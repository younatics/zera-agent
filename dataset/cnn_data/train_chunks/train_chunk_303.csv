"Washington (CNN) -- The man in line to be the next speaker of the House lost his primary Tuesday in Virginia. The outcome of the race shocked Eric Cantor, challenger Dave Brat and political pundits and analysts. The day after Cantor's devastating defeat, those same people are trying to answer the critical questions: Why and how did a well-funded, powerful, conservative member of Congress lose to a political novice? 1. Too much political calculation: Cantor is known for smart political calculations and ambition, but this year those attributes may have cost him his job. One thing that's been lacking throughout Cantor's career is loyalty among his constituents, says Russell Berman, reporter with The Hill. ""He has always been seen as somewhat calculating,"" Berman said, noting Cantor changed his position on immigration in the final weeks of the campaign. CNN political editor Mark Preston agreed, adding that Cantor tried to have it both ways. ""It was only just a couple years ago that Eric Cantor was seen as the voice, so to speak, for the tea party within the leadership. The past couple of years, he seemed to have been moderating his views a little bit,"" Preston said. 2. Too much ambition: CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger noted that as the No. 2 Republican in the House, Cantor was in line to become speaker, a position he wanted. ""(He) was seen as very ambitious, somebody who spent a lot of time fund-raising for the Republican Party,"" Borger said. Cantor 'earthquake' rattles Capitol Hill . Republican strategist Ben Ferguson said Cantor ""forgot that his job was to go to Washington and fight for conservative ideas."" ""He embodied -- from many of their perspectives -- sort of the arrogance of power. That I think has a lot to do with it. And along those lines ... he didn't tend to the district,"" CNN chief congressional correspondent Dana Bash said . 3. Disconnected: Ambition and calculation lead to being disconnected. ""This is Eric Cantor's fault. He was in Washington on Election Day, not back in his district,"" CNN chief national correspondent John King said. ""His confidence, his smugness, his arrogance cost him his seat."" Borger agreed. ""This is a repudiation of Eric Cantor personally, that he failed Politics 101, which is to keep in touch with your district,"" she said. ""And that was an issue,"" Ferguson said. ""When you start having your operatives deal with the little people in your district -- like, oh, you take their phone calls, oh, you e-mail them back, I'm too busy for that, I'm this big dog in the GOP -- the way that Eric Cantor, John Boehner, John McCain have acted, you get your rear end kicked eventually."" 4. Turnout/enthusiasm: Brat's campaign didn't come close to matching Cantor's deep pockets, but Brat made up for the fund-raising shortfall by rallying his staunchest supporters. ""Money can't buy enthusiasm,"" Bash said. CNN political analyst John Avlon said the difference may lie in voter turnout, which stood at just 12% on Tuesday. ""When you get these very low turnout primaries and the people are not paying attention to, they can be easily hijacked by activists. There is no question Eric Cantor would have won a general election in his district,"" Avlon said. 5. The role of the right: Brian Stelter, CNN senior media correspondent, said conservative media corralled the troops to vote for Brat in numbers that Cantor did not match. ""Laura Ingraham, for example, to name one talk radio host, was very supportive of Brat, even held a rally for him in Virginia this time last week. The top of her website today said, 'Vote Dave Brat today.' Other radio hosts also supported him. Ann Coulter supported him. And I think they are going to be getting credit in the days to come. Tonight on Fox News, Megyn Kelly called Ingraham instrumental to this victory,"" Stelter said. 6. ... and the left: Larry Sabato, diirector of the University of Virginia Center for Politics said Democrats, who make up 43% of the district, played a role as well. ""There was a major outreach to Democrats in that district,"" Sabato said. ""You had Brat operatives going to Democratic Party committees, even on election eve, asking them to go to the polls to get rid of Eric Cantor. It had nothing to do with Dave Brat. There were robocalls to Democrats in that district, wanting -- telling Democrats come out to the polls."" 7. He was a casualty of a bigger battle: ""(Cantor had been) taking conservative position after conservative position after conservative position, but almost 100% wasn't enough for these folks. And I think of it as a major message to Republican leadership,"" Avlon said. Borger said that Cantor's loss to a challenge from the right, despite rock-solid conservative credentials, puts the GOP at a crossroad. ""I think they're kind of at the proverbial fork in the road. They can either be a congressional party and win these congressional seats by going further to the right, or they can become a presidential party in which you have to move to the middle."" Cantor was not only an establishment figure, GOP Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska noted, but was deeply involved in negotiating with the White House to end the government shutdown last fall. ""And that was used against him. And so the message to us is, negotiation or compromise could get you beat,"" Terry said.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The next time you pull into a parking garage and the attendant gives you the once-over, he or she may be taking note of more than just the shiny rear spoiler on your new car. As part of a new government initiative, parking lot attendants and other transportation workers are being trained as the next line of defense in the fight against terrorism. The First Observer program was introduced to parking lot professionals at a Las Vegas, Nevada, convention in May, days after a vendor in New York's Times Square spotted a suspicious vehicle and helped thwart what could have been a deadly terrorist attack. Full coverage of Times Square plot . The Times Square incident highlighted the need for ordinary citizens to be trained to become extra eyes and ears of law enforcement, according to officials involved in the program. ""No matter how banal it seems, if something seems different to you or suspicious, we want you to report it,"" said Jeff Beatty, a former CIA and FBI agent. Beatty led the First Observer program's pilot training session Monday in Atlanta, Georgia. He and a team of Transportation Security Administration officials trained some 60 parking lot officials and representatives on how to spot suspicious vehicles carrying hazardous materials or other activity that may signal the planning phases of a terrorist attack. ""In New York City, a T-shirt vendor saw an abandoned vehicle that looked suspicious. He called the police, and they moved in quickly,"" Beatty said. ""Even in the eleventh hour we have an opportunity to make a difference."" The training is part of a $15.5 million program funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and administered by the Transportation Security Administration. Under the program, transportation workers -- including parking lot employees and truck and school bus drivers -- are trained to be on the lookout for people taking photos or sketches of supportive beams in parking garages, people loading vehicles with numerous propane fuel tanks, and foul odors such as diesel fuel coming from a nondiesel-burning van -- which could signal an ammonium nitrate bomb. ""We are not trying to turn you into Jack Bauer,"" Beatty said at the Atlanta training session, referring to Kiefer Sutherland's role as a counterterrorism agent in the TV series ""24."" ""We like who you are as parking lot professionals. We want you to 'observe, assess and report.' "" Organizers plan to provide similar training sessions nationwide over a three-year period. For parking lot employees who cannot attend the seminars, First Observer encourages individuals to go to its website where they can take an online training course. If citizens would have reported red flags such as Timothy McVeigh's improperly parked getaway car ahead of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people, the attack may have never occurred, Beatty said. Witnesses who see red flags and don't report them may live with guilt, he said. ""Shame on us if we don't prevent this from happening again,"" Beatty said. Vehicles packed with explosives can easily elude authorities, he said.  That's why people such as parking lot attendants, who are more familiar with everyday activities, can be a great asset to counterterrorism operations. Still in its infancy, the First Observer program has resulted in around 80 calls that have provided valuable information to law enforcement, Beatty said. Organizers said the program should not replace the 911 emergency system but enhance it. ""It's not illegal for someone to take pictures of an underside of a bridge or of a chlorine tanker,"" Beatty said. ""Is it suspicious? Yes.""","New federal program trains parking lot attendants to spot suspicious activity .

"(CNN) -- Maria Kang likes a good workout. And she is getting one after a bunch of angry women turned her into a punching bag. The 32-year-old Californian fitness enthusiast is under attack for posing for a cheeky photo and posting it on Facebook. The picture shows Kang -- who works out for 30 to 60 minutes per day, six days a week -- dressed in a workout bra and shorts that reveal an extremely toned body. She's surrounded by her three young sons -- now 1, 3 and 4. Plastered overhead is a simple but loaded question: ""What's your excuse?"" The photo went viral. It has more than 16 million views on Facebook and more than 12,000 comments. Most of the reaction has been positive; Kang estimates that the negative comments are outnumbered by the positive ones by a ratio of 7-to-1. The photo is provocative. And it was meant to be. But a lot of women out there were absolutely furious with Kang. ""You, as a woman, should be ashamed that you are furthering the downward spiral of how society views women, and how we women view ourselves,"" scolded one blogger. Some call her obnoxious, a showoff, a bully shaming other women and worse. What's worse? How about getting accused of being a ""bad mother""? That's right. Some women had the nerve to insist that no one gets into this kind of shape without neglecting their children. Oh, don't go there. The last thing we need is another skirmish in the ""mommy wars"" where women compete to see whose maternal instincts are stronger. ""I did it because I knew it would wake people up,"" Kang told me in an interview while her sons clamored for their mom's attention in the background. ""My intention was to inspire and motivate people to get healthy."" Her point: If a mom with three children can work out, eat healthy and stay fit, what excuse is there for the rest of us? ""It takes a lot of time to raise kids, but you have to also make time to take care of yourself,"" she said. That isn't easy with Kang's schedule. She said she cares for her three boys without a nanny in addition to creating and running a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping people get fit. She wants Americans to lead a healthier lifestyle. Her crusade is personal. She saw her mother -- whom she describes as a 52-year-old saddled with the body of a 70-year-old -- battle diabetes in her 20s, a stroke in her 30s, and a heart attack and kidney transplant in her 40s. Her mom's health problems got Maria's attention, and the daughter -- who admits to being a chocolate lover and ""sugarholic"" -- aims to set a different example for her children. Kang said she saw a column I'd written for CNN.com recently about so-called ""fat letters"" -- missives that schools send home to parents informing them their children are overweight. I thought the letters were a bad idea. Kang disagrees. ""Parents play such an important role in teaching their kids to be active, to eat good food and stay fit,"" she said. ""Not to diet. But to be healthy."" The ""fat letters"" got my attention for several reasons. As the father of two young girls, I worry that someday other girls -- what Hollywood has dubbed ""Mean Girls"" -- will lash out at them for their physical appearance. As someone who is attacked by the left and the right, I worry that Americans have forgotten how to talk to one another without treating every annoyance or disagreement like a seek-and-destroy mission. And as someone who is in a profession that is supposed to be about defending the little guy, I worry that bullying has become the new normal and that everyone is so eager to play the victim that they miss the irony when they start victimizing others. All these worries come together in the exasperating and yet empowering story of Maria Kang. It appears that the young mother was coming from a good place and that she wasn't out to pick on anyone. Kang believes she is being a good mother, and she's not backing down. I asked her what this experience has taught her. For one thing, she said, she had no idea that mothers could be so competitive about mothering. She recalls the woman who wrote her an angry letter trying to one-up her, asking if she had ever started a business, gotten a Ph.D. or learned another language. ""There are a lot of people who don't take responsibility, who make excuses, who like to blame others,"" she said. She's right about that. But enough about Washington. After the government shutdown, a lot of Americans are talking about how Congress is broken. True enough. But do you know what could really stand some repair? How Americans talk to each other, especially when they disagree. Our public dialogue has gotten personal and ugly. Maybe it's the anonymity afforded by Twitter and other sites, where people can rip into one another in hurtful ways without revealing their identities. Or maybe it's just more evidence of what has been, over the last few decades, a gradual coarsening of the culture. Whatever caused it, this much we know: Many Americans have forgotten their grandma's admonition that if they can't say anything nice about someone, they shouldn't say anything at all. In the case of Kang, her critics should have said nothing at all. Join Us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"Washington (CNN) -- Well, that turned ugly fast. A move that the White House hoped might herald a happy welcome home for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a soldier held captive for five years by the Taliban in Afghanistan, quickly turned into a nasty and largely partisan fight when he was exchanged for five militants being held in Guantanamo Bay. A political tsunami ensued with allegations from both sides of the aisle of politicizing national security, questions about whether Bergdahl is a deserter and criticism of his family. ""I'm never surprised by controversies that are whipped up in Washington. That's par for the course,"" President Barack Obama said Thursday during a news conference at a meeting of G7 leaders in Brussels. Surprising? Perhaps not. But the force of the vitriol, backlash and backpedaling is an example of how sensitive issues can quickly turn volatile in a hyper-partisan Washington climate, political analysts said. ""When, all of a sudden, you've got Republican congressman who previously were calling for this, criticizing the administration for leaving this man in captivity for five years, or praising his release, and then deleting those Tweets? That really belies the politics. That exposes the naked, ugly politics behind this controversy,"" said John Avalon, a CNN political analyst. Politics, raw and unpleasant, is what defines Washington now, political analysts said. ""It's to be expected because it's a potent mix of partisan environment where the rhetoric is very heated,"" said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. ""Combine that with a very controversial decision. Put those things together and you expect this kind of thing to happen."" However, it's important to wade through the rhetoric and get to the issues at the core, said David Rothkopf, editor of Foreign Policy magazine. Behind the ""the arm-waving and typical Capitol Hill vs. White House gamesmanship,"" there are pertinent questions about why the administration didn't tell Congress about the prisoner swap plan, if such a trade was a good one and whether the White House should have struck a more solemn tone about Bergdahl's release when there were questions about desertion, Rothkopf said. ""The Bergdahl situation has produced exactly the same kind of whirlwind of invective and overheated, highly politicized commentary that just about everything else does in Washington,"" Rothkopf said. ""The trick in this case, as in all others, is to somehow discount all that and get to the underlying truth. Real issues regularly get obscured by all the invective and defensive spin."" And everyone involved is in heavy ""defensive"" spin mode. Who was swapped for Bergdahl? I was for it before I was against it . Former Vietnam prisoner of war and 2008 GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain, criticized the trade of Bergdahl for the Taliban commanders quickly. ""This decision to bring Sergeant Bergdahl home, and we applaud that he's home -- it's ill-founded, it's a mistake and it's putting lives of American servicemen and women at risk,"" the Arizona Republican told reporters. However, in February, McCain seemed in an interview with CNN to back a swap. ""Obviously, I'd have to know the details, but I would support ways of bringing him home and if (an) exchange was one of them, I think that would be something I think we should seriously consider,"" he said at the time. McCain has said his message has been consistent. Then there are lawmakers who deleted their initial ""welcome home"" Tweets to Bergdahl as the controversy over his release spiraled into ugliness. Democrats, including the President, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, said Bergdahl is being used as a political football. ""If Barack Obama cured cancer, Republicans would attack him for putting oncologists out of work,"" Democratic strategist Paul Begala told CNN. But even some Democrats, such as Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein, criticized the administration's end run around Congress in securing Bergdahl's release but defended the decision. Confusing messages from the White House . The White House story on when and how top leaders on Capitol Hill were informed about the release has added to the confusion, political analysts said. The initial Rose Garden announcement was quickly followed by apologies to such top Democrats as Feinstein for being kept out of the loop. Then came more explanation about the critical timing of Bergdahl's release, which the administration has said was tied to his declining health and the pending withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Afghanistan. Hillary Clinton wanted tougher deal for Bergdahl . Meanwhile, the criticism outside of Washington has grown louder and less polite. A group of soldiers from Bergdahl's unit in Afghanistan accused him of desertion. Their claims -- not confirmed by the Pentagon, which is investigating -- responded to how Bergdahl was lauded by the White House as a hero when there were questions about his disappearance. Those soldiers said several troops were killed in efforts to find him, another claim the military has not confirmed. Republican strategist, Richard Grenell, who BuzzFeed reported helped get the soldiers' side of the story out to such media outlets as the New York Times, worked on former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. Grenell declined to comment on his efforts to CNN. In the meantime, the rancor has even begun to impact Bergdahl's family and community. Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly said Bergdahl's father, who wears a long beard, ""looks like a Muslim,"" and their hometown of Hailey, Idaho, called off a welcome home rally after fears of backlash over the controversial nature of the soldier's release. ""Emotions are running very high on this case,"" said CNN senior political analyst David Gergen. ""Among the military personnel and veterans, my sense is it has less to do with the trade for the five militants than the celebratory qualities that the administration initially displayed toward Bergdahl. The message they got was this was a hero coming home. And that totally misreads the military mentality on this issue."" Celebrated at first, Bergdahl's release raises questions .

CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta contributed to this report.","Rhetoric over Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's release has turned rancorous .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- At the up-market ""Urembo"" hair and beauty salon, in uptown Nairobi, entrepreneur Maureen Murunga has her sights set on expanding her business. The growth is important to Murunga, who bought the business a year ago, without the help of big banks. ""A local small bank gave me my first break,"" she says. ""But it wasn't without a lot of tears, tantrums, kickings and insisting that they would have to support me,"" she adds. Murunga, who has a background in banking, says it is difficult for women to get credit from banks to start businesses. ""The bank will limit the financing to the security available,"" says Murunga. ""For the women in this region, that is the challenge, because that will involve things like land, which traditionally families will give that to men. ""So for women, creativity is a big part."" That need for creative financing led Murunga to start an investment group, or ""chama"" as they are popularly known in Kiswahili. Unlike the traditional revolving fund groups that merely saved money, theirs is an active investment group. Registered as Unathi Investment Limited, the 21-women in the group, mostly in their late 30s, are drawn from all sectors, ranging from finance to information technology to legal. Their common goal is to build a solid retirement nest egg. Each member's monthly minimum contribution is about $200 but the more they contribute the more shares they get. Murunga says when it comes to new members they look for someone who is interested in their long-term strategic vision and thus willing to pump in money for 10 years without getting any out. Collectively, they have been able to purchase prime real estate, trade shares in the stock market and invest in unlisted, growing companies. ""The chama has been very exciting in that it's been much easier for us to quickly invest in big deals which would not have been possible if I tried to do (it) myself,"" says Murunga. Another member is Nancy Kanyango, the current chair and a legal expert working with the government. She says shared responsibility is important. ""We hold each other accountable in terms of our resources, ensuring that we have something aside for our retirement,"" she says. But even with their group's achievements in just three years, Kanyango is quick to point out that it's not all been smooth sailing. ""All our personalities are different -- some people are fast at making decisions or have a greater risk appetite than others,"" she says, and the members must balance their commitments to the chama with busy nine-to-five jobs. Banking analysts say three out of every five Kenyans is part of a chama and  banks have been moving to profit from this niche market. Some banks have even created products that specifically target chama groups, with favorable interest rates and sizeable loan potential. Joseph Okumu, a product manager with Bank of Africa, says: ""We're an SME (small and medium enterprise) bank. We thought if we sit to get an SME that has grown 10 years we probably might miss out on the market, so we thought, let's get these groups, empower them and grow them so that they become an SME from an early age."" Though the group is run with a steady hand, the members still take time out to socialize, going back to the spirit of what brought them together: friendship. ""It's about the money but also more than that,"" says Kanyango. ""We know each other; we know each other's family and what goes on in each of our lives,"" she adds. Now men are also forming their own groups or joining mixed-groups. But the women of the Unathi group say they're a long way from allowing the men in. ""We made a deliberate decision that it would be a woman's group"", says Kanyango, ""just the dynamics of not mixing with men on that space."" ""It's our space,"" she adds with a laugh.","Kenyan women forming their own investment groups, known as ""chamas""

"(CNN) -- A cancerous tumor in 13-year-old Danny Hauser's chest has shrunk significantly since he was ordered by a court last month to resume chemotherapy treatment, a family spokesman said. Danny Hauser, 13, was headed for a clinic in Mexico until an arrest warrant was issued for his mom. But the Hauser family attributes much of his progress to the complementary use of vitamins and minerals to boost his immune system, Dan Zwakman said. ""The family is doing it on their own, with the doctor's knowledge,"" Zwakman said. ""Everybody is pleased that the tumor is shrinking, of course. The goal is to get rid of the cancer, but they'd rather be doing it without the chemo."" Danny's case made national headlines last month when he and his mother, Colleen, fled Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, for Mexico to seek alternative cancer care despite a court order that he undergo chemotherapy. They eventually returned after an arrest warrant was issued for Colleen Hauser. But had they made it to their destination -- the Rubio Clinic in Tijuana, according to Zwakman -- they would have joined the ranks of an estimated hundreds of other cancer patients who head south of the border each year for cancer care. ""Their intentions started long ago with Colleen. She's been involved in natural healing for many years now. She believes the world was created with everything needed to sustain and heal life,"" Zwakman said. Despite controversial origins and consistent bad press in the United States, Tijuana's border clinics continue to attract people like the Hausers, who are in search of more holistic approaches to cancer treatment. Because little data exist on how many clinics are operating, it's unclear how many American cancer patients visit Mexico each year, said Stephen Barrett, a patient advocate who runs the Web site, http://www.quackwatch.com/. ""If they answered, you could not be sure they were telling the truth. They might have an incentive to raise the number,"" he said in an e-mail. ""To make matters more complicated, many of the 'cancer' clinics also see people who don't have cancer."" The concept of complementary and alternative cancer treatment has slowly been gaining acceptance for more than a decade in the United States, with the creation of entities including the National Cancer Institute's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine. ""Clinicians and researchers have realized that it's important to conduct methodologically sound studies to help guide patients to understand what's safe and what's effective,"" said Dr. Ted Gansler, medical director of health content for the American Cancer Society. But no one recommends that alternative treatment be used to replace conventional care, such as chemotherapy or radiation, he said. ""The important thing to remember is there is no recommended alternative to conventional treatment, and the reason is because if it worked, it would become conventional,"" he said. As far as Tijuana's border clinics are concerned, the American Cancer Society cautions that ""methods promoted in Mexican border clinics are not consistent with scientific understanding"" of cancer and its treatment. ""Although these clinics often claim great success in advertisements and books, they have not published convincing evidence in medical journals to support those claims,"" the ACS says in a section on its Web site called Questionable Cancer Practices In Mexico. ""Patients traveling to the Tijuana area for treatment appear to be subjecting themselves to costly and potentially hazardous regimens, especially if they postpone standard medical care."" Loose regulatory standards in Mexico allow Tijuana's clinics to thrive, many offering expensive treatment in luxurious, spa-like settings, complete with fresh meals, exercise classes and emotional and spiritual counseling. Many herbs and dietary supplements used in border clinics are not considered dangerous; they just have not been put through the rigorous clinical trials required for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve them for use as cancer treatments. Others, like the antioxidants carotene, lycopene and vitamins C, E and A, have produced inconsistent results in large-scale trials and are still being researched. Still others, like laetrile, a chemical compound whose active ingredient is cyanide, can be dangerous, the National Cancer Institute says. But many patients say they are attracted by the warm, caring relationship between patient and clinic staff. ""They don't just see the disease. They see the person behind the disease and know how to care for them in every way,"" says Sarah Sackett-Hutcheson, who claims she has been cancer-free for 17 years. When she was 11 years old, her oncologist told her family she had six months to live and recommended chemotherapy and radiation to battle her non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Instead of undergoing the debilitating treatments, she went to the Oasis of Hope Hospital in Tijuana, where she received low doses of chemotherapy along with intravenous vitamins. The American Cancer Society says there is no scientific evidence that low doses of chemotherapy or large doses of supplements are effective against cancer. But Sackett-Hutcheson believes the small doses of chemo attacked cancerous cells without destroying her immune system while the vitamins boosted her immunity. ""I remember thinking if they'd given me the high doses of chemo I wouldn't have made it. Even the low doses made me so incredibly sick. I'd be getting up like every 15 minutes, puking in the middle of the night,"" Sackett-Hutcheson said. Like Danny Hauser, Sackett-Hutcheson was entangled in a court battle over her family's decision. However, a judge allowed her to continue treatment in Mexico, while last month a judge ordered Hauser to undergo chemotherapy. Sackett-Hutcheson's case was ultimately dismissed after doctors from the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston declined to evaluate her progress on the grounds that they felt she was receiving ""inadequate treatment,"" according to court documents. Four months after her diagnosis in 1991, she says, she was cancer-free, and has remained so. Dr. Francisco Contreras, Oasis of Hope's head physician and the son of its founder, says Mexico's ""open-mindedness"" toward alternative therapies is related to the socioeconomic standing of most of its citizens. ""Mexican authorities are much more open to natural therapies because most Mexicans live under the line of poverty so they would not have access to conventional medicine,"" he said. ""I don't know if that's for benefit of our patients or not, but we have this open-mindedness because we have to do something to help our people."" Like many border clinics, Contreras says his center takes an integrative approach, combining conventional treatment, such as chemotherapy and radiation, with alternative methods to create individualized regimens that focus on healing the entire body with fewer debilitating, long-term side effects. Not everyone leaves Tijuana's clinics happy. Several articles on www.quackwatch.com and its sister sites contain negative testimonials from people who say they sought alternative treatment, mostly laetrile, for parents or a loved one only to have them die of cyanide poisoning a few weeks later. Such cautionary tales didn't stop Jennifer Woods from following the example of her grandfather by going to Tijuana to receive the Alivizatos treatment, an intravenous serum that its makers say consists of vitamins, minerals and amino acids. During her first monthlong visit, Woods paid about $15,000 for surgery to remove her tumors, 20 days of worth of the dosage and two meals a day, plus lodging expenses across the border in San Diego, California. But Woods says it was worth every penny. ""I feel well. I've never had any ill side effects, and I have learned so much about nutrition and how to maintain my health,"" she said in a telephone interview from her home in Denver, Colorado. Woods says she has not seen a doctor in the United States since. She says she returns to IBC about every six months for six days at a time to receive ""booster treatments"" for about $1,200 a visit. ""It's a very well-rounded program. You don't just go there and let somebody give you something and then walk out and forget about it. You take responsibility from that day forward to do the right thing to keep your health in order.""","Tumors have shrunk in teen who was ordered to resume chemotherapy .

The previous night automated calls from the Israeli military and leaflets dropped by the Israeli Air Force on these neighborhoods located in the east warned of impending bombings to begin at 9 a.m. the following day. The war between Israel and Gaza militants is entering its 10th day. Their donkey strains against the weight of the load as they move to their final destination, a United Nations-run school that has been turned into temporary shelter and, more importantly, safety. Growing toll of kids killed in Gaza . For many Gazans, the search for safety means packing whatever they can into cars, buses and trucks to flee the impending bombings. Almost like clockwork plumes of black smokes billow above Shujayya. The neighborhood's main market is closed. Almost all the stores have their metal shutters down and padlocks clasped tight. Typically those shops would be bustling as families prepare to break the fast during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Scrambling in the shadow of the explosions, mothers and fathers are looking for alternative places to buy last-minute items for their children. Fifty-five-year-old Um Mohamed walks quickly down the sidewalk carrying bags of fruits and vegetables. The sweat on her brow mixes with the tears in her eyes. ""What can I do?"" she asks. ""We ran out of food so I had to leave my daughter-in-law to take care of the kids."" Trapped in war: 'This is tyranny' Um Ali left her two girls at home, crying, to buy food and medicine. She refused to evacuate. ""The Israelis told us to leave our home by leaflets and phone calls but I have nowhere to go ... we will not leave, it is our destiny,"" she says. Then there is Atef Al Somery who cracks a smile of relief. He just finished evacuating 20 members of his family from their home. ""We are fed up with this frightening situation but at the same time we need them to open the border so we can work and feed our families,"" the 57-year-old says. Many people we talk to despise the war but their anger is eclipsed only by Gaza's current state of affairs. For that, they blame Israel . Gaza has been called the world's largest open-air prison. It's been like that since Hamas took control of it back in 2007. The only real exit for Gazans is the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, which is rarely open. Importing items from Israel is heavily restricted, so is access to the sea. Racing toward danger: War-scarred Gaza medical crews also in harm's way . At the U.N.-run school are scores of refugees who've fled their neighborhoods. There is a sense of security within the blue and white walls of the compound. Here we find a crowd surrounding a lady crying hysterically. Between the tears, Umm Ahmed tells us how she returned to her house just as the sun illuminated the concrete structure demolished. Two plastic bags carry all the possessions she could salvage. She screams, thanking God she left the previous day. But despair sets in for the mother of three. ""Where will I go?"" she asks. ""I have nothing left. No food, nothing."" Later at the same school, Bidwan is in his new accommodations, a fourth-floor classroom. His ride is left with the other donkeys and horses tied up at the main gate. He is settling in with his new neighbors. His children are still smiling, this time because they have new playmates.

"(CNN) -- Kenya's national football team may not have made it to the World Cup Finals in Brazil -- but one man will be there for his African nation. Stepping into the role of representing Kenya is Aden Marwa, the country's first linesman to officiate at the beautiful game's biggest event. ""Football is my life, football has made my life change a big deal,"" Marwa tells CNN. Like many a young boy, Marwa became obsessed with football, often walking vast distances so he could get to a TV to watch a match. Yet despite his passion for the game, he wanted nothing to do with refereeing and for good reason. ""Those times it was hard because a match would hardly finish without a referee being beaten,"" he explains. ""The fans were rowdy and you know, the facilities were not very good."" ""You were playing in open fields so the referee could be attacked anytime so when I could see that as a young boy, I didn't love it. So I was scared."" However, by the time Marwa became a linesman in 1998 at the age of 21, the game had changed dramatically as more resources and education had been funneled into the sport. ""Once you decide you want to become a football referee there are three pillars. One is your medical fitness, two is your physical fitness and then three, the technical fitness, so these can not be compromised."" By 2006, the ambitious referee got his big break refereeing a game in the Kenyan Premier League before making his international debut as an assistant referee for FIFA just two years later. Today he holds the accolade of ""best assistant referee"" in the Kenyan Premier League and his talent has taken him to sun-kissed shores of South America for the 2014 World Cup, where he has been performing as a reserve assistant referee. The 37-year-old knows this will be the biggest test of his career so far and is prepared to have the eyes of millions of football fans scrutinizing his every decision. ""Referees have to make decisions in the shortest time possible. I see it once but you, on TV, will see it and see a replay and you can even pause with technology and even review,"" he says. ""As a referee I only have one angle to look at that ... so the challenge that we have as referees, the biggest one, is how to place yourself at the right position and the right moment to make that very important, crucial decision."" Check out the video below to find out how Marwa prepared for his greatest moment to date and earned his dream job officiating at this year's World Cup.","Aden Marwa is Kenya's first linesman to officiate at a World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Alleged Boston crime boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger may have authored two memoirs, one of which was titled ""My Life in the Irish Mafia,"" according to court documents. It is not clear whether the notorious fugitive, who evaded authorities for 16 years, actually wrote the memoir, but prosecutors say it is part of their investigation. The manuscript was seized at a South Boston home on January 5, 1995, the same day a warrant was issued for Bulger's arrest on racketeering charges. The alleged gangster also apparently penned a separate autobiography that was found by authorities at Bulger's Santa Monica, California, apartment after his arrest there, courts documents say. Bulger, 82, has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him, including 19 murder counts. Once one of the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives, he is currently being held without bail and faces an impending racketeering indictment after authorities tracked him down in June 2011 at his California home. Bulger was arrested after being lured out of his apartment with an FBI ruse: He apparently received a phone call and was told his lock box, located in the basement parking lot of his building, had been broken into. When Bulger went down to check, FBI agents arrested him.

"(CNN) -- Four family members' bodies were found after an intentionally set fire damaged a Florida home belonging to former tennis player James Blake, who was leasing it out, authorities said Wednesday. ""We have also confirmed that the fire was started intentionally by an unknown accelerant,"" Hillsborough County Sheriff Col. Donna Lusczynski told reporters. Two bodies had upper body trauma, Lusczynski said. The four apparent family members -- two adults and two teenagers -- were found in their respective bedrooms after the early morning fire, Lusczynski said. Identifying the bodies will take several days, she said. The adults were in one bedroom, and each teen was in a separate bedroom, Lusczynski said. Authorities found small commercial-type fireworks in the Tampa home, officials said. Blake was not at the home at the time of the fire, Lusczynski said. He was leasing the property and was contacted by phone after the incident by sheriff's officials. Blake, 34, was once ranked No. 4 in tennis among world singles and played in the 2006 Tennis Masters Cup, according to his Facebook page. At 5:45 a.m. Wednesday, authorities received a 911 call about an explosion and then a fire at the home. Firefighters began extinguishing the fire and then discovered two bodies inside the 6,000-square-foot house, authorities said. Crews found a third body and then a fourth, the sheriff's office said. ""Due to the magnitude of the structural damage caused by the fire, this investigation will be a slow, meticulous process,"" the sheriff's office said.

"(CNN) -- Yes, climate change is happening. But it's hard to say that the tornado that ripped through Moore, Oklahoma -- or any given tornado, for that matter -- was influenced by climate change. Scientific research has not made a clear connection between tornadoes and climate change, said J. Marshall Shepherd, climate change expert and professor at the University of Georgia. There is currently a much better understanding of how climate change increases the risks of droughts, heat waves and precipitation, he said. There are also indications that changing patterns may influence the intensity of hurricanes. But as far as tornadoes: There's just not a lot of information. As far as the Moore tornado, ""This tornadic storm, in my view, probably would have happened irrespective of whether there's climate change or not,"" Shepherd said. ""The question is: Are we increasing the risk and probability of more extreme events in general as our climate differs?"" More research and discussion is needed about future warming and the environments that might produce storms, he said. Trends in tornado occurrence over the last 50 years do not appear to have changed in conjunction with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and patterns of rising temperatures, Shepherd said. Beyond the climate change question, meteorologists don't know a lot about why some thunderstorms produce tornadoes and not others. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, only about 1% of thunderstorms generate tornadoes. However, tornado prediction is advancing and evolving. Weather, says Shepherd, is like mood -- it changes all the time. The deeper underlying forces we call ""climate"" are like personality. Greenhouse gases building up in our ocean atmosphere system, from human activity, influence that personality -- which is much harder to undo. To put it a different way, a driver who is sober has a certain risk of getting into an accident, said Patrick Kinney, the study's senior author and director of the Columbia Climate and Health Program at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. The risk goes up with a couple of drinks. Similarly, as humans pump more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, that raises the likelihood of extreme weather events. ""Greenhouse gases are kind of like the alcohol in the system of the climate,"" Kinney said. Climate change will mean more heat deaths . Earlier this month, scientists measured for the first time an average carbon dioxide concentration of 400 parts per million at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, representing a new peak for this iconic monitoring station.

"SINGAPORE (CNN) -- Of all the aircraft on display at the Singapore Airshow, the brand new, fuel-efficient Airbus A350 XWB is dominating attention. Billed as the new generation wide-bodied jetliner and seen as a direct competitor to Boeing's Dreamliner, the A350 has been drawing crowds, taking part in aerial displays and opening its doors to select trade visitors. It's all part of a grand plan by Europe's Airbus to try to woo as many buyers as possible. Inside the 40,000 square meters of airshow exhibition space, the plane's maker, Airbus, has also grabbed the limelight, announcing the first big deal of this biennial aerospace and defense trade show to a packed press conference on Tuesday -- the firm sale of 63 A320 Family single aisle aircraft to low cost Vietnamese carrier VietJetAir. Delivery is scheduled to start later this year. VietJetAir will also lease a further seven A320 aircraft and has purchase options for another 30. The $6.4 billion deal is a significant expansion for the privately-owned low-cost airline, which was only founded in 2011. ""The A320 has proven to be extremely efficient in service with VietJetAir and is a favorite with our passengers,"" said VietJetAir's Managing Director Luu Duc Khanh at a signing ceremony held this afternoon. The center of world demand . VietJetAir is typical of the market here. It's a low cost carrier, numbers of which are growing rapidly across Asia Pacific, fueling demand for single aisle planes. Airbus predicts in the next 20 years the Asia-Pacific region will need almost 7,000 deliveries of single aisle aircraft, representing over a third of the world's total. ""All our products are in the region in significant numbers, and we continue to dominate sales in this region because we have the aircraft Asia-Pacific airlines need,"" says Airbus Chief Operating Officer Customers, John Leahy. Arch rival Boeing is more circumspect about the prospect of being able to announce any big deals out of this airshow. But the Vice President of Marketing for Boeing Commercial Planes, Randy Tinseth, says the exhibition is just as much about bonding with customers. ""The Asia-Pacific market in terms of demand is about 35% of the world demand so it's incredibly important and we're delivering more airplanes than anyone else in the market here, so we do have strength, there's no question,"" Tinseth says. The world's two largest airplane manufacturers have spent many long hours poring over predictions for growth in Asia-Pacific and both have come up with mind boggling forecasts. ""The economy grows, incomes going up, and incomes going up means more people travel. And it's really pretty staggering. If you think about the Asia-Pacific region, if you look out the next five to ten years, each year 100 million people will travel in terms of growth,"" Tinseth says. Airbus is predicting the region's airlines will take delivery of some 10,940 new passenger and cargo aircraft between now and 2032. The figure from Boeing differs slightly, with estimates 12,820 new aircraft will be needed in Asia-Pacific within the next two decades, a market Tinseth values at $1.9 trillion dollars. ""This is the world's largest market for single aisle airplanes. It's the largest market for wide body [twin aisle] airplanes, it's the largest market for big airplanes like the 747, and it's the biggest market for freighters so the center of aviation is here, that's why we're here."" Tinseth says 36% of the world's new airplane deliveries over the next 20 years will be in Asia and nearly half the world's air traffic growth will be driven by travel to and from the region. Battleground . As to who currently has the upper hand in Asia-Pacific, Airbus says in 2013 it won 80% of all new business in the region. But it's a more level playing field in terms of actual deliveries, with Airbus delivering 331 aircraft into Asia Pacific last year, representing 51% of all new carriers entering service here. Aviation analyst and vice president of ICF International David Stewart has been watching the competition between Airbus and Boeing for 15 years. ""I firmly believe that these things tend to balance themselves out and that one year Airbus will have a good year, and some years Boeing is well ahead. It's all about timing in terms of where they are in their product cycles."" Airbus says it's already received 814 orders for its A350 XWB. Thirty percent of orders have come from Asian airlines including Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines. Airbus claims its current Asia-Pacific order backlog is 1,740. Boeing says its order backlog in the region is around 1,000 planes. On the single aisle side, Boeing's main Asia-based customer is Indonesia's Lion Air. The airplane maker has long dominated the wide body market, with customers including All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines and some Chinese airlines. With Tuesday's announcement, competition just stepped up a notch in this critical market and both Boeing and Airbus are keen to get as much leverage as possible out of this year's Singapore Airshow.

She has previously worked as a foreign correspondent based out of both Beijing and Hong Kong.","Singapore Airshow begins with A350 XWB flyover .

"Washington (CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama is a popular American political figure, even more so than her husband. Her name, face and stories of her influence behind the scenes are a constant in the media, and sometimes in not so flattering words and images. In books, she is portrayed as battling with White House insiders. In magazines, she has been satirized as a militant activist. On TV, she responds to those who see her as an ""angry black woman."" But still, she stays centered, focusing on her issues -- health and young children, military families and raising her family inside the White House bubble. ""The administration is doing everything they can to keep her out in the public eye and remind everyone why they liked this family in the first place,"" said Garrett Graff, editor of The Washingtonian magazine. CNN iReport exclusive: Michelle Obama . But that warm embrace isn't universal, and the first lady made note of it in a recent interview with CBS. ""There will always be people who don't like me,"" Obama told Gayle King on ""CBS This Morning."" Ever since her husband announced his candidacy for the 2008 presidential race, she said some have viewed her as ""some kind of angry black woman."" First ladies are always placed under the microscope and often become the targets of harsh critics. Paul Begala, a former adviser in the Clinton administration, said the public is an equal opportunity offender. ""Some liberals attacked Nancy Reagan unfairly. A whole lot of conservatives attacked Hillary Clinton when I was working for her husband in the White House,"" said Begala, who is also a CNN contributor. For Michelle Obama the first punch came shortly after then-Sen. Barack Obama decided to run for president. Beaming with pride, she told an audience that ""for the first time in my adult lifetime I'm really proud of my country."" That comment drew fire from conservatives who questioned her patriotism. She was forced to clarify her remarks. Then there was the portrayal of her on the cover of The New Yorker. A sketch showed her with a machine gun slung across her back, sporting an Afro and wearing combat boots like 1960s activist Angela Davis. Opinion: Working together for the health of America's children . The first lady has carved out a public role for herself as a strong advocate for military families and promoter of a healthy lifestyle, especially for children. At events or in TV appearances, she is only too willing to tout her fitness by joining in jumping jacks or getting down on the ground for push-ups. On ""The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,"" she playfully pressured the late-night entertainer to eat his veggies. She challenged talk-show host Jimmy Fallon to a tug-of-war contest in the White House. Beyond promoting her initiatives, the first lady also has used the spotlight to pull the curtain back on her softer side. Whether it's talking about her role as a mom or trying her hand at acting, such as a recent cameo appearance on the hit Nickelodeon comedy ""iCarly,"" Obama tries to bring humor and personality inside the Washington bubble. The Washingtonian's Graff said the first lady plays a unique role in American society. ""We don't expect them to have the gravitas of the president, and so you can have a little more fun, be in photo opportunities and do things the president can't do because of his office,"" he said. As the president campaigns for a second term, the first lady is also able to do something else. Her trips often take her to key battleground states, where her message re-enforces the president's policies and her presence at fundraisers raises campaign cash. ""I know that if we come together and we do this work, we will elect the president that this country deserves,"" she recently told Obama supporters. At another event, she pumped up the audience with a call and answer riff: ""Do you have his back? Are you fired up? Are you ready to go?"" Said Begala, who considers himself an Obama supporter: ""I think the first lady is not only the president's greatest asset in his political campaign; she's his greatest asset in his life. Political hacks like me would like to use her all the time."" But Begala warned she shouldn't be overused or become ""too political"" because that could ""diminish her value."" In her supporting role, she is trying to strike a balance as wife, mother and first lady while challenging a lingering negative image that she insists is off the mark. ""I just hope that over time, that people get to know me,"" she told CBS.","Michelle Obama is viewed as an asset to her husband's re-election campaign .
She's advocate for military families and promoter of healthy lifestyle, especially for kids .
Still, negative images in the media have dogged the first lady .

"(CNN) -- Down on Earth, we all know: Do anything stupid these days, and video of it will turn up on the Internet to embarrass you. Now, space aliens may be about learn that lesson, too. NASA deployed live webcams on the International Space Station in March, and UFO enthusiasts monitoring their live feeds online have nabbed unidentified flying objects scooting through Earth's orbit. They've made screen grabs of the NASA video and posted them online. UFOlogist Scott Waring may have been the first, when he plastered them onto his blog, UFO Sightings Daily, early last week. Highlighted by a red circle and clearly visible is -- a speck. A white one. An enlargement of the screen grab reveals -- a blur. A note explains the alleged vehicle's shape: ""It has a long line down its middle and a dome on its top, but is rectangle on it lower bottom."" If you still don't recognize it, don't worry, it's not called ""unidentified"" for nothing. And it's hard to know for sure what it is, with all the meteors, satellites and space junk swarming around Earth. A few days later, a similar post turned up of another white speck spied by a space station lens as it pulsates and fades away. Look down . Sleuthing for extraterrestrials was not NASA's intention when it attached the four high-definition cameras to the space station. They offer live views of Earth's terrestrial greens and browns, atmospheric and oceanic blues, and cloudy swaths of white as the space station races around the planet once every 90 minutes. And they are a high school science project. Students designed some of the hardware components in the overall system in a project with NASA called HUNCH, or High Schools United with NASA to Create Hardware. Its aim is to figure out how conditions in space, like high radiation, affect video quality to help decide what kind of cameras to use on future missions. NASA is separately experimenting with using a laser beam to transfer data to Earth. Researchers hope it will speed up data transfer by 10 to 100 times. The idea is to zap massive amounts of data to scientists, but it could also make for very high-quality video streams. Aliens on the Internet? The cameras for the Earth viewing are consumer grade, off the shelf. But they are apparently good enough to snag alien vessels, which may not have journeyed too terribly far to visit Earth's orbit, according to UFO Sightings Daily. Trawling NASA images for proof of intergalactic visitors to our solar system has gone on since NASA started snapping the images decades ago. And the website has page after page of alleged photographic signs of advanced alien life on Mars that it claims happened to turn up in pictures shot by NASA Mars rovers. They are replete with fossil remains on the red planet and alien bases constructed there, on asteroids, and even on our moon. Though the rovers have found that, at one time, Mars could have supported basic life, NASA has reported nothing on this order. At least one alleged alien ""mother ship"" made it into a NASA lunar photo, and you don't even have to squint to see it. Though it may seem these advanced beings have accomplished much right in our neighborhood, they haven't learned not to fly within eyeshot of a space station the size of a football field (including the end zones). Or they may just like watching themselves live on the Internet.","NASA recently deployed live webcams on the International Space Station .

[Story previously published 6:39 a.m.] . OK, so the U.S. lost to Germany, but still squeezed through to the next round. No shame in that. But nothing to be too proud of either. But the game today? This is do or die. This is one and done. This is all or nothing. This is whatever cliche you can think of to rabble rouse your team spirit. If the U.S.-Germany match was a battle of David and Goliath, this afternoon's encounter is David and the Dark Horse. And Belgium ain't no one trick pony. The game's at 4 p.m. ET -- enough time for you to skim through this cheat sheet and become an insta-pundit. Why you should care . It's about time soccer caught on in the U.S. And in order for that to happen, Americans need a team they can really rally behind. If the boys can beat Belgium, it's off to the quarter finals of the World Cup. The last time the men's team did that was in 2002. (They lost to Germany.) The expectations are enormous. When was the last time you saw the country unite behind one cause, gather in front of massive TV screens, and collectively bellow, ""I believe that we will win""? At home, 25 million people watched the USA nearly slay Portugal last week. Twenty five million! That's more than what the NBA finals or the baseball World Series averaged. In Brazil, Americans are second only to the host nation in the number of tickets bought. Online, Twitter and Facebook are blowing up. Soccer, you see, is starting to stir the soul of America. ""The country is paying attention in a way that it's never done before, and we have a chance to make some history,"" said Sunil Gulati, the U.S. Soccer Federation president. It'd be a shame if the plucky Yanks lost to Belgium, killing the momentum. How America won the 2014 World Cup . How it has played out before . When the U.S. last played Belgium at the World Cup, it beat them 3-0. But that was 84 years ago -- in 1930! More recently, the teams played two ""friendlies"" (matches that aren't part of a tournament). The U.S. lost both. Why you should worry . You don't hear Belgium mentioned in the same breath as soccer powerhouses like Brazil, Argentina or Germany. That's because it isn't. It plays a boring brand of soccer. Cautious. Tentative. Patient. ''I am here to be a realist,"" their coach, Marc Wilmots, says. ""I am not here to please the fans in the stands."" But Belgium wins games. It qualified for the World Cup, winning eight out of 10 games. (It drew the other two.) At the tournament, it's won all three of its games, conceding only one goal. Another reason: The Red Devils are young and hungry. Eleven of their players are in the prestigious English Premier League. Four of the Americans play there. Also, Belgium has way too many strong goal-scorers. Glossary for the budding American World Cup fan . Why you shouldn't worry . Un: The Belgians are banged up. Captain Vincent Kompany can't seem to shake a nagging groin injury. So he's iffy for the game. Kompany is one of Belgium's key defenders. A second starting defender has a hamstring strain. Without those two, the goal scoring potential increases for the U.S. And they're not the only ones battling injury. There's one guy with a broken leg, another with a groin strain, another with muscle tightness. Deux: Jozy Altidore will be back for the U.S. Since he was sidelined with a hamstring injury in the U.S opener against Ghana, Clint Dempsey has had to go it alone as the main goal scorer. Altidore returns to the potent partnership. Trois: There's something to be said for experience. And the U.S. has four players who are World Cup veterans (Howard, Dempsey, DaMarcus Beasley and Michael Bradley.) They know how to deal with the pressures of competing on soccer's biggest stage. The Belgians? The last time they were at a World Cup was 14 years ago. ""We have absolutely no fear at all,"" U.S. Coach Jurgen Klinsmann said. ""We believe we have built a foundation in our team that we are able to beat them, and we're looking forward to it."" What you should ignore . The fact that the referee is Algerian. Ever since FIFA picked Djamei Haimoudi for the match, the comments have poured in: ""We're toast."" Why? Because the USA knocked Algeria out of the 2010 World Cup with a 1-0 victory. Klinsmann's got a second reason: He seems to think that the fact that the ref speaks French gives the Belgians an edge. ""Is it a good feeling? No,"" he said. ""He's able to speak French with their players on the field, not with us. And it's the country that we beat in the last second of the last World Cup."" Will Haimoudi hold a grudge? Hogwash. He's refereed the Netherlands-Australia game and the England-Costa Rica game without complaints from fans or critics about wrong calls. ""It is looking for excuses ahead of the match,"" Belgian coach Wilmots said. What the U.S. should do . Attack, attack, attack! In the last three games, the boys attacked just 72 times, says FIFA. You know where that places the USA among the 32 teams at the World Cup? Dead last! Today, the natural tendency of the team might be to hunker down, ward off the inevitable Belgian onslaught, and make a run for the goal when chances open up. Wrong. This isn't the group round. You lose here, you're out. All of Belgium's goals have come in the last 20 minutes of games, making it hard for the opposing team to equalize. So the U.S. needs to go at it guns blazing. Yes, the Red Devils have won their World Cup games so far, but they never quite dominated. Overwhelm them. What you should say . Here are some fun facts to impress your buddies at your soccer watching party: . Fun fact #1: Before he became Belgium's coach, Marc Wilmots served in the country's senate for two years. Fun fact #2: Belgium's most notable contribution to cinema is Jean-Claude Van Damme. Fun fact #3: Waffle House is calling for a ban on Belgian waffles. That's not even a Belgian invention. Oof! Fun fact #4: Brussels sprouts actually do get their name from the Belgian capital. Fun fact #5: Clint Dempsey has another goal: to make it as rapper Deuce. His 13-track album, ""The Redux,"" comes out after the World Cup. Who will win . The folks at FiveThirtyEight give the U.S. a 42% chance of winning. The Belgian coach pegs his team's chances at 50-50. The U.S. quotes Abraham Lincoln: ""The best way to predict your future is to create it."" Off the field: The men of the USMNT .

"(CNN) -- Turkey's economy, fattened with foreign investment during its boom-times, has stalled amid warnings its model is unsustainable. The country's $800 billion economy remains among the 20 biggest in the world -- but the IMF says it can't last and remains too vulnerable to dangers outside its borders. The OECD has also weighed in with concerns, saying the country's addiction to foreign money risks volatility. How did it get into this mess? Many developed countries struggled with growth after the global financial crisis. But not Turkey, which grew substantially over the last decade -- the country's GDP grew by average 5.5% per year. The government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, now a presidential candidate, was praised for its ability to attract foreign investors from Europe and emerging markets such as Russia and China. The rapid economic growth was largely fueled by cheap credit pouring into the country. As the crisis hit developed economies, investors turned to emerging markets, which promised higher returns than depressed Western markets. For years, Turkey enjoyed a foreign-funded construction boom. House prices have soared more than 50% since the end of 2009 and both the country's GDP and per capita income have increased threefold since 2003. But the party ended with the U.S. Federal Reserve announcing a scale-back in its stimulus program last summer. Suddenly, there was less cash available to invest. With more security in the U.S. economy, investors started pulling their money from the emerging markets. Turkey's growth slowed to just above 2% in 2013 and the country's currency, the lira, slumped further in January this year. That forced Turkey's central bank to ratchet up its interest rates from 7.7% to 12% -- showing the bank's determination to prevent foreign capital outflows. Erdogan strongly opposed the bank's move to raise the rates. He argued it would hurt Turkey's growth, blaming the lira's tumble on the opposition and an ""interest rates lobby,"" and saying it was the result of a conspiracy. What's the economy doing now? The OECD expects 3.5% growth in 2014, picking up slightly from 2013, but high inflation is pushing the country back and hurting consumers. At around 9%, annual inflation is nearly double the Turkish central bank's target of 5%. This, coupled with the country's low employment rate leads to high levels of poverty. In an OECD study, one in three Turks said they were not able to afford sufficient food. The OECD average is one in seven. Furthermore, 20% of Turks live below the relative poverty line, meaning they survive on less then half of the Turkish median income. This makes Turkey the third poorest developed nation, with Mexico and Israel lagging behind. Turkey's strategic position means the country is the bridge between Asia and Europe. Its membership of NATO and candidacy to join the European Union reflect its importance. But unrest and uncertainty has already cost the country millions, with its stock market losing a third of its value last year.

"(CNN) -- There was lots of news in the NFL this weekend. Little of it had to do with the pigskin. Domestic violence has dominated professional football's story lines for weeks, and this weekend saw three star players miss their games because of issues at home. A black cloud hangs over a fourth player as California's lieutenant governor requested that the San Francisco 49ers bench a defensive end as his domestic violence case navigates the court system. Here is what you may have missed: . Ray Rice was initially cleared to play next week, until footage of him brutalizing his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, hotel elevator surfaced. Once the video was made public, the Baltimore Ravens cut Rice, and the NFL made his suspension indefinite. There are reports that Rice intends to appeal the new punishment. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, who joined 15 other women senators in asking NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to institute a zero-tolerance policy for domestic violence, has said it's ""outrageous"" the NFL didn't try harder to obtain the tape. Goodell has said no one in the league office saw footage of Rice striking Janay Palmer until TMZ posted the video online. ""I have a feeling there's a lot of people that know stuff, what went on here,"" Klobuchar told CNN on Sunday. ""I'm waiting to see if there is a major cover-up. If it shows (Goodell) lies, there could be many factual situations where, in fact, he should step down."" Adrian Peterson turned himself in to authorities in East Texas on Saturday after a grand jury indicted him on felony child abuse charges. He quickly posted $15,000 in bail and was released, the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office said. The Minnesota Vikings star running back, considered one of the best -- if not the best -- in the NFL, missed his team's game against the New England Patriots on Sunday. State law says an accused person can defend himself against the charge Peterson faces if he can demonstrate he was administering reasonable discipline. While the prosecutor in the case alleges Peterson hurt his child ""with criminal negligence or recklessly,"" Peterson's attorney says his client used a switch to spank his son, thus doling out discipline much like ""he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas."" Greg Hardy was set to take the field Sunday, despite being convicted of domestic violence this summer and facing a jury trial in an appeals court later this year. That changed shortly before game time when the Carolina Panthers announced he would sit out the team's match against the Detroit Lions. Authorities say Hardy in May choked his then-girlfriend, threw her around, dragged her by her hair and threatened to kill her. He was sentenced in July to 18 months of probation and a 60-day suspended sentence. The 6-foot-4, 275-pound defensive end says he is innocent and has appealed a guilty verdict rendered by a Mecklenburg County judge in North Carolina, but many observers wondered how Rice could face suspension, but not Hardy. Despite sitting Hardy, the Panthers were accused of reacting to the new climate regarding domestic violence rather than any acting out of any concern about the crime or victim. Coach Ray Rivera acknowledged the changed climate and said in post-game remarks, ""We really do have to get this right."" Sports Illustrated's Richard Deitsch was not impressed with Hardy's last-minute benching. ""They ceded to press/public pressure. It was disgrace it took this long,"" he tweeted. Ray McDonald had two tackles in the San Francisco 49ers' Sunday Night Football game against the Chicago Bears, but according to Sports Illustrated, Goodell was not in attendance. Goodell, who often attends stadium openings and was reportedly scheduled to be at Levi's Stadium for its christening, is under fire for his handling of the Rice case, prompting the women's rights group Ultraviolet to fly banners over NFL stadiums with the hashtag, #GoodellMustGo. Police were called to a birthday party at McDonald's home about 3 a.m. on August 31 and determined McDonald had been involved in an altercation with his fiancee, who was 10 weeks pregnant, The Sacramento Bee reported. She showed police minor bruises on her arms and neck, the paper reported. McDonald told CNN affiliate KTVU that ""the truth will come out"" after he was released from jail on felony domestic violence charges. California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom asked the 49ers to bench their defensive tackle Sunday, saying the team's ""continued insistence on playing Ray McDonald during his ongoing criminal investigation is a painful affront to every victim of domestic violence and sends a troubling message to our community and especially our children that 'zero tolerance' are empty words, not real actions."" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Mary Grace Lucas, Candy Crowley, Greg Botelho, Ray Sanchez, Steve Almasy, Kevin Conlon and Holly Yan contributed to this report.","Senator: NFL commissioner should resign if there was a cover-up in the Ray Rice case .

"(CNN) -- One priceless car was crushed. Another, mashed; a third, pancaked. Now, Vette City faces a sinkhole summer. A total of eight vehicles at Bowling Green, Kentucky's National Corvette Museum remain just as wrecked as they were when the earth swallowed them whole more than two months ago. Workers fished the last car out of the monster sinkhole on April 9 and so far, not one coat of paint has been applied to any of the cars. Not one dent has been removed. Nothing. Why? Museum officials were shocked by the damage. ""The last three or four cars that came out of the sinkhole ... we didn't expect them to come out looking quite that bad,"" said Dana Forrester, lead Corvette restoration member of the museum's board of directors. Among the worst-damaged was a custom-made, one-of-a-kind speed demon that can zoom-zoom at more than 175 mph. ... Well, it could. The sinkhole reduced it to â€” as one museum official put it â€” ""just a tire."" The whole dirty mess has been enough to make any grease-smeared gear-head cry. Next month, the museum's board of directors plans to meet with independent restorers and Chevrolet's parent company General Motors to consider new strategy on how to save the cars. ""We'll listen to what they say about it, and then we'll make a decision as to which car gets restored and to what degree,"" Forrester told CNN on the phone. Surprisingly, the museum may choose not to restore the worst-smashed cars at all. And then there's another problem: what to do about that 40-foot-wide, 60-foot-deep sinkhole. Thank goodness nobody got hurt when it desecrated the museum's cathedral-like Skydome in the early morning hours of February 12. The idea of a giant hole suddenly opening up inside a museum and stealing away with some of the crown jewels of the auto world grabbed global attention. Reports estimated the total value of the cars at more than $1 million. Passionate owners and fans still feel the pangs. Even for folks who don't care about cars, the Corvette matters. It's historic. Experts call the Corvette the most collected car in America. We're talking about the ""world's longest-running, continuously produced passenger car,"" according to General Motors. Since the 'Vette's 1953 debut, more than 1.5 million have rolled off Chevrolet assembly lines, creating jobs for generations of Americans. The sleek silhouette has transformed into a pop culture icon across TV, films and advertising. Although GM announced back in February that it would ""oversee"" restoration of the Corvettes, more options are on the table now. ""Recent discussions have changed what the original thoughts were,"" said Forrester, who's also an officer of the National Corvette Restorers Society. Restoration of some of the cars ""may not be possible,"" he said. Or for some of the cars, ""it may be best"" that an independent restorer other than GM do it. Related story: Check out the 625-horsepower Corvett Z06 . The privately funded, not-for-profit museum is governed by the board of directors - but driven by its donors and 28,000 members. Don't think 'Vette-heads around the world aren't watching closely. They are. And they care about the details. ""I think they should do it the right way and deliver a finished product like it wasn't damaged at all,"" said longtime New York Corvette owner Frazer Bharucha, 47, of the Long Island Corvette Owners Association. ""When it's all said and done, it should look the way it was when it first entered the museum."" To outsiders, restoring a Corvette ""correctly"" might seem -- well -- kind of anal. Attention to detail sometimes includes specific engine bolt heads, or original headlights, or even a $10,000 set of original tires. Will the sinkhole cars get that same level of treatment? ""I don't believe they'll go that far,"" Forrester said. GM's goal is ""sensitive restoration,"" said its Corvette communications manager, Monte Doran. Doran is expected to take part in meetings with museum officials where he anticipates a ""serious talk to see if they want us to restore all the cars."" Final Corvette raised from sinkhole . GM designer says: Save their 'souls' Just be careful, advised Tom Peters, GM's director of exterior design for performance cars. Respect the vehicles. They have ""souls."" They have ""character"" and ""being."" Replacing too many key original parts might result in ""re-creations"" rather than restorations, he said. Peters described himself as a passionate museum supporter who's not at all involved in the restoration project. ""You have to ask, what is it going to take to bring some of these cars back to being authentic? It's just terrible, but the last two they pulled out are basically pancakes,"" he said. It's hard to know for sure -- and too soon to tell, but ""maybe they're better off just leaving them as they are."" Decisions about which cars to restore might be based on some of these questions: . Did enough of the car's unique body panels survive? Does the car still have structural integrity? Did its fundamental framework suffer too much damage? Worst damaged: . - 2001 custom-made, one-of-a-kind Mallett Hammer Z06 racing car . - GM-owned 1993 ZR-1 Spyder; fewer than 12 were ever built . Significantly damaged: . - 1984 PPG Pace Car; a one-of-a-kind car for Indy Car World Series . - 1993 Ruby Red 40th Anniversary model; more than 6,000 were built . - 1992 '1 millionth' Corvette to come off the assembly line . - 2009 '1.5 millionth' Corvette to come off the assembly line . Least damaged: . - 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil, among GM's fastest production cars . - 1962 tuxedo black Corvette, the oldest sinkhole car . Related story: GM reveals most powerful drop-top Corvette . Institutional memory . The black '62 poses another big question: Does GM still have enough institutional memory to best restore a car that's more than a half-century old? Should independent specialists be brought in to help? ""It may be best that there's some other restorer to do it,"" Forrester said. ""I know GM's got the expertise to go back and take the [two] cars they still own and work on them to a certain degree, but as far as structural work ... I don't know. I'm sure that will enter into the discussion."" Oh, about that 60-foot-deep hole in the floor... In an apparent masterstroke of marketing genius, the museum has put the wrecked cars on display for visitors -- sort of a sports-car version of a carnival freak show. Also, the museum plans to allow visitors close access to the hole this weekend on a temporary basis. They'll be able to stand in the Skydome three feet from the edge, where they can get a good look at the natural forces that crushed the cars. See how the museum is showcasing the sinkhole . The new exhibits appear to be popular. March attendance spiked by more than 50%. Donations following the sinkhole collapse have already topped $75,000. ""It's the rubberneck effect,"" said museum spokeswoman Katie Frassinelli. The whole mess is now ""part of the museum's history -- and part of Corvette's history,"" said Forrester. The idea is, why not embrace it? Museum officials haven't decided on a long-term strategy to deal with the sinkhole. There's talk about leaving the hole open as a permanent exhibit, and building stairs so visitors could walk down into it. Another option would be to return the Skydome to its original condition by filling the sinkhole with dirt and replacing the collapsed floor. ""I personally lean toward securing the hole -- but not filling it -- and creating something like a bridge across it so people can actually look down into it,"" said Forrester. An accomplished artist, Forrester has painted a watercolor canvas depicting the hole and the 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil rising out of it. If there's a bright side to the sinkhole collapse, Forrester thinks he's found it. ""Millions of people in the Corvette culture have pulled together over this,"" he said. ""Now more people outside the community are discovering how special this culture really is.""","No major repairs have begun on Corvettes recovered from a giant sinkhole .

"(CNN) -- Before she was taken hostage during a brazen bank robbery this month, Misty Holt-Singh worried about one thing, says a woman inside the bank with her. ""Misty was crying,"" Janie Martinez told CNN affiliate KOVR. ""She was saying her daughter was alone in the car. She said, 'I don't want my daughter to see me coming out with you,' and they said, 'Don't worry, nothing is going to happen,' and they took her anyway."" The three heavily armed men forced Holt-Singh and two female bank employees into a Ford Expedition and sped away, police in Stockton, California, said. About 50 law enforcement vehicles chased the SUV for an hour during a high-speed gunbattle. The chase ended with three deaths -- two suspects and Holt-Singh, who was used as a human shield, police said. Authorities don't know if the police or the suspects fired the bullets that killed her. Martinez, the first victim to talk about the robbery, said she and other customers were inside the bank July 16 when the three armed men entered and demanded money. They tied up a security guard. Holt-Singh's 12-year-old daughter was sitting in the car in the parking lot. ""They had guns, and it was happening so fast,"" Martinez said. ""When they found out the police officers were there, they said we're going to take hostages. They just grabbed Misty."" Police chased the SUV on surface streets and interstates through Lodi to Acampo, then 20 miles back to Stockton. Gunfire from a semiautomatic ""AK-47-type assault rifle"" and other weapons struck 14 of the squad cars that gave chase, police said. The two bank employees either jumped or were pushed out of the SUV and will recover, police said. When the chase ended, Holt-Singh was dead, along with two suspects, ages 27 and 30. Police said they were members of the NorteÃ±os street gang. Police arrested Jaime Ramos, 19, of Stockton and charged him with murder and other offenses. Authorities have offered a $50,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest of a fourth suspect, KOVR reported.

"(CNN) -- Politics is in the blood of Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak. His father was the country's second prime minister, and his uncle, the third. Najib has continued the political dynasty with a career in politics and became his country's leader in 2009. In Malaysia's multi-ethnic and multi-religious society, he has presided over some flash points since taking office, most recently the violent response earlier this year by Muslim fundamentalists to a court ruling that allowed Christians to use the word Allah. Pursuing a policy to strengthen national unity, called ""1Malaysia,"" he thinks that, contrary to what many commentators believe, multi-culturalism is working in a country where affirmative action laws were enacted in 1971. ""In spite of the huge diversity in Malaysia in terms of religion, culture, race, ethnicity and so forth, we've really gone very far in developing this country,"" he told CNN. ""And I'm confident this journey for Malaysia to become a fully developed nation, high-income nation, by 2020 is doable."" Malaysia has seen 7 percent economic growth this year, but the possibility of a ""brain drain"" of skilled and talented Malaysians going abroad has prompted Najib and his government to address a growing problem. ""We have recognized it [as a problem]. There's going to be huge change in government policies in this regard,"" he said, and indicated an announcement on the issue will be made later this month. On China and India's role in the region he is phlegmatic: ""I don't see them as threatening the region. They will increase their influence, of course, using more of their economic clout to influence events in the region... So I think both countries are important to Malaysia, and we have a large community of Malaysian Chinese as well as Malaysian Indians."" While Najib represents the continuity in the top echelons of Malaysian politics, more recent scandals have gained international headlines. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim is facing trial for sodomy charges, a crime that he was charged with in 1998. Al Gore has called the recent charge a threat ""to all those in Malaysia who have struggled for a freer and more democratic nation."" Other commentators have suggested it is politically motivated, which Najib refutes. ""It's not our choice. And we didn't plan for this. It so happened that his own employee made a criminal complaint against him,"" said Najib. ""We're willing to compete against anyone. You know, this is a democracy. So let it be, the best party, chosen by the people, will form the government."" Speaking at the UN General Assembly in New York in September, Najib proposed a global movement of moderates, in part to counter the growing problem of Islamophobia. ""I am concerned if 25 percent of Americans think that President Obama is a Muslim. I mean it's obviously a lack of knowledge. But also, it's for the Muslims as well, you know, because a small numbers of Muslims have really painted a very negative image of Islam,"" he said. ""It's a problem between the moderates and the extremists of each religion and if the moderates can have a much stronger voice, then there is every chance that we will find resolution to many of the world's problems.""","Najib Razak is Malaysia's 6th Prime Minster and son of a former PM .

"(CNN) -- House Republicans have been forced to close a potential loophole on their much-touted insider trading law -- a loophole CNN uncovered and reported about last month. Because of CNN's report, the Senate and House passed new legislation Thursday to close the loophole that could have allowed family members of some lawmakers to profit from inside information. Senators who were critical of the loophole after it was unearthed applauded the fix. The STOCK Act, one of the rare bipartisan bills passed this year, was signed by President Barack Obama in April. Obama signs STOCK Act to address 'deficit of trust' in Washington . Lawmakers proclaimed that the bill, officially called the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, would restore trust in government. It also applied new rules to some employees of the executive branch. But CNN discovered the law that members of Congress thought they voted for earlier this year wasn't exactly as advertised. The STOCK Act requires that any trades of $1,000 or more made on or after July 3 have to be reported to the House and Senate within 45 days. But the House and Senate came out with two completely different interpretations of that rule. In the Senate, the Ethics Committee released one page of guidelines in June ruling that members and their spouses and dependent children all have to file reports after they make stock or securities trades. But the House Ethics Committee disagreed. Its 14-page memo released in June found that House members and aides covered by the law that their spouses and children were not covered. The Office of Government Ethics, which oversees all federal executive branch employees, sided with the House, informing its employees that their spouses and children don't need to file these periodic reports. Both of the lead sponsors of the Senate bill didn't realize the discrepancy until CNN brought it to their attention last month. Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown, the only Republican senator to attend the White House signing ceremony, said he was ""obviously very concerned."" ""Say I find out some information, I tell my wife and she goes and trades on it, what's the difference?"" Brown told CNN. Brown, who speaks constantly about this bill in his neck-and-neck race for re-election against consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren, said the whole point of passing the law was to demonstrate that members of Congress weren't held to a different standard. Massachusetts Senate race in a dead heat . ""I mean, bottom line, we're supposed to have that level of transparency and have us be treated like every other member of the United States and bottom line, if we can't do it, then -- sorry, if they can't do it -- then we shouldn't be able to do it as well."" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, also criticized the House decision not to include congressional spouses and children when the loophole was brought to her attention. ""I think it's wrong, and I think it's unfortunate because the reality is the whole point of this legislation is we should play by the exact same rules as every other American citizen, and when all of America looks at Washington, they know it's broken."" ""We're trying to restore just a small measure of confidence through this kind of transparency and accountability,"" Gillibrand said. After CNN told Brown about the House interpretation, Brown fired off a letter to his GOP colleagues in the House, Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. ""The House interpretation leaves a loophole and the appearance of an ongoing double standard,"" Brown said in the letter. ""It is deeply troubling that the House of Representatives and Executive Branch would attempt to operate under a substantially weaker interpretation than the Senate,"" he added, demanding that the House adopt the Senate's view and require all spouses and dependents to begin reporting stock trades. Why was there a difference? Robert Walker, a Washington ethics attorney and former chief counsel for both the House and Senate Ethics Committees, explained that the Senate bill did include a provision that covered spouses and children, but when Cantor's office wrote the House version, this language was shifted to a different section of the bill. The change meant that spouses and dependent children weren't subject to the new reporting requirements. ""The House recrafted some of the provisions of it and moved some of the provisions around. In that process, some of the Senate bill that applied to filing of these new reports was moved from one section of the bill to the other,"" Walker said. The Senate Ethics Committee decided to stick with the spirit of the law that senators originally intended, but the House Ethics Committee went with the letter of the law, which included the loophole not requiring spouses and children to report financial transactions in a timely fashion. More Congress: No aid for farmers amid drought . Why did it matter? The loophole went to the heart of what the STOCK Act set out to do. While there were already laws in place barring members of Congress or the executive branch from profiting from nonpublic information that they learn in the course of their duties, it was extremely difficult for those at the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce those laws. The financial disclosure forms House members and senators were already required to file only come out once a year, making it tough to track any relationship between legislative action and a stock trade. That's why the STOCK Act added the rule that after each trade over $1,000 a report had to be filed in a timely manner. Walker stressed the new law provides ""more immediacy, more real time so that the public could have more real-time understanding of what their members, of their senior staff and other high government officials were doing with their finances, what kinds of trades were they making."" The chairman of the House Ethics Committee, Rep. Jo Bonner, R-Alabama, and the ranking Democrat, U.S. Rep. Linda Sanchez of California, defended their committee's interpretation of the law in a written statement to CNN last month. ""As has been noted by outside experts, the office of Government Ethics and various House offices of expertise, including the Office of Legislative Counsel and the Office of General Counsel, with whom the Committee consulted, the plain language of the STOCK Act and the Ethics in Government Act is unambiguous and beyond dispute and the Committee interpreted it correctly."" Initially when contacted by CNN, Cantor's office insisted it did nothing to change the intent of the STOCK Act. But when pressed with the new information uncovered by CNN, the majority leader's office conceded it made changes to the House bill that effectively took out the requirement for spouses and children to file these reports. Cantor's spokesman insisted that the change was unintentional and the majority leader's office did not believe when they passed their bill that it differed from the Senate version. ""Since new information has been brought to our attention with respect to this discrepancy, we are reviewing our options regarding transaction reports in the House of Representatives,"" Doug Heye said at the time. Still, another question is why the House changed the legislation in the first place. A GOP leadership source insists there were no sinister motives, that Cantor and the broader GOP leadership made changes after consulting with Ethics Committee lawyers. In the two weeks since CNN's report, Cantor's office consulted with the Senate to determine how they should fix the loophole. After consultations with leaders of both parties, new legislation was drafted. The two-page bill passed unanimously by both chambers on Thursday before Congress left Washington for their month long summer recess. Following the change, Gillibrand issued a statement applauding it. ""The intent of this important reform bill was clear from the start, to restore people's faith in their elected leaders by ensuring we play by the exact same set of rules as every other American. Including family members in our monthly disclosure requirements was an integral piece of restoring that faith, and I am pleased the House will finally join the Senate in conforming to these important new rules,"" said Gillibrand. Brown also praised the move to fix the law. ""I'm pleased that with today's legislative action, we've made sure the House will follow the Senate Ethics Committee's lead and implement the law the way it was intended. The same rules need to apply across the board -- no matter who you work for. "" In addition to closing the loophole for spouses and dependent children, the new legislation passed by the House and Senate also made a change that the Obama administration requested. Some administration officials voiced concerns that the ability of foreign governments to view personal financial information about top government employees posed a national security threat. To address those concerns, the bill gave executive branch employees a waiver from the requirement to disclose their stock or securities trades until September 30 to allow some additional time to determine the appropriate procedures for those officials.

"(CNN) -- Great baseball players know every pitch is an opportunity. As with fastballs, international crises also present opportunities. And the current clash between Israel and Gaza offers several potential game-changers. Over the course of the past six days, Hamas gunmen, along with other militant groups, have fired nearly 800 rockets at Israeli cities and towns. The Israeli air force, in response, has conducted some 1,200 sorties against Hamas targets and -- despite warning civilians of impending attacks -- inflicted civilian casualties. Now, the Israeli army is poised to enter Gaza and uproot Hamas by force. Destruction is expected to be at least as extensive as in the previous rounds of fighting between Hamas and Israel. Thousands are liable to be displaced; civilian casualties will mount. Still, with nearly its entire population under rocket fire, Israel will have no choice but to invade. The obvious solution is a cease-fire similar to ones mediated by Egypt in 2008 and 2012 and co-sponsored by the United States. Such a cease-fire would end the shooting but would not hold for long. An unconditional cease-fire would enable Hamas to rearm and reignite the conflict at a time of its choosing. Egypt, moreover, is now focused on its domestic challenges and reluctant to become embroiled in regional conflicts. And American foreign policy has been weakened by its failure in the peace process and its resistance to intervening in the Syrian and Iraqi civil wars. What's the endgame? Worsening matters, the Egyptian government of Gen. Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has had a strained relationship with the U.S. government that frowned on his undemocratic rise to power. In baseball terms, the crisis in Gaza seems to be a fastball too blistering to hit. Yet, the very threat of full-scale fighting can serve to motivate the combatants to seek a way out. Promised a new beginning in their relations with Washington, the Egyptians can be induced to once again mediate between Hamas and Israel. And America can reclaim its traditional leadership. A simultaneous cease-fire can be achieved, but that would only be the first in a multistaged diplomatic process. The next stage would apply the formula with which the United States and Russia successfully removed chemical weapons from Syria. American inspectors can locate Hamas' rocket stockpiles and ship them abroad for destruction. At the same time, the people of Gaza would receive the international aid needed to repair the war damage and energize their economy, which has been failing for years. Finally, once the rockets are eliminated, Israel can ease the maritime blockade of Gaza. The Palestinians will be spared further hardship and Hamas deprived of one of its chief pretexts for attacking Israel. The crisis also presents an opportunity to strengthen Palestinian moderates. American and Canadian-trained police officers loyal to the West Bank Palestinian Authority can be stationed at the border crossings from Israel into Gaza. Similarly, these security personnel can be deployed at the Gaza border crossings that Egypt formerly closed but would now reopen. Opinion: How Iron Dome missile defense buys time for Israel . Ideally, the Palestinian Authority would replace Hamas rule over Gaza. It is doubtful whether that goal could be achieved swiftly and without prolonged violence. Yet a new status quo can be created that is more stable and less prone to breakdown. Effectively demilitarized, with a stimulated economy and an expanded role for Palestinians committed to the peace process, Gaza can cease being the cause of repeated conflict. The Obama administration could point to a significant diplomatic victory, Egypt could reassert its regional leadership and Israel and the Palestinian Authority could create a context for restarting the peace process. Israelis and Palestinians are indeed confronting a complex and dangerous situation. But as every slugger knows, the faster the pitch, the further the ball will fly off the bat.

"(CNN) -- Lightning strikes killed two people in two days in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, said Kyle Patterson, public information officer at the park. Both strikes hit the people on trails off Trail Ridge Road at elevations of 10,829 and 11,400 feet, Patterson said. On Saturday afternoon, lightning hit four people near Rainbow Curve trail, he said. They were taken by ambulance to Estes Park Medical Center where one man died, he said. The man was not identified. On Friday, lightning hit eight people on the Ute Crossing Trail, about 500 feet from the trailhead, Patterson said. Rebecca R. Teilhet, 42, of Yellow Springs, Ohio, died on the scene, Patterson said. An air ambulance landed during periods when the weather broke and two others, including her husband, were taken to Estes Park Medical Center, he said. Five of the other hikers transported themselves to the medical center. The park 75 miles from Denver had not had a lightning death since 2000, when a technical climber was struck on the Diamond on Longs Peak, Patterson said. Dr. Martin Koschnitzke, of the Estes Park Medical Center, speaking to CNN affiliate KUSA, urged walkers to be aware of changing weather conditions. ""We can't emphasize enough that when it starts getting dark and clouds are forming, it's time to get down,"" he said. ""My understanding is this group was actually in the process of doing that and still got caught, which is really a sad thing.""

"(CNN) -- We've had octopuses, camels and turtles providing World Cup predictions, but now a computer software program has got in on the act of forecasting football matches. And, according to Microsoft, their recently released software program Cortana had a 100% success rate in predicting the winners in Brazil 2014's round of 16 games. Like Apple's Siri, MIcrosoft's virtual assistant Cortana -- named after the AI character in its Halo video games and voiced by the same actress -- is using a number of indicators to predict the winners of World Cup matches. ""For the tournament our models evaluate the strength of each team through a variety of factors such as previous win/loss/tie record in qualification matches and other international competitions and margin of victory in these contests"" said Microsoft's Bing blog. One of the Cortana software developers Mouni Reddy tweeted: ""If she gets the United States-Belgium game right we are officially living in the matrix."" And so it proved with Belgium beating Team USA 2-1 after extra time. So if you don't want to know which teams will reach the World Cup semifinals look away now. If you're still reading, Cortana predicts Germany will beat France, hosts Brazil will triumph over Colombia, Argentina getting the better of Belgium and the Netherlands knocking out Costa Rica.

"(CNN) -- ""Fail fast."" It's a mantra you hear in the tech-startup world -- a reminder to chase your dreams even if you need to pick up the pieces and start from scratch every now and then. Of course, some failures work out better than others. This year saw its share of technology-driven missteps. Some were rare slip-ups by usually reliable tech titans. Others were folks who crashed the world stage via the Internet's powerful echo chamber, got lambasted for their efforts, then disappeared to presumably never be heard from again. Among them all, it wasn't hard to fill the top spot on this year's list of ""tech fails."" There are lots of arguments for and against the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature health care law that has opened access to insurance for millions of Americans. But there's no debating that the rollout of its website, where millions of people would presumably sign up for care under the act, was a disaster. Some painted it as a stark contrast between the nimble, flexible world of Silicon Valley startups and the unwieldy snarl of Washington bureacracy. Regardless, the glitch-filled launch gave critics of the plan plenty of ammunition at a time when supporters would have preferred to be extolling the virtues of the health care plan. Of course, the full-time techies weren't perfect this year, either. After unveiling its successful video app, Vine, Twitter launched an uncharacteristic clunker in Twitter Music, a streaming tool that nobody seemed to notice. Once-mighty BlackBerry watched its dwindling relevance erode to almost zero in 2013, while Microsoft learned that taking on the iPad isn't easy as its Surface tablet struggled to find an audience. Yahoo's tinkering with its e-mail service frustrated users -- although not as much as a handful of major outages. And Facebook learned that being the world's most popular social network doesn't mean people want a smartphone that's been reskinned with Facebook features. Smartwatches were part of one of the year's top tech stories, the emergence of wearable technology. But by the end of 2013, none of the devices had lived up to all the hype. Perhaps spoiled by the capabilities of their smartphones and tablets, many users felt the connected watches just don't do very much ... yet. And it wouldn't be a year in the digital age without people using their Web access in regrettable, embarrassing and sometimes just plain stupid ways. Be it overzealous crime-fighters on Reddit, restaurant owners ranting on Facebook or the rest of us leaping at the chance to believe, and share, phony stories, there were plenty instances of people posting first and thinking later.

"(EW.com) -- Even though it's set in a prison that serves tampon sandwiches for lunch, ""Orange Is the New Black"" is a pretty highbrow show, whether it's quoting Shakespeare's Coriolanus, name-dropping Ulysses, or analyzing Robert Frost's ''The Road Not Taken'' in a way that will permanently alter how you interpret that poem. Midway through the second season, Officer Fischer (Lauren Lapkus) makes a literary reference that's particularly spot-on. She's monitoring the inmates' telephone conversations when her eyes brighten. ''It's so interesting, all these lives,'' she says. ''It's like Dickens.'' She's right. ""Orange Is the New Black"" might be the closest thing we have to Charles Dickens right now: a sharp denunciation of an arcane system, driven by hardscrabble characters with whimsical names that define who they are and what they like. 'Orange Is the New Black': Mugshots and Rap Sheets . This season delves further into the complicated lives of Poussey (Samira Wiley), Crazy Eyes (Uzo Aduba), and Taystee (Danielle Brooks), making them even more sympathetic, especially when Taystee's old drug-dealer boss Vee (Lorraine Toussaint) shows up. (Minor spoilers ahead.) And when Piper (Taylor Schilling) starts snooping into allegations of fraud at Litchfield, ""OITNB"" continues its savvy critique of officials who benefit from the oppression of the poor — what, exactly, is Fig (Alysia Reiner) doing with those prison funds? — and prisoners who manipulate the goodwill of officials. And there's no better satire of white privilege on television: When Larry (Jason Biggs) tells Piper that he just stood in line for hours to get a much-hyped ''bagnut'' — half bagel, half doughnut — she sighs, ''I forgot what it's like to have all that freedom to waste.'' Maybe that's the biggest difference from last season: Piper's not the Whole Foods-eating, Toms-shoes-buying idealist anymore, and it's gratifying to see her lose the wide-eyed blondie shtick. Early on, she must decide whether to tell the truth and testify against a drug lord, or lie and protect Alex (Laura Prepon), and her decision makes her want to declare herself ''a lone wolf, and a vicious one.'' 'Game of Thrones' Pedro Pascal will star in new Netflix drama . But these women are way too caught up in one another's lives for that, and watching how much they depend on each other in this matriarchal world can be quite moving, from Vee saving a piece of cake for the ever-excluded Crazy Eyes to Poussey helping Taystee tailor her skirt for Career Day. When Piper wonders whether anyone would care if she died, Nicky (Natasha Lyonne) is right there to reassure her. ' 'You're one Cheerio in the bulk box of life,'' she says, ''but you f---in' tickle me, so I think it would matter.''

"New York (CNN) -- When chef and food aficionado Ali El Sayed opened the Kebab Café in Astoria, New York City, some 24 years ago, few there had even heard of Egyptian cuisine. He was the first to open an Egyptian business on Steinway Street, a bustling neighborhood in the borough of Queens, and a small-business hub now known as ""Little Egypt."" It's long been a home to immigrants -- first Germans, then Italians and Greeks, and most recently, Arabs. Almost half of Queens businesses are minority owned and together they bring in an average of $7 billion annually. While it typifies the growth of many American neighborhoods, Little Egypt also boasts one of the most diverse populations in the United States, according to recent census results. Foreign-born residents in the borough come from over 100 different nations. El Sayed embraces the new immigrants he's seen settle here in his 40-plus years in Astoria. ""(The) neighborhood it changes because if a neighborhood doesn't change it means it's a dead neighborhood,"" he said. And this neighborhood has certainly changed. From selling hookah pipes, to selling Islamic clothes, recently arrived merchants from North Africa have found ways to set-up shop. The U.S. government estimates that 60,000 Egyptian Americans live in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with more than 21,000 of them in New York City. Merchants here aren't just at the whim of shifting tastes and the demands of new arrivals. Like business owners everywhere, they're also susceptible to changes in the national economy. El Sayed's brother, Moustafa Abdel Rahman, is chef at the Mombar Restaurant across the road. He knows first hand the perils of change. ""You know the recession affects everybody -- the recession, 9/11 all these things ... the snow affects this business,"" he said. For him, as for many of the immigrants who pass through here, less income has far-reaching consequences. Many merchants in Little Egypt work with one goal in mind -- to support the families they left behind. Nile Deli owner Hesam Makhlos has relatives in Egypt who depend on him. ""A lot of people support his family back home,"" said Makhlos. ""At least if you send like $100 a month to support your family, if you have a wife over there or if you have a sister or a mother. A lot of people need help."" And they depend on each other here too, El Sayed explained. ""We believe that money goes around and we want to take care of our neighborhood and our merchants,"" he said. El Sayed practices what he preaches, shopping daily in the local markets to stock his restaurant's kitchen. Supporting the neighborhood is not his only impetus. Immigrants with common origins often have common ideals. Mohamed Zohny is the owner of the Islam Fashion store. He prefers doing business with other Muslims in Little Egypt. ""This is only Halal money, like for example, there is no liquor, no ham, no pork, nothing; everything is 100%. I know it is Halal,"" he said.","Steinway Street, in Astoria, New York City, is known as ""Little Egypt""

"(CNN) -- Last month the TEDx talk I gave was posted online. Now it has been viewed over a million times. The talk itself is nothing groundbreaking. It's a couple of stories and observations about working as a model for the last decade. I gave the talk because I wanted to tell an honest personal narrative of what privilege means. I wanted to answer questions like how did I become a model. I always just say, "" I was scouted,"" but that means nothing. The real way that I became a model is that I won a genetic lottery, and I am the recipient of a legacy. What do I mean by legacy? Well, for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire, but also as tall, slender figures, and femininity and white skin. And this is a legacy that was built for me, and it's a legacy that I've been cashing in on. Some fashionistas may think, ""Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen."" But the truth is that in 2007 when an inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the runway, of the 677 models hired, only 27, or less than four percent, were non-white. Usually TED only invites the most accomplished and famous people in the world to give talks. I hoped telling a simple story -- where my only qualification was life experience (not a degree, award, successful business or book) -- could encourage those of us who make media to elevate other personal narratives: the stories of someone like Trayvon Martin, the undocumented worker, the candidate without money for press. Instead my talk reinforced the observations I highlighted in it: that beauty and femininity and race have made me the candy of mass media, the ""once you pop you just can't stop"" of news. In particular it is the barrage of media requests I've had that confirm that how I look and what I do for a living attracts enormous undeserved attention. Do I want a TV show? Do I want to write a book? Do I want to appear in a movie? Do I want to speak to CNN, NBC, NPR, the Times of India, Cosmo, this blogger and that journal? Do I want to speak at this high school, at that college, at Harvard Law School or at other conferences? TED.com: A teen just trying to figure it out . I am not a uniquely accomplished 25-year-old. I've modeled for 10 years and I took six years to finish my undergraduate degree part-time, graduating this past June with honors from Columbia University. If I ever had needed to put together a CV it would be quite short. Like many young people I'd highlight my desire to work hard. But hard work is not why I have been successful as a model. I'm not saying I'm lazy. But the most important part of my job is to show up with a 23-inch waist, looking young, feminine and white. This shouldn't really shock anyone. Models are chosen solely based on looks. But what was shocking to me is that when I spoke, the way I look catapulted what I had to say on to the front page. Even if I did give a good talk, is what I have to say more important and interesting than what Colin Powell said? (He spoke at the same event and his talk has about a quarter of the view count.) TED.com: Isaac Mizrahi on fashion and creativity . Like many young people I believe I have potential to make a positive impact in the world. But if I speak from a platform that relies on how I look, I worry that I will not have made room for anyone else to come after me. I will have reinforced that beauty and race and privilege get you a news story. The schoolteacher without adequate support, the domestic worker without rights, they won't be up there with me. So what do I do? I am being handed press when good press for important issues is hard to come by. These outlets are the same outlets that spent two years not reporting a new drone base in Saudi Arabia while press in the UK covered it. They are the same organizations that have forgotten New Orleans and forgotten to follow up on contractors who aren't fulfilling their responsibilities there -- important not only for the people of NOLA, but also for setting a precedent for the victims of Sandy, and of the many storms to come whose frequency and severity will rise as our climate changes. TED. com: Amy Tan on where creativity hides . Should I tell stories like these instead of my own? I don't feel like I have the authority or experience to do so. How can we change this cycle? The rise of the Internet and the camera phone have started to change what stories are accessible. And we now have the ability to build more participatory media structures. The Internet often comes up with good answers to difficult questions. So I ask: How can we build media platforms accessible to a diversity of content creators? On a personal note, what should I talk about? Do I refuse these offers outright because of my lack of experience, because I'm not the right person to tell the stories that are missing from the media? Can I figure out a way to leverage my access to bring new voices into the conversation? Right now I'm cautiously accepting a few requests and figuring out what it all means. I'm listening, tweet me @cameroncrussell .

Decked out in simple furnishings, each room sleeps between two and four people -- each also has its own wooden terrace, a transparent roof for star gazing and compost toilet at ground level.

Suspended from trees within a 32-hectare private wood and reached via a small bridge, this wool-insulated orb makes for a romantic retreat-for-two. Inside you'll find a double bed that converts into a sofa, a log-burning stove and desk with a power socket. An en-suite deck has a shower, toilet and sink, plus there's a fire pit next to a stream for alfresco dining. Red Kite Tree Tent, +44 1865 764 087; three nights from $479 . 5.

Situated on a private estate, it sleeps up to four people with two bedrooms, a kitchenette and bathroom. The Bilbo-Baggins-cum-Unabomber aesthetic might suggest otherwise but there's even heating and a TV. It's unlikely you'll spend much time in front of the box, though, considering guests have free use of the estate's grounds, including a swimming pool.

"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- Humor was Jami Gong's answer to helping revive New York City's Chinatown in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks. Born and raised in Chinatown, where the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center long stood as beacons over his street, Gong was awoken by his sister after the first plane had crashed into the North Tower. He grabbed his camera, caught a glimpse of the second plane before it hit the South Tower and watched helplessly, as both towers collapsed. ""I know that any one of us could have been there,"" said Gong, who once worked inside the South Tower's shopping mall before moving to another store, in an interview in Hong Kong last month. As New York struggled to recover, Chinatown -- about a 20-minute walk from Ground Zero -- turned into a ghost town. Roads closed, deliveries stopped. ""Only residents, police everywhere,"" Gong, now 42, recalled. Three-quarters of Chinatown workers -- nearly 25,000 -- were laid off, with the garment industry losing nearly $500 million in the year after the attacks, according to a 2002 report by the Asian American Federation of New York. One year later, more than 90% of surveyed restaurants, garment factories and jewelry stores were anticipating ""an inability to recover"" to pre-September 11 business levels, the report said. Chinatown shaken by 'double whammy' And then in February 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, hit Asia. Rumors flew, including an email hoax that SARS had hit Chinatowns across the United States. No confirmed cases of SARS were found in New York City, but for Chinatown it was a ""double whammy,"" said Gong, who had served as a tour guide in Chinatown in addition to his job in retail. ""Again, no one went down to Chinatown to eat. Business plummeted."" Also not helping was the general state of the U.S. economy, by then impacted by war in Afghanistan as well as the run-up to the invasion of Iraq. With friends, Gong started ""TakeOut Comedy,"" a series of shows intended to revitalize nightlife in Chinatown. The shows sold out. As head of the New York chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans, Gong also organized a SARS (Support Asian RestaurantS) rally in Chinatown, encouraging people to eat at their favorite Chinatown restaurants. Gong had first conceived of bringing comedy to Chinatown during a plane ride months earlier to see his ailing grandmother in Hong Kong. He wrote his ideas on a sick bag and was eager to share them with her, but upon landing, learned she had died while he was en route. It was she who had made him embrace his Chinese roots. ""My grandmother was a big inspiration in my life,"" Gong said. ""She worked hard to put all six of us [grandchildren] in college."" Asian-Americans were typically stereotyped as lawyers, doctors and engineers -- but aside from Jackie Chan and Margaret Cho, where were the entertainers, Gong wondered. He quit his day job to dedicate himself to finding them. The 9/11 attacks were the catalyst for the shows in Chinatown, but Gong had found what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. In 2004 he staged the first TakeOut Comedy Competition, pitting 50 Asian-American comedians from across the United States. The competition would launch winner Paul Ogata's comedic career. Gong then launched a six-city national tour with Ogata and a handful of other top Asian-American comedians, billing them ""Asian Kings of Comedy."" Having made several trips to Hong Kong over the years, he wondered why there hadn't been a full-time comedy club there. Gong spent the next two years researching. Besides Dayo Wong and Michael Hui, where were the other local comedians? As Gong put it: ""Who's finding the next Dayo?"" Heading for Hong Kong - and a new audience . Gong left New York to launch Hong Kong's -- and what he says is also Asia's -- first full-time comedy club in 2007. The idea was to teach comedy and educate crowds more accustomed to Chinese slapstick than English-language sarcasm. ""Chinese don't get the sarcasm,"" Gong said. ""They'll take things literally. You don't blame them."" He still gets calls asking if shows require standing up all night, he says. TakeOut Comedy has several bilingual comedians. Last year, in an odd twist, Andrew Chu, a native Cantonese speaker won ""Funniest English Comedian, while Christopher ""M"" Mellen won ""Funniest Chinese Comedian."" Another comedian, Vivek Mahbubani, has taken home both honors in recent years. ""With TakeOut Comedy, you get a regular platform. Like with any other skill, you need to keep practicing to get better,"" said Mahbubani, 28, who now teaches Cantonese workshops there. By day, he is a self-employed web designer and developer. The group's members give each other feedback, rewrite, refine and then perform in front of an audience, he said. Chu, a fan of American comedians and TV shows like ""South Park"" and ""The Simpsons,"" said humor forced him to change his point of view, including dealing with sadness in the world. He credited Gong's English workshop for teaching him basics from holding the mic stand to writing jokes based on his observations and how others see him. ""My English is so bad -- that's why it's so funny,"" he quipped. By day, the 28-year-old does data entry for a financial institution. Then there is James (""James Lee"") Collison, a 36-year-old intellectual property attorney, who had also never done standup before TakeOut Comedy. Months after it opened, a friend suggested they try an open-mic night. The preparation paid off; within days, they were enlisted to do weekend shows -- and then TakeOut's charity shows. It was at such a function for the American Chamber of Commerce that he met his future wife, who worked for the organization. ""Stephanie was at the door giving out name tags. And I went up and asked for a nametag. She said no,"" he recalled. No payment, no nametag. ""I didn't explain I was a comic,"" he said. Later after finding out that he was, she did give him a nametag. Cards were exchanged, then dinner, and now four years later they're married. Just this week, Collison did his first standup in Singapore where they recently moved. ""If I learned anything about the comedy thing, it's this neverending process that you keep working at."" Gong sees laughter as the glue that brings people together and the club as a way for people to boost confidence, creativity, self-esteem and public speaking. Moreover, it's a platform for talented people to get discovered, he pointed out. ""I want to unite the world through laughter,"" he said.","Gong watched the World Trade Center's Twin Towers fall from his street in Chinatown .

"Editor's note: Jane Velez-Mitchell is host of the HLN show, ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell,"" a topical event-driven show with a wide range of viewpoints. Velez-Mitchell is the author of ""Secrets Can Be Murder: What America's Most Sensational Crimes Tell Us About Ourselves."" Jane Velez-Mitchell says the Chris Brown-Rihanna relationship sends a bad message to young people. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Pop star Chris Brown has been charged with two felonies -- including assault -- in the Rihanna beating case. If convicted, Brown could face more than four years behind bars. The charges stem from the early morning of February 8, when he and his girlfriend Rihanna reportedly got into a heated argument in his car hours before they were scheduled to appear at the Grammy's. What police say happened next shook the entertainment world. A Los Angeles County affidavit says Brown gave Rihanna a vicious and continuous beating. He allegedly started by shoving Rihanna's head against the passenger window, then punched her in the face numerous times while still driving. The beating reportedly splattered blood on Rihanna's clothing and the car interior. The report goes on to say that in between barrages of punches, Brown placed Rihanna in a headlock and bit her ear -- still driving, mind you. After stopping the car, Rihanna says Brown again put her in a headlock. She said she began losing consciousness and as she fought back, he bit her finger. Days later, a gruesome police photo of Rihanna leaked to the media and it showed her with a bruised, scratched face and a split lip. It was clear evidence of a continuous pummeling, not some impassioned slap in the heat of the moment. Perhaps even more shocking than these grisly details are reports that this may not have been Brown's first time abusing Rihanna. According to TMZ, Rihanna told the LAPD that Brown had attacked her several times in the past, and the assaults were gradually becoming more violent. Yet less than a month after this ordeal, Rihanna has apparently forgiven him. Amazingly, according to an unidentified source quoted by People magazine, Brown called Rihanna on her 21st birthday and the two then reunited for some time together at Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' Miami, Florida, mansion. Through her lawyer, Rihanna asked a judge Thursday not to prohibit Brown from having contact with her while he faces the felony charges of assaulting her. Before the reported reconciliation, Brown attended anger management classes, according to the New York Daily News, even though legally he didn't have to. Sure, it's a positive step, but come on, Rihanna! Nobody can change that quickly. Rihanna and Brown's punch drunk love is sending a dangerous message to their young fans. And don't tell me children aren't paying attention, because they are both up for Kid's Choice Awards on March 28. Rihanna's apparent quick forgiveness for the alleged pummeling sends the worst possible signal -- namely, that this sort of behavior is just par for the course when it comes to male-female relationships. When you look at the numbers, it is certainly more prevalent than we'd like to admit. According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control, 5.3 million women are abused annually in the United States. An American Bar Association survey found that about one out of four American women are raped or physically assaulted by a current or former partner at some point in their lifetime. But there is some progress. The Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics found that intimate partner abuse rates in America have steadily declined since 1993. Yet the Rihanna beating shows just how much ground we still must cover. As much as I sympathize with her, I think Rihanna herself may have to go to classes. Her reported reunion with Brown enables his allegedly abusive behavior and is, in my opinion, a classic case of battered woman's syndrome. If she is going back to Chris Brown so soon, Rihanna is putting herself at risk and seems to be falling into the brutal cycle of powerlessness, fear and low self esteem that often accompanies abusive relationships. And it sends a message to Brown that he doesn't have to change. iReport.com: Chris Brown fans: Share your reaction . If the reconciliation is real, Rihanna is also setting a dangerous example for other abused women. Unfortunately, despite her incredible looks and talent, I think she is now the poster child for battered woman's syndrome. Our society must stop this cycle of helplessness that traps abused women. We must give them the help they need to escape the abusive spiral. But women must begin holding their loved ones to a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to violence.

"(CNN) -- These eggplant halves look wonderful and are as delicious cold as they are hot, a perfect side dish or vegetarian main course that can be made in advance. Ingredients: . 4 medium-sized eggplants . 6 ripe plum tomatoes, skinned, seeded and chopped . Handful of fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped . Fine sea salt . 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped . Handful of black olives, pitted and halved . Several good splashes of olive oil . Directions: . Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Slice the eggplants in half lengthways. Using a sharp knife, make diagonal incisions from left to right into the flesh of each eggplant half. You need to cut almost down to the skin, but make sure not to puncture it. Then make diagonal incisions from right to left to create a lattice effect. In a bowl, mix together the tomatoes, parsley, two or three good pinches of salt, garlic, basil and olives. Then add a splash of olive oil and mix thoroughly. Spoon the tomato and herb mixture over the eggplants, trying to push some of the sauce into the incisions in the flesh as you do so. Lay the eggplant halves in a shallow baking dish and pour olive oil around them to the depth of around 1 cm (about 0.4 inches). Place the dish in the oven for around 45 minutes, until the eggplant flesh is soft through. Remove the dish from the oven, sprinkle fresh basil over the eggplants, and allow them to rest for about 15 minutes before serving.

"(CNN) -- It was billed as a bright new beginning. But in the end Manchester United's opening day fixture of the EPL season bore all the hallmarks of its recent troubled past as Swansea City upset Louis Van Gaal's side to win 2-1 at Old Trafford Saturday. Goals from Ki Sung Yueng and Gylfi Sigurdsson either side of a spectacular Wayne Rooney overhead kick ensured the Swans were full value for the three points. Apart from a Rooney free-kick that cracked the post midway through the second half, United rarely threatened or looked like a side capable of getting its league campaign off to a winning start. ""It is very disappointing that we have lost our first home match,"" Van Gaal told BT Sport in his post game interview. ""We didn't reach the level we can play at. That is disappointing because we have done it much better and when you cannot do it in your first home match that is disappointing, especially for the fans."" The feelgood factor had seemed to have returned to United since Van Gaal's appointment earlier in the summer. A busy pre-season witnessed promising victories over Liverpool, Roma, Valencia and Real Madrid. But Saturday's performance had more in common with last year's disastrous campaign under David Moyes which saw the Red Devils finish seventh, their lowest placing in Premier League history. ""We were very nervous in first half, made the wrong choices and that is a pity. In the second half we never played as a team, therefore I'm responsible,"" Van Gaal continued. ""We had more chances than Swansea but that shall say nothing about the result. It is the goals that count. ""I thought we would win (when the scores were tied at 1-1 in the second half) but because we are not playing as a team in the second half we made the wrong decisions going forward."" Van Gaal intimated later in an interview with MUTV that there would be further signings arriving at Old Trafford before the transfer window slams shut at the end of August. Judging by this performance, the prospective new arrivals can't arrive soon enough. United began with a 3-5-2 system similar to that employed by Van Gaal's Dutch side at the World Cup earlier this summer before switching to a 4-4-1-1 as the game progressed. There were competitive debuts to new $48 million midfield signing Ander Herrera and 20-year-old center half Tyler Blackett. Newly installed captain Wayne Rooney led the line alongside Javier Hernandez with Robin Van Persie still missing after he was given extended holiday to recover from his World Cup exertions. Like many a visitor to Old Trafford, Swansea sat in deep and attempted to play on the break. It was a tactic that would work to perfection as United pressed and dominated possession but produced few goal-scoring opportunities. Ki was a standout in midfield for Swansea while Ashley Williams was his usual commanding self at the back, organizing when required and reading the game exceptionally well. ""We have been working hard in pre-season on defensive shape and we can get even better at that but there were pleasing signs in the way we stuck together and the goals we scored against a side of Manchester United's resources,"" said Swansea manager Gary Monk. ""We have worked on the mentality side of things so that even when things go against us we continue to believe in what we are doing."" Having lost a raft of key players over the summer, including Chico Flores, Michel Worm and Ben Davies, many observers had questioned whether Swansea would be relegation candidates. With more solid, mature performances like this over the coming season such predictions will be made to look badly placed.","Manchester United suffer 2-1 defeat to Swansea City on EPL opening day .

"(CNN) -- Former world No. 1 Roger Federer had a simple message for those advocates of revamping tennis by allowing on-court coaches -- he hopes he will have retired if it ever happens. On-court discussion with coaches is currently banned at ATP Tour events, but female players are allowed to call for a coach under certain circumstances. Federer warned against rules changes in tennis following an effortless 7-5 6-1 quarterfinal victory over South Africa's Kevin Anderson at the Indian Wells Masters -- a win that will see the Swiss star return to the top five of the world rankings. ""If it does happen, it's hopefully after I'm done playing,"" the 17-time grand slam champion told reporters after the match. ""I really don't think it's necessary. I don't think it's fair, maybe, because not everybody can afford a coach ...it's just not right."" Federer's comments came after a coaching call appeared to not have quite the required effect in one of the day's two women's quarterfinals. Italian Flavia Pennetta was one set up against American starlet Sloane Stephens, and leading 5-4 in the second set, when she called for her coach. The Italian proceeded to lose the following three games, and the set, before rallying to take the match 6-4 5-7 6-4. The rules, introduced in 2009, allow for discussion at one changeover each set, and in between sets. Federer -- once also a vocal opponent of the Hawkeye ball-tracking review system -- defended the sport as a one-on-one battleground. ""It's cool to figure it out yourself,"" added the 32-year-old. ""You can look over to your coach for comfort and support, but other than that, I think tennis should be one of those unique sports where you don't get coaching."" In little over an hour under the floodlights, Federer completed his 10th successive victory following his win at the Dubai Open earlier this month. Arriving at the tournament ranked No. 8, Federer will re-enter the world's top five next week, a position he occupied for more than a decade, before dropping out in August 2013. Federer has not dropped a set this tournament and is looking for his fifth Indian Wells title as he heads into a semifinal clash with Alexandr Dolgopolov, who secured a 6-3 6-4 win over Canada's Milos Raonic. Ukrainian Dolgopolov knocked out world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in the third round and he was in bullish mood ahead of his first semifinal at an ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event. ""I played good for three weeks,"" said the world No. 31. ""I'm confident enough to come out and play good tennis. Then, who knows? I beat a lot of good players around here, so I wouldn't see why not win more matches."" In the women's draw, Pennetta will meet top-seed Li Na in the semifinals after China's world No.2 triumphed in a competitive match against Slovakian Dominika Cibulkova. Na lost her opening service game, and appeared shaky, but eventually rallied to record a 6-3 4-6 6-3 victory in two hours and 36 minutes. Read.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- Natalie Grant apologizes for crying, but she can't help it. She is describing meeting a woman from India who is a counselor in a village where some women have been saved from human traffickers. The counselor knew all too well what these women went through. When she was 12 her parents took her to Mumbai for her birthday. Her brother traveled with them. When they got off the train, the woman told Grant, she was separated from her family. She began to cry endlessly. A man came up and said he would help. He didn't. He had purchased her from her parents, whom she said thought that she would be getting a job and sending money back to their village. Instead she was thrown in the trunk of a car, and that night she began her horrific journey into sex slavery. Years later, after being rescued and going through a ""restoration"" program, she met Grant, a popular Christian music singer who grew up near Seattle, Washington, never giving thought to sex trafficking. There was one word they both understood. ""She just kept looking at me and she kept saying, 'Jesus' over and over,"" Grant said. ""In my American, comfortable life I've never experienced anything like that before. It wrecked me for life."" It was also a force in Grant, a four-time female vocalist of the year at the Dove Awards, starting a charity, The Home Foundation, to provide assistance for the battered and abused women rescued from trafficking. Her mission started in 2004, when Grant was shocked as she watched a episode of ""Law & Order"" on human trafficking. She knew the show was based in fact and it bothered her so much she turned on the computer and spent hours that night searching the Web for information about trafficking. ""I found the Trafficking in Persons report for that year, and I just started reading it, and I thought, why don't I know this already,"" she said. ""I watch the news all the time, why don't I know more about this?"" Within months, Grant had arranged a trip to India with her husband, music producer Bernie Herms, where their guide showed them the seedier side of life. Many of the street girls -- some as young as 5 -- were going to be sold and raped repeatedly that night, she said the guide told her. ""I'd be hard pressed to find a human being who would see that -- outside of the men who are the buyers -- that wouldn't be appalled by that,"" she said. ""That doesn't mean everyone is going to come back and say I have to change it. But I believe enough in the human heart that it would at least wreck you, at least mess you up a little bit."" In her research, Grant found some stunning statistics. There are more sex slaves now than at any point in history, she said. More than 80 percent of them are women and girls. In the United States, there are more than 100,000 people who had been trafficked and less than 50 beds in shelters for those rescued, she said. Grant knows that as a touring Christian music singer and someone who does a lot of media interviews, she has a unique platform from which she can drive a faith-based movement to fight trafficking. Faith-based because she feels the church is best suited at ""restoring the broken."" So she started the Home Foundation in 2005 to raise money and partner with other charities to help out. For the first four years, it sent a lot of its money to causes overseas. Grant, who figured she'd just get up at her concerts and ask the audience for money, said it's become a lot more than that. Now, the goal is to build shelters, starting with 10 major U.S. cities. Grant also proudly talked about the new Christian Trafficking Shelter Association, which she likened to a Better Business Bureau of shelters. The foundation also has a growing internship program, she said. Jeff Barrows, the director of the association, said by e-mail there are four centers that house young victims of sex trafficking, with one more building being renovated. He thinks the United States is doing a good job in arresting and convicting sex traffickers, but there is still more the government can do. ""I personally believe that the U.S. is doing very well in prosecution, but could make some major strides in protection and prevention, especially when it comes to domestic minor sex trafficking victims,"" he said in the e-mail. Barrows said his group will make sure shelters follow ""established standards of care"" and said Grant has been instrumental in helping . ""She has shown leadership by realizing the need to develop best practices in this field so that efforts to help these victims are not haphazard or at worst, cause further harm to them,"" he said in the e-mail. Grant appeals for more than just money these days. ""We can all do something,"" she said. Write your congressmen to tell them to do more for the victims of sex trafficking, Grant said. She also would like people to boycott the website Craigslist until it stops selling adult ads or ask the religious leaders at their houses of worship to see what they are doing with their missions. Most churches are very receptive to her sharing information during her concerts, she said, but not all. ""There was one church that said, ""We know you do that whole trafficking thing, but we just don't want you to do that tonight. We just want you to do a real family-friendly concert,"" she said, palpable annoyance in her voice. ""I'm thinking, you're missing the whole purpose of what God wanted church to be,"" she said. A portion of the proceeds from Grant's new album, ""Love Revolution,"" will go to the Home Foundation. The CD is a reminder to Christians that a spiritual life is more than attending church each week. The album is a call to action to let your life be your message, to let your lifestyle and the way that you live be the message of Christ's love. ""It's a return to being church rather than doing church,"" she said. Grant is somewhat collected now, but she has another tale of a girl who was forced into slavery. She recounts meeting the girl at one of her concert meet-and-greets last year. The girl was much like the others who attend her shows: young, good kid, active in her church. One day, she met a cute boy at a smoothie place. He invited her to a party and told her he'd have her back by 10. She got in the car with him . ""Three weeks later the police found her. For sale, on Craigslist,"" she said. ""It's not like she was a runaway. She was just a 16 year old from a Christian school who just went to Jamba Juice. And she was trafficked.""","Christian music singer Natalie Grant has won female vocalist of the year four times .

"(CNN) -- The ex-boyfriend of American exchange student Amanda Knox says he has returned to Italy to fight his new murder conviction in the death of Knox's onetime roommate, Meredith Kercher. In a CNN interview Monday evening, Raffaele Sollecito said he and his current girlfriend were in neighboring Austria, preparing to celebrate what he had expected to be his exoneration by an Italian court. Instead, that court found Knox and Sollecito guilty for a second time last week, sentencing him to 25 years. Knox, who returned to the United States after her 2009 conviction was overturned, said last week that she ""will never go willingly"" back to Italy. But Sollecito said he came back ""as soon as I understood the verdict."" ""I'm trying to be as positive as possible in a situation like this,"" he said. ""It's very traumatic, the situation here now. But on the other side, I still have to fight. I have chosen to be here and to fight against this ordeal."" Italian police said Sollecito was stopped in the northern Italian town of Udine, near the border with Austria and Slovenia. In an interview on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360,"" Sollecito said he thought his relationship with Knox hurt him. ""Why do they convict me?"" he said. ""Why do put me on the corner and say that I'm guilty just because in their minds I have to be guilty because I was her boyfriend. It doesn't make any sense to me."" Kercher, 21, of Great Britain, was found stabbed to death in 2007 in the house she shared with Knox in Perugia, where both women were exchange students. Prosecutors said Kercher was killed after she rejected attempts by Knox, Sollecito and another man, Ivory Coast-born Rudy Guede, to involve her in a sex game. Guede is the only person in jail for the murder, and many aspects of the crime still remain unexplained. Both Knox and Sollecito have maintained their innocence, and their 2009 convictions led to questions about the effectiveness of Italy's justice system. The trial revealed widespread doubts over the handling of the investigation and key pieces of evidence, and the convictions were overturned on appeal in 2011. But in March 2013, Italy's Supreme Court overturned the pair's acquittals and ordered a retrial. That proceeding resulted in the convictions being reinstated on Thursday.

"(CNN) -- Netflix Co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings made a public apology in his blog Sunday after a customer outburst against a hike in prices. ""I messed up,"" Hastings said. ""I owe everyone an explanation."" Hastings posted the mea culpa after a barrage of customer backlash that caused Netflix stock to plunge. Netflix subscribers quit the service in droves last week after the unexpected increase. Enraged customers flooded the Netflix site with tens of thousands of comments, as well as a barrage of tweets under the hashtag #DearNetflix. ""In hindsight, I slid into arrogance based upon past success,"" Hastings said. ""We have done very well for a long time by steadily improving our service, without doing much CEO communication."" Hastings goes on to explain the company's plans to rename its DVD-by-mail service Qwikster, while keeping the Netflix name for the online movie streaming service. Hastings also assures customers the price hike is over. ""There are no pricing changes (we're done with that!)."" A downside is that customers will have to subscribe to two separate services if they want both the mail and streaming options. Members who subscribe to both services will have two entries on their credit card statements, one for Qwikster and one for Netflix. The total will be the same as the current charges. Hastings closes the blog with another apology and the companies' commitment to ""work hard to regain your trust. We know it will not be overnight. Actions speak louder than words. But words help people to understand actions."" Whether angered customers will accept the apology and come back is yet to be seen.

"(CNN) -- If you're taking a strict view on the world's most bike-friendly cities, the eventual list would mainly take in a smallish patch of northwest Europe. One such rating table, produced by the Denmark-based cycling advocacy group Copenhagnize, has more than half its top 20 bike-friendly places clustered around the Netherlands, France, Germany and Denmark. Instead, we'll spread our net more widely, rewarding aspiration, ambition and progress, as well as just endless ranks of smiling cyclists pedaling sensible bikes on segregated paths. Utrecht, Netherlands . Lists such as this one traditionally begin with Amsterdam, but while the Netherlands' most populous city is definitely bike friendly, we're marking it down for the hordes of wobbling tourists on bright-red rental machines. Instead we're heading southeast to Utrecht, a city that has a fair claim to being the globe's most pro-two-wheel destination. In its center, up to 50% of all journeys take place in the saddle and local authorities are building a 12,500-space cycle parking facility billed as the world's biggest. As in all Dutch cities, visitors from places with a more belligerent traffic culture might be struck at how normal it all feels. Cycling in Utrecht is treated on par with walking, with helmets and high-visibility garments rarely used, not least because of the protection offered by segregated cycle lanes. One well known English cycle blogger, Mark Treasure, was struck by the range in ages on a visit to Utrecht. ""I find it hard to imagine children this young cycling into the center of any UK city at all, let alone cycling in and looking so happy and relaxed, and so ordinary,"" he writes. ""Yet in Utrecht, families cycling around together is commonplace."" Seville, Spain . Seville is the answer to those who say promoting urban bike use is too ambitious and takes decades. In 2006, the Andalusian capital's government, vexed by the city's four daily rush hours (yes, four! This is siesta-taking southern Spain) decided to take action. There was plenty of naysaying. Critics pointed out Spain has scant tradition of commuter cycling. Some questioned who would ride in midsummer through Europe's hottest regions and risk arriving at work as damp as if they'd just pedaled through a mechanical car wash. Undaunted, the city established about 50 miles of cycle lanes within a year (there's now about 80 miles) and commissioned a municipal bike rental plan called Sevici. The result? Within about six years, journeys made by bike shot from less than 0.5% to about 7%, and city transportation chiefs from around the world suddenly had the perfect excuse to arrange week-long fact-finding trips in the sun. Montreal . By long tradition one of the few North American cities in these sort of lists, Montreal began constructing bike paths in the 1980s and now has almost 400 miles of them. The addition of its popular and pioneering Bixi municipal bike-share plan, the model for those later rolled out in Paris and London, has meant a remarkable amount of cycle use, especially for a place where daytime winter temperature above 10 C (50 F) is viewed as dangerously tropical. Cycling stats for Montreal indicate the city still has work to do and cycle groups say too many riders are nudged onto busy roads. One survey says nearly half the city's adult population rides a bike at least once a week, yet little more than 2% of commutes are made on two wheels. ""The challenge is that we have asked people to start using their bicycles and they've done it so much faster than we've been able to change the city,"" Aref Salem, the person in charge of mass transit on Montreal's executive committee, told the Toronto Star recently. Copenhagen, Denmark . Much like ignoring France on a roster of great cheese countries, a list of top cycling cities excluding Copenhagen just wouldn't be right. More than half the locals in the Danish capital cycle to work or school, and with an estimated bike population of 650,000 there are slightly more cycles than people. Enough of these are available to rent to tourists, and Copenhagen's compact dimensions and tolerant traffic make it perfect to explore by bike. City leaders are intent not just on increasing bike use further, but exporting the Copenhagen doctrine of a segregated and safe bike infrastructure that features bike lanes of up to three meters (about 10 feet) in width. There's an official Cycling Embassy of Denmark to spread the word, while the founder of the aforementioned Copenhagenize group, Mikael Colville-Andersen, spends much of his working life telling other cities how to copy the Danish model. Berlin . Less shouted about than the Dutch or Danish examples, Germany has nonetheless been quietly getting on with boosting bike use in many of its cities. Berlin is the standout example. About 13% of all trips in the city are made by bike, nearly twice the rate of 20 years ago. In some inner suburbs this hits 20%. This is particularly impressive given the city's long, freezing winters, abundant public transport and status as capital of a nation with a long tradition of manufacturing cars and driving them at absurd speeds on autobahns. Aside from clever and consistent public policy designed to boost bike use, Berlin has a number of inbuilt advantages. Streets are often hugely wide, in part a consequence of the devastation of World War II and grandiose postwar Soviet planning, and the terrain is largely flat. While many Berliners live in apartments, often a difficulty for those using bikes, the city's traditional Mietskaserne tenement blocks tend to be built around a central courtyard, giving space for secure storage. What's most impressive is the sheer scale -- Berlin has a population of about 3.5 million people, far bigger than the relatively small likes of Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Portland, Oregon . ""The groundwork for the city's bike infrastructure was laid over 20 years ago,"" says Brian Zeck, bike manager of Portland's River City Bicycles. ""It has built upon itself over the years and bicycling has become somewhat ingrained in the culture of the city. ""In some ways, Portland now has the feel of a European city."" That infrastructure includes more than 65 miles of bike paths, 30 miles of low-traffic bike boulevards and 175 miles of bike lanes, all of which are used with gusto by the 8% of citizens who claim that biking is their primary form of transportation, and 10% who say a bike is their secondary vehicle. All of those numbers are climbing annually, thanks to the city's grand Bicycle Plan for 2030, unanimously adopted by the City Council in 2010. The plan calls for attracting new riders by forming a denser bike network, reducing vehicle speed limits on designated streets (thus increasing safety for riders) and increasing bicycle parking, among other measures. The most exciting development for Portland bikers is the planned 2015 opening of the Tilikum Crossing, Bridge of the People spanning the Willamette River, which divides the east and west sides of the city. The first span built over the river since 1973, ""the bridge will be distinctive in the United States, designed to carry light rail trains, buses, cyclists, pedestrians and streetcars, but not private vehicles,"" according to TriMet, the local public agency that operates mass transit. The bridge will feature two 14-foot-wide pedestrian and bike lanes. According to the League of American Bicyclists, an estimated 2,100 races, rides and other biking events are held in Portland each year. Tokyo . Wait, Tokyo? The one with more than 13 million inhabitants covering 800-plus square miles. That Tokyo? Correct. In this vast, crammed capital city, an amazing 14% of all trips are made by bike. There are practical reasons many Tokyo residents prefer a bike to a car for shorter journeys. Before you can even buy a car in the city you must prove you possess a (rare and usually expensive) off-street parking spot. Cycling here is different. Few people cycle to work -- distances tend to be long and the mass transit system is hugely efficient. Instead, rides tend to be around the countless neighborhoods that make up the city. Also, a lot of cycling takes place -- legally -- on footpaths and sidewalks. These aren't the Lycra-clad speedsters of London or New York. Tokyo cyclists use practical ""mamachari"" bikes with sturdy frames, baskets for shopping and seats containing one or two small children. They pedal about the pavement on these weighty behemoths, rarely reaching the pace of a jog, keeping out of the way of each other and pedestrians with ample use of the so-called ""gaman"" attitude, a sort of stoic tolerance for others which makes life in such a vast, packed city more or less work. Bogota, Colombia . Call this one an honorable mention. Colombia's capital is by no means as obviously cycle-friendly as others on this list, with fewer than 5% of Bogota's journeys involving bikes, increasing car numbers and choking smog. Nonetheless, it merits its place for effort, not least for tempting so many citizens of an often deprived and hugely packed city -- the population is fast nearing 9 million -- onto two wheels. Did we mention it's located 2,600 meters (8,500 feet) above sea level? Anyone thinking of pedaling around as a tourist should be prepared for some undignified wheezing the first day or so. Credit is due to the city's former mayor, Enrique Penalosa, who on taking office in 1998 canceled a planned highway through the city center and kick-started a process that's seen Bogota acquire nearly 200 miles of protected bike lanes and, soon, its own bike-rental plan. The best way to try two-wheeled life in Bogota is a weekly Sunday ritual known as Ciclovia that sees 70 miles of streets closed to vehicles and given over to bikes and pedestrians.

"(CNN) -- If you've ever looked closely at a newly minted penny, you've probably been struck by its sheer beauty. Abraham Lincoln's bearded, chiseled, copper face shines forth beneath the proclamation of ""In God We Trust"" and beside the quintessential American motto, ""Liberty."" Americans revere the penny, as it encapsulates a history lesson -- Lincoln brought freedom to so many -- and a civics lesson all in one. But increasingly, Americans have stopped using the penny, as we turn toward electronic payments and away from cash. Sadly, inevitably, like so many other beautiful, venerated historical objects, it appears that the penny now belongs in a museum. Earlier this week, President Barack Obama asked Congress for permission to change the mix of metal that goes into making pennies and nickels. He based this recommendation because it costs taxpayers about 2.4 cents to make each penny and 11.2 cents to make each nickel. In fact, the costs of using such coins are even higher. Poor Richard, aka Benjamin Franklin, recognized that ""time is money."" How much is our time worth? The average American earns a little more than one penny for every two seconds of work. Unfortunately, when there's a penny involved in the transaction, it takes a couple extra seconds to fumble around for the coin and complete the purchase. Thus, for many people, time is more valuable than this money, and increasingly we throw away pennies, lose them, don't bother to collect them to return to the store or let them pile up in jars. Stores pay out more pennies than they receive, so the order goes down the line to make more pennies, which are often lost and ignored -- repeating this vicious cycle. Unfortunately, the U.S. Mint won't find a miracle metal that will make pennies worthwhile. The bottom line is that even if pennies could be created out of thin air, the cost of our time would outweigh the gains from using the penny. For nickels, the math works out better, so I'll second the president's call to begin making nickels out of less costly metal, rather than consigning them to the history books. People from across the political spectrum should unite to retire the penny. Conservatives care about the color red -- they hate the red ink that losses by the U.S. Mint impose on taxpayers. Conservatives also loathe inflation, but unfortunately, the penny's value has been slowly eroded by inflation over the years, so the penny isn't worth a red cent any more. Liberals love the color green. A penny will turn a sour shade of green if you leave it out in the elements long enough, but it's environmentally un-green. Using pennies means an increase in zinc and copper mining, an increase in energy use and pollution at these mines and an increase in energy use and pollution as the government, banks and businesses put rolls of pennies into sacks and lug them from place to place. Penny advocates worry that customers will be ripped off if Congress kills the penny. In a penny-free world, sellers would round your bill to the nearest nickel for cash purchases. Purchases totaling $4.98 or $4.99, for example, would be rounded up to an even $5, while those equaling $5.01 or $5.02 would be rounded down to $5. Since so many retail prices end in a 9, the fear has been that this rounding will gouge consumers. This worry is unfounded. I calculated the magnitude of this ""rounding tax"" after obtaining data on nearly 200,000 transactions from a multistate convenience store chain. The data reveal that the ""rounding tax"" is a myth. In reality, the number of times consumers' bills would be rounded upward is almost exactly equal to the number of times that they would be rounded downward. It turns out rounding would have given customers in my study a tiny gain of about 1 cent per every 40 purchases. ""Why, oh why, has it taken so long to recognize reality?? Get it done [eliminate the penny], and you will deserve the Nobel Prize!"" That's the encouragement I received after former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker read about my findings. Nobel Prize, hmmm ... that's worth almost 150 million pennies. You could start a museum with that ... Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- Commercial airlines that usually cross eastern Ukraine on their flights to Europe, Asia and elsewhere are detouring away from the volatile region in light of Thursday's suspicious crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that U.S. airlines had voluntarily agreed not to operate in airspace near the Russian-Ukraine border. Later, the FAA issued a notice prohibiting U.S. flight operations in the airspace over eastern Ukraine until further notice. The restricted area includes the Dnepropetrovsk and Simferopol Flight Information Regions. The European Aviation Safety Agency and intergovernmental aviation organization Eurocontrol also warned against flying in these areas. Ukrainian authorities have closed many of the routes in eastern Ukraine, according to Eurocontrol, which counts Ukraine among its 40 member states. Live blog: Loss of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 . The United States has concluded the Malaysian airliner was shot down, a senior U.S. official told CNN's Barbara Starr. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Friday blamed ""terrorists"" for the downing. The flight was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Tensions have been high between Ukraine and Russia since street protests forced former pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych from power in February. Russia subsequently annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region, and a pro-Russian separatist rebellion has been raging in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions. In April, U.S. airlines were prohibited by the FAA from flying in airspace surrounding Crimea, but Thursday's crash site was not within what was considered restricted area. The International Civil Aviation Organization and European Aviation Safety Agency also issued warnings in the spring against flying in the same area, the Simferopol Flight Information Region. The crash occurred outside the warning area near the town of Torez in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region. ""What I can't understand is why civilian airliners were flying over this area, which is just a huge error on their part,"" said Bob Baer, a CNN national security analyst and former CIA agent. Most airlines follow the guidelines and rules set by their national civil aviation authorities and fly the most direct route from their departure to their arrival city, said Mary Schiavo, former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The FAA and other national civil aviation authorities hadn't yet defined the area where the aircraft got shot down as part of the conflict zone in Ukraine, Schiavo said. ""It wasn't this particular area,"" she said. ""They hadn't defined it as a stay-away area"" even though there was violence in the region. ""No airline will risk the safety of their passengers, crew and aircraft for the sake of fuel savings,"" said Tony Tyler, head of the industry group International Air Transport Association, in a statement. ""Airlines depend on governments and air traffic control authorities to advise which airspace is available for flight, and they plan within those limits."" Many travelers are likely to avoid the major air route between Europe and Southeast Asia, Schiavo said. ""People simply will just avoid that route. I certainly wouldn't fly that route right now."" In light of the crash, airlines around the world are rerouting flights. ""We're taking a wide detour around eastern Ukraine,"" said Lufthansa spokesman Nils Haupt. That detour will be in effect at least through Friday, he said. Lufthansa had four scheduled flights Thursday that would usually cross over eastern Ukraine. ""We are closely watching the situation"" to decide flight plans beyond the next couple days, he said. ""It's a precautionary measure to protect the safety of our passengers."" Did surface-to-air missile take down MH17? Lufthansa said it isn't making any changes to its two daily flights going from Frankfurt, Germany, to Kiev, Ukraine, or its one daily flight from Munich, Germany to Odessa, Ukraine, because they don't cross over that airspace. With only once-a-day service between London's Heathrow Airport and Kiev, British Airways doesn't have any flights in the area of the crash site, according to a representative. ""We are keeping those (Kiev) services under review, but Kiev is several hundred kilometers from the incident site."" A Kiev-bound Emirates flight turned around on Thursday and returned to Dubai ""due to the safety concerns raised with the latest reports on Malaysian flight MH17,"" and suspended all flights to Kiev immediately until further notice, according to a company statement. Other Emirates flights to and from the United States and Europe fly a route outside the area where the crash occurred, the company said. With the exception of flights to Kiev, Air France is no longer flying over Ukraine, the airline said. Air France suspended flights over the area surrounding Crimea in April. American carriers including Delta Air Lines are also avoiding the region. ""Out of an abundance of caution, Delta is not routing flights through Ukrainian airspace and is monitoring the situation involving Malaysia Airlines Flight 17,"" the airline said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Motivational speaker and author Zig Ziglar died Wednesday in Dallas ""after a short bout with pneumonia,"" his spokesman said. He was 86. The self-described ""Undisputed King of Motivation"" was known for his seminars, which grew into large gatherings held in packed arenas. Ziglar wrote more than two dozen books on salesmanship and motivation over five decades. He spread his message of positive attitude, motivation and success through stories punctuated with short quotes that became legendary among his followers, such as: . â€¢ ""Failure is a detour, not a dead-end street."" â€¢ ""Success is the maximum utilization of the ability that you have."" â€¢ ""Of course motivation is not permanent. But then, neither is bathing; but it is something you should do on a regular basis."" After suffering injuries in a fall in 2007, Ziglar continued his tour schedule with fewer events and help from his daughter onstage. He was born Hilary Hinton Ziglar in Coffee County, Alabama. His family moved to Yazoo City, Mississippi, and later to New York City. In his autobiography, Ziglar described a challenging childhood that taught him to connect with people.

"(CNN) -- This time, Paul the Octopus won't be able to predict the winner. In a World Cup already marked by stunning victories and catastrophic defeats, trying to guess the next World Cup champion is pretty much moot. Germany is riding high after annihilating host country Brazil 7-1 in their semifinal, a defeat so brutal that Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff said she'd never imagined such a horror in her worst nightmares. Of course the Germans would love a repeat against Argentina. But if anyone can show grit and then calm under pressure, it's the Argentinians. Their semifinal against the Netherlands came down to a heart-pounding penalty shootout, and Argentina's 4-2 victory cemented the team's first trip to the World Cup final in 24 years. Germans and Argentinians have faced each other in the World Cup finals twice before. Back when West Germany was still a country, it lost to Argentina in 1986. Four years later, Argentina lost to West Germany in 1990. Sadly, unlike the last World Cup in 2010, there is no psychic cephalopod placing its bets on this year's victor. In that tournament, Paul the Octopus correctly predicted the outcome of eight consecutive matches, dooming Germany's hopes when he picked Spain in the semifinal and then also in the final. Paul died in his German aquarium later that year. No matter what happens Sunday, it's unlikely either squad will be as heartbroken as host team Brazil. As if their semifinal demolition by Germany wasn't humiliating enough, the Brazilians didn't score a single goal in their attempt at redemption during Saturday's third-place match. The Dutch finished off the Brazilians, 3-0. Follow the live blog . CNN's James Masters contributed to this report.","Argentina and Germany have met in the World Cup finals twice before .

"(CNN) -- On the wing of an empty airplane, a young boy is practicing his backward-bend. In the cockpit, a crowd have gathered -- taking it in turns to play captain. From an outsider's perspective, Goma International Airport -- once a makeshift arsenal for the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo -- is probably the last place you'd expect to find a makeshift playground. To locals, such dichotomies are typical of the once conflict-ridden region. ""For me this captures the Congo experience,"" says Michael Christopher Brown, a photojournalist who shot the images in 2012. ""On the one hand, this is a place that is often in the news as a very horrific place, because of course, very horrific things have happened there. But there are also beautiful things that happen there,"" he says. Years of war and a volcanic eruption in 2002 -- which saw much of the city and large swaths of the airport overrun with lava -- pretty much shut down any commercial activity at the site. Though Goma Airport essentially fell into disuse, the locals have made use of the leftover volcanic rocks -- from which many constructed their homes -- and the abandoned aircraft that pepper the place. ""While I was there, I saw children going through the planes, collecting parts and hacking at the engines to get the wires. My fixer, Horeb, said these materials were later sold on the street to be used in other products. A hunk of steel can be used in a stove, the wires could be used in other electronics. There, everything is recycled, in a way."" Even adults play make-believe . Outside of serving a utilitarian function, Goma Airport has acted as a kind of Fantasy Island for the locals -- inviting them to dream big even if their means were small. Horeb recalled a friend who had always wanted to be a pilot. ""His parents were too poor and all the schools were expensive, so he could not hold onto that dream,"" Horeb told Brown. When Mount Nyirangongo erupted, Horeb's friend was one of a hundred locals who rushed to move the planes before they got swallowed up by the encroaching lava. Emptied of fuel, food and passengers, the aircraft proved easy to shift. Horeb's friend jumped inside the plane to steer it while the others pushed -- briefly living out the dream he never got to see fulfilled. ""Horeb described the experience as exhilarating for his friend,"" recalls Brown. 'These images are unique' Brown was in Goma when the M23 rebels captured the city from the Congolese government. Though the site was manned by rebels, he says, that never prevented the local children from playing in the debris. ""If no planes were coming in, the troops would allow villagers to move across the runway with water and groceries,"" he recalls. They did not, however, grant him access to the site. When the rebels cleared out of the city, there was a short period when the airport was unmanned before Congolese government forces (FARDC) moved in. Brown took his opportunity. ""Really, these images are unique, because access is so difficult,"" he says. ""I saw this brief window when no one was at the airport. I saw the kids running around inside and decided to try one more time before I was blocked. This time, I was successful."" Since that first visit, a wall has been erected around the airport. ""After that one afternoon, we could not get access again,"" he recalls. ""With the wall there, I'm not sure if the kids are allowed in any more -- I can't see them.""","In 2012, children turned an empty airport in Congo into a makeshift playground .

"(CNN) -- The Mississippi Supreme Court has denied the state attorney general's motion to set an execution date for Michelle Byrom, according to an order filed by the court Thursday afternoon. ""Having duly considered the motion and Byrom's response, the court finds that the Motion to Reset Execution Date is not well taken and should be denied,"" the order reads. Earlier Thursday, the court said Byrom, convicted of a murder to which her son has confessed multiple times, would not be executed Thursday, as the Mississippi Supreme Court continues to review her post-conviction motion. Byrom's motion for the court is still pending, and there is no word on when the court's decision on that particular motion will be made, court spokeswoman Beverly Pettigrew Kraft said. Attorney General Jim Hood had requested the 57-year-old death row inmate be executed ""on or before (the date of) March 27,"" Kraft said. The Mississippi Supreme Court has the final say on execution dates and they haven't yet issued a decision on the attorney general's request. During Michelle Byrom's original trial, prosecutors said she plotted to kill her husband, Edward Byrom Sr. He was fatally shot in his home in Iuka, Mississippi, in 1999 while Michelle was in the hospital receiving treatment for double pneumonia, but a jury convicted her based on evidence and testimony, saying she was the mastermind. Byrom Jr. admitted in jailhouse letters that he committed the murder on his own after growing tired of his father's physical and verbal abuse, and a court-appointed psychologist has said that Byrom Jr. gave him a similar story. On the stand, Byrom Jr. pinned the murder on one of his friends, whom he said his mother hired for $15,000. Following her attorney's advice, Michelle Byrom waived her right to a jury sentencing, allowing the judge to decide her fate. He sentenced her to death. Michelle Byrom's attorney has now filed a motion asking the court for additional discovery so the confession to the court-appointed psychologist can be fully explored. Additionally, attorneys want to depose the prosecutor from her trial, Arch Bullard, regarding his knowledge of Byrom Jr.'s confession to the psychologist. Bullard has told CNN that he firmly believes Michelle Byrom was the mastermind of the murder-for-hire plot. According to those familiar with the process, the Supreme Court typically issues opinions at 1:30 p.m. on Thursdays. The nine-member court could issue a decision regarding the Byrom case Thursday, but there is no requirement on the timeline for the decision.","NEW: State's high court denies motion to set execution date for 57-year-old .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Several Israeli Jewish suspects were arrested Sunday in connection with the killing of a Palestinian teen, Israeli police said. ""Investigation continuing, strong indication a nationalistic incident, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld tweeted about the death of Mohammed Abu Khedair. Rosenfeld told CNN that those arrested were Israeli Jews. Rosenfeld also tweeted Sunday that police have arrested a ""taxi driver from the north who admitted killing the girl Sheli Dadon in Migdal Haemek recently. Background nationalistic."" The 19-year-old Jewish girl was killed last month. The suspect is an Arab resident of the Galilee, the Jerusalem Post reported. Mohammed Abu Khedair's death came after the bodies of three Israeli Jewish teens were found in the West Bank. Israeli and Palestinian officials quickly suspected it was a revenge killing and condemned any such actions. The Palestinian teen's mother said she wants equal justice for her son's killers. 'If they sentence them and demolish their houses and give them life sentences, it might satisfy me a little,"" Suha Abu Khedair said. The Israeli military destroyed the homes of the two suspects in the killings of the three Israeli teens. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday sent his condolences to the family, Israel's Channel 2 reported. ""I also promise that we will exploit the full extent of the law with the perpetrators of this horrendous crime worthy of condemnation and denunciation,"" he said, according to Channel 2, a CNN affiliate. ""These kind of murderers do not belong in the Israeli society."" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas handed a letter to Robert Serry, U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, asking for an investigation into recent crimes against Palestinian people, Palestinian state news agency WAFA reported. Mohammed Abu Khedair, 16, died from being burned alive and hit on the head with a blunt object, according to Palestinian General Prosecutor Mohammed al-Auwewy, citing a medical autopsy. Al-Auwewy said the autopsy discovered traces of smoke inside the lungs of the 16-year-old, indicating it was inhaled while the fire was burning. The teenager was heading from his home to a mosque in the middle-class neighborhood of Shuafat in East Jerusalem for prayers around 4 a.m. when three men forced him into a car and drove off, his father, Hussain Abu Khedair, told CNN. The boy's body was found about an hour later at a forest in Jerusalem. He was buried on Friday. Meanwhile, on Sunday, Israel Defense Forces said it prevented an attack by targeting terrorists involved in rocket launching in Gaza. At least 25 rockets fired from Gaza hit Israel in the past day, IDF said. ""This reality is unbearable and unacceptable. We will continue to act in order to debilitate and incapacitate the Hamas terror infrastructure, striking its warehouses, rocket manufacturing capabilities and those that endanger the well-being of the Israelis in the south of the country,"" IDF spokesman Lt. Col Peter Lerner said in a statement. At least eight Palestinian militants were killed in over 10 Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip overnight, Hamas security sources told CNN. They said four militants were injured. Cousin released from detention . Khedair's American cousin was given house arrest by a court in Jerusalem on Sunday after an incident in which his family says he was beaten by Israeli security forces. Tariq Khdeir was detained at a protest following the death of his cousin. A 15-year-old high school sophomore from Florida, he said he was standing around, watching protesters last week when he was accosted. ""I was attacked by police. I woke up in the hospital,"" Khdeir said as he walked out of court in Jerusalem on Sunday. It's unclear why the teen is being investigated or what possible charges he might face. The teen, who had bruising around his eyes, paid bail and was driven away with his parents to serve his house arrest in the Beit Hanina neighborhood in Jerusalem. ""They (his attackers) came from the side of me, and I tried to run away,"" he said, adding he felt much better Sunday. He will be kept under house detention for nine days, lawyer Ziad Haidimi said after a court session. If the investigation ends without charges, he can travel back to the United States, Haidimi said. His mother, Suha Abu Khdeir, said the family ""definitely"" will sue Israeli authorities. ""I'm not really happy"" with the court's decision, she said. The teen's aunt said he was scared, lost and confused. ""You just wish you could have pulled him out of that situation as soon as you could,"" Sanah Abukhdeir told CNN. ""Tariq doesn't understand anything that's going on as far as war. He hasn't been in any type of war zone before, so all of this is really scary for him,"" she said. An official from the U.S. Consulate General was at Khdeir's hearing Sunday. ""We will continue to monitor the situation closely,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. ""We are calling for a speedy, transparent and credible investigation and full accountability for the apparent excessive use of force."" Israel's ambassador to the United States told ""Fox News Sunday"" there will be justice and that excessive use of force is unacceptable. ""I will tell you, from what I understand about the facts of the case, this is not just an innocent bystander who was pulled off of a schoolyard,"" Ron Dermer said Sunday. ""He was with six other people. They were masked. They threw petrol bombs and Molotov cocktails at our police. Three of them had knives, from what I understand. ""That does not excuse any excessive use of force and our Justice Ministry is opening an investigation."" According to his family, Tariq was among the Palestinians protesting in the Shuafat neighborhood over his cousin's killing. But he wasn't involved in the clashes, they say. His relatives say he is the young man who appears in two separate videos being held down and beaten by men wearing the uniform of Israeli security forces. His father, Salah Eddeine Abu Khdeir, said Saturday that his son didn't throw rocks at police. Netanyahu on Sunday said the other side must help calm tensions. ""I call on the leaders of the Arab public to show responsibility and come out against the disturbances in order to restore quiet,"" he said. Kareem Khadder and Ben Wedeman reported from Jerusalem; Steve Almasy reported from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Though still in critical-but-stable condition, Tracy Morgan is continuing to show signs of improvement, his publicist said Thursday. ""Today was a better day,"" Lewis Kay said, adding that Morgan's medical team remains optimistic that his recovery is progressing. The actor-comedian was seriously injured early Saturday after a Walmart truck slammed into the limo car occupied by Morgan and four others on the New Jersey Turnpike. The collision killed comedian James McNair and injured the others. Morgan was hospitalized with broken ribs, a broken nose, a broken femur, and a broken leg. Passengers Ardie Fuqua, Jeffrey Millea and Harris Stanton also were injured in the crash; Stanton is the only person since released from the hospital. The truck driver, Kevin Roper, turned himself in to police the night of the crash. Roper pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges that include vehicular homicide and assault by auto. In a criminal complaint, police said Roper has been awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the crash. Morgan is likely to remain in the hospital for the next several weeks, Kay said. Morgan was a regular on ""Saturday Night Live"" for seven years and later received an Emmy nomination for his role in the comedy series ""30 Rock.""

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, dogged by widespread speculation about his health, appeared chipper and energetic in a television appearance over the weekend. ""What a lovely breeze, what lovely weather,"" Chavez said Saturday as he opened a meeting with a delegation from Belarus several weeks before President Alexander Lukashenko's scheduled visit to the South American nation. State-run VTV showed Chavez walking down a long hall with the Belarusian delegation before delivering a speech on the front steps of the palace. For Chavez, a year of health struggles . Facing a row of cameras, the Venezuelan president spoke effusively about his Bolivarian revolution, football, friends and the weather. Live television appearances have long been common for the Venezuelan president, but have dwindled in recent months as he undergoes cancer treatment. On Tuesday, the Venezuelan president spoke for several hours, making no mention of his health, during a cabinet meeting that was broadcast live, . Eleven months after Chavez first announced his cancer diagnosis, Venezuelan officials have released few details about his treatment. Neither Chavez nor anyone in his government have publicly discussed what kind of cancer he has or provided a detailed prognosis for the 57-year-old leader. In May, Chavez said he had successfully completed his latest cycle of radiation therapy. ""This week I have been holed up, working, rigorously following the doctor's orders to recuperate as soon as possible from the effects of the radiation therapy. And I am recuperating gradually,"" he said in a May 18 telephone interview with VTV. But speculation has continued to swirl about the president's political future, and for months many have turned to media accounts for information on Chavez's health. Last week, a report from veteran U.S. television journalist Dan Rather described Chavez's health situation as ""dire,"" citing an unidentified source's assessment that the Venezuelan president may not see the final results of the October elections due to the progression of his cancer. ""This reporter has been told that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma, an aggressive cancer that has 'entered the end stage,'"" Rather said on the website for his HDNet show ""Dan Rather Reports."" Rather, a longtime CBS News anchor and ""60 Minutes"" correspondent, said the information came from a ""highly respected source close to Chavez and who is in a position to know his medical condition and history."" However, Rather said that ""there is only one source for identifying the cancer and the prognosis quoted in the first part of the story."" He did not disclose the source of his report, which has not been confirmed by CNN. The report -- which also referred to Chavez as a ""dictator"" -- drew swift ire from the Venezuelan government. The next day, the nation's information ministry distributed an editorial from close Chavez ally Eva Golinger titled, ""Shame on You, Dan Rather."" ""Dan Rather has always emphasized the necessity of 'courage' in reporting, yet he shows cowardice and sloppy ambition by racing to publish unconfirmed reports on President Chavez's health, and by touting slanderous epithets to describe the Venezuelan head of state,"" Golinger wrote. Golinger said Chavez was ""a far cry from being on his 'death bed,' as Rather implies."" ""Chavez has cancer, and he is fighting it hard, with the same strength he has used to propel his nation forward, often against the toughest obstacles,"" she wrote. Chavez, who has ruled oil-rich Venezuela since 1999, is a controversial figure with outspoken, antagonistic views toward the United States. His pro-Cuban, socialist policies are also controversial domestically and have increasingly polarized the nation and national media, according to the Atlanta-based Carter Center, which provided election monitors in the nation's 2006 presidential elections. Recent polls have offered different assessments of how Chavez's health could impact Venezuelan voters when they cast their ballots on October 7. According to the Datanalisis polling firm, Chavez's popularity stood at about 49% last year. The pro-government GIS XXI reports that 86% of the population admires how he has handled his illness and 45.7% said Chavez's health hadn't affected the national political situation. CNN affiliate Globovision TV reported that polling firm Varianzas, which claims to be independent and has no international affiliation, puts Chavez at a 51.3% percent lead in the latest polls ahead of his opponent, Henrique Capriles Radonski, who registered a 46.5%. Varianzas President Rafael Delgado told reporters in May that the October presidential elections will be very close, and trends could quickly change depending on campaigning styles and economic trends.","""What a lovely breeze, what lovely weather,"" a cheerful Chavez says .

"(CNN) -- Early this year, Michael Sam made news by announcing he is gay. On Saturday, he made history as the first openly gay player to be drafted by a National Football League team. Seconds later, he made waves kissing his boyfriend in celebration as cameras looked on. Now, Sam has one goal in mind -- to make the St. Louis Rams' roster. ""I'm determined to be great,"" he told reporters Tuesday in St. Louis. ""So I'm going to train hard and try to make the team."" As a selection in the seventh and last round in the NFL draft, Sam playing for the Rams or any other NFL team this upcoming season is hardly a lock. And with standouts like Chris Long and Kendall Langford, the fact that St. Louis boasts one of the league's best defensive lines -- the place where Sam starred at the University of Missouri -- makes his task even harder. That challenge isn't lost on Sam, who some experts thought might not fit in the NFL not because of his sexual orientation but because they characterized him as a ""tweener"" -- too small to play on the defensive line, too slow to be a linebacker. Still, he sees the chance to learn from his Rams coaches and teammates things that can help improve his game. And he seemed careful Tuesday not to get too far ahead of himself, expressing thanks for being given ""the opportunity to play"" but professing no certainty that he will be on the sidelines come opening day. ""I still (don't) really feel like I'm part of the NFL right now,"" Sam said of the whirlwind of the past three days. ""I'm blessed, really."" Obama congratulates Michael Sam . The company around him during his first media availability Tuesday showed that he's not the only prospective football player living a dream. Other late-round selections for the Rams joined him in fielding questions. And each had their own one-of-a-kind stories -- like Demetrius Rhaney, who lost his grandmother and great-grandmother on the same day a few years after his mother died, or Maurice Alexander's having worked at St. Louis' Edward Jones Dome to pay for college. Yet the fact that Sam was the only player at the podium a few minutes later speaks to the fact that he was extraordinary, even among NFL draftees. Not every would-be pro wins ESPN's Arthur Ashe Courage Award, gets a phone call from President Barack Obama after getting drafted, or ranks second in jersey sales among rookies, after all. Sam has recently tasted the flip side of stardom as well -- as a number of people, among them current and former NFL players, took to Twitter to rip ESPN for airing footage of him kissing his boyfriend, Vito Cammisano, right after he got the call from the Rams. Reactions heat up after Sam kisses boyfriend on TV . Sam noted that he'd never experienced all this attention as an openly gay player at Mizzou because, while he confided his sexuality to coaches and teammates before the 2013 season, he didn't announce anything publicly until February. Now that he's out, he said any jabs about his sexuality would fuel him on the gridiron. ""Thank God for you guys,"" Sam said, referring to the media, ""because it's just going to make me even a better player than I am now."" Kevin Demoff, the St. Louis Rams chief operating officer, said the organization discussed the ramifications of picking a man who could become the NFL's first openly gay player. ""If you're going to take a leadership position by drafting Michael, then I think you have to expect both the good and the bad,"" Demoff said of the public reaction. ""We're prepared for it, and I think we'll shine through it."" Rams General Manager Les Snead acknowledged Sam's selection is historic, comparing it to Kenny Washington's becoming the league's first black player, in 1946. Moments later, though, head coach Jeff Fisher stressed that the team did what it did based on what Sam could do for the Rams on the field. ""Michael's value as a football player was off the charts,"" Fisher said. ""So we drafted Michael as a football player. And he has an opportunity now to compete to try to make our football team."" Opinion: Just a kiss, and more than a kiss .","Sam is the first openly gay player to be picked by, and possibly play for, an NFL team .

"(CNN) -- It has appeared repeatedly on Venezuelan state television, government ads, and the even the president's Twitter account. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has a new populist slogan. Chavez, who recently admitted he is battling cancer, is no longer using the slogan that defined his first decade in power: ""patria, socialismo o muerte"" (motherland, socialism, or death). He has now changed it for one that is markedly more optimistic. Since he returned from Cuba earlier this month after undergoing cancer treatment that included a surgery, Chavez has been using the slogan ""viviremos y venceremos"" -- we will live and we will come out victorious. The 56-year-old socialist leader has also been noticeably more focused on topics that center on life rather than revolution and socialism. Earlier this week he attended Mass at a Caracas military academy and took Holy Communion while his supporters prayed for his health. Thursday morning, Chavez wrote on his twitter account, @chavezcandanga, ""Good morning, happy World! Good morning, to Living! I sing to you from my barracks. I play the trumpet and start my battle. We will live and we will come out victorious!!!"" In a phone interview aired by the Venezuelan state channel VTV Wednesday, Chavez revealed to the audience that the tumor found in his pelvic area was ""the size of a baseball."" He also said that the second phase of his treatment includes ""an organ by organ evaluation"" and that he may need radiation or chemotherapy later on. Chavez spent almost a month in Cuba for the initial phase of his cancer treatment, which included surgery. The opposition repeatedly called for Chavez to name a temporary head of government in his absence. Now that he's back, Chavez says he's under 24-hour medical supervision, but made it clear that he's still calling the shots. ""I am in my barracks, but still commanding,"" he said.","Hugo Chavez is using a new slogan that focuses on life .

"(CNN) -- Australia said Wednesday that it has chosen a Dutch company to carry out the next phase of the underwater search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which mysteriously disappeared five months ago this week. Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss announced at a news conference that Fugro Survey will use two vessels for the search in the southern Indian Ocean, where the Malaysian plane is believed to have gone down after it flew off course and dropped off radar. The two ships will be equipped with towed deep-water vehicles and will also use side-scan sonar, multi-beam echo sounders and video cameras in the search, Australian authorities said. Fugro, which has operations in the Western Australian city of Perth, is engaged as a single, private contractor to search for the missing plane -- and if it successfully locates it, to positively identify and map the wreckage. The operation, which is expected to begin in September and last as long as a year, will slowly scan some 60,000 square kilometers (23,000 square miles) of the ocean floor, looking for any sign of aircraft debris. 'No simple answer' It's not yet clear exactly how the deep sea search will play out. While the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is overseeing the underwater search at Malaysia's request, has developed the overall strategy, the independent contractor will be responsible for day-to-day operations in the search zone. ""We are still ... working out the details of the techniques to be used, which will vary depending on the topography of the ocean floor,"" ATSB Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan said Wednesday. ""So there's a range of possibilities. We haven't gotten the full detail of our search plan because we have to do that on a collaborative basis with Fugro. So there's no simple answer."" Australia now estimates a yearlong underwater search will cost $48 million. According to Truss, the amount of money Malaysia will contribute to the next phase is yet to be agreed. He said he expects to discuss that with his Malaysian counterpart later this month. When asked if China, which had the greatest number of passengers on board the flight, would contribute financially to the next phase, Truss said Beijing hasn't ""indicated an intention to assist in that way."" Mapping the ocean floor . Some 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) off the coast of Western Australia, a pair of survey ships continue their efforts to give search teams a better understanding of what lies thousands of meters below the surface in one of the most uncharted, remote places on the planet. The Chinese Navy's Zhu Kezhen and the Australian-contracted Fugro Equator have covered roughly 60% of the priority search area, which the ATSB says is the most likely resting place of MH370. A Malaysian survey ship is on schedule to join them this month, and underwater mapping is expected to wrap up in September. According to the ATSB, the data collected by survey ships is being converted into detailed topographical maps. So far, it says, those maps show ocean depths ranging from 1,500 meters to nearly 5,000 meters (roughly one to three miles), and wide-ranging terrain that includes everything from flat, sloping surfaces, to rugged terrain like mountains, ridges and cliffs. David Gallo, an oceanographer and director of special projects at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was involved in the search for Air France Flight 447, said that a high level of detail is critical to make sure the search is carried out effectively and safely. ""You have to know where you're going or you'll end up impacting the bottom,"" he said. ""We're looking at less than a handful of tools that can work in this depth and that are available, so you really don't want to risk anything."" One of the most challenging spots, Gallo pointed out, is at the southern end of the search area, where he expects to see pockets of terrain up to 7,000 meters deep (four miles). ""The south side of that Broken Ridge is a monstrous wall... almost two miles top to bottom, almost vertical,"" Gallo explains, adding that there are only a few pieces of equipment worldwide that would even have a chance of reaching such extreme depths. A slow, painstaking search . According to ATSB tender documents, Fugro is required to begin the search no later than one month after signing the contract, and will be required to search all 60,000 square kilometers within 300 days. The towed side-scan sonar devices will each be attached to one of two ships, the Fugro Equator and Fugro Discovery, with a cable, and will be capable of transmitting some data to the surface in real time. According to the ATSB's Dolan, that data will be analyzed by experts on the survey ships and on shore in Australia. Woods Hole's Gallo said each type of search system has its strengths and weaknesses, noting that towed systems work well on flat terrain and cover ground quicker. In more rugged areas, a drone which hugs the bottom will likely do a better job, albeit at a slower pace of around 65 square kilometers (25 square miles) a day. For the most extreme terrain, Gallo said, search teams may need a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), steered from a surface ship with a tether. Malaysia has already partnered with American and Australian contractors to supply additional search equipment, including a towed side-scan sonar and ROV. It's not yet clear how these will be integrated into the larger, Australian-run operation. Where to start? Where the search teams begin their work will depend on what the underwater maps show. ""If there's a chunk of fairly smooth terrain and fairly shallow, you could get a lot of ground covered early on, which raises spirits a little bit,"" Gallo said. But there's a lot of ground to cover. The area search teams hope to tackle over the next year is four times the size of the search zone for Air France 447, which went down in the mid-Atlantic in June 2009. And with a greater area to search, and multiple search assets involved, the operation becomes far more complex. ""The worst thing that we could do is have a ship show up with technology, have them go over the spot...and you write that spot off forever,"" Gallo said. But he added that he is completely confident in the ATSB's ability to manage the overall operation, saying that if the wreckage of MH370 is in the designated search zone, it will be found. Are they looking in the right place? There is far less confidence about whether search teams are looking in the right spot. The search for MH370 continues to focus along the seventh arc, the so-called ""partial handshake,"" which experts believe was the last signal sent between the Malaysia Airlines plane and a communications satellite operated by Inmarsat. ""What I'm a little concerned about... is that there still seems to be some confusion about Inmarsat data and how it's being interpreted,"" said David Soucie, a former safety inspector at the U.S Federal Aviation Administration and author of ""Why Planes Crash."" In late June, the ATSB announced it was moving the priority search area several hundred kilometers southwest, the second major shift of the search zone along the arc. That move was based on analysis of the satellite data and a review of aircraft performance limits, including speed and altitude, by an international group of experts. That analysis also made a series of assumptions, ""in order to define a search area of practical size,"" the ATSB's June report said, including that the plane was flying on autopilot for a long period of time until it eventually ran out of fuel and crashed. Not making that assumption, the report said, ""would result in an impractically large search area."" No guarantees . The ATSB has said that the Inmarsat data will continue to be reviewed during the next phase of the search, acknowledging that there is still a chance the hunt may be extended outside the 60,000 square kilometers designated as the priority area. ""The haystack is a big chunk of terrain in the Indian Ocean,"" Gallo of Woods Hole said. ""And even though the haystack is huge there's no guarantee that the needle is in that haystack."" Soucie agreed, however, he adds the ATSB is going about the search in a smart way: ""Am I confident they will find the airplane in that area? No. But if it were my search, I would be doing exactly what they're doing."" Despite a potentially vast search zone, Dolan said late last week that he's cautiously optimistic that search teams will find the missing plane. ""We're doing this, in a large part, because we want to give some certainty to those who are grieving the loss of their loved ones,"" he said. ""And we're fully committed to doing that."" MH370 departed Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early on the morning of March 8 carrying 239 passengers and crew members. On March 24, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that the flight had ended in the southern Indian Ocean. To date, no trace of the plane has been found.

"(CNN) -- The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, better known as MERS, may be an airborne virus, according to an observation paper published Tuesday in the journal mBio. There have been 836 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS infection since its first appearance in 2012, according to the latest numbers provided by the World Health Organization. At least 288 related deaths have officially been reported to the WHO. Scientists are still trying to figure out how the deadly virus is transmitted. Saudi Arabia reports big jump in MERS cases . Researchers from King Fahd Medical Research Center in Saudi Arabia collected three air samples from a camel barn. Previously, they had found MERS in a camel from that barn and in its infected owner, who later died from the condition. After analyzing the air sample, the scientists found one strain of MERS RNA, the viral genome. Interestingly, the barn air tested positive for MERS on the exact same day that one of the nine camels in the barn tested positive for MERS. Also, the virus from the air sample was identical to the virus found in nasal samples from the infected camel and its owner. ""These data show evidence for the presence of the airborne MERS in the same barn that was owned by the patient and sheltered the infected camels,"" the study authors write. But does that mean MERS is easily transmitted through the air? ""What they say is that virus particles can be airborne, but it's premature to conclude that MERS is transmitted through aerosols,"" said Dr. Mark Denison, a professor of pathology, microbiology and immunology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. The key point is the difference between dead virus particles and a viable virus. ""I could take billions of particles of dead viruses and could still find the RNA. That doesn't mean that there are infectious aerosols,"" Denison said. Kevin Olival, a senior research scientist at EcoHealth Alliance, agrees on that distinction. ""We know that MERS is found in nasal secretion of camels, so virus particles being spread out in a barn is not a surprise,"" he said. ""Whether or not you can get infected, and if it's a cause for concern, is still an open question."" However, previous studies have suggested that there must be a way MERS is shed into the environment. Several reports in the past have shown MERS infection of those in close contact with infected patients. The exact pathways of infections are unclear. ""Do we still need to consider the possibility of airborne transmission? Yes, of course,"" Denison said. But in order to fully understand whether airborne transmission plays a role in MERS, further research is needed, Denison and Olival conclude. Illinois man didn't have MERS, CDC says .","There have been 836 confirmed cases of MERS infection .

"(AOL Autos) -- Regardless of whether you're talking politics or automotive technologies, the voting and driving public often gravitates to what's new and fresh. Compared to otherwise comparable non-hybrid models, hybrids cost anywhere from $1750-$15,000 more. This herd mentality suggests that there's hope in what's new simply because it's new. Focusing on automotive technology, the green trend AOL Autos identified at the recent 2009 Detroit Auto Show seems to be pushing buyers into two camps: diesel or hybrid. But we'll let you in on a secret: The traditional four-stroke internal combustion engine isn't dead, nor is it irrelevant to the green movement. Not by a long shot. So let's assume you're interested in driving green. By this we mean you want a fuel-efficient vehicle that reduces your carbon footprint. Today, the celebrities of the green movement are diesel- and hybrid-powered vehicles. Here's a quick review of these different technologies. The defining characteristic of the diesel engine is its compression ignition cycle; this means that the engine uses ultra-high compression ratios in the combustion chamber to ignite the fuel-air charge (gasoline-burning internal combustion engines use spark plugs to fire up). The defining characteristic of a hybrid is that these vehicles use a combination of electric motors and internal combustion engines (working in tandem) to propel the vehicle. Now that we've quickly defined diesel and hybrid, let's take a look at what you need to consider to make a smart choice between these technologies, or not (don't worry, we'll explain). Clean diesel technology . With the advent of high-pressure direct fuel injection and special exhaust emissions systems, modern automotive diesel engines bare little resemblance to their stinky, smoke-belching forefathers. And unlike the truly dreadful diesel engines perpetrated on trusting American drivers by Oldsmobile from 1978-85, today's diesels are reliable. Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Chrysler are adding clean diesel engines to their light trucks in 2010, but there are several cars and crossovers available this year that prove that diesel engines are viable for today's American driver. AOL Autos: Most fuel-efficient crossovers . The Volkswagen Jetta TDI was recently awarded ""Green Car of The Year."" Past award winners have been hybrids, but the Jetta's clean exhaust and exceptional real-world fuel economy (30 mpg city, 41 highway) won over the judges. While the mileage matters, the Jetta TDI's pleasant driving demeanor is what will win buyers. Powerful torque is a characteristic of diesel engines. Even though the Jetta's turbo diesel displaces only 2.0-liters (about 128 cubic inches), with 236 lb-ft of torque, the Jetta accelerates as if it's powered by a large gasoline V-6 engine. Thanks to this feeling of power, the $23,000 Jetta TDI shapes up to be an excellent choice for drivers looking for more economy than a gasoline-powered Jetta can deliver (21 mpg city/31 mpg highway). Torque is the overriding trait that defines the diesel driving experience. Torque is the actual power generated by an engine or motor, and in a vehicle, you feel it most when accelerating from a dead stop. Lots of torque pins you back in your seat. A little torque makes you wish you were driving something faster. We recently tested a 2010 Audi Q7 3.0-liter with a turbo diesel and enjoyed the crossover's quick throttle response and ever present thrust. Our real-world economy over hundreds of miles was nearly 30 mpg in this luxurious, 5500-pound, seven passenger crossover. The Q7, just like the smaller Jetta TDI, demonstrated another diesel hallmark: efficiency (mpg) at highway speeds. The same holds true for the Jeep Grand Cherokee diesel and the vehicles it shares its 3.0-liter V-6 with, the Mercedes R-Class and E-Class diesels. The downside of diesel . Unfortunately, diesel engines are more costly to produce than most gasoline engines, so there is a higher up-front cost when you buy or lease. The added cost varies by make and model, but expect to pay $1000-$5000 more for a comparably equipped diesel versus gasoline powered car or truck. Another consideration: diesel fuel is more expensive than gasoline. According to Dan Larson, an oil industry consultant with 18 years experience, the new ultra low-sulfur fuel that makes clean diesel technology possible required a huge investment by refiners, and this cost is being passed to consumers. Worldwide demand for diesel fuel is also up, putting further upward pressure on pricing compared to gasoline (Europe ships diesel to the U.S. at bargain prices). Taxes add to the price differential between gasoline and diesel, and Larson estimates the difference is another six cents to diesel's cost-per-gallon disadvantage. Unfortunately, diesel fuel's higher cost typically erases most cost saving from its better fuel economy . Say hi to more hybrids . Recently, automakers have rolled out hybrids in great supply. Honda introduced their 2010 Insight hybrid. Toyota also recently launched their new 2010 Prius, as well as a new hybrid Lexus, the 250h. BMW also has new production hybrids, including a new mild-hybrid powertrain for their full-size 7-Series. Back in November, Ford took the wraps off their 2010 Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrids, while Hyundai showed the hybrid powertrain for their 2012 Sonata. AOL Autos: Twenty cars of the future . Obviously, hybrids are hot. Why? It's their economy. Because there are several different categories of hybrid powertrains, we'll generalize the group's benefit: hybrids use battery-powered electric motors to reduce the energy required from their vehicle's internal combustion engine. This saves fuel. Most hybrids can operate on only electric power for short distances at city-driving speeds. This attribute generates high city-mileage ratings. For example, the 2010 Prius is rated at 50 mpg city, 48 mpg highway. Likewise, the 2009 Ford Escape Hybrid SUV racks up 34 mpg city, but only 31 mpg on the highway. Clearly, hybrid vehicles tend to benefit those who frequent lower-speed urban areas rather than long-distance interstate trips. AOL Autos: Can I save money by going 87? The lows of hybrids . Unlike diesel-powered vehicles, the highest-mileage hybrids tend to be a bit lackadaisical in regards to acceleration. Some also exhibit odd driving behaviors. For example, the brakes on some hybrids feel unusual because when the brake pedal is pressed, traditional brakes aren't actually slowing the car, a regenerative motor is (recapturing the vehicle's kinetic energy, turning it into electricity to store in on-board batteries). Hybrids also use electrically-driven power steering. These steering systems often have a less direct feeling that's closer to a video game than a sports car. These dynamic differences mean that hybrids can feel odd to drive compared to a more traditional vehicle, plus they highlight the complexity that is systemic with hybrid vehicles. The special sub-systems, components, integration, and programming necessary to make hybrids run are nothing short of rocket science. Of course, cost comes with this complexity. Compared to otherwise comparable non-hybrid models, hybrids cost anywhere from $1750-$15,000 more. You'll want to consider these dollars before you decide whether driving a hybrid makes any sense. AOL Autos: Cheap hybrids . What engine technology will drive us in 2014? Diesel engines and hybrid powertrains will continue to offer high-mileage solutions for those willing to pay the required premium. Many manufacturers, such as Volkswagen, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz see potential for diesel-powered vehicles. Audi specifically expects the diesel Q7 to account for about 15 percent of Q7 sales this year. Other manufacturers, such as Honda and Toyota, are taking a wait-and-see attitude toward diesels. These companies sell diesel-powered cars in Europe, and could bring those engines here easily. Until the cost of diesel fuel drops to be closer to gasoline, company representatives told AOL that they are content to focus on hybrids and maximizing the efficiency of their traditional engines. What about a normal engine? This may come as a surprise, but traditional internal combustion engines represent a solid green choice based on their improving fuel economy and comparatively low cost. ""Technologies such as dual variable valve timing, reduced pumping losses, and improved engine control systems will be where mileage improvements in internal combustion engines come from,"" Toyota's Dan Yerace, a senior powertrain engineer, said. ""Also, the trend toward more forward gears in transmissions will contribute to mileage gains."" What this means is that a variety of technical improvements will make gasoline engines more efficient. Additionally, by adding more gears to automatic transmissions (including overdrive ratios), engines can run more slowly at any given speed, thus saving even more fuel. AOL Autos: How you can get 100 MPG . According to Volkswagen's Group Powertrain Engineer Wolfgang Hatz, internal combustion engines will continue to improve. Hatz estimates that the fuel economy of gasoline engines will improve 15-perent in the coming years. This is a figure confirmed by engineers from other manufacturers. Both Ford Motor Company and General Motors are already introducing gasoline engines with a new type of fuel injection that enhances fuel economy. Their engines utilize direct injection that helps boost mpg up to 20 percent. The plain truth . Evidence points to a technology battle that's broader than diesel versus hybrid. According to Nicholas Prague, an auto industry insider from JustAnswer.com, diesels and hybrids will certainly become more prevalent, but it won't be the tidal wave some are expecting or hoping for. By 2014, he expects hybrids to account for only one in five cars sold in the U.S. Figures provided by J.D. Power & Associates show that these powertrains accounted for less than five percent of sales in 2008. Doing the math, this means that 80-percent of cars and light-duty trucks will remain powered by traditional gasoline engines in 2014 . At most, diesel and hybrid technologies help focus the driving public's attention on efficiency, and that's a good thing regardless of which engine technology is under the hood of your next vehicle. While the tried-and-true internal combustion engine may have fallen out of favor with politicians and the mainstream media, gasoline-fueled engines remain vital to powering America into the future. The good thing is that now you have a choice. Right now you can go out and buy a diesel-, hybrid- or traditional internal combustion-powered vehicle.","Green trend at 2009 Detroit Auto Show pushing buyers into diesel or hybrid .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, back in his home country after five days of medical tests in Cuba, said Thursday that he was cured from the cancer he was diagnosed with this year. ""There are no malignant cells in this body. They don't exist,"" Chavez said during a visit to the state of Tachira, which borders Colombia. He was there to give thanks to Santo Cristo de la Grita, a statue depicting Jesus Christ. Just four months ago, Chavez underwent emergency surgery in Cuba after he was found to have cancer. ""In these four months that have passed, we can say that a vital stage has concluded in the treatment of the illness that surprised me,"" Chavez said. The tests he underwent in Cuba in the past days showed that his body had healed from his surgery and that chemotherapy left no toxins in his organs, he said. Chavez said that the period seemed longer than four months and that during the ordeal, felt more Christian than before. His health registered a perfect score, he said, adding that he will continue to monitor himself. In June, he announced that doctors in Cuba had removed a cancerous tumor from his body. He has not said what type of cancer it was. Chavez has undergone treatments in both Venezuela and Cuba. Last month, the president was in Cuba for what he said was his fourth and possibly final round of chemotherapy. Chavez has pledged to run for re-election next year, dismissing speculation that his illness would force him out of politics.","Venezuelan leader says he has beaten cancer .

"(CNN) -- Back in July 1969, I stood on the talcum-like lunar dust just a few feet from our home away from home, Eagle, the lunar module that transported Neil Armstrong and me to the bleak, crater-pocked moonscape. Standing there and soaking in the view, I called it as I saw it: ""magnificent desolation."" As Neil and I walked upon the surface of the moon at Tranquility Base, we satisfied a vision held by humankind for centuries. And as inscribed on the plaque fastened to the ladder of our lander: ""We Came in Peace for All Mankind."" Sunday will mark the 45th anniversary of the lunar landing, when Neil announced, ""Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."" It was, truly, one small step, but more steps are needed to fuel and assure America's leadership role in deep space exploration. I'm often asked just how lonely it was on the moon. First of all, what got us there was the tireless effort of some 400,000 people who shared a universal dream. Project Apollo was a unified enterprise that relied on teamwork. Second, while we were farther away from terra firma than any humans had ever ventured -- with our colleague Mike Collins circling the moon in the command module above us -- the three of us were connected to home planet Earth. Close to a billion people watched and listened to our journey. In reflecting back on that thrilling, transformative time, several things come to mind. Standing on that harsh, desolate, yet magnificent terrain, stealing precious moments, I looked back at Earth. Everything I knew and loved lay suspended on a far away and fragile blue sphere that was engulfed by the blackness of space. In the back of my mind were Neil's words about a step on the moon. Imagine the great magnificence of humanity going from horse and buggy, to railroads, cars, and airplanes, to rockets -- and now walking on the moon. That is a testimonial to the progress of the creatures here on Earth. I couldn't have imagined anything more desolate -- knowing it hadn't changed in hundreds of thousands of years. You couldn't find any place like that on Earth. The airlessness. Brilliant sunlight illuminated the dust, which was everywhere. And the horizon, visibly curving away in the distance, was so clear because no pollution obscured it. Walking across that landscape was much easier than we had thought it would be. When my boot struck moon dust, it flew away in a straight line, a sign of the lighter gravity load, one-sixth that of Earth. I didn't anticipate, returning to Earth, that America's triumph was viewed as a success for all humankind. People expressed their collective pride by declaring ""We did it!"" -- there was an aura of ownership of the achievement. Although we can revel in taking rear-view mirror looks at the Apollo 11 mission, the urgent need, I believe, is to confront the future. Our space program should not focus on getting back to the moon. We have already blazed that trail. Apollo was part of a clear, get-there-in-a-hurry, space race strategy. To be blunt, that meant we didn't spend time developing re-usability. It's time for commercial and international interests to move, beyond discovery, to development. Other nations, China in particular, are working toward the exploration and development of the moon with robots and, eventually, crews. Providing U.S. support for international lunar development is in our best interest. By participating in a unified, international effort, we avoid an unnecessary race back to the moon and can still participate in lunar science. Other U.S. government entities -- the National Science Foundation and commercial entities -- should take over in moon exploitation and development. It may well be that NASA is not best suited to run this program. Exploitation has never been its strong point. It's true, multiple choices need to be made. We could as a country sit around and do nothing. On the other hand, we could accept the role of space leadership that we carved out for ourselves in the 1960s and 1970s. For America, another destination is calling. America's longer-term goal should be permanent human presence on Mars. The moment to begin could be on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11's touchdown on the moon. We can make a courageous, Kennedyesque commitment to America's future in deep space. The U.S. President could utter these momentous words: ""I believe this nation should commit itself, within two decades, to commencing an America-led, permanent presence on the planet Mars."" We must look to re-establish realistic, but ambitious, longer range and more meaningful exploration goals, and we must issue a call -- with the right guidance and sustained funding -- to a new generation. The next generation of space explorers. Again, the Apollo moon program provided one small step. Other steps lay ahead, strides that take us to the surface of Mars. Catching the summer of supermoons .

"(CNN) -- Nervy, unconvincing and fortuitous -- but Brazil could scarcely care less. On a night where its players finally stepped into the high-pressure cauldron atmosphere of the World Cup on home soil, Brazil found a way to win. Gone are the days of ""FÃºtbol Arte"" or ""Joga Bonito"" -- the beautiful game -- this current generation cannot compete with that of 1970 or 1982. But it does possess its own heroes -- and when Brazil needed him most, Neymar, for so long the face of this World Cup, stepped up and delivered. His two goals, the second a highly controversial penalty awarded in a farcical manner by referee Yuichi Nishimura, ensured Brazil triumphed 3-1 over Croatia in Thursday's opening match. Oscar's stoppage-time strike ensured a party atmosphere in Sao Paulo -- though it did not prevent protesters from assembling outside the stadium immediately after the contest. In a week where politics has overshadowed sport, this was the result the entire country had hoped for and rounded off a day which had begun in worrying fashion. Earlier Thursday, violence erupted in Sao Paulo as police clashed with protesters around 11 kilometers from the stadium. Critics are furious with the Brazilian government for spending $11 billion on the World Cup instead of low-income housing, hospitals and schools. Inside the arena, the country's president Dilma Rousseff was booed by the crowd despite her attempt to keep a low profile. But any frustration at the political problems which have overshadowed the lead-up to the tournament were temporarily placed on hold. As the Brazilian team lined up for the national anthem, those draped in yellow rose to salute not just their heroes -- but their entire homeland. This was not a simple song -- this was a war cry, a call to arms to relieve the pain and struggle of daily life, and the disaster of 1950. Not since that year has Brazil hosted the tournament. For 64 years the nation has waited to exorcize the demons of its darkest day in football. Brazil, needing just a draw to win the tournament, led 1-0 at halftime against Uruguay and appeared destined for greatness. Medals were engraved, newspapers were published at halftime declaring Brazil champion of the world. It was set to be the biggest celebration the country had ever witnessed -- but nobody remembered to tell Uruguay. Juan Alberto Schiaffino equalized to stun the home crowd as the visiting team began to sense fear inside the Maracana Stadium. And then, it happened -- the moment that brought about what would be known as Brazil's ""Hiroshima"" moment. Brazil goalkeeper Moacyr Barbosa allowed an effort from Alcides Ghiggia to roll underneath his body and into the net -- Uruguay was crowned champion. For Barbosa, life would never be the same. Even though he was named goalkeeper of the tournament he was scapegoated and never allowed to forget his error until he passed away in 2000. ""Under Brazilian law the maximum sentence is 30 years,"" Barbosa remarked on his 79th birthday, just two weeks before he passed away. ""But my imprisonment has been for 50 years."" Brazil's players are no strangers to the history of their nation -- the yearning to erase the pain of 1950 has been with each and every generation who have pulled on the famous yellow jersey. So when Marcelo inadvertently diverted the ball into his own net after 11 minutes, you could have forgiven those draped in yellow for looking to the heavens. Croatia, which finished third at the 1998 World Cup, deserved the lead -- though it came in fortuitous circumstances after Nikica Jelavic's miscued effort was turned in by the Real Madrid defender. Buoyed by the goal, Croatia appeared full of confidence and could have had a second when Jelavic peeled away at the far post only to send his header straight at Julio Cesar. Shocked and stunned by conceding, Brazil slowly but surely wrestled its way back into the contest. And in Neymar, the team has a player ready to carry the nation on his shoulders. So much pressure has been placed on the 22-year-old, who endured a difficult first season at Spanish club Barcelona, but this is the moment he has been waiting for. And when his country needed him, he responded. With 29 minutes played, Neymar took advantage of the space in front of him before unleashing a low 25-yard drive which flew into the corner. As the ball hit the back of the net it was as if a pressure valve had been released -- joy unconfined, thousands hugging, dancing, kissing and glancing skywards to offer prayers of gratitude. This was Brazil, resplendent in its yellow and blue, pushing forward. And when it needed it most, it had the luck too. With 20 minutes of normal time remaining, referee Nishimura adjudged that Dejan Lovren had fouled Fred and pointed to the penalty spot. It was a bewildering decision, with television pictures clearly showing that the Brazil striker had fallen over and not been dragged down by Lovren. While the Croatian players raged at the Japanese official, Neymar steadied himself and took the spot kick, only just beating Stipe Pletikosa from 12 yards. ""If that's how we start the World Cup, we'd better give it up now and go home,"" Croatia coach Niko Kovac told reporters after the game. ""We talk about respect, that wasn't respect, Croatia didn't get any. ""If that's a penalty, we don't need to play football anymore. Let's play basketball instead, it's a shame."" With Croatia riled by the injustice, it attempted to respond almost immediately and Ivan Perisic thought he had equalized only to be denied by the referee's whistle. Luka Modric's long-range drive then forced Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar into a scramble as Croatia pushed on in search of the goal to draw it level. But just as Brazil appeared to be hanging on, a moment of magic from its most impressive player on the night, Oscar, ensured victory. A sweeping counter-attack allowed the midfielder to run clear before toe-poking the ball past Pletikosa to secure victory. Brazil will face Mexico in its next game on June 17 in Fortaleza. Mexico begins its Group A campaign against Cameroon on Friday, when there is a repeat of the 2010 World Cup final in Group B with champion Spain taking on Netherlands. Friday's final game sees Chile take on Australia.","Brazil defeats Croatia 3-1 in Thursday's World Cup opener .

"New York (CNN) -- Three defendants pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to conspiring to defraud a Holocaust reparations organization out of $57.3 million, according to court documents. Genrikh Kolontyrskiy, Moysey Kucher and Dora Kucher, all of Brooklyn, helped produce and process some of the thousands of fraudulent applications for the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany that are under investigation. The organization, also known as the Claims Conference, distributes more than $400 million a year from funds provided by the German government to victims of the Holocaust. ""Our efforts to hold to account all of the individuals who participated in defrauding an organization that exists solely for the purpose of aiding victims of Nazi atrocities continues,"" said Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a statement. The defendants aided in defrauding two funds managed by the Claims Conference, the Article 2 Fund and the Hardship Fund, of $45 million and $12.3 million, respectively, according to court documents. The Article 2 Fund makes monthly payments of around $400 to survivors of Nazi persecution who make less than $16,000 per year ""and either lived in hiding or under a false identity for at least 18 months,"" according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's office. The Hardship Fund pays a one-time payment of $3,500 to ""victims of Nazi persecution who evacuated the cities in which they lived and were forced to become refugees."" Kolontyrskiy, 80, knowingly processed fraudulent applications for payment while employed with the Article 2 Fund, according to court documents. Moysey Kucher, 66, and Dora Kucher, 58, recruited individuals to provide identification documents that were used to prepare fraudulent applications for both funds, in exchange for money paid out to the false applicants, according to court documents. Jesse Siegel, Kolontyrskiy's attorney, said his client was by no means a major instigator, but he takes responsibility for his actions. ""He admitted his guilt before the court, and now we hope the judge will put my client's role into context."" Moysey Kucher is extremely remorseful and feels terrible about what happened, according to his attorney, Richard Asche. Dora Kucher's attorney, Benjamin Brafman, says Kucher has accepted responsibility for her conduct, which she deeply regrets . ""We are hopeful that at sentencing, the court will find reason to sentence her with great leniency and compassion."" The three defendants were arrested in 2011 and are among 31 people who have been charged with participating in the scheme. To date, 10 former Claims Conference employees have been charged. ""We are grateful to the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office ... for their diligent work that resulted in the three guilty pleas,"" Claims Conference public relations manager Amy Wexler said in a statement. Kolontyrskiy faces a maximum of 40 years in prison, while Moysey Kucher and Dora Kucher each face a maximum of 20 years in prison. All three defendants are scheduled to be sentenced in August.","Three admit to conspiring to defraud Holocaust reparations group .

"(CNN) -- Ecuador international Christian Benitez, the top scorer in the Mexican league last season, has died suddenly at the age of 27. The striker popularly known as 'Chucho' passed away in the Qatari capital Doha, one day after playing his first game for new side El Jaish. Having played at the 2006 World Cup as a youngster, Benitez had developed into an important component of an Ecuadorian side bidding to reach next year's finals in Brazil. His 24 international goals make him the third highest scorer overall for Ecuador's national team. Jose Chamorro, the player's agent, told an Ecuadorian television station that Benitez had suffered a heart attack and died in hospital, where he had been taken after complaining of abdominal pains. Manchester United star Antonio Valencia, an international colleague of Benitez who played with the striker at leading Ecuadorian side El Nacional a decade ago, was among those struggling to come to terms with the loss. ""This pain (is) very strong my brother but we love you,"" the winger wrote on Twitter, where he also posted several pictures of the diminutive forward. Despite being a footballer who failed to hit the heights in Europe, news of Benitez's death trended on Twitter. Ecuador's interior minister Jose Serrano was among those who took to the micro-blogging site to comment, writing: ""Dear Chucho, thank you for your goals and your happiness."" Sunderland's Craig Gardner, who played with Benitez at Birmingham City between 2009 and 2010, was also moved to comment. ""Can't believe Christian Benitez has died,"" Gardner wrote. ""I had the pleasure to play with him. He was a top bloke. My thoughts go out to his family."" Having only signed Benitez three weeks ago, El Jaish were forced to confirm news of his death on their website. ""The club would like to offer its sincere condolences to the family of the player,"" a club statement said on Monday. ""Benitez had recently joined the club from Club America for three seasons. The player participated for the first time with the team during yesterday's match against Qatar Sports Club in the Sheikh Jassem Cup without complaining of any health problems. ""His sudden departure is a big shock for each member of the technical and administrative staff. He was a player that over the short period he was here was regarded for his high moral character."" The son of former international Ermen Benitez, who is still the top league scorer in Ecuadorian football history, Christian made his name at El Nacional, a club where his father played with great success throughout the 1980's. After leaving the Quito side, who posted a tribute on their website to Christian on Monday, the South American plied his trade with such success for Mexico's Santos Laguna that he alerted the interest of the English Premier League. Joining Birmingham City on loan in 2009, the Ecuadorian made his debut at Manchester United and scored his first goal at Liverpool. Despite a bright start, his impact faded over the season, prompting Birmingham manager Alex McLeish to return Benitez to Santos Laguna in 2010. After leading the scoring charts, he joined rivals America in 2011 and helped the club win this year's Clausura title -- finishing as top scorer along the way. He was still contracted to the club until moving to Qatar this month, but America also paid respects to a key player of recent times. ""Christian will always be present in our hearts and we will never forget you. Rest in peace,"" read the club website. Benitez's last international goal came when in a 4-1 World Cup qualifying win over Paraguay in Quito in March. The Ecuadorians, who failed to qualify for the 2010 finals in South Africa, lie third in South American qualifying, with a quarter of the campaign still left to play. The top four teams in the nine-team group will automatically qualify for the 2014 World Cup. People we've lost in 2013 .","Ecuador international Christian Benitez dies at the age of 27 .

"(CNN) -- Joseph Keenan May's quiet life on the lam in Alaska was unraveled after he used his late stepbrother's name to apply for a driver's license and unemployment benefits, authorities said. May, a former sheriff's deputy wanted since 1991 for capital sexual battery in Bradenton, Florida, was arrested on identity theft charges early Friday at his home in Eagle River, Alaska. ""Sometimes Alaska draws people who want to run away from things,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Bradley told CNN affiliate KTUU. ""We find that there's an inordinate amount of fugitives here. It's unusual for somebody to be able to run so long, but eventually he got caught."" Authorities said May, 60, has been the subject of a federal warrant for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution since 1993. For years, May was living under the identity of stepbrother Michael Camp, who died in his teens in the 1970s in Pennsylvania, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Alaska said in a statement. May is charged in an indictment with two counts of unlawful use of a Social Security number for allegedly using Camp's name and number to apply for an Alaska driver's license in 2009 and unemployment benefits in 2013, the statement said. He was also charged with aggravated identity theft. The Social Security Administration notified federal authorities of the alleged identity theft, KTUU reported. May faces up to 12 years for the federal charges in Alaska -- and potentially the death penalty in Florida if he is extradited, the U.S. Attorney's statement said. A former road patrol deputy, May was arrested in 1990, accused of raping a 6-year-old girl in the 1970s, the Bradenton Herald reported. May fled before he could be tried.

"(CNN) -- Your phone always knows where you are. And now, if you want, your Facebook friends will always know where you are, too. Facebook is introducing a mobile feature called Nearby Friends that taps into that steady stream of location information so friends can track each other in real time. The idea is to make it easy for people to meet up in real life, so they can have conversations in person instead of comment threads, temporarily replacing Likes and LOLs with eye contact and actual laughter. A live meet-up is also an excellent opportunity to grab a selfie with your pal and upload it to the Facebook owned Instagram. In a refreshing change, the new Nearby Friends feature is not turned on by default. Friends will not be able to see where you are unless you decide live-tracking is something you want in your life and visit Facebook's settings to turn it on. Making a potentially invasive new feature opt-in suggests Facebook has perhaps learned from some of its past mistakes and privacy problems. You can choose to share your general location with all your Facebook friends, close friends or a customized list of people you feel most comfortable with. Further minimizing the potential stalking factor, your location is only shared with other people who are also using the feature and who have chosen to share their location with you. When turned on, Nearby Friends shows a list of approved Facebook friends who also use the feature and shows their approximate location. A push notification can tell you how many of your friends are nearby. Open the app to see a list of pals, the neighborhood or city where they are, how many miles away that is from your current location, and a time stamp of when they where there. There is an option to share your exact location with specific friends, which can be handy for coordinating large groups at concerts or finding someone in a crowded area. Your friends will see a little image of your face on a map for a set period of time. Nearby Friends will be available on Facebook's iOS and Android apps, but will only work for select locations at first. Facebook, Instagram and many other apps already include features that let people ""check-in"" to locations, but those location features are different because you decide if and when to share each specific location. You might check into a Starbucks downtown, but never into your home or other spot you'd rather keep private. Nearby Friends is continuously gathering details about where you are in the background instead of waiting for a manual check-in. This is not the first time an app has used location information to physically connect friends. Similar apps such as Highlight, which got a flurry of attention in 2012, mapped out the locations of nearby strangers. Facebook also purchased a startup in 2012 called Glancee that also connected strangers. That technology evolved into this new, more private feature. If you turn on the Nearby Friends feature, Facebook starts collecting data on your exact location and keeps details on where you've been in the past, not just places where you've used its app to check in. It also collects location information even when the Facebook app is closed. But you can turn off this location history in the Facebook app's settings. It's possible to delete individual locations from a history, or clear the whole thing and start from scratch.","Facebook's Nearby Friends feature shares your general location with chosen friends .

"(CNN) -- It is an attacking arsenal to make any soccer side in the world quiver. And European champions Real Madrid wasted little time in underlining its emboldened firepower en route to a 2-0 victory over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup final. In truth, little else was expected of a team that took the field in the Welsh capital Cardiff to reports that at a reputed cost of $612 million, it was the most expensive ever assembled in the sport. The focus was largely on its new recruits, Colombia's World Cup poster boy James Rodriguez, and Toni Kroos, who lifted the trophy in Brazil with Germany. But it was the world footballer of the year Cristiano Ronaldo that shone yet again, even taking the gloss off Gareth Bale, the world's most expensive player who was back in his hometown. Two fine goals from the Portuguese star helped the European Champions League holders ease past its Europa League counterparts in front of a capacity crowd. The first was provided by Bale, a hometown hero who said prior to the clash that Real were gunning to win all six titles on offer to them this season. The second was the result of another fine move, as Ronaldo was released by France striker Karim Benzema, before slamming the ball into the top corner. Real's dominant performance sent out an ominous warning to its domestic and European rivals with the new season poised to burst into life. ""Obviously it'll take a little bit of time for everyone to settle in but I think we played very well tonight,"" Bale told ITV. ""We gelled as a team and we've got a lot of time to improve. ""The most important thing for us tonight was to get the job done, get the trophy and go down in history. ""Everybody comes to Real Madrid to win trophies, we want to play with the best players in the world. We're going out to win every trophy this season."" Successful soccer sides seldom stand still and no-one can accuse Carlo Ancelotti's men of doing that this summer. The Spanish giants, who ended a long wait for their tenth European Champions League crown last season with victory over city rivals Atletico, have bolstered their 'galatico' ranks in typical fashion. A huge amount of buzz has centered on Rodriguez, the 23-year-old who proved a revelation at the World Cup. His six goals helped Colombia to the quarterfinals for the first time in its history, and secured him the golden boot -- awarded to the tournament's top scorer. Rodriguez looked a little ring rusty on his first competitive outing for his new club, a heavy first touch often belying the skill he showed in Brazil, when the ball seemed to be attached to his foot. The star, known the world over by his first name -- pronounced Ha-mes -- did show some silky touches and forced Sevilla goalkeeper Beto into one fine save with a powerful volley. Real's other new recruit looked sharper and more comfortable in his surroundings. Unsurprising, given that Kroos' last outing saw him help Germany to lift the World Cup crown. Signed from Bayern Munich, the 24-year-old controlled the midfield and showed he can by the lynchpin behind a wealth of attacking talent. Real eased into a confident stride early in the match despite most of its stars having only recently returned to training due to their World Cup exertions. Bale, roared on by the Welsh fans inside the stadium, drew a save from Beto after prodding a Rodriguez cross towards goal before Iker Casillas was forced to save a shot from Sevilla midfielder Vitolo. Ronaldo's first effort of menace on the night was smartly saved by Beto, the goalkeeper standing tall to repel his shot after neat work from Benzema. But five minutes later Ronaldo, who scored a record 17 European Champions League goals last season, did find the net as he slid in to fire home from Bale's pinpoint cross. The Portuguese repeated the feat in the fledgling stages of the second half as Benzema released him inside the area, Ronaldo's shot flashing into the corner. Chances came and went as Sevilla tried to fashion a way back into the game, Rodriguez going close before Ronaldo was denied a hat-trick thanks to a vital tackle from Grzegorz Krychowiak. Krychowiak and Diogo Figueiras went close in the dying stages for Sevilla before a fine save from Beto denied Bale the goal he and the large portion of Welsh fans so desperately craved. Real then took that familiar climb up the stairs to accept its first silverware of the season. One down, five to go.","Two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo help Real Madrid claim the UEFA Super Cup title .

"(CNN) -- Henry Cavill hasn't slipped into his ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" cape yet, but this is a start. On Monday, the Internet got its first look at Cavill as Clark Kent in the ""Man of Steel"" sequel courtesy of the Royal Marines Charitable Trust Fund. The U.K.-based organization works with current and retired Royal Marines and their families with a mission of giving them a better way of life, and British actor Cavill is one of the charity's big supporters. In the photo shared by RMCTF, Cavill's seen on the ""Batman v Superman"" set wearing the kind of straitlaced suit and tie that Superman's alter-ego, Clark Kent, would favor. (And since he's standing next to a director's chair bearing the name ""Clark,"" the presumption is that Cavill appears dressed in character as the Daily Planet reporter.) There isn't much else to fill fans in on what director Zack Snyder is cooking up for his 2016 release, but we already know that the movie is filming in some disparate locations: Warner Bros. confirmed in May that production on ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" will take place in Detroit, Michigan, as well as various international locales. In addition to Cavill, ""Batman v Superman"" also stars Ben Affleck as Batman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Jeremy Irons as Alfred and Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. ""Man of Steel"" stars Laurence Fishburne and Amy Adams will reprise their roles of Perry White and Lois Lane, respectively.

"(CNN) -- Outrage over the reported discovery of the bodies of almost 800 children at a former home for unmarried mothers run by nuns in Ireland prompted calls Wednesday for a full investigation. The children whose remains have apparently been found in Tuam, in County Galway, are believed to have died between 1925 and 1961, according to local media reports. The grim discovery was highlighted in a front-page report in the Irish Mail on Sunday, which cited the efforts of local historian Catherine Corless to research the burial sites of 796 children listed as having died at the home, which was run by the Sisters of Bon Secours. According to the newspaper, Corless believes their remains are all buried in the unmarked mass grave next to the place where the home once stood. Local children stumbled upon the grave in the 1970s, local media reported, but the site was never examined afterward. The revelation has sparked calls for an investigation and renewed questions about the treatment of unmarried mothers and their children by the Catholic Church and institutions associated with it. Sgt. Brian Whelan, in the press office of Garda, Ireland's national police, told CNN there was nothing to suggest any impropriety and that police are not investigating the matter. Whelan also disputed media reports that remains were found in a septic tank. The skeletal remains were found in a graveyard in the grounds of the home, he said. Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Charlie Flanagan said in a statement Wednesday that ""active consideration"" is being given to how to address the details that have emerged about the burial of children who died in homes for unmarried mothers. ""Many of the revelations are deeply disturbing and a shocking reminder of a darker past in Ireland when our children were not cherished as they should have been,"" he said. Government departments are working together to establish the best course of action, said Flanagan. 'Tip of the iceberg' Opposition parties Sinn Fein and Fianna Fail urged a comprehensive government inquiry into the matter. ""The news that the remains of some 800 babies were found on convent grounds in Tuam has shocked citizens,"" said party leader Gerry Adams in an online statement Wednesday. ""This case warrants an immediate full public inquiry into the neglect and maltreatment which caused the deaths of these children. ""Unfortunately, this case is really just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the treatment of women and children in mother and baby homes."" Colm Keaveney, a Fianna Fail lawmaker in Galway East, insisted that Ireland's Prime Minister -- or Taoiseach -- Enda Kenny, must take a lead in investigating the reports. ""These shocking revelations about the appalling treatment of hundreds of babies and their mothers must be dealt with by the highest levels in Government,"" he said. ""We need to hear from the Taoiseach today about the Government's plans to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of these children, the dumping of their remains, the treatment of their mothers and the State's role in the activities at this home."" Archbishop: Huge emotional wrench . A petition set up Tuesday on the activist website Avaaz.org calls for a judicial investigation into the circumstances of the children's deaths. More than 8,000 people had signed it as of Thursday morning. The petition, which is addressed to the Irish Minister for Justice and Equality, says, ""We are concerned that evidence suggests that the mortality rate for these children was significantly higher than the national rate of infant mortality at the time. ""And we are shocked at reliable, contemporaneous accounts that the children were malnourished and seemingly uncared-for, when the Irish State was paying the Bon Secours to look after them."" Archbishop Michael Neary, who heads the Tuam archdiocese, welcomed the government's move to examine what happened at the home -- and said it was hard to fathom the suffering of the mothers involved. ""I was greatly shocked, as we all were, to learn of the extent of the numbers of children buried in the graveyard in Tuam,"" he said in a statement. ""I can only begin to imagine the huge emotional wrench which the mothers suffered in giving up their babies for adoption or by witnessing their death."" Despite the length of time elapsed, ""this is a matter of great public concern which ought to be acted upon urgently,"" Neary said. ""It will be a priority for me, in cooperation with the families of the deceased, to seek to obtain a dignified re-interment of the remains of the children in consecrated ground in Tuam."" He said the Church would work with the Bon Secours Sisters and the local community to put up a memorial plaque to the infants who died. Neary said that the diocese has no documents related to the home, since it was not involved in running it, while the Sisters of Bon Secours handed over their archives to local authorities in 1961. He added, ""There exists a clear moral imperative on the Bon Secours Sisters in this case to act upon their responsibilities in the interests of the common good."" Harsh treatment . The Tuam case is the latest high-profile episode in which the state and Catholic Church have been called to account over care of the most vulnerable in Irish society. A government report last year into the so-called Magdalen Laundries, run by various Catholic orders, acknowledged that Ireland's government sent thousands of women and girls to ""harsh and physically demanding"" workhouses, where they worked and lived without pay, sometimes for years. The laundries operated from 1922 to 1996. While some were sent there by courts, others were unmarried mothers, victims of sexual abuse, orphans considered a burden to relatives or the state, or were mentally or physically disabled. And earlier this year, Philomena Lee -- whose decades-long search for the son she was forced to give up for adoption in the 1950s was the subject of an Oscar-nominated film -- launched the Philomena Project in hopes of compelling the governments of Ireland and the United States to open access to adoption records.","NEW: Tuam archbishop says he will seek a ""dignified re-interment"" of children's remains .

"(CNN) -- A new poll this week claims the thing people most want to see in an airport is a cinema. Not automated, super-fast security checks, not complimentary Michelin-star dining options, not even Star Trek-style transporters to your destination (presumably those questioned could have chosen anything?). No, it seems people are resigned to the fact that airports must be endured rather than enjoyed, and a good movie is the most we can even wish for, let alone expect. Kudos to Hong Kong, Seoul and Singapore, which all have cinemas in their international airports already. Flight comparison site Skyscanner asked 10,000 people what they would most like to see in an airport. Responses ranged ""from a gym to a beach,"" the site said. Nearly half chose cinemas as their top airport wish, followed by ""sleep pods"" (36%) and a library (32%). Other items included a park, a pool and a ""vanity area."" But who has time for all these activities? Can you have fun in an airport? Aren't airports most often sites of flustered, sweaty travelers rushing between gates, or tense mothers squawking at their children to ""sit still!"" or irate latecomers having melt downs? Perhaps these enjoyable amenities would make us all arrive earlier and feel happier. No doubt frequent flyers spending several hours each month wondering what to do between Dallas/Fort Worth and Heathrow would appreciate the distraction. Hong Kong International Airport was the first airport to have an IMAX cinema within. It's a behemoth 358-seater with a 22-meter-high screen. But despite being open to the general public, not just fliers, up to 40% of the audience are airport and airline staff, says Kathe Lin, deputy marketing manager at UA Cinema Circuit, which operates the IMAX in Hong Kong. And anecdotal evidence from travelers suggests the place is rarely full, or even close to it. Singapore's Changi airport has two cinemas, only accessible to passengers, but they are relatively modest at 13 seats and 55 seats. Korea's Incheon International Airport was built with a specific audience in mind: ""We opened a theater at the airport to target the massive number of hallyu (Korean Wave) fans who come to the airport,"" says a CGV Theaters representative. These include local residents as well as international travelers who flock to see their favorite K-Pop artists and Korean movie stars as they travel through the airport. CGV is catering to an eager crowd, but the spokesperson admits days are usually pretty quiet. Do we want what we say we want? The evidence seems to suggest that despite the professed wishes of cinema-deprived travelers, where airport cinemas exist already, people aren't really that bothered. Figure in the amount of space a cinema takes up, the logistics, the cost, the maintenance and other bits and pieces that go into managing the space, and it's probably just as well most airports concentrate on other things. What do you think? Would you use an airport cinema if you had the time? Tell us below .","Nearly half of those surveyed say they would like a cinema in airports .

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said authorities have arrested a U.S. citizen who ""had all the appearances of a mercenary"" working to destabilize the South American country's government.

U.S. officials have reached out to the Venezuelan government on the matter, but haven't received information, the source said. Chavez said the passport the man was carrying had stamps from recent years in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. The president also said police seized a notebook with written coordinates from the man. ""It sends a powerful signal, how this citizen wanted to illegally enter the country, to do who knows what. ... He says he was fleeing from I don't know who.

"(CNN) -- It's described as the 'Everest of sailing' -- a testing 39000 nautical mile challenge that takes crews through some of the most perilous waters in the world. The Volvo Ocean Race is in its first weeks of competition, an adventure that will last nine months. At the beginning of this month, six crews set off on the first leg of the grueling race in Alicante, Spain. Their journey will take them across the globe via the ports of Cape Town, Abu Dhabi, Sanya, Auckland, ItajaÃ­, Miami, Lisbon, and Lorient -- eventually finishing in Galway, Ireland in July next year. It's predicted millions of people will flock to the shorelines when the boats enter the ports. The event's growing popularity is parallel to the increasing professionalism that surrounds the race, and shows just how much it has changed since it began 38 years ago. ""Our main concern was survival in the first race,"" says Alec Honey, who competed in 1973-74, when the event begun. It was known as The Whitbred Round the World Race and featured 17 yachts competing on what was then a 27,000 mile contest. Although the course was shorter, the journey was much slower and meant that sailors spent a lot more time at sea. Then the crew's comfort was considered. There was space for sailors to play cards during the down times and guitars were brought on board for night time sing-a-longs. Erik Pascoli, who skippered 'Tauranga' in 1973-74, remembers how on some yachts crates of beer were even included in the supplies so the sailors could enjoy a drink. ""I remember the way the boats were loaded with pallets of beers when in other circumstances even an extra roll of toilet paper would have been a scandal."" In modern racing, speed is the driving force behind every design decision. The record for the fastest day was set in 2008, when the Ericsson 4 traveled 687 miles in 24 hours. In the early days of the race's history, 200 miles was considered a very good day. But while it may have been slower, in 1973 the crews relied on their wits for survival. There was no satellite information -- the first they knew of a storm was when they were in it. ""Our instrument of navigation wasn't so far from James Cook's times,"" says Pascoli. Even some former competitors admit they were crazy to embark on such an adventure, particularly when it comes to sailing in the southern ocean. ""We knew there were whales, we knew there were icebergs, we knew there were storms,"" says Peter Lunde, the skipper of the 1981-82 entrant 'Berge Viking'. ""We prepared ourselves to cope with it. We were very happy to get around with a full crew."" Despite all the advances in technology, competitors at sea now are still faced with plenty of danger. ""Down there you are pretty much running on luck anyway,"" explains Mike Sanderson, who is this year captaining 'Team Sanya'. ""You're blasting along. You know it would only take a piece of ice the size of a small car to tear the bottom out of the boat and you're not going to see that with any technology in the world."" Five sailors have lost their lives competing in the race, including three in the first edition. Participants are all too aware that the dangers of the event are very real. ""It's easy to say that winning the race is the priority,"" says Ken Read, skipper of 'Puma Ocean Racing, powered by BERG'. ""But our number one priority is everybody coming home."" The determination and courageous spirit of the yachtsman has remained unchanged throughout the past four decades. Organizers say it's one of the most demanding team sporting events in the world, with participants this time around set to face countless challenges in the months ahead like their predecessors. Sailors will experience temperatures ranging from minus five degrees Celsius to 40-plus degrees. No fresh food is taken on board, only freeze dried goods are eaten by crewmen and woman, who are also unlikely to get sufficient sleep while competing. While many of the personal challenges faced by competitors are similar, one thing that is significantly different is the professionalism of the event. ""When you reach this echelon in this sport -- the upper echelon -- you get paid pretty well for doing something like this,"" says Read. Multi-million dollar sponsorship deals have been signed on on all six boats as well as the event itself. There is greater media attention that follows the race, bringing a valuable global audience. In each port, separate small races are being held, giving the teams the opportunity to win points, and the event the chance to win over more spectators. In Alicante, several events such as concerts were held to coincide with the start of the race, and more are due to be held in the other ports. ""We're in the entertainment business, without entertaining all these guys there is nothing,"" explains Read. But the lucrative sponsorship deals have not taken away the spirit of adventure. ""There's not a lot of commercialism at 2am when your spinnaker is out the back of the boat and you are lying on your side,"" says two-times race winner Grant Dalton. ""No matter what you do with it .. you can never destroy adventure, icebergs, waves, cold and no sleep. You will never destroy the adventure that started this race in 1973.""","The Volvo Ocean Race is 39000 nautical miles long .

"Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- Three more suspects have been arrested in connection with the April 28 bombing in Marrakech which killed 17 people and injured 20 others. CNN learned Wednesday from security sources that Moroccan police have apprehended three Moroccan males in the coastal town of Safi, the hometown of the alleged chief perpetrator of the bombing, Adil El Atmani. This brings the total number of arrests in Morocco to six. The sources confirmed that El Atmani is the chief suspect held by the police, following press speculation this week that he was being held, which was unconfirmed by the Moroccan government. The security sources also confirmed that Moroccan authorities are working closely with the FBI and German police. They pointed to the recent arrests in Germany of three men, two of them with connections to Morocco, who are accused of plotting terror attacks in Germany. They said those arrests came the day after the Marrakech attack, and that the leader of the German cell is a Moroccan who was in contact with El Atmani before the Marrakech bombing and is known by German security services to be both an operative of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and an expert in explosives. AQIM has denied any link to the Marrakech bombing, but the denial is being met with increasing skepticism by some Moroccan news media. An editorial in the French-language daily Aujourd'hui said the statement by the North African al Qaeda cell -- put out a week after the bombing -- was unprecedented and ""contradicts itself."" On Wednesday, Moroccan authorities held a staged reconstruction of the bombing in Marrakech, which tore through a café. Authorities have said the bomber remotely triggered two explosives, which he had placed there while disguised as a Western hippie.","Sources say Moroccan authorities are working with FBI, German police .

"(CNN) -- Germany's intelligence service has intercepted phone calls by two U.S. secretaries of state, German media reports reveal. The news comes several months after Germany complained about the United States eavesdropping on its politicians. German intelligence service BND intercepted a phone call from then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ""by chance"" while Clinton was traveling on a U.S. government plane, the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported. The magazine Der Spiegel said this happened in 2012. And Der Spiegel reported BND intercepted a satellite call from U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in 2013. According to the Sueddeutsche article, unnamed members of the German government claim that the wiretapping was accidental and not part of a widespread operation to eavesdrop on U.S. politicians. Der Spiegel said the recorded calls were deleted. Sueddeutsche says it and German public broadcasters NDR and WDR based their reports on documents from the case of a German intelligence agent who'd given information to the CIA. Sueddeutsche gives the man's name simply as Markus R. and said he was arrested in July after giving the CIA at least 218 classified documents. Der Spiegel, quoting unnamed sources, also reported the Germans have spied on Turkey, a NATO member state. The magazine said it viewed documents supporting the claim from 2009. Relations between Germany and the United States have suffered lately because of revelations about intelligence gathering. Last month, Germany kicked out the CIA station chief in Berlin after learning that two Germans -- one working at a German intelligence agency, the other in the Ministry of Defense -- were suspected of spying for the United States. Last year, Edward Snowden leaked information that the National Security Agency tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. A German prosecutor has opened an investigation into the matter. The U.S. State Department and representatives for Clinton declined to comment Sunday. CNN Senior Political Correspondent Brianna Keilar contributed to this report.","German media: German intelligence agency accidentally recorded Clinton, Kerry calls .

"(CNN) -- Two-time champion Alberto Contador is out of this year's Tour de France after suffering a heavy crash during Monday's 10th stage. The Spaniard had completed 62 kilometers of the 161.5-kilometer stage from Mulhouse to La Planche des Belles Filles when he fell off his bike on the descent of Petit Ballon. After receiving medical attention at the roadside for a bloodied right knee, Contador rejoined the race on a new bike. Tinkoff-Saxo teammates tried to help their team captain to get back into contention with the main peloton, but their efforts came to nothing when a tearful Contador called it a day 20 kilometers later. Contador started the day in ninth place, four minutes and eight seconds behind overall leader Tony Gallopin of France with Italy's Vincenzo Nibali (Astana) second in the standings following Sunday's stage. The 31-year-old won the tour in 2007 and 2009 but was stripped of his 2010 title after testing positive for banned anabolic steroid clenbuterol during that year's race. Contador follows last year's winner Chris Froome out of the 2014 tour -- the Team Sky rider's attempt to win back-to-back titles ended last week. After injuring his wrist and hip in a fall in stage five on Tuesday, Froome then came off his bike twice more in wet conditions the following day forcing him to retire. The 29-year-old British cyclist tweeted his sympathies to Contador following the Spaniard's exit saying it was a ""big loss"" for the tour before wishing him a swift recovery. Nibali went on to win the 10th stage to reclaim the yellow jersey. The Italian overtook Spaniard Joaquim Rodriguez in the final kilometer of the gruelling mountain stage to claim a second victory in this year's race. France's Thibaut Pinot took second place on the stage finishing 15 seconds behind Nibali with Alejandro Valverde of Spain taking third spot. Valverde's efforts on Monday leave him third overall while Australian Richie Porte (Team Sky) who finished the stage in seventh place, moves up to second overall, two minutes 23 seconds behind Nibali. Gallopin's 33rd-place finish on Monday saw him slip to fifth overall.","Two-time Tour de France winner falls and injures knee during stage 10 .

"(CNN) -- The suicide death of Robin Williams has generated interest in the relationship between creativity and depression. No one knows the nature of Mr. William's problems (added to them today was the revelation that he was suffering with early stage Parkinson's disease), but the possibility of a link between ""madness"" and creativity is ancient and persistent. It is also controversial; some believe that making such a link romanticizes painful, potentially lethal illnesses and ignores the diversity of temperament and imagination that is essential to artistic work as a pathology. The evidence for such a link, however, especially between bipolar disorder and creativity, is strong and growing. Many biographical studies, as well as studies of living artists, writers, and musicians have found higher rates of mania, severe depression, and suicide in creative individuals. First-degree relatives (that is, a parent, offspring or sibling) of creative people with bipolar disorder or depression also have elevated rates of both mood disorders and creative accomplishment. Opinion: Why Robin Williams lost to depression . In the past five years alone there have been four large studies (one that reported on 20,000 individuals and three others, each of which studied more than 700,000 individuals), that found that those with bipolar illness were disproportionately likely to be overrepresented in creative occupations; so too were their first-degree relatives. Additionally, the first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia, although not those with schizophrenia, were more likely to be in creative occupations. Going public with depression . Mood, temperament, behavioral and cognitive factors associated with bipolar illness can, in some people, make them more creative by increasing the fluency and originality of their thinking, as well as by increasing risk-taking, ambition, energy, exuberance and a desire to create meaning from suffering and chaos. It must be emphasized that most creative people do not have a mental illness and most people who have mental illnesses, such as bipolar disorder, are not unusually creative. It is rather that there is a disproportionate rate of mood disorders, especially bipolar disorder, in creative individuals. Untreated bipolar disorder is a painful illness that is associated with a very high rate of alcohol and drug abuse, as well as suicide. Opinion: Suicide doesn't set you free . It is a common illness and it usually first hits at a young age. Fortunately, treatment works and allows people to continue their creative work. I have had bipolar illness since I was 17 years old.  It is a difficult illness and it nearly cost me my life, as it does tens of thousands of people every year. There is nothing romantic about psychosis, depression or suicide. The death of Robin Williams, who was admired and loved by so many, makes this clear.","Kay Jamison: Williams suicide has raised issue of link between creativity and depression .

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- When the World Bank's arbitration body weighs in on a dispute between Venezuela and ExxonMobil, President Hugo Chavez says he won't respect the decision. The oil giant and officials from the South American nation have been feuding since 2007, when Chavez's government nationalized a joint project in the country's crude-rich Orinoco belt. A case before the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is pending. ""I will say it once. We will not recognize any decisions of the ICSID. We will not recognize them,"" Chavez said on state television Sunday. A hearing in the ICSID case is scheduled for the first quarter of 2012, according to a summary of the dispute published in an Exxon financial report. Last week Venezuela's state oil company PdVSA said it would pay ExxonMobil $255 million after the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce ruled that Venezuela owes ExxonMobil $907 million. Past debts and asset seizures make up the difference, officials from PdVSA said in a statement. Chavez criticized ExxonMobil, which has asked for billions of dollars in compensation, for continuing with the case. ""Since they couldn't do it in Paris, now they are going to the ICSID in the United States,"" he said. ExxonMobil affiliates filed the ICSID arbitration case against Venezuela in September 2007 over the Cerro Negro Project, which was a joint venture until the Venezuelan government took over ExxonMobil's 42% interest in June of that year. ExxonMobil has argued that PdVSA breached obligations under an investment treaty. Venezuela argued that taking over the project and others in Orinoco belt was its sovereign right. Chavez, who has nationalized numerous industries and land holdings during his 13-year tenure, said Sunday that he supported Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa's proposal to create a new arbitration body ""where we can settle whatever differences there are between governments and companies in Latin America."" Venezuela -- along with allies Bolivia and Nicaragua -- has said in the past that it would withdraw from the convention that created the ICSID, arguing that the international body gives transnational companies a gateway to violate national sovereignty. Chavez repeated those concerns Sunday, saying the arbitration panel was being used to threaten his country. ""They are trying to achieve the impossible, that we pay them what we are never going to pay,"" he said. World Bank directors devised the international arbitration panel in 1965. More than 140 countries are members, according to a statement on the ICSID website, which describes the body as an ""autonomous international institution."" CNN''s Catherine E. Shoichet and journalist Osmary Hernandez contributed to this report.","Venezuela and ExxonMobil are feuding over the 2007 nationalization of a project .

"(CNN) -- The cosmos has aligned, quite literally, for families, space geeks and insomniacs alike, as the Earth is set to intercept a new meteor shower late Friday into Saturday. The scientists who discovered the cosmic debris say the Camelopardalid shower could be ""significant."" Some forecasts show 200 to 1,000 meteors an hour between 2 and 4 a.m. Eastern Time on Saturday. NASA says North America is in the best position to get a glimpse because the peak of the shower will appear during our nighttime, and the debris will ""radiate"" from a position favorable for viewing. ""We expect these meteors to radiate from a point in Camelopardalis, also known as 'the giraffe,' a faint constellation near the North Star,"" according to Bill Cooke, who heads NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. More than just the potential for a spectacular light show, stargazers could witness a rare cosmic event. Awe-inspiring photos: 'Blood moon' mesmerizes sky gazers . ""New meteor showers don't come along that often. It'll be the first time in a generation that a new meteor shower will show up,"" according to CNN Meteorologist Sean Morris. Where to see them . The best place to watch the shower will be east of the Mississippi River or in California. Precipitation over the Plains and Pacific Northwest could make viewing there difficult. If you're having trouble seeing it, or if you want to join other amateur astronomers across the country as it happens, NASA's website will host a live chat from 11 p.m. Friday until 3 a.m. EDT Saturday, as well as offering a live view of the skies over Huntsville, Alabama.

"New York (CNN) -- One of the street vendors who alerted police to a smoking vehicle in Times Square that was later found to be carrying explosives says he's planning to run for Congress. Duane Jackson, a registered Democrat and Vietnam veteran, told CNN Wednesday he plans to face off against Republican Representative Nan Hayworth in New York's 19th district in the November election. In May, 2010, Jackson and another vendor noticed black smoke coming out of a Nissan Pathfinder sport-utility vehicle illegally parked in a bus lane in Times Square, with the keys still in the ignition. Authorities later discovered a bomb inside the vehicle made up of propane tanks, fertilizer and gasoline. The bomb failed to detonate. Jackson, who sells souvenirs in the square, said his motivation for taking his ideas to Washington is to work with House Speaker John Boehner to help establish more bipartisan solutions. ""I think there's been so much discontent over the years, both with Republicans and Democrats,"" Jackson, 59, told CNN. ""I hear it all the time from my neighbors in the Hudson Valley, as well as people in Times Square."" Jackson also believes that there is too much bickering and ""nothing's being done,"" and claims his rival, Hayworth, is ""out of touch with the Hudson Valley values."" The vendor was thrust into the spotlight after being credited with helping to prevent what authorities believe was a planned terrorist attack in the heart of Manhattan, even receiving a phone call from President Barack Obama. Pakistani-born U.S. citizen Faisal Shahzad pleaded guilty to the bombing attempt and is serving a life sentence in prison. Jackson said he started thinking about the possibility of elected office four or five months ago, after seeking the advice of his town supervisor and his neighbors, but his interest in politics dates back to growing up in California and being involved in student debates. He served in the Navy and attended Boston University on the G.I. Bill, where he received a degree in city planning. An advocate for veterans, Jackson said he's traveled to Albany numerous times after former New York City Mayor David Dinkins fought to amend a law that would have ended up affecting the businesses of disabled street vendors. He believes his background in city planning will bring a ""unique perspective"" to the race, he said. Jackson plans to make an official announcement within the next 10 days and is preparing to file with the Federal Election Commission. The attempted car bombing changed his life, Jackson said, and is helping him believe that he can make a difference. ""Looking at what do you do, not only for your community, but what you can do for your city, your country, and for your fellow citizens, and when I look back at it, it's like how can I make a difference?"" Jackson said. ""And that difference somewhat started that night."" Calls to Rep. Hayworth's office were not immediately returned. National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Nat Sillin said the potential race between Jackson and the other Democratic candidates running against him will make ""great theater for political junkies"" as they vie to be the most liberal candidate. Spokesman Josh Schwerin for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee did not directly comment on Jackson's potential run, but stated that ""New York voters are looking for a representative who will fight for middle class jobs and protect seniors from the devastating cuts to Medicare being pushed by Congresswoman Hayworth and Washington Republicans.""","Duane Jackson wants to represent New York's 19th district in Congress .

"(CNN) -- I got married the Saturday before Labor Day. My partner Jená and I had been a couple for nearly nine years and living together for six. Which is why the most frequent refrain she and I heard all weekend was, ""It's about time!"" So why, after all these years, did we decide to tie the knot? Well, it has something to do with gay marriage. We live in Seattle, Washington. Ever since the voters of our state enacted marriage equality in a 2012 referendum, dozens of friends have entered into same-sex marriages. Many had been together for years or even decades but rushed to get the seal of the state on their unions. What has struck me about this boomlet of connubial bliss -- a steady parade of weddings with double white dresses or double tuxedos, and all the traditional trappings and rituals -- is that something very deeply American is happening: We are using progress to conserve an institution. And/or: We are conserving something to make progress. I'd supported Referendum 74 and spoken out in favor of it. The argument I'd made most often was that interracial marriage had once been illegal, and a ban on same-sex marriage was similarly unjust and repugnant. The analogy seemed direct, and the need for straight allies of color to stand up for marriage equality seemed urgent. After the campaign, watching all these couples who'd fought for recognition finally achieve it and joyfully claim it, I was stirred by something other than social justice. I began to appreciate more deeply what marriage truly means, why it matters, and how the experience of a ceremony and a public commitment -- to say nothing of the shared life that's thereby transformed -- is so necessary. Now, to be sure, there were some visceral reasons why Jená and I had for so long stuck with cohabitation and ""practically married"" status. Each of us had been married once before, and the endings had left us both a little wary. What helped get us over that wariness was in part the passage of time and the strengthening of our bond as we experienced life together, for better and worse. Part of it too was the catalytic example of our gay and lesbian friends, neighbors and colleagues. They showed us that marriage is different. That ""wife"" and ""husband"" are different from ""partner"" or ""girlfriend/boyfriend."" That vows spoken publicly are different from assurances whispered privately. That if fear should block us from exercising a right like the right to marry, then we should consider how it'd feel to be denied the right altogether. That the reason this institution is vital is that in the end it's not about rights; it's about responsibility -- of one spouse to the other; of the couple to their people, and vice versa. Opponents of marriage equality have claimed that letting gays and lesbians marry would devalue marriage, subvert its purposes, lead to the collapse of families. In poll after poll, across the country, the anti-equality advocates are losing. More importantly, though, in state after state, they're being proven wrong. Marriage today has a new glow to it, a vibrancy that comes with the entry of all these same-sex newcomers. It's akin to the way that immigrants have revitalized dying rural towns and neglected urban neighborhoods, injecting new blood, new money, and new energy into dilapidated structures. Eight days before we spoke our vows in front of family and friends, Jená and I went to the courthouse. Our friend who performed the legal wedding there is a justice of the Washington State Supreme Court. Since the passage of marriage equality she's been the go-to judge for same-sex weddings. There are two reasons why. One, she is lesbian and a pioneer in the legal community. Two, her name is Mary Yu. When someone named Mary Yu marries you, things feel right. And when our big wedding ceremony a week later concluded with vows that all our people made to us, the larger implications of marriage equality became vividly clear. Far from subverting or undermining the institution of marriage, gays and lesbians are fortifying it. Not just by forming their own families. But also by giving people like me and Jená the courage to remake ours. So yes, I speak stoutly in defense of marriage -- marriage for all -- and I do so because I am grateful to be reminded by those once excluded what a powerful thing it is to join the matrimonial tribe.","Eric Liu: My longtime partner, Jená, and I finally got married before Labor Day .

"Washington (CNN) -- Was the sound of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 striking the water captured by ocean devices used to listen for signs of nuclear blasts? It's a long shot, but an Australian university is studying records from underwater listening devices in an effort to help find the missing plane. ""One signal has been detected on several receivers that could be related to the crash,"" said Alec Duncan of Curtin University's Centre for Marine Science and Technology (CMST). Researchers are studying a very low frequency sound to see if it was ""the impact of the aircraft on the water or the implosion of parts of the aircraft as it sank,"" Duncan said. ""But (the source of the noise) is just as likely to be a natural event,"" he said. Low frequency signals can travel thousands of kilometers through water under favorable circumstances, Duncan said. But ""at the moment (the sound) appears to be inconsistent with other data about the aircraft position,"" he said. Martin Dolan, the Chief Commissioner with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), the organization leading the search into MH370 at the request of Malaysia, agreed with DuncanÂ¹s analysis of the sound. ""We think that those detections may have been interesting from the point of view of the direction they came, but other characteristics make it unlikely that they are associated with MH370,"" he said. The ATSB first referenced these signals in a document posted on its website on Monday. The research is continuing, Duncan said, and investigators may release additional information about their findings in the coming days. As was the case with the Inmarsat satellite -- a communications satellite whose data was analyzed by Malaysia Airlines MH370 investigators as a navigational aide -- this study involves the use of technology for a purpose that it was not originally intended for. One of the devices, operated by Curtin University and located some 20 kilometers off Perth, is designed to listen to whales and other marine life. The other is for signs of underwater nuclear explosions, one of 11 operated worldwide by the U.N.-chartered Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) as part of the International Monitoring System. Search area 'can now be discounted' Gleaning the data . Early in the search for Malaysia Flight 370, the United Nations reported it had not detected any explosions or plane crashes on land or water from its sensors around the globe. But the recent efforts involve pairing CTBTO data with other sources to see what can be gleaned, officials said. ""One can always be hopeful,"" said Mark Prior, a seismic acoustic analyst with the CTBTO. The CTBTO's hydro-acoustic stations detect low frequency sound in the 0-100 Hz range, and can't detect black box ""pings"" in the 30-40 kHz range, officials said. ""It's possible (to detect a plane crash), but the circumstances that would allow it would have to be very particular,"" said Prior. Prior said some of those circumstances might include a sloping sea bed. Another possible scenario: the origin of the sound would need to be near the listening device. The CTBTO's system near Cape Leeuwin, the southwestern-most point of Australia, regularly captures signals of ice breaking noise from Antarctica and seismic activity from Indonesia, he said. ""There are other scenarios that would allow (the hydrophones to detect a crash). But it's not certain if there was an impact we would detect it,"" Prior said. Attempts were made following the 2009 crash of Air France 447 in the southern Atlantic Ocean to see if underwater listening devices had detected the plane's impact. No data could be found. Years later, after the plane was located, CTBTO again checked its data, and still was not able to identify signals related to the crash. On Friday, Beijing put pressure on Malaysia to start a new search, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported. ""We expect Malaysia to take the leading and coordinating role, come up with a new search plan for the jet at an early date, and take the investigation seriously,"" Premier Li Keqiang told Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who was on a diplomatic visit. The largest contingency of passengers on board MH 370 were from China.","An Australian university is studying underwater listening devices to help find the jet .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is expected to begin radiation treatment Sunday in Cuba, where he underwent cancer surgery late last month. Chavez flew to Havana late Saturday night. His treatment is expected to last about a month, he said in a message on state media before departing. In February, Cuban doctors removed a tumor, which Chavez said was smaller than another tumor removed in June. ""I've decided, based on the recommendations of my medical and political teams, to begin ... radiation therapy as a complement to the surgery I had four weeks ago,"" the president said during comments broadcast by the Venezuelan state-run news channel VTV. Chavez has not specified the type of cancer he is battling, and the government has released few specifics, fueling widespread speculation about his health and political future. The 57-year-old outspoken, flamboyant socialist leader has led Venezuela since 1999 and has pledged to run for re-election in October. His trip comes at the same time Pope Benedict is scheduled to visit the Caribbean island. The pope, who is on a six-day tour of Mexico and Cuba, is expected to visit Santiago de Cuba and Havana next week. CNN's Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.","Chavez has not specified the type of cancer he is battling .

"(CNN) -- He is the player whose heart stopped beating for 78 minutes and who subsequently retired at the age of 24. Now the welfare of footballers is top of Fabrice Muamba's agenda and he has urged FIFA to put the wellbeing of players at the center of any decision on the scheduling of the Qatar 2022 World Cup. FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced on Twitter last month that no decision on the staging of the 2022 World Cup -- be it in Qatar's summer or winter -- would be made until after the 2014 tournament in Brazil. ""I hope FIFA will have a second thought because playing in those conditions is very dangerous for people,"" the 25-year-old told CNN. ""The heat and the humidity in that country can damage people; they have to look at the bigger picture."" Former England Under-21 international Muamba suffered an on-field heart seizure while playing for Bolton Wanderers against Tottenham Hotspur in March 2012. The Congo-born midfielder was revived by medics before making a remarkable recovery in hospital. ""You worry, not just me but every player,"" continued Muamba.

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Monday he will return to Havana to undergo more cancer treatment. The 57-year-old president has been back and forth several times this year between Venezuela and Cuba, where he is being treated for an unspecified type of cancer. He returned home from his latest trip Thursday. ""We're in the home stretch,"" the president said about his radiation treatment. He spoke during a ceremony to sign a new labor law, during which he also called for Venezuela to withdraw from the Organization of American States' Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. ""Enough already!"" he said of the Washington-based body, accusing the United States of using it as a way to harm Venezuela. Chavez asked a newly created council to take up the matter. Venezuelan official says Chavez is in full control . The president pulled a cross from his breast pocket, kissed it and clasped it in his fist. ""I am confident Christ will repeat, or continue, the miracle,"" he said, his voice cracking with emotion as he wrapped up his address. Chavez said he would return to Venezuela within ""a few days."" Since the beginning of the year, he has spent 50 days in Cuba. The Venezuelan government has released few specifics on the president's illness, fueling widespread speculation about his health and political future.

"(CNN) -- An alleged terrorist leader suspected of plotting the bombing of a Philippine superferry more than four years ago, killing at least 116 people, has arrived in Manila after his arrest in Bahrain, a Philippine justice official said Saturday. Authorities suspect Ruben Pestano Lavilla Jr. was behind the 2004 superferry bombing. Authorities in Bahrain arrested Ruben Pestano Lavilla Jr. last month, said Ricardo Blancaflor, undersecretary at the Department of Justice. Lavilla was deported Saturday to Manila, where police arrested him and briefly paraded him in front of local media crews before locking him inside police headquarters, Blancaflor said. Lavilla is one of the top ideologues in the Rajah Solaiman Movement, a group of former Christians who converted to Islam and claim affiliation with the al Qaeda-linked regional terrorist groups Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf, Blancaflor said. Blancaflor said authorities suspect Lavilla helped plot the bombing of a superferry near Manila on February 27, 2004, in which at least 116 people died. They believe Lavilla also helped plan the bombing of a bus behind the Intercontinental Hotel in Manila on February 14, 2005, an attack that killed at least four people and came to be known as the Valentine's Day Bombing. The bus bombing was part of a trio of attacks that happened that day. The two other blasts, both fatal, happened in the southern cities of General Santos and Davao. Blancaflor said he suspects Lavilla was also involved in the planning of several bomb attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Manila, all of which were thwarted by Philippine police. In describing Lavilla's arrest in Bahrain, Blancaflor said only that police there arrested him as they were enforcing U.N. Security Council resolution 1276, which imposed air travel and financial sanctions on the Taliban. Jemaah Islamiyah aims to create a Muslim ""superstate"" across much of Southeast Asia. Authorities blame the group for the Bali, Indonesia nightclub bombings of 2002, which killed more than 200 mostly Western tourists. The group is also suspected of subsequent attacks on the Australian Embassy and J.W. Marriott hotel, both in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. The Abu Sayyaf group is one of several Islamic militant groups fighting the government in and around the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.

"(CNN) -- If investing in credit default swaps or commodity derivatives doesn't exactly fill your heart with a sense of wonder and excitement, then a product with a little more va-va-voom could be a surprisingly viable alternative: vintage cars. Records have been tumbling recently for classic cars sold at auction. Last week, a 1964 Ferrari went for $14.4 million at the ""Art of the Automobile"" sale, smashing the previous record of $6.9 million for the same model. Sotheby's sold off 31 classic and concept cars and auto-related items for nearly $63 million in just over two hours at the auction in New York City. Over the past decade the average value of classic cars has risen by 430%, according to Knight Frank's Luxury Investment Index. This compares to 273% for gold and a comparatively meager 55% for the FTSE 100 over the same time period. Indeed, in only July a 1954 Mercedes-Benz was snapped up for $29.6 million, the highest price for any car ever sold at a public auction -- dwarfing the previous title-holder by $13.3 million. And just yesterday, Ringo Starr's 164 Facel Vegal was auctioned off for a cool $553,000 alongside a host of historic cars at Bonham's, during a series of lots that netted the auction house a cool $27.6 million of sales. ""The fact that a car was previously owned by a celebrity will more often than not push the value up, but of course it depends on who the celebrity is"" said Bonham's spokesperson Chloe Ashby. ""The demand for vintage cars is rising,"" she added. ""Along with jewelry and Asian art, cars are now in the top three collecting categories."" Dietrich Hatlapa is founder of the Historical Automobile Group, an independent investment research house that specializes in classic cars. He says that vintage motors offer a unique appeal, particularly in the wake of the financial crisis. ""People have been more drawn to tangible assets over the last 10 years. Classic cars are fun, you can drive them and they have become a lifestyle as well. It's also a way to pass on wealth from one generation to the next."" The value of classic cars has jumped 39% this year alone, according to the Historic Automobile Group Index (HAGI), which tracks the financial performance of 50 rare and exotic classic cars. However, there is a sense among industry experts that these growth trends will slow down. ""I would be surprised if the demand and value can continue at the same rate over the next 10 years,"" said Andrew Shirley, editor of the Wealth Report. There are also risks to investing in vintage cars, as opposed to the more conventional alternatives, like bonds. ""The big difference to mainstream investment options is the lack of liquidity. You can't sell your car next door,"" Shirley said. ""It will take a lot of research and a long time to find someone to sell your car to for the right price. There are also slight fluctuations in trends, so it might be that at that time an Aston Martin isn't as much in demand as a Ferrari."" It's also not a one-off investment -- there can be substantive costs involved in maintaining the car. ""You have to look after them to keep them in good condition, especially if you want to keep driving,"" Shirley said. Accordingly, Hatlapa advises against throwing your money at a classic car if money is all you're hoping for in return. ""Someone shouldn't go into the vintage car market for pure investment purposes, but have a passion for classic cars,"" he said. ""The most valuable return from owning a vintage car is the satisfaction that you have something you're passionate about.""","Auction house Bonhams sold Ringo Starr's vintage car on December 1 .

"(CNN) -- They have been meeting for two months, poring over concepts and ideas already hashed out by three other groups over the past year. But nine days before their deadline, members of the so-called congressional ""super committee"" created to forge a deficit reduction deal indicated Sunday that they remain hung up on basic issues of tax and entitlement reform that have previously stymied agreement. Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the panel's Republican co-chair, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the only solution possible might be a two-step process in which the bipartisan committee sets a figure for increased tax revenue that congressional committees would then implement through legislation. ""There could be a two-step process that would hopefully give us pro-growth tax reform,"" Hensarling said. George Washington to debt panel: Show courage . The continued political wrangling over how to reform the tax code and entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid as part of a broad deficit reduction plan causes consternation for two senators who were part of the ""Gang of Six"" that put together their own plan earlier this year. ""We've got to be willing to probably make some folks mad on both ends of the political extreme,"" Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia told the CNN program. ""And you'll know this super committee is getting close if you hear folks on both ends of the political extreme scream the loudest, because that will show that there's actually movement being made."" ""That's what's so disappointing,"" he added. The panel created under the debt ceiling deal earlier this year has until November 23 to reach an agreement on at least $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade. If it works out an agreement, Congress must vote on the unamended plan by December 23. Failure to reach an agreement or gain approval by Congress and President Barack Obama would trigger $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts scheduled to take effect in 2013. Hensarling said Sunday that the process will fail unless Democrats are willing to accept significant reforms to entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, the government-run health care systems for the disabled, poor and elderly. Democrats, meanwhile, say any solution must be balanced with spending cuts, entitlement reforms and increased tax revenue. Hensarling and other Republicans oppose any kind of tax increase, particularly the call by Obama and Democrats to raise rates of wealthy Americans to increase their share of the tax burden. However, the Republican position has shifted to accept increased tax revenue through reforms that would lower rates by expanding the number of payers while ending some subsidies and loopholes. ""Increasing tax revenues could hurt the economy, but within the context of bipartisan negotiations with Democrats, clearly they are a reality,"" Hensarling conceded to CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley. Republicans have offered a proposal with $1.4 trillion in deficit reduction, including $500 billion in new revenue from capping individual deductions while cutting all six income tax rates by roughly 20%. Under the proposal, the top rate would fall from 35% to 28%. Democrats immediately rejected the plan as insufficient, saying it would end up decreasing revenue in the long run by permanently extending tax cuts from the Bush administration that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2012. The Republican proposal would bring in more revenue by spurring economic growth, Hensarling insisted, adding: ""We Republicans want more revenues. We just want to raise it by growing the economy."" Other legislators stuck to long-held positions, showing the remaining gap. ""The kind of reform we're talking about is actually guaranteed to create millions of jobs over time and also bring more revenue,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, said of the Republican proposal on ""Fox News Sunday."" In particular, it would extend Bush-era tax cuts set to expire at the end of 2012, said Toomey, one of the super committee negotiators. That's the problem, countered Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""That was not a serious proposal,"" she said, insisting that the combination of reducing some itemized deductions while extending the Bush tax cuts would result in decreased revenue in the long run. On Fox, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina said he agreed with fellow panelist Toomey on most of his proposal. However, Clyburn called for actual numbers for revenue growth that can be analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office instead of assertions of future economic growth that ""Pat Toomey will dream about."" ""I believe that all of the ingredients for a good resolution are there,"" Clyburn said. ""We just need to develop a will."" Warner, meanwhile, said on CNN that if the super committee fails to push through a compromise, Congress should vote on one of plans worked out by either the ""Gang of Six"" or a deficit commission appointed by President Barack Obama in 2010 that was headed by former Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson, a Republican, and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, a Democrat. Both plans pushed by Warner call for around $4 trillion in deficit reduction by a combination of spending cuts, tax increases and reforms to entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Another deficit commission in 2010, headed by former White House Budget Director Alice Rivlin and former Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-Wyoming, also called for a comprehensive approach including higher taxes, frozen spending and entitlement reforms. A so-called ""grand bargain"" along those lines discussed by Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, earlier this year fell apart over differences on tax hikes on the wealthy sought by Democrats and Medicare restructuring sought by Republicans.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Shweyga Mullah gestures a greeting to her visitors at Tripoli's burn hospital. Her head wrapped in fresh bandages, her frail body under a red fleece blanket, Mullah is slowly regaining her dignity. Tears stream down her cheeks, not of pain anymore, but relief. She is grateful for all those who have helped her in her ordeal. She prays now for God to heal her and return her to her family in Ethiopia. Mullah worked as a nanny for two of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's grandchildren. When she couldn't keep one from crying, Aline, the wife of Gadhafi's son Hannibal, poured boiling water on her head. CNN journalists discovered her in Hannibal Gadhafi's plush home after anti-Gadhafi forces overran Tripoli and Hannibal Gadhafi and his wife fled to Algeria. Mullah's scalp and face were a mosaic of injuries that rendered her face into a grotesque patchwork. Even though the burns were inflicted three months ago, she was still in considerable pain. ""I think it's a crime against humanity,"" said Naji Barakat, the new Libyan health minister. Apparently, it was not just Mullah who suffered as servants of Hannibal Gadhafi's family. A man too frightened to reveal his name led CNN reporters to another one of Hannibal Gadhafi's properties, a gated, high-walled villa-like house, where the man said more abuse was meted out to staffers. ""Shweyga is not the only one,"" he said, describing a Sudanese man who was also scalded with water after he burned an undershirt he was ironing. He said the foreign staff bore the brunt of the abuse. Another foreign nanny contacted CNN and described Aline Gadhafi as a ""sadist"" and a ""psychologically sick"" woman. A room in the villa perhaps bears out the nanny's words -- a prison cell in a private home. Back at the burn hospital, Mullah faces months of recuperation and surgery. Her story generated enormous public response. So far, people have donated more than $16,000 dollars for her care. Now, CNN is working with several agencies to make sure that Mullah gets proper care and that she can get back home to her family after her nightmare under the Gadhafis.","Shweyga Mullah says Moammar Gadhafi's daughter-in-law poured boiling water on her .

"(CNN) -- Each time your heart beats, your entire body moves -- even if you're unconscious and pinned under a pile of rubble. The vibrations are small, invisible to the human eye, and might just save your life after a major disaster. Researchers at NASA have developed a device that picks up these subtle movements through up to 40 feet of debris. Called FINDER (Finding Individuals for Disaster and Emergency Response), the tool was developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to help rescue crews find survivors quickly in a major disaster. ""I spend half my time doing space exploration and half building boxes that can search for people in a disaster,"" said James Lux, who created FINDER at the JPL. NASA develops technology for space but frequently finds additional uses for its discoveries here on Earth. After the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the Department of Homeland Security's science and technology directorate wanted technology they could use in similar situations. They reached out to Lux. He had previously worked on a similar device for the U.S. military, which could tell if a solider downed on the battlefield was dead or alive. After a disaster, there's a limited window of time to find trapped survivors. FINDER makes the process more efficient. It uses a low power radio signal to detect motion. Each movement caused by a heartbeat is like a ""twinkle"" reflecting back to the radar. What makes the system especially smart is software that can cut through all other movements and pinpoint which vibrations are signs of life. The system looks just for the signals that match human heartbeats, filtering out slower movements like tree branches in the wind, and faster ones like the heartbeat of a rat. It takes about five minutes to learn how to use FINDER and just a few minutes to set up. The device fits into a case small enough to carry on a plane. Hit the ""Search"" button and 30 seconds later a Web page appears on the FINDER laptop, which shows how many heartbeats it's found in a 100 foot radius. In the U.S., infrastructure is solid enough that earthquakes don't result in the same type of devastation that hit Haiti. Tornadoes are a bigger problem, like those that flattened parts of Moore, Oklahoma, and Joplin, Missouri. ""In both cases, they had a wide area with a lot of rubble and no good way to figure out where people were trapped,"" said Lux. ""It would have been nice to have one of these there -- people were in storm shelters under the pile of a neighbors house."" It could also work in avalanches and hurricanes. After Katrina, many people climbed into their attics to escape the rising water and ended up trapped. FINDER would be able to detect heartbeats in similar situations, which could help dictate rescue efforts. Because disasters rarely announce themselves ahead of time, and only a handful of prototypes are available, FINDER hasn't been used in a real emergency. It has been tested by FEMA task forces and at a training site in Virginia that is set up to mimic the scene of a natural disaster. NASA frequently develops cutting-edge technology, but it doesn't mass produce or sell it. To get these devices into the hands of more emergency response crews, a separate company needs to license the technology and manufacture and sell the gadgets, which would probably sell for about $10,000, said Lux. ""What it's really waiting for is somebody to manufacture it, we can't force anybody to make it,"" said Lux, who thinks the devices will be used in the next year or two. Until then, Lux is working to shrink the FINDER hardware and mount it on a drone or helicopter. Then crews could fly the device further into disaster areas that are difficult to reach on foot. His team is also working on a variation that could help firefighters determine where people are in a burning building before rushing in. ""It's not often you get to use tech developed for deep space and to go out and save lives,"" said Lux.

"San Angelo, Texas (CNN) -- Polygamist leader Warren Jeffs was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison plus 20 years for sexually assaulting two girls he claimed were his ""spiritual wives."" Jeffs, 55, will have to spend at least 45 years in prison before being eligible for release, according to Jerry Strickland, spokesman for the Texas Attorney General's office. The jury sentenced Jeffs to life in prison for aggravated sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl and 20 years in prison for the sexual assault of a 15-year-old girl. He must serve at least 35 years of the life sentence and half of the other sentence, Strickland said. The judge in the case ordered that the sentences be served consecutively. ""Justice has been served,"" Jeffs' nephew, Brent Jeffs, told InSession soon after the sentence. He testified during the penalty phase of his uncle's trial that Jeffs raped him when he was 5 years old. ""I finally had this day and it was an awesome day in court to be here, involved in all of this,"" said Brent Jeffs, now 28. Jeffs perverted his position as the head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to ""satisfy his own personal appetites and desires,"" prosecutor Eric Nichols said. Those appetites included forcing sex on the two girls, 12 and 15, who he had taken as wives, prosecutors said. Audiotapes seized from his car and the church's Yearning For Zion Ranch compound in Eldorado, Texas, and played for jurors during his trial, depicted Jeffs offering ""celestial marriage"" instructions to the young wives, according to prosecutors. ""You have to know how to be sexually excited and to help each other ... and you have to be ready for the time I need your comfort,"" a man's voice says. ""This is your mission. This is how you abide the law. At one point, the man says, ""Take your clothes off. Do it right now,"" followed by the sounds of crying. ""Just don't think about the pain; you're going to heaven,"" the man says. ""Rarely if ever in the criminal justice system in Texas have we ever encouraged a person such as Warren Jeffs, whose criminal conduct spans decades, multiple jurisdictions and hundreds of victims,"" Nichols said. A former member of the church, Rebecca Musser, said the verdict will not bring back lost innocence. But she said it can help others escape from abuse they may have suffered. ""Whether the currency is God or greed, the trafficking of women and children for sex is a form of slavery,"" she said. Jeffs is the eighth person from the ranch to be convicted on sexual assault, bigamy and other charges, according to the Texas Attorney General's office. Four others are awaiting trial. Attorney General Greg Abbott said he believes authorities have rooted out the molesters from the ranch, but will continue to monitor the church's activities there. ""We have an ongoing open investigation that will evaluate all evidence about any kind of wrongdoing out there at the compound whatsoever,"" Abbott said. Jurors came back with the sentence after 30 minutes of deliberations Tuesday. They began their work Tuesday morning following brief closing statements by prosecutor Nichols. Jeffs, who has argued that he and his faith were being persecuted, instructed his attorneys to deliver no closing statement. ""This is not the prosecution to persecute a people, this is a prosecution to protect a people,"" Nichols told jurors. Jeffs did not attend the closing statement. In addition to tape recordings that the state said depicted sex acts with minors, prosecutors also presented evidence that Jeffs knew he was wanted by federal authorities and that his behavior would be shunned by outsiders. FBI Special Agent John Broadway testified that Jeffs ordered the destruction of various discs and transcripts three days after an arrest warrant was issued for him on June 10, 2005. The polygamist sect leader established ""houses of hiding,"" allegedly with young girls for him to marry, Broadway said. The FBI agent also read from a priesthood record, in which Jeffs allegedly wrote: ""Things are happening so quickly. There is an even younger girl that the Lord wants me to take. She is 13. For some reason the Lord is sending me these girls that can be worked with."" Jeffs also wrote: ""If the world knew what I was doing, they would hang me from the highest tree,"" according to evidence presented in court. Referring to that comment, prosecutor Nichols said during his closing statement that ""Yes, this is Texas. But no, we don't hang convicts anymore from the highest tree, and we don't have the ability to call down the wrath of the Almighty ... We as a people choose to isolate our worst offenders, to keep them away from their past and future victims."" Jeffs' breakaway sect is believed to have about 10,000 followers. Their practice of polygamy, which the mainstream Mormon Church renounced more than a century ago, is part of the sect's doctrine.

"(CNN) -- World No. 2 Li Na has pulled out of next month's U.S. Open with a knee injury. Li, the reigning Australian Open champion and a semifinalist at Flushing Meadows last year, posted a message on her Facebook page saying she expects to return to action after the tennis season's fourth and final grand slam event. ""I wanted to let all of my great fans know that unfortunately I am going to have to withdraw from the upcoming WTA events in Montreal and Cincinnati, as well as the U.S. Open,"" Li's statement read. ""Since March, I have been struggling with my knee and it is just not where I need it to be in order to play at the highest level. ""My medical team has advised me that I need to take some time off to rest my knee so it heels. I look forward to getting back on the court this fall in Wuhan and Beijing."" After the two Chinese tournaments in late September, there is just one premier-level WTA Tour event before the season-ending championships in Singapore starting October 20. Li is third in the standings for the eight-woman showpiece. Injury to her right knee forced Li to withdraw from April's Stuttgart Open, and the 32-year-old has struggled with her form since. A first-round exit at Roland Garros in May was followed by a third-round defeat at Wimbledon the following month, which is her last tournament appearance. Li became China's first grand slam singles champion when she won the French Open in 2011 and clinched a second major title at Melbourne Park in January, when she beat Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova in straight sets. Thursday's announcement came 24 hours after Rafael Nadal revealed he is suffering from a wrist injury and may not be fit for the New York slam. Nadal clinched his second U.S. Open title against Novak Djokovic last September but his title defense could be in peril after he was told by doctors that he needs at least two to three weeks off from competitive action. The injury, sustained during practice, has denied the second-ranked Spaniard the chance to defend his titles at next week's Rogers Cup in Toronto and the Cincinnati Masters, which starts on August 10.

"(CNN) -- Private businesses are better placed than governments to tackle global warming because they can act faster, according to panelists at CNN's climate change debate. High profile figures in the private sector and the United Nations agreed the urgency to reduce carbon emissions was such that business could not afford to wait for politicians to act. Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, said at the CNN Earth's Frontiers debate in Cancun, Mexico, that business should be ""pulling governments along."" She said: ""The difficult thing is to balance two realities. One reality is the urgency of it, which science tells us and we can see and economics has already figured out, with the political pace with which governments can move. ""That's where private sector comes in, that's where private sector, seeing the opportunity, should be not waiting for governments but taking the lead and pulling governments along."" Figueres was joined in the debate by Felipe Calderon, President of Mexico, and Caio Koch-Weser, vice chairman of Deutsche Bank, discussing who should pay to combat climate change. Koch-Weser agreed: ""The business community is doing this already. They see the risk, see the opportunity. I think we are ahead because business thinks longer term than politicians."" Calderon, who has pledged to make Mexico one of the first developing countries to take a lead in combating climate change, said everyone should contribute to avert disaster. ""We will need a lot of public money, we will need a lot of private money, we will need the market, we will need new rules, we will need taxes. ""But, in any case, it will be cheaper than to pay the consequences of climate change."" He added that all countries should pay according to their circumstances. ""You have more money, you pay more; your consumption of carbon is larger than mine, you must pay more; but the point is everyone is going to pay the consequences, everyone has to contribute."" During the debate, hosted by CNN anchor Becky Anderson, Koch-Weser praised the efforts of Mexico, China and other emerging economies in tackling carbon emissions. He said: ""I think countries like Mexico and China have understood that this is compatible with growth, job creation and eradicating poverty. ""There's a huge potential for competitive advantage and technological leap-frogging if you go for green growth, if you go for the big transformation that's coming our way. ""Some call it the next industrial revolution, where you go for much more natural-resource saving generally and low-carbon future growth path. ""I think Mexico, China and other emerging economies are more vigorous than some mature market economies."" The panelists discussed the establishment of a global carbon market to make the highest polluters pay for their emissions. Koch-Weser, a member of the United Nations High-Level Advisory Committee on Climate Finance, said this could best be brought in by building on individual country pledges. He said: ""I'm skeptical, unfortunately, that we will have in the foreseeable future a global carbon market, but what we will have is domestic schemes spring up. We have the European experience, of course. ""China is thinking as part of its next five-year plan about establishing carbon markets and we could link domestic markets, create regional markets and eventually lead back to an international agreement."" He added: ""We need a carbon price -- get the incentives right and humankind will be very innovative in responding."" Patrick Moore, the environmentalist, speaking to CNN separately, said a country's individual circumstances need to be taken into account instead of trying to impose a one-size-fits-all solution. He said: ""If we really want to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, if we really want to change technology, we really need to do it country by country, or perhaps bilateral agreements among countries that have similar circumstances. ""One of the main reasons that Kyoto has failed is that every country is different, some countries are rich, some countries are poor."" He added: ""How can you expect countries as disparate as this to have some kind of common cookie-cutter agreement on what everyone is supposed to do? It's impossible.""","Panelists discuss who should pay to tackle climate change .

"(CNN) -- Call it part tank, part boat and part beer cooler. But it's unquestionably all cool. It's a new U.S. Marine Corps vehicle for getting stuff like troops, tanks and trucks from ships to shore and back. The Corps showed off a prototype of its Ultra Heavy-lift Amphibious Connector (UHAC) last week during Rim of the Pacific exercises in Hawaii, running it from the Navy's amphibious dock landing ship USS Rushmore to the beaches of Marine Corps Training Area Bellows on Oahu. ""Showcasing the UHAC during RIMPAC is a big deal,"" Dave George of the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab, which developed the UHAC with funding from the Office of Naval Research, said in a press release. ""This is a great way to let people know that this new technology is being developed."" Here's how the UHAC works: The tracks, which are made of what the Marines call ""captured-air foam blocks,"" extend like flippers to propel the craft through the water. When it hits the beach, the foam flattens to become like the tracks on a tank or a bulldozer, only much softer, according to a report from Stars and Stripes. Last week, the UHAC prototype, which is about half the size of envisioned production models, carried an assault vehicle from the Rushmore to the beach. The Marine Corps says a full-size UHAC would be able to carry much more. ""The full-scale model should be able to carry at least three tanks and a HMMVW (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle),"" Gunnery Sgt. Joseph Perera, the Warfighting Lab's Infantry Weapons Project officer, said in a statement. That's about three times the load that the Corps' current craft assigned to the task, called a Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), can handle. It also will be able to surmount bigger obstacles. While an LCAC can only get over a 4-foot-high sea wall, a full-size UHAC will be able to get over sea walls as high as 10, 12 or even 16 feet, according to the Corps. The UHAC prototype type is not armored or armed, but Perera said production models would have armor plating and a .50-caliber machine guns for protection. They also would be much faster. The prototype could only go 5 mph on the water, but a full-size UHAC should do 25 mph, Gen. Kevin Killea, commander of the Corps' Warfighting Lab, told Stars and Stripes. The UHAC prototype used last week is the third in the program, built upon a concept originally proposed by the Hawaii-based shipbuilding and research firm Navatek, Ltd. ""There has been a one-fifth scale model, then a one-quarter scale model and this is a half-scale model, so we have been progressing,"" Frank Leban, program officer at the Office of Naval Research, said in a statement. ""Every vehicle has incorporated more features and technology to help get us to the full scale."" There's no word yet on when the full-scale model may actually come, but officials were happy with last week's demonstration. ""This is a great way to show what it can do,"" said George. ""Today went quite well.""","Vehicle uses foam blocks for paddles, tracks .

"Washington (CNN) -- Less than 48 hours before primaries in Arizona and Michigan, Mitt Romney received a key endorsement from Arizona's governor Sunday while his current main challenger, Rick Santorum, appeared to downplay his own chances of winning in the Grand Canyon State. The two are leading the pack in the Republican presidential campaign that includes former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul as it heads into a series of crucial contests in coming weeks, including Super Tuesday on March 6 when 437 delegates from 10 states will be at stake. Michigan is emerging as a showdown between Romney and Santorum, with the outcome expected to significantly impact the campaign. If Romney comes from behind in the polls to win the state considered home turf where his father was governor, he will cement his status as the lone front-runner and presumptive nominee. A Santorum victory would raise further questions about Romney's ability to attract broad conservative support in the primaries or against President Barack Obama in November's general election. The latest polls from Michigan and Arizona put Romney and Santorum in a virtual tie in both states, but the trends show Romney increasing his support as Tuesday's primary approaches. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a tea party conservative known for legal and public clashes with Obama over immigration policy, announced her endorsement of Romney on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program Sunday. ""I think he has that pro-business background and he has that political history that I think he would serve America the best of all the candidates,"" Brewer said, adding that Romney also has the best chance of defeating Obama in November. Santorum cited negative ads by the Romney campaign and super PAC supporters for the tightening poll numbers, and he sounded resigned to a second-place finish in Arizona. ""That's another tough state for us,"" Santorum told the NBC program. ""Demographically, it doesn't work quite as well for us as maybe some other states."" Regardless, he said, the results of Tuesday's primaries would show the Republican nomination was down to a two-person race pitting him against Romney. Santorum and Gingrich are vying to be the main conservative challenger against the more moderate Romney. Gingrich is banking on a strong Super Tuesday performance in the Southern states of Georgia, which represented in Congress, and neighboring Tennessee to revitalize his flagging campaign. In his push for conservative support, Gingrich warned Sunday in remarks at a Georgia church that liberal elitism was threatening the country. ""You have elites in the bureaucracy, elites in the judgeship, frankly elites in the news media, elites in the academic world, and elites in politics -- and they would all like to impose on us an America that none of us believe in,"" Gingrich said. Paul, the libertarian champion who has a devoted but limited support base among mostly young followers, has waged a strategic campaign aimed at accumulating delegates so he can assert influence at the Republican convention in August. So far, Romney's advantage in money and organization have helped him fend off challenges from a succession of Republican contenders. On Sunday, Romney surrogates appeared on talk shows to boost his chances ahead of the upcoming contests. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a strong Romney backer, declared on the CBS program ""Face the Nation"" that ""Rick Santorum's not going to be the nominee,"" while Arizona Sen. John McCain told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he was ""confident Mitt will do well on Tuesday night in Arizona and in Michigan and hopefully that will move this process forward so we can concentrate on the real adversary."" Another veteran Senate Republican, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, also told the CNN program that he expects Romney to win both states on Tuesday. While Graham has yet to endorse a candidate, he praised Romney for ""getting better and better"" throughout the campaign season. ""Romney really has sharpened his skills, and I think that will pay dividends if he gets the nomination,"" Graham said. Meanwhile, the senior adviser to Obama's re-election campaign did his best Sunday to encourage a drawn-out Republican nomination process. Former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, now advising Obama's campaign, told CNN that Santorum has a ""legitimate chance"" to become the GOP nominee and described the former Pennsylvania senator as a candidate with blue-collar appeal who is ""clearly somebody who has a very different economic background than Mitt Romney."" Predicting Tuesday's contests in Michigan and Arizona will not be a ""clarifying event,"" Gibbs said he expects the primary to go on for ""weeks and weeks."" A tea party group also sought to boost Santorum's candidacy Sunday, urging Michigan conservatives to donate money and back Santorum even if they support Gingrich in order to damage Romney's chances. ""No matter who your preferred candidate might be down the road, if you want to stop Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum needs to stop Romney in Michigan,"" said an appeal from the Freedom's Defense Fund. ""We're trying to make sure that happens."" Romney did a rare talk show appearance on ""Fox News Sunday"" in which he defended his stance against the auto industry bailout in 2008 and also parried questions about what critics call his inability as a wealthy businessman to connect with working-class Americans such as tea party conservatives. Last week, Romney's comment that his family owns several cars kept at different residences, including two Cadillacs driven by his wife, came under media scrutiny. ""You know, I can't be perfect. I just am who I am,"" Romney said on the Fox program, later adding: ""If people think that there is something wrong with being successful in America, then they better vote for the other guy, because I've been extraordinarily successful and I want to use that success and that know-how to help the American people."" Romney also pushed back against critics of his opposition to the government bailout of the auto industry when the recession hit in 2008. Democrats and their labor union supporters have highlighted the Romney stance in Michigan, saying he would have turned his back on workers in a time of need. To Romney, the issue is about government fiscal intervention in a market-driven industry. ""You've seen all sorts of businesses go in bankruptcy. And they come out and are stronger,"" Romney said on Fox. ""This is not the first time that an industry or a company has been in trouble."" He said he opposed ""writing checks"" when auto industry leaders asked for help, instead of forcing them into what he called a managed bankruptcy and then helping them recover. ""After bankruptcy, that was the time to give them the financial support, the guarantees to provide the help to get them out of bankruptcy,"" Romney added. ""That's the way it would have been done best."" However, Romney didn't directly respond when asked if his plan would have forced the automakers into a more severe form of bankruptcy that would have resulted in greater job losses and a more difficult recovery. Santorum went after Romney on the auto bailout issue, saying the former Massachusetts governor was ideologically inconsistent because he had supported the government bailout of Wall Street firms but opposed the help for the auto industry. ""Mitt Romney supported his friends on Wall Street and then turned his back on the people of Detroit,"" Santorum told the ABC program ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos."" ""Now I say turned his back because he supports the concept of bailouts. I don't. And that's the difference between the two approaches."" Santorum also continued to wrestle with the increased attention to his campaign since he surged to the top of polls in recent weeks following his sweep of contests in Minnesota, Missouri and Colorado earlier this month. In his appearances on ABC and NBC, he was questioned about comments last week that challenged Obama's push for students to attend college and the call more than 50 years ago by former President John F. Kennedy -- the nation's first Roman Catholic president -- for an absolute separation of church and state. On ABC, Santorum said the Kennedy speech -- which sought to ease concerns about his faith interfering with his ability to govern -- made him sick. ""What kind of country do we live that says only people of non-faith can come into the public square and make their case?"" Santorum said in seeking to link his interpretation of the Kennedy speech with his criticism of the Obama administration for what he calls impeding on religious freedom. ""That makes me throw up and it should make every American who has seen from the president, someone who is now trying to tell people of faith that you will do what the government says, we are going to impose our values on you,"" Santorum said, later adding that imposition of government values was ""the next logical step when people of faith, at least according to John Kennedy, have no role in the public square."" On higher education, Santorum was asked about declaring calling Obama a snob for advocating that all American students go to college if possible. After first responding on ABC that not everyone wants or needs a college education to succeed, noting that a trade school or a music career were examples of alternative options, Santorum characterized the majority of U.S. colleges and universities as liberal-biased institutions that are biased against conservative thinkers and religious believers. ""We have some real problems at our college campuses with political correctness, with an ideology that is forced upon people who, you know, who may not agree with the politically correct left doctrine,"" Santorum said. ""And one of the things that I've spoken out on and will continue to speak out is to make sure that conservative and more mainstream, commonsense conservative and principles that have made this country great are reflected in our college courses and with college professors. And at many, many, and I would argue most institutions in this country, that simply isn't the case."" Some Republicans have warned that such strident conservative rhetoric would hurt the party's cause in the general election against Obama, when the GOP nominee will need the support of independents to win. Christie took that stance Sunday, telling the CBS program that he believed declaring Obama a snob over the higher education issue was ""probably over the line."" He also criticized Santorum for what he called ""naked opportunism"" in questioning Romney's conservative credentials, noting Santorum endorsed Romney in 2008. CNN's Dana Bash, Ashley Killough and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.","NEW: Newt Gingrich warns that liberal elitism threatens the United States .

"(CNN) -- A woman approached me as I was rushing toward the D.C. Metro after giving a talk on rape in Syria last month. She asked in a low voice if she could share some information. She had DVDs, she said. On them were testimonies of Syrian women who'd been raped; in particular, a mother, a daughter and a sister all in one family. In a taxi recently en route to Heathrow Airport, I was told another startling story. The driver turned to me and said, ""I am Syrian. And I have a story to tell you that I keep wishing is not true."" His eyes welled up as he relayed what his neighbor said happened to a friend. The neighbor described being stopped in his car at a Syrian checkpoint on the road from Zabadani to Damascus. He said army officers told him to leave his daughter with them. My driver said he knew no other details than this, that the man had been given a horrific choice to make: leave his daughter behind, or his wife and other children would be killed in front of his eyes. The man made a decision, the driver said. He left his daughter at the checkpoint and drove on. I keep wishing it is not true, too, but what I told the driver that day is that his story sounds all too familiar: Of the hundreds of cases of sexualized violence against Syrian women and men I have heard and documented as the director of the Women Under Siege project at the Women's Media Center, many fit this pattern of women and girls being raped at checkpoints. Read more: Syrian family hides from attacks in underground 'prison' And the story from the woman in Washington falls all too neatly into the pattern of ripping apart families -- rape and other forms of sexualized violence have long been used as a tool of war to destroy not only individual bodies but entire communities. What is happening in Syria is no exception. In an attempt to not lose a single story that could be used as possible evidence for future war crimes trials, we are documenting reports of sexualized violence on a live, crowd-sourced map on Syria. We know, however, that evidence of crimes is being destroyed every day: More than 20% of the women in our reports are found dead or are killed after rape. Broken down by type of crime and perpetrator, each case is marked as a red dot on the map and contains up to dozens or even hundreds of victims. Each dot is a life or lives potentially ripped apart by a horrific act of violence, an act that is particularly powerful as a weapon in Syria, where honor is so highly prized. Rape is tearing Syrians apart. The concept of purity is destroying their lives on top of it. The International Rescue Committee, referring to Syria, reported in August that ""girl-child survivors of rape are frequently married to their older cousins or other male members of the community, to 'save their honor.' "" Participants in adolescent girl groups told the IRC that if a girl is raped, ""Sometimes she might be killed by her family. She might kill herself. ... She knows that she will be dishonored for the rest of her life."" Honor killings, forced marriages and divorce are just a few of the ways shame is destroying lives in Syria. There is also suicide when the shame becomes too much to bear, such as the story on our map telling of a girl in Latakia who reportedly killed herself by jumping off a balcony after rape. But the concept of honor is failing Syrian women in another way. Read more: NATO stands with Turkey as Syrian violence spills over borders . ""What I always think about is how women have tried to persuade the perpetrators not to attack them by asking to think of them as their sisters,"" said one of the Syrian researchers on our mapping project. ""In Arab culture, a real man will protect his sister at any price. He is expected to take revenge if someone dishonors her. His sister is his responsibility even if she is married because blood relation is stronger than marriage. The women were appealing to whatever remnant of manhood and Arab honor these attackers might still have. Unfortunately, they had none."" The unending ""dishonor"" and manipulation of Syrians through sexualized violence is committed by all sides, although the majority of our reports indicate government perpetrators. It is creating an entire nation of traumatized people: not just the survivors of the acts, but their children as well. It is time to stop it all. There are measures the world can take to bring these horrors to an end. Shame should never fall on victims, but should be used to compel Russia to join a U.N. Security Council call for the Syrian government's alleged crimes to be referred to the International Criminal Court. Governments can help humanitarian groups that offer medical and psychosocial services for survivors. Syrian women's rights organizations are already taking action to combat and respond to gender-based violence, including organizing family-based care for displaced children of survivors. The international community can and should support Syrian civil society in this work. Shame is a powerful feeling that causes retreat. It causes us to lower our heads and look away. But we have a chance to lift up the survivors of sexualized violence in Syria and honor them by paying attention, by caring enough to bring their suffering to an end, by telling them that we do not accept the violence against them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lauren Wolfe.","Lauren Wolfe: Rape is a weapon that destroys individuals, families, communities .

"(Health.com) -- An essential nutrient found in fish oil does not appear to slow the mental decline associated with Alzheimer's disease, according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study is merely the latest to cast doubt on the mental benefits of the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which until recently was considered a promising way to minimize the risk and damage of dementia. (The other main ingredient found in fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA, is not believed to play a significant role in brain health.) Health.com: Fish oil doesn't benefit new moms, babies . DHA or fish-oil supplements aren't likely to cause any harm to Alzheimer's patients, but they aren't likely to do any good either, says Steven H. Ferris, Ph.D., the director of the Aging and Dementia Research Center at New York University. Fish oil ""seems to be healthy in general, and maybe for other things it's helpful, but it doesn't benefit cognitive function in a person with Alzheimer's,"" says Ferris, who was not involved in the study. Research on DHA has been inconclusive and sometimes conflicting. Several studies that followed large groups of people as they aged have suggested that a diet rich in fish is linked to a reduced risk of dementia and mental decline, but most randomized controlled trials comparing DHA supplements with placebo have found no benefit. Health.com: 9 foods that may help save your memory . ""It's not the first time something in large epidemiological datasets just didn't work out clinically,"" Ferris says, noting that statin medications, anti-inflammatory drugs, and estrogen therapy have all failed to live up to their initial promise in preventing or treating Alzheimer's. ""Unfortunately, that seems to be the situation here."" The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging and was led by Dr. Joseph F. Quinn, M.D., a neurologist at the Oregon Health and Science University, in Portland. Quinn and his colleagues randomly assigned about 400 women and men in their mid-70s with likely Alzheimer's disease -- the disease is very difficult to accurately diagnose -- to take 2 grams of DHA or placebo capsules per day. After 18 months, the average mental decline in the DHA and placebo groups was nearly identical, as measured on two separate tests and rating scales. Despite the disappointing results, the study doesn't entirely rule out the possibility that DHA may have some benefit if taken earlier in life. A growing body of research suggests that dementia begins decades before any noticeable symptoms surface, and it's possible that DHA helps prevent or slow those harmful changes. Health.com: 25 signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease . Treatments such as DHA may be too little too late for people who are already showing signs of Alzheimer's, according to Dr. Kristine Yaffe, M.D., a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco.

"(CNN) -- Katie Goldman's universe extends from her home to her first-grade classroom. She is a big sister to Annie Rose and Cleo, a piano player, a Spanish student, a wearer of glasses. She loathes the patch she has to wear for one lazy eye. She loves magic and princesses and ""Star Wars,"" an obsession she picked up from her dad. The 7-year-old carried a ""Star Wars"" water bottle to school in Evanston, Illinois, every day, at least until a few weeks ago, when Katie suddenly asked to take an old pink one instead. The request surprised Katie's mom, Carrie Goldman. It didn't make any sense. Why would her little sci-fi fan make such a quick turn? Goldman kept pressing for an answer. She wasn't expecting Katie's tears. Kids at school insisted that ""Star Wars"" was only for boys, Katie wailed. Her daughter said she was different enough already -- the only one who was adopted, who's Jewish, who wears glasses, who needs a patch. If sacrificing Yoda for the color pink would make her fit in again, so be it. Goldman's heart sank. These weren't nameless, faceless bullies who taunted her daughter. They were good kids Katie ran around with on the playground. They were getting older, though, and starting to see what made people the same -- and different. Now, it was about ""Star Wars,"" but Goldman wondered what lunchroom teasing would progress to in middle school, high school or college. ""Is this how it starts?"" Goldman wrote in her blog, Portrait of an Adoption. ""Do kids find someone who does something differently and start to beat it out of her, first with words and sneers? Must my daughter conform to be accepted?"" 'I need your help' A few days later, in Orlando, Jen Yates clicked on a link that led to Goldman's blog. Yates couldn't shake Katie's image when it flashed across the screen  -- a little girl with long blonde hair, no front teeth, square-rimmed glasses. ""When you hear about bullying, it's like an abstract concept,"" Yates said. ""When you put a face on it, an adorable little girl's face, with glasses, it brings it home."" Yates remembered the isolation of being the weird kid at her high school. She was the teen who hit ""Star Trek"" conventions on weekends and got snide comments about it the rest of the week. She was the lone geek girl among her friends, mostly geeky boys. Bullying tragedies dominated headlines this year after a spate of suicides. Studies revealed how deeply the bullies at school, home or online can traumatize kids. The federal government laid out new anti-bullying guidelines for educators trying to combat the issue. It's tough to lay out anti-bullying rules for kids so young, but tougher still to know how to protect the bully's perennial target: geeks, nerds and anybody whose interests stray from the norm. Whole genres of pop culture are devoted to ridiculing them and Yates knew that Katie's story was how it starts. Katie isn't alone. Girl geeks are a growing force. ""We've all had those kinds of experiences, if you call yourself a geek,"" Yates said. ""It was about Katie, but it was about every girl out there, every geek out there. It transcended gender, it transcended age. ""I know a Katie. I was Katie."" So Yates did what any geek would -- she went back to her computer. ""My fellow geeks,"" she wrote on her blog, Epbot.com, ""I need your help."" 'You are not alone' Later that day, in yet another time zone, Catherine Taber clicked Yates' post about a little girl and her ""Star Wars"" water bottle -- Katie. Taber grew up on science fiction and fantasy, from Stephen King to ""Star Wars,"" but she wasn't bullied. She was an Army brat, always the new kid at school. With each new place, her parents reminded her to be whatever she wanted, and be proud to share it with the world. ""I immediately had to say something,"" Taber said. ""The whole theme of the 'Star Wars' universe is an anti-bullying theme. It's good versus evil, standing side by side with your friends, doing what's right. One of the most important things to stopping bullies in their tracks is to empower kids to stand up for themselves."" Taber found Katie's mom's blog, sent it to everyone she knew, and left a comment she hoped would help. ""I am [the] actress who has the great honor of being Padme Amidala on 'Star Wars: the Clone Wars!' I just wanted to tell Katie that she is in VERY good company being a female Star Wars fans,"" Taber wrote. ""I know that Padme would tell you to be proud of who YOU are and know that you are not ALONE! ""THE FORCE is with you Katie!"" 'Part of a very tight community' Back in Evanston, Carrie Goldman was feeling good. Since she had written about the water bottle incident, other parents at Katie's school had talked to their kids. School leaders were supportive, and working on an anti-bullying program. Something else was happening, too: Traffic on Goldman's blog was exploding. Some 1,200 people had left messages there for Katie. Readers were coming from Yates' blog, where more than 3,000 more comments stacked up. There were links from ""Star Wars"" message boards, parenting blogs, tech sites. A Twitter hashtag, #maytheforcebewithkatie, streaked across social media. Guys and gals of all ages wrote about how they'd been bullied, and how life had gotten so much better since then. They shared that they loved ""Star Wars,"" that they wore glasses, that they were adopted -- just like Luke, just like Leia, just like Katie. ThinkGeek, a nerdy online retailer, sent Katie a lightsaber. Artist Scott Zirkel sent a cartoon of Katie as a Jedi, glasses and all. A first-grade class in California sent letters to Katie as a show of support. Taber and the rest of the cast of ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"" sent ""Star Wars"" merch. Ashley Eckstein, who voices the female Jedi Ahsoka Tano, sent Her Universe clothes tailored for girls. Tom Kane, who voices Yoda, escorted the Goldmans to a screening near their home. The thousands of comments left online will be bound into a book for Katie to read whenever she needs it. To keep a sense of normality at home, the family reads just a few every night. Katie, and her parents, have learned that the universe is so much bigger than the first grade. ""You realize how, if you want someone who has something in common, all you have to do is reach out,"" Goldman said. ""It feels really, really good. What we want is for it to feel good for other people."" Katie is donating many of the books and toys to other kids. A fan created a Facebook event suggesting that people wear ""Star Wars"" gear on December 10 to support Katie. The Goldmans also asked participants to donate Star Wars toys to charities for the holidays. About 20,000 people have signed up. ""What strikes me is how these individuals who were once so isolated are now part of a very tight community,"" Goldman wrote on her blog this month. ""They have found each other; they are plugged into each other, and they have each other's backs. Now they have Katie's back, too."" Katie isn't doing any more interviews. There are scales to practice, Spanish words to memorize, baby sisters to play with. She still has to wear the dreaded eye patch, and eat lunch with the kids in her class. She is very busy being 7. But on December 10, her school will host Proud To Be Me Day. Kids will be encouraged to wear something that shows what they're interested in, whether it's princesses, sports, animals and anime. Katie will have the force of thousands behind her, and a ""Star Wars"" water bottle.","Katie Goldman, 7, was pressured at school for liking ""Star Wars""

"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is no wallflower when it comes to public speaking. She's known for passionate proclamations on national television and rapid-fire online posts about her work. But it's been almost a month since her last public appearance and 33 days since her last Twitter post, prompting critics to question who's in charge of the South American country. Close aides to Fernandez have dismissed such concerns, stressing that she's the one making the government calls. ""The President is present every day, working with us,"" Cabinet Secretary Jorge Capitanich told reporters earlier this month, according to the state-run Telam news agency. Fernandez went on medical leave in October so doctors could perform emergency surgery to remove a blood clot on the surface of her brain. She officially returned to work in November and appeared at a series of events in December. But now, with Fernandez largely out of public view once again, speculation has surged about her whereabouts, and her health. ""If we hadn't had the President's illness just a few months ago, one would discard it. But the problem is the rumor has been established, and the sense of uncertainty of not knowing why,"" said Orlando D'Adamo, director of the Center of Public Opinion at the University of Belgrano in Buenos Aires. ""Is it a political strategy? Is she making room for a new candidate for 2015? Is it because she does not want to face difficult situations for the government? We do not know."" Others think Fernandez is taking a break to take care of her health and not face a similar fate as her husband, former President Nestor Kirchner, who died in 2010 after suffering a heart attack. ""I think she does not want to repeat that story,"" said Enrique Zuleta, another political analyst. As Argentina has faced high inflation and other challenges in recent weeks, Capitanich was the public face of the government. On the streets of Buenos Aires, residents say they have felt the President's absence. ""There are many problems that require a solution, and there is no clear response from her,"" worker Gabriel Blanco said. Merchant Nelida Jorquera said she was worried about the situation. ""But I think she is a serious person, and she would not deceive the people,"" she said. CNN's Jose Manuel Rodriguez reported from Buenos Aires. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.","It's been nearly a month since Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's last appearance .

"(CNN) -- Marc Marquez, Spain's racing prodigy, finished fourth in the Czech MotoGP Sunday ending his hopes of winning a record eleven races in a row. His Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa won his first race of the season in Brno, where he also won in 2012. Yamaha duo Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi finished second and third respectively. ""I was able to do a good race, I'm happy, I had a good pace and it's another podium,"" Rossi said after the race. ""It was a great pleasure to beat Marc one time."" Before the race all eyes were on Marquez and whether he could beat Italian legend Giacomo Agostini's record of winning the first ten races of the 1968, 1969 and 1970 seasons. Whilst a race season only lasted ten races back then, no one has won the first eleven in the modern era. But his Spanish teammate Pedrosa instead prevailed, a victory that British two-time World Superbike Champion James Toseland believes will stand Marquez in good stead. ""I think everyone appreciates the dedication he puts in,"" Toseland said in an interview with CNN's World Sport. ""He's a World Champion at 20, but he's been at it for 15 years ... The handcuffs are off with that fourth place. Now Marc can relax. He can't win them all now.""

Then Eisenbud had a low-paying job liaising with young players' parents at the Bradenton academy that IMG bought off Bollettieri, but now he's Vice President of Tennis at the world's leading sports agency -- having made a fortune not only for Sharapova but also China's most bankable tennis star, Li Na, the No. 2 earner on Forbes' 2012 female athlete list. ""As an agent you just get lucky sometimes, and I'm just a really lucky guy,"" said the 41-year-old agent. ""I just really try not to mess it up!"" Deal maker . His lucky day came on July 3, 2004 when the 17-year-old Sharapova stunned Serena Williams -- and the tennis world -- in the Wimbledon final to win her first grand slam title. With her model looks and youthful charm, blue-chip sponsors fell over themselves to get a piece of the action. Forbes magazine reported that Sharapova earned almost $28 million in the year up until June 2012 -- $22 million of that was from endorsements. They might make something of an odd duo, with the glamorous Sharapova standing at 6 foot 2 inches and Eisenbud, a short, balding man from New Jersey, but as a business partnership they have the perfect synergy. ""We've just been very open and honest and real, and he's someone who says it like it is,"" said Sharapova, who like Eisenbud was born in April -- but 15 years apart. ""I think that's one of the greatest things that I appreciate in people, and he's done that from the very beginning. He understood the dynamic of me being the athlete, of working for me. ""Agents have much bigger jobs than just everyday life -- booking planes, looking into your agenda -- of course he's trying to make you money and make you big deals, but at the end of the day, he does everything for me. ""He has this old-fashioned calendar and just looks at every date. He knows my schedule, exactly when I'm flying to this tournament, when I'll be back, when we can fit this in. ""He knows my training hours so there are some things that I prioritize over others, and there are certainly some shoots creatively that I would like to do and he's like, 'We just don't have time for it', so I have to ax that out, but we usually agree on many things."" While Sharapova is comfortable on the red carpet and at celebrity parties, her manager is happier making deals. ""He's constantly looking at his BlackBerry ... if you need to get his attention, you should probably send him an email. That's the way I see our relationship,"" she said. ""He's very good at some things; others he's just absolutely hopeless at, like if you go to an event and you're on the red carpet, he has no idea what's going on. ""He's like 'Hey' and he's talking to all these people and you're like, 'OK, where am I going? Am I doing interviews? Or a step and repeat? What's going on?' ""That's not his forte. His thing is getting on the phone, getting deals done, getting the schedule together. All those business decisions, so there are things that I know I need to bring in other people for."" Super agent . Eisenbud sees his role as a juggler of commitments. ""I think I'm more of a facilitator, an organizer. I know when to bring things to her because she's in the middle of a tournament, and when she needs to stay focused some more, so it's not distracting her tennis,"" he says. ""I think that's kind of my skill. We do probably anywhere between 30 and 75 emails a day between us, so sometimes we don't even need to talk on the phone. She just sets the vision and I'm just able to try to do my best to try and follow her vision."" From clothing and cosmetics to her latest foray -- a self-funded candy line -- Sharapova has a strong business strategy. ""If I didn't want to play tennis again, I'd have enough money to live for the rest of my life but I do respect the money that I've made because I didn't grow up having a lot of money,"" said Sharapova, whose parents fled their native Belarus soon after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident, just before she was born. Her father accompanied her to the United States in 1994, taking low-paying jobs before she enrolled at the $35,000-a-year IMG academy on a scholarship, aged nine. ""My family never had it, so I'm always very respectful for every single dollar that I make to this day. I really came from nothing,"" she said. ""I was living a normal, average, everyday life back in Russia and we had a dream and I had a talent and we moved to the U.S. ""Of course I'm so lucky and fortunate to have and earn great money but at the end of the day, we did earn it with my parents and their hard work and their sacrifices and all the hours on the court."" Eisenbud may work with other players -- he has a group of young hopefuls as well as Li -- but he says Sharapova will always be his focus. He's been there from her early highs, to the lowest of the lows when it seemed a shoulder injury would end her career back in 2008. ""I've been with her so long, to see her smiling on the court, there's nothing better,"" he said, with Sharapova this year winning the Indian Wells title in March and last Sunday beating Li in the Stuttgart final to retain her title. ""It's pretty hard for me. I know too much information that other people don't. I know what's on the line, where we are with different things and what wins would mean, so I get a little nervous."" With Li also earning big deals, Eisenbud is akin to football's ""super agents"" such as Jorge Mendes, who works with Cristiano Ronaldo and Jose Mourinho. ""Rather than competing against one another, Sharapova and Na actually provide Eisenbud's business with much greater global coverage,"" British sports business expert Simon Chadwick told CNN. ""There is a degree of overlap in that they are both global tennis stars, whom the general public are aware of. This poses issues of clarity, focus and targeting for Eisenbud. ""However, as brands, they are significantly different propositions, which means that they are likely to appeal to different groups of people in different countries around the world."" Life after tennis . It was last year's French Open success that really crowned Sharapova's comeback, having been written off after a long struggle to rebuild her career following that shoulder operation. ""That was emotional, I definitely had a lot of tears,"" Eisenbud recalled. ""I was with her when she had the shoulder surgery, I was there when she woke up, I saw her first rehabs, I saw all the tough times, I heard all the journalists writing her off, Pam Shriver saying she'll never win a grand slam again, all the people just 'never never never.' ""If I'm seeing it I'm sure she's seeing it, so when she was able to win that -- get on her knees and win that French Open -- that was just a lot of, 'I told you so' and 'don't count me out.' ""Here's a great champion that had all the money in the world, all the glory, all the titles, but she wanted to come back and win, and it just says a lot about her."" But the injury did turn Sharapova's thoughts to life after tennis, and the resulting launch last year of her ""Sugarpova"" candy was her first independent business project. ""There's a lot of downtime on the tour and she uses it a lot,"" Eisenbud said. ""She's involved in everything she does, she's not a silent owner -- she runs and drives everything that she's doing and I just try to implement it while she's on the court. ""Everything we've been doing now for the last couple of years has been thinking about life after tennis. We didn't want her career to end and then all of a sudden start thinking about it. ""I think Sugarpova will be a huge business for her after tennis. She'll be getting into a lot of different things -- cosmetics, fragrance, clothing -- so I think it's just the beginning right now for her.""","Tennis star Maria Sharapova is the world's highest-paid female athlete.

"(CNN) -- Want to ""Walk the Line"" where Johnny Cash once played as a child? Before he changed the music industry with songs like ""Ring of Fire"" and ""Folsom Prison Blues,"" Johnny Cash spent his hardscrabble childhood in the small community of Dyess, Arkansas. The Johnny Cash Boyhood Home, the newest of Arkansas State University's Heritage Sites, opens Saturday for public tours after a restoration project that includes other historic buildings. When visitors walk into the home, they are stepping back into the 1930s. Cash family artifacts original to the home include the piano that belonged to Johnny's mother, his father's shaving mug and even the original flooring in his childhood bedroom and the living room. The living room linoleum still has burn marks caused by the wood-burning stove. Other furnishings and objects are of the time period and mostly contributed by donors, said Ruth Hawkins, director of Arkansas Heritage Sites at Arkansas State University. They are based on the photos and memories of Tommy Cash and Joanne Cash Yates, two of Johnny Cash's siblings. Period details include a pedestal sewing machine, a battery-operated radio like one Johnny Cash would play at night and the living-room sofa. The period icebox and corner cabinet were painted the apple-green color the siblings remember. The Dyess Colony was a federal agricultural resettlement community created in 1934, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program in response to the Great Depression. The colony provided homes and jobs for about 500 poor farm families, including the Cash family. Johnny, called JR at the time, was 3 years old when his family moved into a Dyess home in 1935. Johnny spent his childhood in Dyess, attending school and church in the town. He also suffered an enormous loss when his brother Jack was killed in a sawmill accident in 1944. Cash left ""JR"" behind and became Johnny when he left Arkansas for the Air Force in 1950. Arkansas was an important influence on Cash, who told audiences how ""Five Feet High and Rising"" and many of his other songs were influenced by his time living in Dyess. ""The little church in Dyess, Arkansas, has been such an inspiration to me, and (so have) the people from Dyess,"" Cash said at the 40th reunion of Dyess High School in 1990, in a video exhibited at the Dyess Colony Museum. Cash died in 2003, leaving four daughters from his first marriage to Vivian Liberto. Cash and his second wife, singer June Carter Cash, had a son together. June Carter Cash died earlier in 2003. The annual Johnny Cash Music Festival, which starts on Friday in nearby Jonesboro, has raised almost $2 million to fund the restoration project. Headliners for this year's sold-out festival include Reba McEntire, Bobby Bare and Loretta Lynn, who are donating their performances, as have artists in previous years. With the restoration of Cash's childhood home and nearby Dyess Colony Administration Building complete, work has already begun on the restoration of the historic Dyess Theatre adjacent to the administration building, to be used as a visitor center. In his 1997 autobiography, ""Cash,"" he credited his state with inspiring his music. ""Back in Arkansas, a way of life produced a certain kind of music.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Karl Rove, often described as President George W. Bush's brain, defended the former president in a new book against claims that he lied to the American public in order to invade Iraq in 2003. ""[D]id Bush lie us into war? Absolutely not,"" Rove wrote in his 516-page book, ""Courage and Consequence: My Life as a Conservative in the Fight."" The book highlights Rove's life and career and his time working for Bush. Rove, a long-time political advisor who joined Bush in the White House after the 2000 campaign, said the U.S. wouldn't have gone to war with Iraq if the administration knew that weapons of mass destruction wouldn't be found. ""Would the Iraq War have occurred without WMD? I doubt it,"" he wrote. ""Congress was very unlikely to have supported the use-of-force resolution without the threat of WMD. The Bush administration itself would probably have sought other ways to constrain Saddam, bring about regime change, and deal with Iraq's horrendous human rights violations."" Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, Rove argued, may have destroyed most of his WMD stockpiles or possibly moved them to other countries such as Syria before the war. ""But I am under no illusions; the failure to find stockpiles of WMD did great damage to the administration's credibility,"" he wrote. ""Our weak response in defense of the president and in setting the record straight, is, I believe, one of the biggest mistakes of the Bush years."" He goes on to say, ""So who was responsible for the failure to respond? I was. I should have stepped forward, rung the warning bell, and pressed for full-scale response. I didn't."" Enhanced Interrogation . Rove discusses the Bush administration's support for the controversial interrogation technique known as waterboarding, which Democrats and others have described as torture. He defends the use of enhanced interrogation techniques (EITs), arguing they were authorized by the Department of Justice in August 2002 and signed off by then-CIA director George Tenet. He also disputes claims that the administration failed to brief members of Congress on the use of these techniques. ""When these techniques were first authorized, Democratic leaders had been briefed about them. Their silence made them complicit in their use,"" he wrote. ""Nonetheless, when political winds shifted and memories of 9/11 faded, some Democratic leaders claimed that they had never been told about the techniques and that the Bush administration used EITs only in secret."" He singled out House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, who charged in July 2009 that the CIA misled Congress in a secret briefing she received in 2002. Pelosi said the CIA failed to inform her and others at the briefing about harsh interrogation techniques being used on terrorism suspects. The CIA responded by saying Pelosi was told about the harsh techniques, including waterboarding, at the classified 2002 briefing. As for whether the techniques were actually torture, Rove says the president ""never authorized torture,"" but rather ""did just the opposite"" by making sure the techniques ""did not cross the legal line into torture."" ""What's more, EITs did help our intelligence agents gather critical information to thwart future attacks,"" he added. Hurricane Katrina . Bush and his administration have been criticized for their response to Hurricane Katrina, which devastated much of the Gulf Coast in 2005. One incident Rove addresses in the book involves Bush flying over Louisiana in Air Force One rather than landing and surveying the damage. Rove says he was ""one of the people responsible for this mistake,"" and argued that the president shouldn't land in New Orleans in the immediate aftermath so as not to hinder relief efforts, but rather come back days later. Rove notes that while the decision did not help out Bush politically, it was the right thing to do so as not to take away vital resources that were needed for the relief effort. Bush DUI . Rove cites a particularly touchy subject that emerged during the 2000 presidential campaign: Bush's 1976 arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. Rove said that while Bush told a few people about it,  including himself, the governor didn't want it to be made public. The DUI disclosure, which came out shortly before Election Day, was ""suspicious,"" Rove says. He points a finger at Vice President Al Gore's campaign spokesman, Chris Lehane, as a possible source of the information getting out. ""[W]e had our suspicions and they centered on Lehane,"" Rove writes. ""He had been raised in Kennebunk, was one of the Democratic Party's best opposition researchers, had run the Maine campaign for Clinton-Gore, worked on the White House rapid-response team handling scandals during the Clinton years, played around in Maine Democratic politics ..."" Cheney as a running mate . Dick Cheney, a Defense Secretary under President George H.W. Bush and former Wyoming congressman, was tasked to help then-candidate Bush picking a running mate. Some of the potential running mates that Bush and his campaign considered included former Sen. John Danforth of Missouri, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, along with Sens. Jon Kyl of Arizona and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, among others. But it would be Cheney's name that would resonate with Bush at the time. Rove says the governor was ""starting to feel that Cheney was as good as any"" to fill the role. ""Bush had become impressed with Cheney's thoroughness as head of the VP search and the intelligence and insights he offered in meetings ... Bush liked Cheney's straightforward manner and his ability to question the fundamental premise of an argument,"" Rove writes. Rove also confronts rumors in the book that Cheney picked himself, saying that accusation is ""far-fetched."" ""I saw the man squirm as Bush pressed him to accept,"" he wrote. Valerie Plame . Rove writes that the low point for him personally during the Bush presidency was when reporters were camped out at his home and he faced a possible indictment over leaking CIA operative Valerie Plame's name to the media -- an accusation he denies in the book. Upon finding out that prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was not likely to charge him, he says he ""placed the receiver in its cradle and wept."" John Edwards . Rove also wrote that he was most worried in the 2004 re-election campaign about then-Sen. John Edwards, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination that year. ""He was a fresh face, articulate and engaging, and attractive to the point of being almost too pretty,"" Rove wrote. ""He was a product of the South, which had helped Bill Clinton a dozen years before."" But Rove also charged that Edwards was unprincipled, flip-flopped on issues and was somewhat vain. ""Edwards also seemed inordinately in love with his looks, his voice, with himself,"" Rove said. Rove's memoir goes beyond the Bush years, his criticism of the media and Democrats. He also takes readers back to his childhood and opens up about how he dealt with his mother's suicide.","In new book, Karl Rove says U.S. would not have gone to war if WMDs wouldn't be found .

"(CNN) -- Instant messaging, texting, Facebook, and ... ""Call of Duty?"" The ""Call of Duty"" games effectively adapt to changing communication habits, Bobby Kotick, the CEO of game publisher Activision, told CNN on Tuesday. And that could be the smoking gun in the franchise's takeover of the video-game industry. The latest entry in the console-game series, ""Call of Duty: Black Ops,"" has netted more than $1 billion in sales worldwide since it came out on November 9, Activision announced on Tuesday. In that time, gamers have spent 600 million hours with the game, the company said. ""More people play 'Black Ops' every day than watch Jay Leno, David Letterman and Jimmy Fallon, combined,"" Kotick boasted. ""The audience of 'Call of Duty' is probably greater in terms of size ... than in any other interactive form of entertainment."" Activision didn't invent war games or first-person shooters. Even today, the genre continues to attract new big-budget entrants. On Tuesday, Electronics Arts released ""Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Vietnam."" Yet it's the ""Call of Duty"" games that attract blockbuster openings and fervent support. By some estimates, ""Black Ops"" had the biggest five-day opening in revenue of any entertainment debut in history. The ""Call of Duty"" games generally feature compelling, cinematic storylines. In ""Black Ops,"" soldiers are tasked with assassinating Cuban leader Fidel Castro. But it's the competitive play that draws the biggest crowds, Kotick said. Some 60% of traffic coming through Microsoft's Xbox Live online gaming service is from ""Call of Duty"" games, where players can take each other on, he said. ""The multiplayer is really the thing that has changed the game in such a meaningful way,"" Kotick said. Instead of getting together to watch a movie, some people huddle around the living-room game console, or strap on a headset and chat online with friends across town or across the country over some gunfire. ""If you look at the 500 million people who are on Facebook and the way that people text each other and instant message and use video chat, there is now an evolution of media,"" Kotick said. ""Those are the characteristics and attributes that a generation and audiences feel are very important to their media and entertainment experiences. And we expect that."" ""Call of Duty"" delivers on that trend, he said. These games can be as integral to the social lives of young people, especially males, as any other form of digital communication. Kotick rattled off various factors he says make the ""Call of Duty"" franchise stand out from competitors -- ""production value, the level of polish,"" that ""no detail gets left unaltered,"" he said. Perhaps most important is ""the sophistication and capability of the multiplayer matchup,"" Kotick said. ""Black Ops"" credits Activision's Treyarch studio as the primary developer. The game came under scrutiny from video-game critics after a shakeup at Infinity Ward, the developer most often associated with the franchise. Activision fired two executives from Infinity Ward for ""wrongdoing"" -- ""so wrong that you were left with no choice"" but to dismiss them, Kotick said. Their positions have since been filled after the company was flooded with about 5,000 résumés, Kotick said. ""Multiplayer has been largely developed by Treyarch,"" even in games like ""Modern Warfare,"" which were credited to Infinity Ward, Kotick said. ""I don't think Treyarch got their due for how much they contributed in the production and polish to the multiplayer."" Future ""Call of Duty"" games may borrow some things from Activision Blizzard's other massive franchise, ""World of Warcraft,"" Kotick said. For example, developers should constantly mold their games based on audience feedback, he said. ""Blizzard really created the model for how to do this successfully and effectively, making sure the community of 'World of Warcraft' players has incredible influence on the future of the product,"" Kotick said. ""There's so much more that we can deliver to our players.""","""Call of Duty"" effectively adapts to changing communication habits, says Activision's CEO .

"(CNN) -- If you're handing over cash for a heavily discounted iPad from some random guy in a McDonald's parking lot or at a gas station, then yes, you should consider your purchase a risk. But when you're like Suzanne Nassise and you buy Apple's popular tablet from a well-known retailer, you expect it to be legit. Nassise says she walked out of a Walmart in Brockton, Massachusetts, last month with what she believed was a new $499 iPad. When she got home and opened the box, she told CNN affiliate WCVB, she thought, ""'Wow, it's a little on the light side -- Apple's an elegant product.'"" Then she tried to turn it on. When nothing happened, Nassise looked at the plastic rectangle more closely. The imitation iPad -- an iFake, if you will -- tried to replicate a real iPad's charging port and speakers, the latter of which were small, painted-on dots. ""When I realized it, I was upset,"" she told WCVB. ""I just paid $500 for a paperweight."" If her story sounds familiar, it's because it has happened at retailers in a variety of states over the past few years. Numerous shoppers have purchased what they thought were iPads, only to open the box and find a worthless decoy inside. To make matters worse, some stores have refused to give refunds on the grounds that the buyers might have been trying to scam them. The majority of news reports on the problem have involved iPad purchases at Walmart, although other retailers are not immune. In December 2010, the year the first iPad hit shelves, a man in Dorchester, Massachusetts, said he spent $800 at a local Best Buy on an iPad that turned out to be fake. The store said the same thing had happened to five or six other people, he told his local NBC station, WHDH. The next year, Ken Lemal told a similar story after the businessman purchased what he thought was an iPad from a Walmart in Woodstock, Georgia. Like Nassise, Lemal's iPad was packaged in a way that suggested he was buying a product straight from the manufacturer. ""I think that probably somebody switched (the iPad) and took it back with the cellophane and everything,"" Lemal told CNN in a recent interview. ""An employee says, 'Oh it's wrapped up, we'll stick it back in inventory,' and it gets sold to somebody else. I think that's what happens."" That same year in Vancouver, British Columbia, several iPad shoppers at Future Shop and Best Buy stores said they opened the Apple packaging to find plastic bags filled with modeling clay. Last November, a man in Miami accidentally gave his wife a fake iPad for her birthday, thinking he'd spent $480 on the real deal. In January, a woman in Randolph, New Jersey, said that she, too, wound up with a fake Apple tablet after shopping at her neighborhood Walmart. ""When I got home and opened the box, I thought it was a real iPad,"" Jamie Frick told the Newark Star-Ledger. ""I took out the charger and then tried to plug it in the iPad, and that is when I started to notice everything."" So how is this fraud happening? Retail chains aren't saying. But the prevailing theory begins with a scam artist buying an iPad, replacing it with something of similar size and weight and then repackaging the box so it looks ready for the sales floor once again. Then the person returns the box for a refund. Other speculation has focused on unscrupulous store employees raiding storerooms to make similar swaps. Walmart at first declined to offer Nassise, the Massachusetts woman, an exchange or refund because of a policy against returned merchandise that has been unwrapped. But after the local ABC station got involved, Nassise eventually received a refund for her purchase. Walmart spokesperson Dianna Gee said the company is aware of the problem and is working to address it. ""We're actively reviewing our transactional records, and then going back and looking at the video that matches up with that to determine how this product is getting back on our shelves,"" she said. ""If it appears that it is fraudulent, we will share all that information with local law enforcement."" Best Buy, which has seen similar fake-iPad episodes, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Walmart's Gee recommends that iPad shoppers open the box and check the tablet carefully before making a purchase. Lemal's experience made him wary of purchasing items from anyone other than the manufacturer. But he did learn a valuable lesson: Double-check the serial number on the box. ""If you have an issue, don't rely on the retailer to just check the item that's inside the box; call Apple and verify the serial number that's on the box itself,"" he said. ""Either require them to do it while there, or when you get home ... (that will tell you) if it had been sold prior to your date of purchase.""","A Massachusetts woman says an iPad she bought from Walmart was fake .

"(CNN) -- An 84-year-old man shoots his son. So what does his grandson do, according to authorities, in his own father's defense? Shoot -- fatally, it turns out -- his grandfather. That's what authorities said happened Monday night in Kittrell, a small North Carolina town of less than 500 people located about 35 miles south of the Virginia border. Vance County sheriff's deputies responded around 7 p.m. to an address there after getting a call about a fight, Sheriff Peter White said in a news release. When they got there, deputies found two people shot. One was Lloyd Woodlief, 84, who lived at the Kittrell home, according to White. He had been shot once with a 12-gauge shotgun and ""died shortly thereafter,"" the sheriff said. His son, 49-year-old Lloyd Peyton Woodlief, had been shot with a 22-caliber pistol, added White. The resident of nearby Henderson, North Carolina, was being treated at Duke Medical Center in Durham as of Tuesday afternoon. The other person involved was the 11-year-old grandson of Lloyd Woodlief. White said a preliminary investigation indicates that Lloyd Woodlief first shot his son. Then the 11-year-old boy shot his grandfather. Charges are pending, the sheriff added, though he didn't specify who might be charged, or with what. Deputy's fatal shooting of boy carrying fake rifle ruled lawful .

"(CNN)  -- The would-be assassin of Saudi Arabia's Prince Mohammed bin Nayef hid his bomb in his underwear, apparently believing that cultural taboos would prevent a search in that part of his body, according to a Saudi government official close to the investigation. Saudi Arabia's Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, head of counterterrorism, was slightly injured in August. The prince was slightly injured when the bomb exploded in the August attack. Several news reports this week have said the assailant hid the bomb inside his rectum, but according to the Saudi official, the government assessment discounted those reports, based on various factors. Among them: When the bomb went off there was a flash of light, suggesting that the bomb was not hidden inside the assassin's body. Also, doctors consulted by the government judged that the toxicity of the plastic explosives would make them hard to hold for many hours inside the rectum, and the environment in this area of the body would make detonation ""difficult,"" according to the Saudi official close to the investigation. The Saudis said they think the bomb weighed 100 grams and was made with a plastic explosive, to avoid detection by metal detectors through which the would-be assassin had to pass before he was allowed to meet with the prince. The official said the explosive was PETN, which was used by the so-called shoe bomber Richard Reid, who attempted to blow up an American Airlines flight between Paris, France, and Miami, Florida, in December 2001. The Saudis are exploring the possibility that the prince's assailant exploded the device using a detonator that used a chemical fuse, which would not be detected by a metal detector. The would-be assassin -- a Saudi member of al Qaeda who had fled to Yemen, identified as Abdullah Hassan al Asiri -- posed as a member of the terror group willing to surrender personally to Prince Nayef. Prince Nayef is responsible for overseeing the kingdom's terrorist rehabilitation program, and some two dozen important members of al Qaeda previously have surrendered to him in person, according to the Saudi government official. During the month of Ramadan, traditionally a time of repentance in the Muslim world, al Asiri gained an audience with the prince at his private residence in Jeddah, presenting himself as someone who could also persuade other militants to surrender. Under the cover of pretending that he was reaching out to other militants to surrender, al Asiri briefly called other members of al Qaeda to tell them that he was standing by Prince Nayef. After finishing the call, the bomb blew up, killing al Asiri but only slightly injuring the prince, who was a few feet away from his would-be assassin. The Saudi government official characterized the prince's narrow escape as a ""miracle.""","Source: Man hid bomb in underwear, believing he wouldn't be searched there .

"(CNN) -- Move over, Steve Rogers. Let the Falcon take wing. The Falcon, aka Sam Wilson, is taking over as Captain America from Rogers, Marvel announced Wednesday. The new hero isn't just far younger than Rogers, who ""must surrender his blues for a sturdy cane,"" Paul Montgomery wrote on Marvel.com; he's also an African-American very much in tune with the modern world. ""While Sam shares many of Steve's beliefs in a general sense, he's also a very different person with a very different background,"" editor Tom Brevoort said on the website. ""He didn't grow up in the 1930s, he's a modern-day man in touch with the problems of the 21st century. For most of his professional life, Sam has worked as a social worker, so he's seen the worst of urban society up close, and how crime, poverty, lack of social structure and opportunity can affect the community."" The Falcon debuted in 1969 in ""Captain America"" #117. He was Marvel's first mainstream African-American superhero.

"(CNN) -- Two Las Vegas police officers were were shot and killed along with a civilian bystander late Sunday morning by a gun-toting duo declaring ""revolution,"" authorities say. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police spokeswoman Laura Meltzer says the attackers -- one male and one female -- opened fire inside of a CiCi's Pizza location at 11:30 a.m, killing the officers as they ate lunch, she said. Clark County Sheriff Douglas Gillespie identified the slain officers as 41-year-old Alyn Beck and 31-year-old Igor Soldo. Beck, a 13-year LVMPD veteran, leaves behind a wife and three children. Soldo, who also leaves behind a wife and baby, joined the force in 2006. The names of the suspects have not been released, and a motive is not known, but witnesses told police that the shooters said ""this is a revolution."" After killing the officers, Meltzer said the pair then went across the street and into a Walmart, where they killed a female at the store's entrance. Her name has not yet been released. As police converged on Walmart, Gillespie says the female suspect shot the male suspect before turning the gun on herself. The city's public figures were quick to condemn the violence. ""This was a senseless and cruel act killing three innocent people, two who dedicated their lives to protecting all of us in our community and one who was innocently going about her daily life"" said Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman. ""I am devastated by the news today of two officers and an innocent bystander who were murdered in an act of senseless violence,"" added Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval. My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families."" Both Walmart and CiCi's issued statements expressing condolences. ""We express our deepest condolences to everyone who have been affected by this senseless act of violence,"" said Walmart spokesperson Brooke Buchanan. ""We are deeply saddened by this tragic event and our hearts go out to the families and friends of the officers,"" said Geoff Goodman of CiCi's.

"(CNN) -- House Republicans are going forward with plans to sue President Barack Obama and will base their legal case on the sweeping health care law he championed and they despise. Speaker John Boehner said the suit, which also highlights an ironic Obamacare twist, will follow the argument Obama violated the Constitution by circumventing Congress and alone delaying the law's requirement for businesses to provide coverage. ""In 2013, the President changed the health care law without a vote of Congress, effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it,"" Boehner said in a statement. ""That's not the way our system of government was designed to work. No president should have the power to make laws on his or her own,"" he added. The Republican-led House is expected to vote on a resolution authorizing legal action against the President over Obamacare at the end of the month, just before lawmakers head home for August to campaign for midterm votes. Boehner then is expected to hire attorneys to actually file the suit in federal court. But the timing of that is unclear. The Rules Committee plans to hold a hearing on the matter with outside legal experts. White House calls it a 'stunt' The White House expressed disappointment in a statement, saying Boehner and Republicans are wasting time and taxpayer resources on a ""political stunt."" ""As the President said today, he is doing his job -- lawsuit or not -- and it's time Republicans in Congress did theirs,"" the statement said. Obama defiantly challenged Republicans last week, saying he would continue to take steps he felt were necessary with or without the support of congressional Republicans. ""So sue me,"" he dared them. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi also dismissed the suit as a political ""stunt."" The case magnifies a toxic partisan climate that has engulfed Congress and come to define Obama's relations with Republicans in general. Some arch-conservatives in the party want him impeached. Pushing forward . Boehner doesn't agree with such a step, but he's plowing ahead with an unusual legal challenge built around Republican claims Obama has abused his authority at the expense of the legislative process. Boehner's staff has consulted experts and considered several options for the legal basis needed to make the case. Another key area of contention was Obama's move in 2012 to defer deportations of children who enter the country illegally -- a hot button issue today with thousands of minors crossing the southern border unaccompanied. Also, environmental regulations and the Taliban prisoner exchange that freed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl were criticized. But a senior House Republican leadership aide said the health care case gives the House ""the best chance of success in the courts."" So far, the House has passed two bills aimed at curbing executive orders. Neither has gone anywhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Must prove harm . Many legal experts have already said any lawsuit of this kind would face challenges. In order for it to be formally considered by the courts, House Republicans must prove that the chamber was somehow injured as an institution. Obamacare has been a partisan flashpoint since it's passage in 2010 with no GOP support. The House has approved dozens of bills aiming to weaken or repeal it. The Obama administration a year ago postponed a requirement that businesses with more than 50 workers provide their employees with health insurance. The so-called employer mandate now won't take effect until 2015. Ironically, the same lawmakers pressing the lawsuit on Thursday actually voted on House legislation a year ago that would have delayed the mandate. But pushing that measure through the Democratic-controlled Senate would have required debate, possibly other changes, and a likely delay just as the administration was gearing up to put the measure into practice. Justifying the apparent contradiction of suing the President over taking action they actually supported initially, Republican aides said it is up to Congress to make those changes in law, not the President. Not personal . Another centerpiece of the initiative required individual Americans to obtain health insurance from Obamacare or on the private market, or face a possible fine. So far 9 million people have signed up for plans under the health law, the administration has said. It's the signature domestic policy achievement of Obama's presidency so far and a rallying cry for Republicans, especially on the midterm campaign trail. Earlier in the day, Boehner argued a suit wasn't simply a personal issue, but a move to defend Congress as an equal branch of government. ""It's not about Republicans versus Democrats. This is about the legislative branch that's being disadvantaged by the executive branch. And it's not about executive actions. Every president does executive orders,"" Boehner said. Saying most presidents act lawfully, Boehner said Obama ""is basically rewriting law to make it fit his own needs."" Read the resolution (PDF) Boehner op-ed: Why we must now sue the President .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A man arrested at Sandra Bullock's Los Angeles home allegedly was inside for more than an hour before police were called early Sunday. Joshua James Corbett, 39, also owned an illegal machine gun, although he did not have it with him when he allegedly broke into the actress's home, a Los Angeles prosecutor said Tuesday. Corbett, from Montrose, California, was charged Tuesday with felony counts of residential burglary, stalking and possession of a machine gun, according to Deputy District Attorney Wendy Segall. Corbett entered a not guilty plea during a brief court appearance Tuesday afternoon. The judge set his bond at $185,000. Corbett allegedly climbed a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire to enter Bullock's West Los Angeles property and enter her home at about 5 a.m. Sunday, according to Segall. Bullock was home at the time, but police have not said whether her young son also was there. Los Angeles police said they were not called to the home until 6:30 a.m., suggesting that the alleged burglar was inside for more than an hour while the actress slept. LAPD officers responding to a ""hot prowler"" call found Corbett outside of the house, but on the property, according to a police spokeswoman. The prosecutor would not give details about where investigators found the machine gun, saying only Corbett ""was not in possession of the machine gun at the time of the break-in."" No other information about Corbett has been released, although CNN confirmed through FAA records that he has a private pilot's license. CNN has been unable to identify a lawyer for Corbett. The charges carry a potential maximum seven years and four months in prison, if the suspect is convicted, Segall said. Bullock, who also has a home in Texas, was in Los Angeles over the weekend to receive the ""Decade of Hotness Award"" at the Guys Choice Awards. Her representatives did not respond to CNN requests for comment.","NEW: Joshua Corbett pleads not guilty, bond set at $185,000 .

"(CNN) -- A California entrepreneur is helping salvage the dream of a father and son from Indiana who died trying to pilot a plane around the world in a record-breaking quest for charity. Entrepreneur Ashar Aziz has donated the remaining half of the $1 million Babar Suleman and his 17-year-old son Haris were hoping to raise for a Pakistan charity that helps poor children go to school. The Sulemans' plane crashed into the Pacific Ocean near American Samoa on July 22, ending a voyage that was months in the making and would have taken the father-son duo on a 26,500 mile adventure around the world in 30 days in their single-engine plane. Had they completed the flight, the teenager would have been the youngest pilot to achieve the feat. ""I was deeply saddened and shocked to hear of the tragic end of Babar and Haris' fundraising mission,"" said entrepreneur Ashar Aziz. Aziz was a high school classmate and friend of Babar Suleman. ""I felt that the best way to honor this brave father and son duo was to complete their mission of raising $1 million for the charity that was dedicated to providing free education for the underprivileged."" The Sulemans were raising money for the Indiana-based group Seeds of Learning, which supports the work of The Citizens Foundation in Pakistan. They had raised half their goal when their Beechcraft Bonanza A36 crashed into the Pacific 23 miles from the island. In an interview with CNN affiliate WISH TV in June, only days before the pair set off, Babar Suleman, also a pilot, spoke of the importance of the work done by the Pakistan charity. The money raised, he said, would help open schools ""for underprivileged children who otherwise would not have a hope of getting an education and may even end up in the wrong hands."" Aziz said, ""Since this is a cause I also believe deeply in, it was only appropriate that I help complete my old friend and class-fellow's humanitarian mission."" Cookie Suleman, Babar Suleman's wife and Haris' mother, was ""really, really touched,"" according to Danial Noorani, spokesman for The Citizens Foundation, the parent organization of Seeds of Learning. The body of Haris Suleman was recovered after the crash, but his father is missing and presumed dead. Services for the teen were held Thursday in his hometown of Plainfield in central Indiana.","An Indiana father and son's dreams of raising $1 million for charity come true .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As he tries to woo independent voters, Sen. John McCain is relying on his image as a maverick, making it clear he's no President Bush. Sen. John McCain wants an end to the federal ban on offshore drilling, a reversal from his 2000 campaign. But the timing of Bush's support for offshore oil drilling this week may spell trouble for McCain's efforts to distance himself from the embattled White House. The president on Wednesday urged Democratic leaders in Congress to lift the ban on offshore drilling -- just as McCain has been making his own energy pitch for the same. ""The next president must be willing to break with the energy policies, not just of the current administration, but the administrations that preceded it, and lead a great national campaign to achieve energy security for America,"" McCain said Wednesday in Springfield, Missouri.  Map: See where drilling is and isn't allowed » . The senator from Arizona outlined an energy plan that would include lifting the ban on offshore drilling for oil, a reversal of his position during his 2000 campaign. His speech followed an address Tuesday in Houston, Texas, in which he also pushed offshore drilling. McCain and the president appear to be marching in lockstep on how to deal with $4 a gallon gas. They are demanding Democrats end the federal ban on offshore drilling, saying it could lead to a drop in oil prices given the expectation of increased supply.  Watch a McCain adviser describe the proposal » . ""I know the Democratic leaders have opposed some of these policies in the past,"" Bush said. ""Now that their opposition has helped drive gas prices to record levels, I ask them to reconsider their positions."" But Sen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, argues that offshore drilling will not help lower gas prices in the short term.  Watch an Obama supporter blast McCain's oil policy » . ""At best, you're looking at five years or more down the road. And even the most optimistic assumptions indicate that offshore drilling might reduce the overall world price of oil by a few cents,"" Obama has said. Obama's solution, a push for plug-in hybrid cars and other alternatives to oil, will not give consumers short-term relief either. Congressional Democrats are determined to block the president's push for offshore drilling, prohibited by a 1981 law and a 1990 executive order. ""When Congress lifts the legislative ban, I will lift the executive prohibition,"" Bush said.  Watch Bush make a case for new drilling » . The issue also makes for a fascinating family drama since the president's father, President George H.W. Bush, signed the order banning offshore drilling, while his brother Jeb more recently opposed such drilling when he was governor of Florida. Florida's current governor, Charlie Crist, has been an opponent of offshore drilling, but he now has an open mind about it since McCain's embrace. Crist's name has come up as a possible vice presidential running mate on the GOP ticket. ""It's the last thing in the world I'd like to do, but I also understand what people are paying at the pump, and I understand the drag it is on our economy,"" Crist told the St. Petersburg Times this week. ""Something has to be done in a responsible, pragmatic way."" In the long run, however, the fact that Bush has embraced this position on offshore oil drilling as well may make it more difficult for McCain to portray himself as an independent. McCain's stance also may hurt him in California, a state with 55 electoral votes. The proposal could put McCain at odds with environmentalists who say it is incongruous with his plans to combat global warning. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a McCain ally, also opposes offshore drilling. Schwarzenegger released a statement Wednesday saying he still does not believe it makes sense to have such drilling off the California coast. CNN's Ed Hornick contributed to this report.","Push for domestic offshore oil drilling is a reversal in policy for Sen. John McCain .

"(CNN) -- Looking for love is a big business in India, where the art of matchmaking is being transformed with a click of a mouse. One of the biggest online industries in India has been the business of arranging marriages. Sites like Shaadi.com, Jeevansathi and BharatMatrimony have had considerable success in recent years. Gaurav Mishra, director of digital and social media at MSL Group Asia, a communications company, estimated that some 10% of India's internet users have used a matrimonial website. He said: ""Online matrimonial sites were one of the earliest ways the internet took off in India after e-mail and job sites. Several of the sites have a couple of million users each."" India's online matrimonial industry is expected to bring in $63 million a year, according to a 2008 report by the market research firm Em Power. With internet use expected to boom in India in coming years -- internet penetration is currently only around 5%, according to Mishra, but he said the arrival of 3G services means that many of the country's 600 million mobile phone users will soon be online -- entrepreneurs are seeking new ways to tap the online matchmaking market. One start-up, Ignighter, set up by three 20-something New Yorkers, is hoping to persuade India that the future of online matchmaking is in group dating. Online dating hasn't really taken off in India, mainly because most marriages are arranged and there is little tradition of dating, according to Anupam Saxena, a correspondent for Medianama, which provides news and analysis on India's digital landscape. Mishra added: ""India is a conservative and traditional society, where people stay with their parents until they're married and there's not much room for personal lives. Women in particular find it difficult to openly date."" The founders of Ignighter hope that Indians will find group dating -- whereby groups of friends arrange to meet other groups -- less risky and more fun and socially acceptable than one-on-one dating. Their move into India was almost accidental. Ignighter was set up by Adam Sachs and his college friends in 2008. The site was aimed at the New York market, but they began to notice most of their traffic was coming from the other side of the world in Asia. Sachs said: ""At first we ignored it, but over the course of 2010, India emerged as our number one market. We started concentrating on marketing in India and it really took off."" Sachs said backers in the United States and India have invested $3 million in Ignighter, and that the site now has almost 2 million registered users in India. However, he refused to say how many of these users pay the $44.95 monthly fee required to contact other users. ""Up until now dating has been a rarity in India, but culture is changing and our timing just happens to be right,"" said Sachs. ""People are telling us they will go out with a group of friends and meet other friends while they are out. Women are saying that going out in a group makes them feel safer."" He added that Ignighter is considering dropping the word dating from the site to make it more socially acceptable. ""One challenge we face is that we call ourselves group dating,"" said Sachs. ""There's a stigma or taboo about the concept of dating that makes people cautious."" Mishra agreed that going out in groups was more socially acceptable in India than one-on-one dating, but still doubted many women would be willing to post profiles online. He said: ""I think group dating is a good idea because it's a safer way of dating for Asian markets. However, I don't see it working in India because I can't imagine Indian women doing it in any numbers."" He said that most profiles on matrimonial sites are created by fathers and brothers, rather than women themselves, and that 80% of Indian internet users are male. ""If women did go to online dating sites, they would be mobbed so many men they wouldn't go back,"" said Mishra. Sachs said 40% of Ignighter's registered users in India are women. Mishra added that social networking sites such as Facebook and Orkut, a site owned by Google, can be used for ""pseudo-dating."" Both Facebook and Orkut have 20 million users in India, he said. ""People sometimes use Facebook and Orkut as pseudo-dating sites to browse friends of friends and reach out to them, but mostly they don't make friends with complete strangers."" Saxena added that Indians would be reluctant to pay for a group dating site when they can use Facebook for free. He said: ""First of all, credit card penetration is low, especially among the age group for dating sites. Secondly, Indians will be hesitant to pay for something they can get for free on Facebook."" Sachs isn't deterred. He's currently in India recruiting staff for an Indian office, which will carry out focus groups to better tailor Ignighter to an Indian market. ""We need to improve the site itself and find out what needs to change for our demographic,"" he said.","Online matrimonial sites are forecast to generate an estimated $63 million a year .
India has little tradition of dating and online dating sites have not taken off .
Ignighter hopes Indians will find group dating safer and more fun ."
"(CNN) -- Photographer Michael Muller is a man without fear. He swims among sharks without the protection of a cage to make studio-quality, intimate photos of these beautiful creatures. As scary as that might sound, the top predators are at the bottom of his list of concerns. He's usually far more concerned about all the gear he brings into the water. ""The sharks don't really pose any of the danger. It's all the diving, and the technical [challenges] and electricity and the light,"" Muller says. ""I don't use cages -- I've been surrounded by 150 to 200 sharks, not once ever been close to being bitten."" Using studio techniques in the wild has helped Muller's work stand out in a crowded field of nature photographers. It bolsters the attention he's received as a commercial photographer, a spotlight he's leveraging to raise awareness about critically diminishing global shark populations. This week his shark photos are being featured on the Instagram blog as he takes over Discovery Channel's account for Shark Week. He'll be uploading images from his own feed as well as posting new pictures from Mexico, where he's currently swimming with whale sharks. Both venues are helping broadcast his pictures -- and his message -- to an enormous audience. Because of threats like overfishing and a high demand for fins, ""the sharks are really in a lot of danger right now,"" he says. ""We're killing about 100 million of them a year. People have no idea when they hear the numbers, and they're the top of a very, very fragile ecosystem in the oceans, so if you take out the top predator it's just like a domino effect."" ""White Mike"" as he's sometimes called, says his highly successful commercial work has helped him see the power of photography, but rather than promote celebrities or products, he's using his skills to help advocacy organizations like WildAid, Sea Shepherds, EarthEcho, and Shark Spotters in South Africa. ""I thought OK, I've done $10 billion in movie posters, maybe I can help sort of change people's perceptions of these animals and what's happening to our planet,"" he says. As any professional photographer must be these days, Muller is also something of an entrepreneur. In addition to owning the patent on the seven-bulb, 1200-watt lighting rig he uses to illuminate the sharks, he's developed a photo toning app and is busy helping establish an online photography school. He says he's also got a number of books in the works, based on his photos of sharks. Photographers strive to make images that connect with viewers, and the skills needed to do that are universal, whether under water or on land. A sense for composition, timing, and more than anything, patience will produce powerful images of a shark as surely as anything else. Muller hopes the connections his images forge will motivate people to think beyond their preconceptions about sharks. Ultimately, the global conversation will have to shift so people don't see these animals simply as a source of fins, or animals to be hunted for sport, but instead as the magnificent mainstays of a vast and delicate ecosystem that they really are. ""In order to get those changes you need people from within those cultures to come out and take a stand, which they're starting to do,"" he says. ""Our generation I don't really have a lot of hope for,"" he says. ""It's for the next generation [that needs to] fix what we've done and what we're leaving them."" Read more from WIRED: .

"(CNN) -- Five Russian Sukhoi fighter jets have arrived in Iraq, the first of 25 warplanes expected to be delivered under a contract between Moscow and Baghdad, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense said in a statement. A video the ministry released Monday showed the jets, with wings unattached, being pulled toward hangars. ""These jet fighters will contribute to increase the combat capability of the air force and the rest of the armed forces in eliminating terrorism,"" the ministry said. The Su-25 has been in service for more than three decades and was part of the Iraqi air force under Saddam Hussein's regime. The announcement follows a comment by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki that recent militant advances might have been avoided if Iraq had proper air power, in the form of fighter jets that Iraq has been trying to get from the United States. ""I'll be frank and say that we were deluded when we signed the contract"" with the United States, al-Maliki told the BBC in the interview last week, which was released Friday. Iraq has now turned to Russia and Belarus to buy fighter jets, he said. ""God willing, within one week, this force will be effective and will destroy the terrorists' dens,"" he said. U.S. officials were quick to reject al-Maliki's complaints. U.S. fighter jets have not been slow in coming, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. The first two promised F-16s ""weren't expected to be delivered until the fall, which is still months away,"" Kirby said. ""And we were in the process of working towards that delivery."" The advance of an al Qaeda splinter group ""couldn't have been stemmed through the use of two particular fighter planes,"" he said. Al-Maliki's statements about the need for air support came as American and Arab diplomats told CNN that the United States is unlikely to undertake any military strikes against the militant group, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and its allied fighters before a new government is formed in Iraq.","5 Russian fighter jets arrive in Iraq; 20 more expected .

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania judge Friday struck down a law requiring voters in the state to show photo identification at the polls, saying the requirement imposed ""unreasonable burden"" on voters and represented ""a legislative disconnect from reality."" State Judge Bernard McGinley's ruling comes nearly two years after civil and voters' rights groups challenged the law, which Gov. Tom Corbett signed in March 2012, that never went into effect because of the court case. ""Voting laws are designed to assure a free and fair election; the Voter ID Law does not further this goal,"" McGinley said in his ruling. Joseph Cercaine, lead organizer of PA Voting Rights Coalition, called the ruling a victory for those who fought against what he called the hardships imposed by the requirements of Act 18, as the law is called. ""The issue of voter ID has served to mobilize the electorate in PA about the issue of voting rights in general as well as the specific of the mandate of Act 18. So it's served a beneficial purpose in some ways but it really did threaten to put up barricades for many voters in PA that didn't have the required ID,"" he said. Cercaine said the law would have ""cost a significant amount of money"" for municipalities to implement, as well as for colleges and universities to change student IDs. ""This is a tremendous relief,"" he said. Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Voting Rights Project, called the decision a ""huge victory for democracy."" ""We are glad that the hundreds of thousands of voters that would have been disenfranchised by this law are no longer going to be affected had it gone into effect,"" he said. But David Almasi, executive director for the National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based group which backed the law, believes the issue will end up before the state's highest court. ""We've seen places that this has been enforced like Georgia where this has been enacted and practiced and there has been an increase in minority voting,"" he said. ""This law has never been given the opportunity to be in place in Pennsylvania. We have never seen the terrible things that they say will happen . ... People are burdened by a lot of things -- to go on an airplane, to go into a government building. It's something you need to have in the 21st century. People are signing up for Obamacare with IDs, why don't we require them for something as simple as voting."" Pennsylvania was one of 31 states with some form of voter ID measure in place; and one of only a handful to require it to be a photo ID. Supporters contend the law would prevent voter fraud. But the judge wrote that there was ""no evidence of the existence of in-person voter fraud in the state or that in-person voter fraud was likely to occur in the upcoming election."" ""Respondents also failed to establish a nexus between photo identification -- showing voters are who they say they are, and the integrity of elections -- when prior elections accepted a number of types of proof to verify identify,"" McGinley wrote. ""The burdens the Voter ID Law entails are unnecessary and not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. And the record is rife with testimony from numerous Pennsylvania voters whose right to vote will be -- and indeed already has been -- denied or substantially and unnecessarily burdened by the Voter ID law."" The controversial law has languished in a legal limbo since Corbett, a Republican, signed it in March 2012. Corbett's office has not returned calls seeking comment.","Judge strikes down Pennsylvania's voter ID law .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Legendary fitness pioneer Jack LaLanne saved millions of lives by teaching people to eat right and exercise regularly, Arnold Schwarzenegger said in his eulogy for LaLanne on Tuesday. LaLanne, who died last week at the age of 96, opened the first American health club in Oakland, California, in 1936, MuscleMag publisher Robert Kennedy said. ""This was the start of the fitness revolution we know today,"" Kennedy said. LaLanne, who spent decades talking about the benefits of exercise, designed the world's first leg-extension machine, along with several other pieces of equipment now standard in the fitness industry. ""It doesn't matter where you go, there is a health club and it all started with Jack LaLanne,"" Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilder, actor and former California governor, said. Other fitness celebrities, including Denise Austin, Lou Ferrigno and Richard Simmons, eulogized the man who inspired their careers. ""I really never cared much for him when I was a kid, because he was everything I wasn't,"" Simmons said. ""He was fit. He ate healthy. He had self-esteem. He had a great little body and I wasn't ready to accept his message."" But when LaLanne appeared on the ""Richard Simmons Show"" in 1980, they became friends, he said. ""I'm here to pay tribute to a legend, to someone who influenced me and made me a better person,"" Simmons said. LaLanne's memorial service at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Hollywood Hills on Tuesday afternoon was filled with laughter about LaLanne's evangelical energy in promoting fitness. ""Jack is now in heaven and, of course, that's going to be very annoying for a lot of people up there,"" Schwarzenegger said. ""It's not going to be pretty because we know what's going to happen."" Residents of heaven have a new wake-up call at 6 a.m. and they are doing ""thousand of push ups and stretching exercises,"" Schwarzenegger said. ""The people are in a state of shock because they were promised if they were good, they could rest in peace,"" he said. ""There will be no resting."" He joked that LaLanne is French for ""do some push ups, you lazy bastards."" People doubted what LaLanne was promoting in his early years, he said. They warned ""you could get heart problems, become a narcissist, turn gay, or it could reduce your sex drive,"" Schwarzenegger said. ""How do they explain the fact that Charlie Sheen works out every day,"" he said. ""So that's nonsense."" LaLanne swam the San Francisco Bay in handcuffs when he was 41. He set a record of 1,033 push ups in 30 minutes the next year. At age 70, he swam the Long Beach Harbor as he towed 70 boats with 70 people in them. Schwarzenegger said he first met LaLanne soon after he moved to Venice Beach, California, as a young bodybuilder. The two worked out together and he soon ""regretted that."" ""I got so pumped up, I couldn't move anymore,"" he said. ""I said, 'This guy is a machine, he's the real machine,'"" he said. ""'This guy's a monster, he just keeps going and going and going with the exercising.'"" LaLanne was laid to rest with a weight he was holding in his left hand when he died, said his son, Dan LaLanne.","Lou Ferrigno, Richard Simmons and Denise Austin also speak at his memorial .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Efforts to stabilize Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, crippled by a March tsunami which triggered a nuclear crisis, are running ahead of schedule, according to the president of the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates the plant. Toshio Nishizawa told CNN Monday he hopes to achieve the second phase of the shutdown before a January deadline. ""I cannot promise you, but if things go smoothly with careful control, it is possible to bring the cold shutdown forward,"" said Nishizawa. Cold shutdown requires a stable winding down of the operations of the reactors at a temperature under 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit). Cooling systems at Fukushima Daiichi, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo, were knocked out by the tsunami which followed a massive earthquake March 11. The disaster triggered the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, as the cores of reactors 1-3 overheated and spewed huge amounts of radioactive contamination across the surrounding area. In April, Tokyo Electric laid out a six- to nine-month timetable for winding down the crisis and bringing the reactors to a complete shutdown. Engineers are working to restore normal cooling in the three reactors that melted down, as well as working to pump out and decontaminate an estimated 100,000 tons of water that has pooled in the basement and service tunnels of the plants during months of emergency measures. TEPCO's president said the most difficult issue at present is the radioactive water. ""We just had a typhoon. With the torrential rain, more of polluted water is being produced. We must not leak highly radioactive water outside of our facility."" More than 75,000 residents of the area around the crippled nuclear plant are unable to return to their homes because of high radiation levels. Nishizawa said TEPCO's top priorities are to restore the nuclear plant and to compensate the victims. The company has set aside more than $5 billion to cover victims' compensation costs, including lost income and mental distress. Japan's government has said it will provide further funds, creating a state-backed entity to meet the large quantity of anticipated claims. TEPCO has struggled to meet energy demand since Fukushima Daiichi was closed following the disaster. The Japanese government has mandated power-saving measures throughout the summer. Nishizawa said while the company is committed to boosting energy generation from fossil fuels and renewables, the supply will not return to normal without the restart of its nuclear facilities that were not affected by the earthquake. ""I believe restarting the nuclear power plants is necessary to stably supply the energy to our users,"" he said. ""We must effort for the restart. It is the most important thing for that is to show the people that Fukushima's situation is stabilized and the issue has come to the end. This is our responsibility.""","The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was crippled by the March tsunami .

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House counsel refused Friday to comply with a subpoena as issued by a House panel regarding the failed solar energy company Solyndra, saying that the initiative ""was driven more by partisan politics than a legitimate effort to conduct a responsible investigation."" Kathryn Ruemmler expressed her views in a letter to Reps. Fred Upton and Cliff Stearns, members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. A day earlier, one of its subcommittees requested internal documents regarding the government's decision to issue more than half a billion dollars in federal loan guarantees in 2010 to Solyndra, which later filed for bankruptcy. The White House counsel on Friday did not rule out disclosing additional information related to Solyndra, saying that ""we remain willing to work with the committee to accommodate its legitimate oversight interests in a balanced manner."" At the same time, Ruemmler said unequivocally that the subpoena, as written, was unacceptable. ""The committee's extremely broad request for documents -- now a subpoena -- is a significant intrusion on executive branch interests,"" Ruemmler wrote. Upton, the Michigan Republican who heads the broader House committee, issued a statement Friday saying that the ""White House could have avoided the need for subpoena authorizations if they had simply chosen to cooperate."" ""We have been reasonable every step of the way in this investigation, and it is a shame that the Obama administration and House Democrats continue to put up partisan roadblocks to hide the truth from taxpayers,"" Upton said after Ruemmler's announcement. ""Solyndra was a jobs program gone bad, and we must learn the lessons of Solyndra as we work to turn our economy around and put folks back to work. ... What is the West Wing trying to hide? We owe it to American taxpayers to find out."" A government official said the White House favors a narrower request. A letter from a group of House Democrats, sent to the committee before it issued the subpoena, said the White House would be willing to share documents related to campaign contributors' influence on the decision to grant or restructure the Solyndra loan guarantee, plus the White House's involvement in deciding whether to make such a conditional commitment or close the loan guarantee. Reps. Henry Waxman and Diana DeGette wrote then that issuing the subpoena -- as it was written -- was unnecessary, given what they called ""substantial progress"" in recent talks between committee members and the White House about disclosing more information on Solyndra. The oversight and investigations subcommittee, part of the larger Energy and Commerce Committee, voted 14-9 along party lines in favor of issuing the subpoena. That followed a contentious debate among its members, with Republicans accusing the Obama administration of stonewalling and some Democrats calling the subpoena resolution politically motivated. ""We need to learn the circumstances of the original deal as the restructuring. We need all the facts, all the witnesses, all the documents,"" DeGette, a Colorado Democrat, said at this week's hearing, describing the subpoena as ""an act of irresponsible partisanship."" ""Sadly, after seeing (Republicans') conduct of this investigation, I do not believe they share this goal."" In her letter Friday, Ruemmler called the subpoena ""unprecedented and unnecessary."" She said that the White House had made a ""good-faith offer,"" which the subcommittee rejected ""without explaining how it fell short of your legitimate oversight purposes."" Among other issues, Ruemmler said that the panel's request for producing copies of all communications related to Solyndra -- including, she claimed, ""thousands of pages of news clips"" -- within days was unrealistic and would require substantial resources. Defending the Obama administration, the counsel said, ""None of the more than 85,000 pages of documents produced to date evidence any favoritism to political supporters or wrongdoing by the White House."" Stearns, the subcommittee's chairman, earlier said the White House Office of Management and Budget ""repeatedly failed to cooperate with our investigation, and we agreed to put off a vote on that subpoena"" in hopes that engaging the White House could avoid the need for subpoenas. ""Only after repeated failed attempts to engage the White House did the committee notify the White House"" that it intended to discuss possible subpoenas, the Florida Republican said. ""This finally got the attention of the White House counsel,"" who then met with lawmakers Wednesday, he said. ""Unfortunately, the White House was unable or unwilling to answer even the most basic questions."" Democrats slammed the subcommittee's move, though some acknowledged that the White House could be more forthcoming with information in the case. Veteran Rep. John Dingell, D-Michigan, said after the vote, ""I've never seen a procedure quite like this. ""We are protesting here a sweeping subpoena,"" he said. Since Republicans have ""been able to find nothing"" wrong in what they've looked at, they have ""increased the size of the net and reduced the size of the holes in the net as they go about this fishing expedition."" Federal analysts looking at the proposed Solyndra loan in 2009 warned then of possible problems, as well as pressure from the White House to speed up a decision, according to a memorandum released last month by congressional investigators. Approved in May 2010, the Energy Department's loan allowed Solyndra to build a factory in Fremont, California, to produce state-of-the-art solar panels. Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in late August and closed its doors, putting more than 1,000 people out of work after it had received $535 million in loan guarantees. The bankruptcy leaves the federal government unlikely to get the loan money back. President Barack Obama had touted the company in a widely publicized visit last year. White House Chief of Staff William Daley announced last week that he is ordering a 60-day independent review of the state of the Energy Department's loan portfolio. The review will include recommendations about how to improve the loan monitoring process. The review will be headed by Herb Allison, a veteran of both the Obama and last Bush administrations who oversaw the Troubled Asset Relief Program, among other efforts. CNN's Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.","NEW: House Democrats says the probe is fair, but the GOP-led subpoena is not .

"San Angelo, Texas (CNN) -- The Texas jury that found polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs guilty Thursday of sexual assault will deliberate again to determine his punishment. Jeffs, who represented himself after firing his defense team, remained stoic as the verdict was read. Jurors will decide his fate after hearing additional witness testimony in the penalty phase of the trial, which began Thursday evening and will continue Friday. The sect leader faces a maximum sentence of life in prison for his conviction of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old who were his ""spiritual wives."" The jury convicted him of two counts of sexual assault on a child -- charges that stemmed from a 2008 raid on a ranch his church operates near Eldorado, Texas. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott hailed the verdict and said prosecutors were seeking a life sentence for Jeffs. ""Here in the state of Texas, juries render tough, swift justice against anyone who would sexually assault a child,"" he said. Before the verdict, witnesses showed jurors DNA evidence they said showed Jeffs conceived a baby with a 15-year-old child. And prosecutors presented an audio recording that they alleged documents Jeffs' sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl in the presence of three other ""wives."" Abbott said attorneys were presenting new, ""repulsive"" evidence about the sect leader during the trial's penalty phase. ""I think it will confirm in (jurors') minds why they convicted the man and why they want to put him behind bars for a long time,"" he said. Court adjourned about two hours after jurors reached a verdict Thursday. The trial was scheduled to continue at 10 a.m. Friday (11 a.m. ET). Jurors deliberated for three hours and 45 minutes, starting Thursday afternoon. They sent out two notes during deliberations, requesting a CD player to listen to audio recordings and asking for the transcript of testimony from a witness. Jeffs stood silently for most of his 30-minute closing argument Thursday -- the latest dramatic twist in a trial that included frequent objections and sermonlike speeches about religious freedom. Jeffs stared at the table in front of him for most of his allotted block of time during closing arguments, as Judge Barbara Walther counted down. He looked up at the jury when he reached the 20-minute mark, staring at each member. The jurors stared back. Five minutes later, Jeffs mumbled, ""I am at peace."" The leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints spoke so quietly that people in the courtroom strained to hear him. Prosecutor Eric Nichols warned jurors not to be swayed by Jeffs' frequent invocations of religious freedom as a defense. The case, he said, has nothing to do with an attack on religion. Instead, it is about Jeffs and his actions, Nichols argued. He showed pictures of Jeffs' alleged victims as he summed up his argument. Jeffs began the hearing on Thursday -- the fifth day of his trial -- by asking for what he called constitutional protection because he represents a religious organization. The judge immediately denied his request. The sect leader then questioned witness J.D. Roundy, a sect member who also had taken the stand for four hours the day before. He did not call additional witnesses to the stand. On Wednesday, Texas prosecutors rested their case after playing a key piece of evidence for jurors: a 20-minute audio tape that began and ended with a man saying prayer. Prosecutors alleged that the recording documents Jeffs' sexual assault of a then-12-year-old girl in the presence of three other ""wives."" The girl had grown up in Jeffs' Yearning for Zion ranch, clearing cactus and attending a Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints school where Jeffs was principal, authorities said. Prosecutors showed the jury a photo of her with her arms around Jeffs, and a marriage certificate which listed the girl's age as 12 at the time. On Tuesday, the jury heard audio recordings that prosecutors said showed Jeffs instructing a 14-year-old and his other young ""wives"" on how to sexually please him in order to win God's favor. Prosecutors said the 14-year-old was Jeffs' ""spiritual wife"" and conceived a child with Jeffs when she was 15. Jeffs' trial started last week. He made no plea during his arraignment and remained silent for more than a day of the trial proceedings. But on Friday, he began repeatedly objecting -- at one point delivering an hourlong speech about his religious freedom ""being trampled upon."" Jeffs could be sentenced to five years to life in prison on the charge of aggravated sexual assault regarding the alleged 12-year-old. For the other count, he would face a sentence of two to 20 years. Jeffs' breakaway sect is believed to have about 10,000 followers. Their practice of polygamy, which the mainstream Mormon Church renounced more than a century ago, is part of the sect's doctrine. The Texas legal proceedings began after about 400 children were taken from the sect's Yearning for Zion ranch in 2008. Jeffs was also charged with bigamy after the raid and is expected to be tried on that charge later. Child protection officials said they found a ""pervasive pattern"" of sexual abuse on the ranch through forced marriages between underage girls and older men. But the Texas Supreme Court ruled the state had no right to remove the children. The court also said the state lacked evidence to show that the children faced imminent danger of abuse. Most of the children were returned to their families, although some men at the ranch were charged with sexual abuse. Jeffs was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list when he was arrested five years ago during a routine 2006 traffic stop in Las Vegas. He was convicted in Utah on two counts of being an accomplice to rape for using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marrying her 19-year-old cousin. Afterward, he was sentenced to two consecutive prison terms of five years to life. But in July 2010, the Utah Supreme Court overturned his convictions, ruling that the jury instructions were erroneous. Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff said last week Utah is prepared to retry Jeffs, depending on the outcome of the Texas case. In Session's Christi Paul, Jim Kyle, Grace Wong and Keith Lovely Jr. contributed to this report.","NEW: The penalty phase of the trial will continue Friday .

"(CNN) -- Tavis Smiley: Bitter, party of one. What else can you say about an accomplished but jaded black scholar who continues to behave like a Twitter troll when it comes to President Obama? Why does he unfairly criticize Obama? Could it be because of a bruised ego? It may have started back in February 2008. Smiley, an author, media personality and leading voice in the black community, invited then-Sen. Barack Obama to speak at his ""State of the Black Union"" forum in New Orleans. Obama declined, opting instead to campaign because he was locked in a tough primary with Sen. Hillary Clinton, who did attend the forum. In his place, Obama offered to send his wife, Michelle. Anyone who has seen the first lady speak knows this is hardly a consolation prize. Smiley said no thanks. Obama sent a letter, reiterating the importance of the forum, and asked Smiley to reconsider. He didn't. And thus, the rift. In 2011, Smiley was on C-Span claiming that Obama was ""the first president in my professional career that hasn't invited me to the White House."" Though truth be told, I'm not prone to inviting people who diss my better half over to the house either. Not that I'm suggesting Smiley shouldn't be able to interview or criticize the president. In fact, I have challenged some of President Obama's policies and decisions for years in my columns, on TV and over radio. But I've always tried to do so in context. So, for those of you enamored with Smiley's recent criticism of the president's remarks about race, which he described as ""weak as pre-sweetened Kool-Aid,"" remember it's all about context. In this case, the context includes their bumpy history. Same goes for Smiley's partner-in-whine, Cornel West, who was so upset that he received one ticket to the 2009 inauguration instead of the requested three that afterward he compared Obama to Machiavelli. Before ticket-gate, West went on the trail for Obama. After the incident, West went off on Obama. Last year, West called the Democratic president a ""Rockefeller Republican in blackface"" while supposedly on an awareness tour with Smiley to talk about poverty. The idea behind the initiative was a noble one. Unfortunately, when they weren't talking about the poor, they would throw random haymakers at the president, like West's ""blackface"" remark. As a result, media coverage spent more time focused on the jabs than on ways to lift the poor out of poverty. This week, West called Obama a ""global George Zimmerman"" in an interview with Democracy Now. Also while a guest on Smiley's radio show, the Princeton University professor said that MSNBC host and Obama supporter, the Rev. Al Sharpton, ""probably deep down wants to be critical of the president, but he can't because he's still on the Obama plantation."" West also insinuated that other blacks who aren't as critical of the president as he and Smiley are also residents of this so-called plantation. Perhaps we should make that: Bitter, party of two. In fairness, it is hard to prove that the vitriol the pair spews in Obama's way all stems from perceived snubs from a few years ago. But the timing of it all is curious. And the personal attacks -- West once said Obama was afraid of ""free black men"" -- make it difficult to believe yesteryear's leftovers are not still on today's menu. Now, I do believe poverty is the least talked about major issue we have in this country. And it seemed like the entire 2012 general election was focused on the rich and declining middle class, with little to no talk about where the middle class was declining to. West and Smiley's criticism of Obama for this omission is reasonable, especially since silence on this issue has a big impact on the black community. A recent study released by Harvard University shows how difficult it is for people born in the lower 5% to reach the top 5%. In some parts of the country, the chances of moving up the income ladder are as high as 35%. But in regions with a large black population, such as near Charlotte, North Carolina; Memphis, Tennessee, and Atlanta, it is as low as 4%. To be born in poverty and then die in poverty is an American nightmare. So I applaud West and Smiley for using their platform to draw attention to the often overlooked problem. But if they're motivated by personal grievances, shame on them for displaying their pettiness while touting important policy critiques. First of all, it's self-serving. Second, it's obvious. Earlier this year Tom Joyner, who once featured Smiley on his syndicated radio show but parted ways with him after his unjust attacks on Obama in 2008, said, ""Tavis is fascinated with his own legacy, and that's not good. He wants more than anything to be remembered the way Dr. King was, and to somehow make that kind of mark on the world."" Translation: It's all about Smiley. When Obama didn't accept the invitation to speak at Smiley's forum in 2008, Smiley interpreted it as an affront to his influence in the black community. When Obama opted not to attend in 2009 -- although he did address the crowd via video conference -- that was the proverbial final straw. Smiley and West have been aggressively attacking the president, sandwiching legitimate concerns about poverty in between over-the-top comments that far too often detract from what they claim is their primary focus -- helping poor black people. Their comments may grab headlines and land them on Sunday morning talk shows, but how have they engaged with the administration in finding solutions on poverty? Instead, Smiley and West appear to be two egocentric men who believe they alone are the face of black intellectualism. And any black talking heads who don't side with them have, in West's words, ""sold their souls."" Welcome to the ivory tower version of black on black crime. Again, I'm all for fairly criticizing the man in the White House. But it feels that West and Smiley are more upset that Obama didn't kiss their rings before he walked through the door than about anything he's done since he got inside. (Note: An earlier version of this article said Smiley was fired by Joyner; Smiley announced that he had resigned although Joyner's staff said the radio host elected not to renew his contract.) The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Why do Tavis Smiley and Cornet West unfairly criticize President Obama?
Granderson: Could it be because they feel personal grievances toward Obama?
He says the two are right to criticize Obama on policy issues but name-calling is petty .
Granderson: Smiley, West seem egocentric in believing they are face of black intellectualism ."
"(CNN) -- Israel's monthlong assault on the Palestinians has taken a heavy toll, with some 2,000 Palestinians killed and 10,000 more wounded. Most of these victims were civilians and many of them children, representing just the latest bloody chapter in a tragic history. During the long decades of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the international community has not fully met or addressed legitimate Palestinian aspirations. Nowhere is that better illustrated than in Gaza. Chronically short of food, water and electricity, and cut off from the outside world by closed borders and blockades, the Palestinians in Gaza are desperate. As an individual who has fought tirelessly for human rights, I cannot ignore their plight, and as a fellow Arab, I cannot ignore this wanton denial of Palestinian rights. The people of Gaza need three things. First, they need a peace agreement that ends the hostilities and lifts an Israeli siege that has been in place since 2007 and has turned Gaza into what some journalists have called ""an open-air jail."" Second, the Palestinians in Gaza need humanitarian aid and funding for development, so they can rebuild their shattered lives, their bombed-out neighborhoods and their fractured communities. And finally, Palestinians everywhere need a comprehensive agreement that will end the occupation and establish two states for two peoples, allowing Israelis and Palestinians to live side by side in peace and security. Until a two state solution becomes a reality, the fighting and bloodshed will almost certainly continue. As Qatar has said many times, peace must be achieved through negotiations, with all sides in the conflict represented. Qatar has already provided humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza and we have pledged to assist with rebuilding efforts once hostilities have ended. But we are also working behind the scenes to facilitate the kind of dialogue that can lead to a lasting peace. Ultimately, Qatar wants to help the Palestinians realize their self-determination by establishing a secure Palestinian state. Qatar makes no claim to being a major player on the global stage. But beginning in the mid-1990s, our government embraced an open door foreign policy focused on relationship-building and conflict mediation that has benefited both Qatar and the global community. This open door policy has allowed Qatar to serve as a mediator for conversation, cooperation, and the advancement of peace. With our doors wide open, our capital, Doha, has increasingly become the center of a vibrant, new multicultural nation, with the creation of a knowledge-based economy enshrined as one of the key goals of our 2030 national vision. It is precisely because we are impartial that we are often approached to mediate and create platforms for dialogue between different factions. In 2008, for example, we were able to broker a peace agreement between the various factions battling for supremacy in southern Lebanon. Later, we played a similar role in Darfur. Over the years we have hosted an Israeli Trade Mission and kept our door open to Western think tanks like the Brookings Institution. More recently, because of our open door policy, we were able to help negotiate the exchange of an American soldier for five Taliban prisoners. And today we are helping facilitate communication between the United States, the United Nations, our Arab neighbors, Israel and Hamas as the various parties struggle to find a peaceful solution to the violence in Gaza. In each instance, we feel we have been on the right side of history. But more important, we believe that we have been on the right side of justice, human rights and human dignity. All these qualities and attributes are on trial in Gaza today, and once again, history will judge our actions. Qatar stands ready to help reconcile differences and advance the prospects for peace. We stand ready to play our part in advancing dialogue and achieving solutions to the seemingly intractable problems confronting the people of the Middle East. Some of these problems, like Gaza, have been years or even decades in the making. But that does not mean they cannot be solved. The bleeding, the suffering and the dying must be stopped. In Qatar, we will always keep an open door to peace.","Khalid Al-Attiya: Isolated, short of food and water, Palestinians in Gaza are desperate .

"(CNN) -- The World Cup has provided an all you can eat buffet when it comes to goals -- but in a tournament which constantly manages to amaze, the latest item on the menu in Brazil was akin to a feast. Those fortunate enough to witness this enthralling contest between the attacking talent of the Dutch and the never-say-die attitude of the Australians were arguably treated to the game of the tournament so far. The Netherlands, which had trailed 2-1 after Mile Jedinak's penalty had given Australia shock 54th minute lead, eventually prevailed 3-2 in a pulsating and often breathtaking affair. Substiute Memphis Depay was the hero for the Dutch, becoming his country's youngest ever World Cup scorer, lashing home the winner just 10 minutes after Robin van Persie had dragged his side level. Last Friday, Netherlands brought the tournament to life with one of the greatest results in recent World Cup history. Not only did it defeat the reigning champion, it dragged it off its throne kicking and screaming while Spanish faces were left red with humiliation. It was sweet revenge for the Dutch, which came so close four years ago only to lose out to Andres Iniesta's winner in Johannesburg. Under the guidance of coach Louis van Gaal, who will join Manchester United after the tournament, this current crop of players has emerged as a new force on the world stage. While the likes of Arjen Robben, Van Persie and Wesley Sneijder remain, the exciting youthful talent of Daley Blind and defender Bruno Martins Indi represents the next generation. There were some who didn't think the Netherlands would even make it out of the group, let alone launch a World Cup challenge. While the Dutch should qualify comfortably from its group, it will take a huge effort to thrill as its players have in its opening two games. Australia, which battled gamely during its 3-1 defeat by Chile in its opening game, arrived knowing anything but a victory would make progress almost impossible. Like so many of it sporting teams, Australia has a side which refuses to give up hope. When Robben ran through the heart of the Australian defense and fired into the bottom corner with 19 minutes played, it seemed a case of how many goals the Dutch could rattle in. Australia's talisman Tim Cahill had other ideas. Just seconds after restarting the game, Ryan McGowan sent a pinpoint cross into the Dutch penalty area where Cahill met it with an unstoppable left-footed -- a goal reminiscent of Marco van Basten's wonder strike for the Netherlands at the 1988 European Championship finals. Cahill's fifth World Cup goal - and possibly his last -- was worth the entrance fee alone. The 34-year-old will miss his side's final group game against Spain after picking up a suspension -- not that you would have known it from his performance. Buoyed by the equalizer, Australia began to push forward and Mark Bresciano missed a golden opportunity to put his side ahead after lashing over from 18-yards. And when Daryl Janmaat inadvertently handled inside his own penalty area, Jedinak swept home from 12-yards to give his side a shock lead. From thrashing the world champion 5-1 to trailing the lowest ranked side in the tournament, the Dutch were rocking. Australia, playing with a confidence which belied its lowly ranking, appeared set to claim one of the most famous results in its history. But the Dutch weren't done yet and four minutes later it drew level when van Persie rifled home from just inside the penalty area. As the game moved breathlessly from one end to the other, Matthew Leckie should have put Australia back in front but could only send his effort straight at the goalkeeper from close-range. It was a costly miss which as just minutes later the Dutch moved ahead once again. Depay burst forward towards the penalty area and his low effort flew in off the fingertips off Australia goalkeeper Matthew Ryan. There was still time for Nigel de Jong and Jermaine Lens to go close -- but the goals dried up -- for now anyway.","Netherlands defeats Australia 3-2 in Porto Alegre .

"(CNN) -- Thursday afternoon, Barack Obama presided over the unveiling of George W. Bush's official portrait in the White House, a warm event that reminds us: It feels like years since President Dubya regaled the world with his famous spoonerisms. His retirement has been defined by an awkward silence. While John McCain's endorsement was trumpeted by Mitt Romney, Bush delivered his in just four words. ""I'm for Mitt Romney,"" he shouted to a journalist as an elevator door closed between them. If, just for old time's sake, Bush had said, ""I'm for Ritt Momney,"" it would have been perfect. Bush's silence may be motivated by the recognition that much of the public doesn't like him. He left office with the worst approval rating for a president since Watergate. But Bush could undergo a renaissance of enthusiasm. Consider the shifting attitudes toward Harry Truman. When he left the White House in 1952, Truman was blamed for the recession and an ugly war in Korea. His approval rate was just 31%. By 1977, Jimmy Carter was hanging Truman's portrait in the White House and the band Chicago sang, ""America needs you, Harry Truman!"" The switch came partly because Truman, like Bush, had a gentle, honest personality that voters looked back on with fondness. But Truman also proved prescient in his conduct of the Cold War. Bush, likewise, might seem a better and more farsighted leader in a few years time. But not yet. In the short term, the two things that will dominate popular memories of Bush are the credit crunch and the Iraq War. John Bolton, Bush's ambassador to the UN, admitted this week that his former employer had left Obama ""a mess"" to clean up. That's an understatement. To be fair, Bush himself faced some events beyond his control: a recession in 2001 and the global collapse of financial institutions in 2007-2008. Nevertheless, on his watch median household income fell, poverty rose and millions lost health insurance. One particularly ugly stat: In 2000 there were 11.6 million children living in poverty in the United States, but by 2008 that number had swelled to 14.1 million. Meanwhile, billions of dollars and thousands of lives were lost in the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Even so, the future of democracy in both countries remains uncertain. In the course of ""rooting out terrorism,"" civil liberties were compromised. If you like your government limited and cautious -- in the style of Thomas Jefferson or Ron Paul -- Bush wasn't your kind of a conservative. However, as memories fade and new reasons to be angry take their place, Bush's time in office might start to look comparatively benign. The economic figures might have been bad when Bush left the White House, but they've only gotten worse. Total debt was nearly $11 trillion in January 2009, when Obama took office, and it's more than $15 trillion today. In January 2009, unemployment was 7.8% and, after hitting a high of 10% in October 2009, is down to 8.1%. People might not have reason to be nostalgic about Bush, but Obama hasn't yet delivered all that change he promised. Moreover, his foreign policy -- although involving fewer boots on the ground -- has dramatically expanded the definition of the enemy and the tools available to fight them. In the wake of the discovery of a creepy ""Kill List,"" a number of liberal journalists have written that Obama is actually less ethical or constitutionally minded than his predecessor. Bush might have tortured enemy combatants, but Obama has targeted U.S. citizens identified as terrorists. Still, historical distance from Bush's presidency will let us put it in greater perspective. Subjective bad memories will be replaced by objective analysis. And, objectively, he was a very important president. In foreign affairs, Bush defined the War on Terror in much the way that Truman shaped thinking about the struggle against communism for decades. After 9/11, Bush could have determined the threat to America to be a limited terrorist opposition centered on al Qaeda. Instead, he defined it as a grand existential conflict between democracy and radical Islam: a clash of civilizations. Many may argue that his analysis was flawed, but many in the West also bought it -- witness Britain's participation in Iraq and Afghanistan and France's ban on the Burqa. On Bush's watch a consensus developed that Islamic extremism must be confronted. More importantly, the idea that the West would support democracy, regardless of the cost -- that the age of the great dictators was over - probably shaped the popular risings that took place across the Middle East in 2010-11. Would there have been an Arab Spring without an Iraq war? Maybe not. At home, Bush was surprisingly innovative, too. He spoke Spanish and attracted unusual numbers of Latino votes. He appointed two black secretaries of State and a Chinese-American secretary of Labor. He also gave to the right the concept of compassionate conservatism: the idea that instead of simply pushing for less government, the Republicans should offer constructive proposals for what should take its place. A result is that the one place in the world where Bush is guaranteed a good reception is Africa. In 2003, just 50,000 Africans were on anti-retroviral drugs. Thanks to the $18 billion in aid that Bush pumped into the continent, the figure had risen to 1.3 million people by 2007. The picture that emerges is a president who was, like Truman, ahead of his time in some regards but who was undermined by events that, in the beginning at least, were beyond his control. Without 9/11, Bush might have been a more benign Eisenhower-style president who could have spent his energies pursuing two policies that Republicans and Democrats will probably have to come to terms with eventually: immigration reform and free trade with Asia. The War on Terror undermined those domestic ambitions. However, it also gave him the opportunity to change the way we perceive the world. For good or bad, we'll be living by the Bush model of international relations for many years to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Timothy Stanley says portrait unveiling allows moment to re-evaluate Bush presidency .

"Washington (CNN) -- In a pair of votes aimed more at making political points than law, the Senate rejected competing Democratic and Republican proposals to boost construction of roadways and other infrastructure projects. Republicans blocked the Democratic bill, which would have approved about $50 billion for projects and another $10 billion to start an ""infrastructure bank,"" because it relied on a surtax on people earning more than $1 million a year. Democrats have tried to pass the surtax multiple times in an effort to convince voters that Republicans care more about their wealthy constituents than about putting the unemployed back to work. Republicans dispute that and argue that the special tax would hit small businesses the hardest, which would curtail hiring. The White House issued a press release Thursday evening saying the GOP is ""out of touch with Americans from all ends of the political spectrum."" ""It makes no sense when you consider that this bill was made up of the same kinds of common-sense proposals that many of these senators have fought for in the past,"" the statement said. ""It was fully paid for. And even though it was supported by more than 70% of the American people -- Republicans, Democrats, and independents -- 100% of Senate Republicans said no."" Democrats rejected a Republican proposal that was aimed, in part, at speeding infrastructure spending by easing regulations that can slow construction, because they oppose GOP plans to offset its cost by rescinding $40 billion in spending approved for this year. Democrats said that violated an agreement about spending levels reached during the debt-ceiling negotiations this year. Neither measure could reach the 60-vote threshold for approval. The Democratic measure failed 51-49. Two members of the Democratic caucus, Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Ben Nelson of Nebraska, joined all Republican senators in voting against it. Nelson is facing a potentially difficult re-election fight. The Republican measure failed on a vote of 47-53. Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted for the GOP bill, and Republican Olympia Snowe of Maine voted against it. Both are up for re-election. Also on Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner unveiled plans to move a separate infrastructure bill through that chamber. The GOP-backed measure would provide ""a new, devoted revenue stream"" by tying infrastructure spending to expanded domestic energy production, using revenue generated from new production to help pay for infrastructure initiatives across the country. ""This is, I think, the opposite of stimulus, by linking infrastructure to energy reform and permanently removing barriers to job growth, instead of just spending money on short-term fixes,"" Boehner said. Details of the measure are not yet available, but Boehner said he hoped to introduce the bill in the next couple of weeks and then pass the bill through the House before the end of the year. ""The president says he wants more money for infrastructure and he's said he supports more American-made energy, so I hope he'll work with us on this,"" Boehner said. CNN Congressional Correspondent Kate Bolduan contributed to this report.","NEW: Vote shows GOP senators ""out of touch with Americans,"" White House says .

"(CNN) -- They have long played second fiddle to their more illustrious city rivals, but Atletico Madrid took another giant step out of Real Madrid's shadow on Saturday with a 2-1 win at the Bernabeu. La Liga's reigning champions are proving just as formidable opposition this year as they were last with Diego Simeone's men stealing all three points in Real's backyard for the second successive season. Tiago gave Atletico the lead in the 10th minute redirecting Koke's corner past Iker Casillas to silence the home crowd before parity was restored from a familiar source 16 minutes later. Guilherme Siqueira was Cristiano Ronaldo's fall guy on this occasion as the left back stuck out a leg as the Portuguese surged into the penalty area. The referee pointed to the spot and Ronaldo duly converted sending Miguel Angel Moya the wrong way to tie up the match at 1-1. Real proceeded to dominate the rest of the half but Atletico weathered the storm with Moya pulling off a notable point-blank save from a Karim Benzema header in the 38th minute. The deadlock in an evenly contested second half was finally broken by the visitors with 14 minutes remaining when a Raul Garcia dummy left subsitute Turan (who replaced captain Gabi in the 60th minute) to sweep home a low shot into the left corner of Casillas' net. Real's efforts to salvage something from the game ultimately came to nothing leaving the European champions pondering a second successive league defeat. ""It is a problem,"" Ancelotti said after the match. ""We have to analyse it in the next few days and fix it quickly. ""The first-half was good like (it was against Real Sociedad) and the second-half wasn't. We played with intensity and aggression in the first-half which is what you have to do to beat Atletico, but we didn't do that in the second-half."" For the Italian's opposite number it was another day at the Bernabeu to savor. ""I think it is the first time we have won twice in a row in the league at the Bernabeu and that is very important for our fans and a new group of players,"" Simeone said. ""We still have difficulties ahead to have the consistency we want, but with the work rate they showed and the play they showed in the second-half I am happy."" Victory lifts Atletico to second in the table with seven points while Real are currently 11th with three points from three matches. Real begin the defense of their Champions League crown on Tuesday with a home tie against Swiss side FC Basel while Atletico travel to Greece to play Olympiacos. Barca continue perfect start . Barcelona maintained their 100% start to the new season but left it late to seal all three points against Athletic Bilbao at the Nou Camp earlier on Saturday. Neymar came off the bench to score a brace in the final 10 minutes of the match to make it three league wins out of three for new manager Luis Enrique. For the first time in their history, Barcelona played a home match in red and yellow away kit which features the colors of the Catalan flag -- the Senyera -- to mark the 300th anniversary of Catalan National Day which took place on Thursday. A giant flag was also unfurled in the stadium prior to kick off. The anniversary, which comes just days before Scotland votes to decide whether to remain part of the UK, has fueled calls from many Catalans for their own referendum on independence to be held. Both Barca and Bilbao kick off their Champions League campaigns next week. Messi and Co will host Cypriot side APOEL Nicosia on Wednesday while Athletic will entertain Ukraine's champions Shakhtar Donetsk.","Atletico Madrid record league win at Bernabeu for second season running .

"(CNN) -- Mario Balotelli's headed goal early in the second half gave Italy a crucial 2-1 win over fellow European heavyweights England in their Group D opener in Manaus. Continuing the pattern of a free-scoring World Cup, both sides created a flurry of chances in an open and attacking match despite the stifling heat and humidity of the Amazon jungle and a pitch of questionable quality. England, inspired by 19-year-old Raheem Sterling, made a confident start to Saturday's game with the Liverpool winger going close with an early snap shot. But it was the Italians who went ahead as Andrea Pirlo's dummy from a corner left Claudio Marchisio the chance to score with a rasping 35th-minute drive from outside the area. Within two minutes England drew deservedly level as Daniel Sturridge converted from strike partner Wayne Rooney's cross after the Manchester United star had been sent clear down the left by Sterling. The eventual winner came five minutes after the break as the excellent Antonio Candreva was allowed to cross for Balotelli to head home at the far post from close range. England pressed forward and created a number of half chances, the best of which fell to Rooney, who dragged his effort wide. But Italy, which knocked England out of the 2012 European Championship in a quarterfinal penalty shootout, always carried a threat as well -- and veteran playmaker Pirlo rattled Joe Hart's crossbar with an injury-time free kick. Italy coach Prandelli praised his midfielders for their role in a famous victory. ""I am clearly satisfied with this victory as this match against England was very difficult, they are a very good team,"" Prandelli said. ""We had a very good basis in midfield,"" he added. Uruguay 1-3 Costa Rica . The win leaves Italy well placed to reach the last 16 after Costa Rica stunned South American champion Uruguay 3-1 in the earlier match in the group. Uruguay, which kept recovering star player Luis Suarez on the bench in Fortaleza, ended the Group D opener with 10 men when Maxi Pereira was sent off for an ugly challenge in injury time. Uruguay had looked set for a routine victory when Edinson Cavani fired in a 24th-minute penalty after Diego Lugano was hauled down. But there was a complete reversal of fortunes after halftime as Joel Campbell drove home a spectacular 54th-minute equalizer. Three minutes later Oscar Duarte stooped low to head the Costa Ricans ahead. Liverpool's Suarez, who had knee surgery ahead of the tournament, was still not risked by coach Oscar Tabarez despite the dire plight of his team and a sorry night was to get worse. Campbell, on the books of Arsenal but yet to play a first team game for the English Premier League side, capped a fine performance by sending away substitute Marco Urena to score a late and clinching third. Pereira then saw red in a moment of madness as he lunged at Campbell and will miss Uruguay's second group match against England Thursday, which now takes on added importance for both teams after their opening setbacks. Costa Rica's Colombian coach Jorge Luis Pinto said Campbell had changed the course of the game. ""He's a man who unsettles you, he surprises, changes the tempo, he was uncontainable for the Uruguay defense,"" said Pinto. Colombia 3-0 Greece . In Saturday's first match, Colombia scored the fastest goal of the World Cup to date to set up a 3-0 victory against Greece in the opening game of Group C. Pablo Armero's deflected shot squeezed over the Greek line to give his team a fifth-minute lead in Belo Horizonte, and the South Americans doubled their advantage in the second half as striker Teofilo Gutierrez netted. Gutierrez, leading the line in the absence of Colombia's injured star forward Radamel Falcao, stabbed home at the far post in the 58th minute after a right-wing corner was flicked on. Greece should have reduced the deficit, but veteran Theofanis Gekas headed against the crossbar from close range soon before he was substituted in the 64th minute. Young midfielder James Rodriguez sealed Colombia's victory in time added on, with a low shot that keeper Orestis Karnezis could only palm into the corner of the net. Great things are expected of Rodriguez, who moved to big spending French club AS Monaco from Porto for $60 million before the start of last season. He is nicknamed the ""new kid"" as he is seen as the natural successor to former Colombian legend Carlos Valderrama, whose nickname was 'the kid"" and starred for the national side at three straight World Cups until 1998. Colombia, in the finals for the first time since Valderrama's last appearance, is considered a dangerous outsider although the loss of Falcao is considered a major blow. Falcao, a teammate of Rodriguez at Monaco, has not recovered in time from a serious knee injury but has joined his international teammates in Brazil to lend his support. Greece has suffered six defeats in the last seven games at the World Cup and coach Fernando Santos said his side had been well beaten. ""They caused us a lot of problems from the opening minutes,"" the 59-year-old told reporters. Colombia coach Jose Pekerman was delighted with his side's opening win. ""We were strong going forward, we had a nice style of play and we created several chances,"" said the 64-year-old Argentine. Ivory Coast 2-1 Japan . Colombia will next play an Ivory Coast team that came from behind to beat Japan in Saturday's final match in Recife. Japan took a 16th-minute lead through a superb strike by AC Milan midfielder Keisuke Honda, but the second-half introduction of veteran striker Didier Drogba helped inspire the African side to victory. Soon after the 36-year-old came off the bench, fellow forward Wilfried Bony made up for several misses when he headed home Serge Aurier's cross in the 64th minute. The defender also delivered an assist for Gervinho two minutes later, as the Roma striker nodded in a near-post effort that Japan goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima will be disappointed not to have saved. It was the first time that the Ivorians had won their first game at a World Cup, and another victory on Thursday would make a historic first progression to the knockout stages possible. Japan was the first team to qualify for Brazil, but now realistically needs to beat Greece to have a chance of reaching the last 16 -- as the team did in South Africa four years ago.","Italy beats England 2-1 in their Group D opener in Manaus .

"Washington (CNN) -- With approval in hand to arm and train Syrian rebels to fight the ISIS terror group, President Barack Obama said Thursday the plan keeps with ""the key principle"" of U.S. strategy: No American combat troops on the ground. ""The American troops deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission,"" he said in televised remarks from the White House. ""Their mission is to advise and assist our partners on the ground. ...We can destroy ISIL without having our troops fight another ground war in the Middle East."" Obama said more than 40 countries, including Arab nations, have offered assistance in the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which calls itself the Islamic State. The developments came as ISIS advanced its grip on portions of Syria and Iraq, seizing 16 predominantly Kurdish villages near the Turkish border. The move by ISIS was just one in a series of developments that saw new reports of atrocities emerge and the release of a video of a captive British journalist criticizing the American and British governments. Citing the Sunni terror group's brutality, from beheading civilians -- including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff -- to the mass execution of its opponents, Obama said the United States will not back down. ""With their barbaric murder of two Americans, these terrorists thought they could frighten us or intimidate us or cause us to shrink from the world,"" Obama said. ""But today they are learning the same hard lesson of petty tyrants and terrorists who have gone before, as Americans we do not give into fear. When you harm our citizens, when you threaten the United States, when you threaten our allies, it doesn't frighten us. It unites us."" The question now appears to be not if, but when the United States will strike ISIS in its stronghold in northern Syria. The U.S. military has everything it needs to strike ISIS targets in Syria, a plan that officials told CNN is still waiting on Obama's signoff. ISIS, meanwhile, is modifying its behavior, from the way it communicates to the way it conceals itself, in response to potential U.S. airstrikes in Syria, U.S. military officials told CNN. The officials expressed confidence the airstrikes would be effective. As top U.S. military leadership approved a plan to strike ISIS in Syria, the Senate on Thursday gave final congressional approval to Obama's proposal. The House approved Obama's request on Wednesday. U.S. military on deck . At the same time, U.S. lawmakers have been debating the best way to stop ISIS. In testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said America's top military leaders have developed a plan to hit ISIS targets in the terror group's stronghold in northern Syria. Obama has been briefed on those plans, which were approved by Hagel and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. For weeks, U.S. intelligence and military targeting specialists have been working around the clock on a list of potential targets in Syria. The list is expected to be shown to Obama one more time, U.S. military officials said. An analysis of the risks of bombing inside Syria will be included, as well as an assessment of how the destruction of the targets could degrade ISIS, they said. Carrying out airstrikes against ISIS in Syria would be a continuation of the U.S. military operation in Iraq, where American airstrikes are being carried out against the group. U.S. airstrikes on Thursday struck an ISIS training camp southeast of Mosul, the group's stronghold in Iraq, the U.S. military said. Another strike southeast of Baghdad damaged an ISIS ammunition stockpile, according to the military. Read more: U.S. ready to strike ISIS, officials say . French air support . In his remarks, Obama said the United States is building a ""broad international coalition."" As part of that coalition, France will join the air campaign in Iraq, he said. Read more: Who is doing what in the coalition? France carried out its first airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq on Friday morning, President Francois Hollande announced in a statement. It used Rafale fighter jets to attack a logistics warehouse used by the group in northeastern Iraq, the statement said, adding that the target had been ""reached and completely destroyed."" Further operations will be conducted in the next few days. Hollande said Thursday that there had been French reconnaissance flights over Iraq this week. When officials ""identify targets, we will act"" in a short time frame, he told reporters in Paris. Hollande thanked the United Arab Emirates for allowing France to use an air base there. Hollande stressed that France ""will not go beyond"" air support and will not send ground troops into Iraq. Iraq: More than 1,000 soldiers MIA . ISIS captured 16 predominantly Kurdish villages in northern Syria over the past 24 hours, a Syrian opposition group said. ISIS fighters used artillery and tanks against the villages along the Syria-Turkey border, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Just as in Syria, the crisis in Iraq continues to unfold. Iraq's Human Rights Ministry said Thursday that 1,095 Iraqi soldiers still are missing after an ISIS attack in June on a military base formerly known as Camp Speicher. ISIS says it killed 1,700 Iraqi troops in the attack. The Iraqi government hasn't released a number of those killed; Human Rights Watch says ISIS executed hundreds of soldiers. The news came as ISIS released a video of British hostage John Cantlie criticizing the American and British governments for their failure to negotiate for the hostages as other governments have done. In a video posted online, Cantlie -- wearing an orange shirt and seated alone at a desk with a black backdrop -- says he is sending what will be the first in a series of messages on behalf of the group that calls itself the Islamic State. Since Cantlie is delivering ISIS propaganda and makes clear in the video he is speaking under duress, CNN is not showing the video on its platforms. In recent weeks, ISIS has drawn growing attention for spewing brutal propaganda across social media -- messages meant both to terrify and recruit Westerners. The group appears to have a well-funded, well-organized social media and video production effort. Its videos are slickly produced, with high production values, experts say.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords works hard every day to overcome the devastating effects of a gunshot wound in the brain that would have killed most people. The grueling physical, occupational and speech therapy is helping the Arizona congresswoman get to a point where she can make a decision about returning to office, said her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly. Thursday, the couple will spend an emotional Thanksgiving in Tucson. There's ""a lot to be thankful for,"" Kelly told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" in an interview broadcast Wednesday. ""Gabby's alive, first of all, and ... she's been able to recover,"" Kelly said. ""She'd remind people to be thankful for your health, your family and for being alive. "" Giffords is generally in an ""upbeat mood,"" Kelly said, and is not angry about what happened to her. ""She'll come back stronger than ever, I'm convinced."" The couple have chronicled their experience in a new book, ""Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."" Jared Loughner, 23, is accused of wounding Giffords and 12 others, and killing six people, in the shooting at a meet-and-greet event for the congresswoman outside a Tucson shopping center in January. Early on, Kelly said, Giffords said she would like to see Loughner' ""rot"" if convicted. ""I think she feels differently now,"" Kelly said. ""She understands he's very sick and needs to be treated."" Last week, Giffords told ABC's Diane Sawyer that she was sad about the six people who died in the shooting. ""I cried. A lot of people died,"" Giffords said, telling Sawyer she doesn't remember the next 13 days at a hospital in Tucson before she was flown to a rehabilitation hospital in Houston. Kelly told Morgan he initially did not tell Giffords about the people who died that day. Eventually, the congresswoman saw newspaper articles about the incident. Giffords caught him when he skipped over the deaths when reading one article, Kelly said. ""She was reading over my shoulder and pointed out that I'd left that out,"" Kelly said. ""I read the paragraph where it talked about six people being killed."" Giffords appeared ""shocked."" A few minutes later, she broke down in the middle of her speech therapy class. ""It was tough,"" said Kelly, who retired last month as a Navy captain. The nature of her brain injury allowed Giffords during therapy to sing an entire song, even when she couldn't speak a sentence, Kelly said. ""So she would sing a song. And the therapists kind of used that to help rebuild connections,"" Kelly said. ""They talk about the plasticity of the brain and that it's able to form new connections."" A therapist would play songs by U2, a favorite band of Giffords. The former astronaut, 47, recalled the 30 minutes that transpired after a couple of news networks reported that Giffords had died. ""It was a tough situation. My mother screamed; kids started crying,"" Kelly said. ""I just got up, walked into the airplane's bathroom and, you know, just broke down. And it was a difficult period of time. But, in hindsight, looking at it, that was the low point. And it's all been pretty positive since then."" Giffords has made what doctors call a miraculous recovery since the shooting. Her neurosurgeon, Dr. Dong Kim, recently told CNN that Giffords' thought process is normal -- a remarkable feat for someone with the kind of injuries she suffered. She is currently able to answer questions with a few words or a short phrase.","Giffords had one-word reply for what should happen to Jared Loughner .

"(CNN) -- It's not much of a stretch to call Nigel Richards a wordsmith. The champion of the 2010 National Scrabble Championship has a photographic memory, said John D. Williams, Jr., the head of the tournament that wrapped Wednesday at the Hotel InterContinental in Dallas, Texas. ""He is probably the best Scrabble player in the world at this point,"" Williams said of the 43-year-old New Zealand security analyst, who lives in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ""He's got the entire dictionary memorized. He's pretty much a Scrabble machine, if such a thing exists."" Richards, now a two-time national champion, spelled his way to first place over the five-day competition, beating out over 400 competitors from 42 states and four countries. Richards collected a $10,000 prize and bragging rights for his knowledge of the English language with his victory. Second-place honors went to another former national and world champion, Brian Cappelletto, 40, an options trader from Chicago, Illinois. Laurie Cohen, 43, a research director at a community college from Tempe, Arizona, came in third. Competitors in the tournament included everyone from doctors and lawyers to truck drivers and school teachers, and ranged in age from 12 to 92, according to Williams. If all this sounds intimidating, it doesn't have to be. Williams said amateurs can get pretty good pretty fast and see their scores jump with a bit of research. ""There are about 100 two-letter words, and they're very valuable to know,"" according to Williams. ""Things like 'za' which is slang for pizza, and 'qi' which is a variation of the 'Chi' in 'Tai Chi."" In winning this year's championship, Richards used the word ""zarf"" - a coffee cup holder that does not have a handle. Another fundamental strategy is something Scrabble enthusiasts call ""rack management."" ""You might make a good move and score 25 points, but if you leave 'z', 'u' and 'w' on your rack you're going to have a terrible rack for the next four or five turns,"" Williams explained. Still, as large as your vocabulary might be, it's not always enough to claim victory. Lady Luck is an undeniable factor in succeeding at the game. ""Scrabble is about 25 percent luck,"" Williams said. ""So when there are two players of equal ability, the player with the best tiles is going to win unless the other guy really screws up."" Although, like most board games, Scrabble faces competition from newer forms of entertainment, like the internet and video games, Williams insists it is hardly showing its age. ""Scrabble is culturally at an all-time high,"" according to Williams, who said board games tend to have a spike popularity during tough economic times. ""People simplify their lives, they stay at home and spend time with their families, and don't spend as much money.""","The Scrabble champion takes home $10,000 .

"(CNN) -- Four crew members escaped and two others were taken hostage from the crash of a Ukrainian transport plane hit by a rocket over the Luhansk region near the Russian border, a Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov said Tuesday. All eight on board the plane downed Monday were Ukrainians, Seleznyov said. In addition, two others remain missing, he said. It's unclear who is responsible for taking hostages. The four who escaped ""are in a safe location,"" the Defense Ministry said. Video posted to YouTube appears to show people watching as at least one person parachutes and a huge plume of dark smoke rises from the ground. The rocket that struck the plane Monday appears to have come from Russia, Kiev officials said. The Ukrainian military has been battling pro-Russian separatists in the area where the Antonov-26 aircraft went down, officials said. The plane's altitude was too high to be fired on from the ground with a portable missile system, according to a statement from Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The plane was hit with ""a more powerful missile weapon that was probably used from the territory of the Russian Federation,"" the statement said. A spokeswoman with the Russian President's office said Monday she could not confirm any missile had been fired from the Russian Federation. On Friday, pro-Russian separatists fired rockets at a Ukrainian military camp in the Luhansk region, killing 19 troops and injuring at least 55 others, according to Ukraine's counterterrorism office.

"London (CNN) -- With just days to go before the Olympic Games open in London, questions over the provision of security guards for the event are dominating the British media. Thousands of team officials and athletes are arriving this week, and throngs of visitors are expected to follow. But should they be worried? The security concerns were triggered last week when it emerged that private security contractor G4S, which was supposed to have provided 10,400 guards for the Olympics and Paralympics, would not be able to deliver. Its failure to recruit, train and vet enough staff in time led the government to announce last week that it was deploying an extra 3,500 troops to cover the shortfall. G4S said it has only about 4,000 guards trained and ready, although it hopes to have 7,000 fully accredited by the time the Games begin on July 27. While the recruitment failure by G4S is highly embarrassing for the company -- and led its share price to drop sharply -- the Games' organizers insist that their contingency planning will keep everyone safe. Visitors can certainly expect to see far more visible security measures in place than usual at Games venues and transport hubs. Sebastian Coe, the chairman of the London organizing group, LOCOG, said Tuesday that the only real difference resulting from the G4S debacle would be in who is performing the security checks. ""The numbers really haven't changed. It's really simply about the mix of security on the park,"" he was quoted as saying by the Press Association news agency. LOCOG is working with G4S to try to ensure that as many people as possible are accredited in time, Coe said, adding, ""This is not a failure in numbers. We've got the numbers there. There's no compromise on security."" Home Secretary Theresa May gave a similar message last week as she was grilled by lawmakers on the matter, saying, ""There is no question of Olympic security being compromised."" Critics have been less positive, with some Labour Party lawmakers concerned that security will be inadequate or that visitors will be made uncomfortable by a prominent military presence. The chief executive of G4S, Nick Buckles, was forced to agree Tuesday under questioning from lawmakers that the security staffing fiasco is ""a humiliating shambles for the country."" The Home Office said Monday that G4S is suffering from a software problem, which means the contractor cannot guarantee who will turn up where and whether guards have the right training. The guards employed by G4S will be responsible chiefly for such tasks as providing venue perimeter security, a spokesman for the contractor said. This includes manning X-ray machines, searching people, searching vehicles and operating closed-circuit television systems, he said. People with tickets for Olympic events have been sent e-mails giving details of the security requirements for each venue. These include airport-style limits on the size of bags that can be carried and the quantity of liquids that can be taken in. One such e-mail reads, ""Be prepared for security checks when you arrive: this will be like taking an international flight at an airport. It will be busy and you will have to queue, so get there early."" The 17,000 British military personnel deployed for the Games, including the extra 3,500 troops called up at short notice, are to help out with the security checks and stewarding at venues, as well as specialist tasks such as bomb disposal and sniffer dog searches. Military jets and helicopters are also on standby around the capital, ready to respond to any threat, and new airspace restrictions came into force Saturday around London and the southeast. The Royal Navy's largest ship, the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, is now moored in the Thames off Greenwich, where it will act as a base for helicopter operations and house 400 troops providing security at the Greenwich Park Olympic venue. Police in London and elsewhere also will play a big role in ensuring security. Well before the G4S debacle hit the headlines, London's Metropolitan Police Service, known as the Met, was planning what it says is its biggest-ever peacetime operation. The operation will ""run for 66 days and cover over 1,000 venues, including those hosting Olympic and Paralympic sports, cultural events and 2012-themed celebrations taking place across the capital,"" the website says. On the busiest days, up to 9,500 police officers will be used, including some from forces outside London, for Games-related operations, it says. Officers at Olympic venues will focus on preventing crime and keeping people and their property safe, while G4S is responsible for the security operation, it says. Away from the venues, the Met will also have to provide the usual policing for the city and its visitors. The Games come just over a year after parts of London were rocked by rioting that led to police being brought in from elsewhere in England to help bring the disorder under control. The threat of a potential terrorist strike has also been in the news in recent days after a number of arrests, although police said the operations were not linked to the Olympic Games. The terror threat level on the UK Home Office website remains unchanged at ""substantial,"" which is the third highest of five levels. The next level up is ""severe,"" which means an attack is ""highly likely,"" and the highest is ""critical,"" meaning an attack is ""expected imminently."" Government officials from Washington to London insist that there are no known specific or credible terror threats tied to the Olympics. Travel to and around the United Kingdom will nevertheless be a focus of security efforts. Visitors arriving at London's Heathrow Airport can expect to see every desk at passport control manned during the Olympic Games, the home secretary said last week. Immigration desks have extra staffers, Heathrow said Monday, amid fears of long lines to get into the country as security checks are carried out. Retired border officials and retired police officers are among those being brought in to supplement immigration staff, the Home Office said. Officials from outside the United Kingdom may also be lending a hand in certain areas. The UK Department for Transport said a small number of staff from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration will be based at certain British airports ""to act as an on-site liaison for the TSA."" The TSA staffers will not, however, be conducting security screening or inspections, the Department for Transport said. U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said Tuesday that his country has full faith and confidence in Britain's ability to provide security. The United States is sending senior diplomatic security staff to Britain to act as liaisons, Ventrell said, adding that the TSA has a ""handful"" of agents in the country. Meanwhile, London's public transport authorities have been warning commuters for weeks to avoid travel hotspots around the time of the Games -- but have not stressed any additional security risk. The city's transport network is not immune to terror threats, as the attacks of July 2005 showed. But visitors can seek reassurance in the fact that Britain's police and intelligence officials have been successful since then in foiling attacks on the capital. In the 2005 incident, three bombs were detonated on underground trains and one on a bus in the city. The blasts killed 52 people and wounded more than 770. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is in charge of the Olympic preparations, said it will be ""a very safe and secure Olympics."" ""We have had a contractor who has let us down ... but we had a contingency plan in place,"" he said. ""It's not possible to secure every single square inch of a huge global city like London, but where there are important concentrations of Olympic activity ... then there will be a security regime before you can enter those. Obviously the actual Olympic venues will be very tightly secured."" Hunt said the vigilance of the public will also be important. ""So far, we have not received intelligence of any particular additional threats, but this is a city that has huge experience of dealing with security issues over very many years,"" he said. CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. State Department has full faith and confidence in Britain's security measures .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Sen. Barack Obama's decision to reject roughly $85 million in public financing -- as well as the strict spending limits that would accompany those funds -- did not come as a surprise to most political observers. The decision was criticized by his opponent, some Democrats and public interest groups. But does the public really care? Probably not. The presumptive Democratic nominee has smashed fundraising records this cycle by harnessing the power of the Internet to raise the once unimaginable sum of almost $266 million from more than 1.5 million donors through the end of April. Obama's fundraising machine shows no sign of slowing down anytime soon. If anything, it will only pick up the pace now that a whole new pool of donors has been made available with the elimination of Sen. Hillary Clinton from the campaign. Sen. John McCain, on the other hand, has raised $93 million through April. A significant number of unenthusiastic conservatives have so far been unwilling to open their wallets for the presumptive GOP nominee. McCain, in what could turn out to be a tragically ironic twist of fate for his campaign, angered many of the same wealthy Republican donors he now desperately needs by trumpeting the cause of campaign finance reform throughout most of his Senate career. Obama is the first presidential candidate to reject public funding since the creation of the post-Watergate campaign finance system. He all but ensures that he will be able to outspend McCain significantly in every swing state -- in the ground game and on the airwaves -- through November. For his part, Obama argues that he opted out of public funding because ""the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken, and we face opponents who've become masters at gaming this broken system."" Tapping into a fear among many Democrats who still angrily remember the ""swift boat"" attacks against Sen. John Kerry in 2004, Obama says, ""We've already seen that [the McCain campaign is] not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so-called 527 groups, who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations."" McCain's advisers, not surprisingly, have a different take on Obama's decision. They argue that Obama failed to abide by his pledge, as stated in a response to a questionnaire from the Midwest Democracy Network in November, to ""aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election.""  Watch McCain blast Obama's decision » . ""The true test of a candidate for president is whether he will stand on principle and keep his word to the American people,"" said Jill Hazelbaker, McCain's communications director. ""Barack Obama has failed that test, and his reversal of his promise to participate in the public finance system undermines his call for a new type of politics."" Some Democrats and public interest groups were also critical. ""This is not a good decision,"" said Sen. Russ Feingold, co-author of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill. ""While the current public financing system for the presidential primaries is broken, the system for the general election is not. The entire system must be updated."" Common Cause issued a statement noting that ""Sen. Obama did say at one point that he would opt into the system if his opponent did the same, and for that he gets a demerit."" Most polling on the issue indicates that a majority of voters are not fond of the idea of bankrolling presidential campaigns. In an August 2007 Gallup Poll, 57 percent of respondents said that federal financing of presidential candidates was unacceptable, while 41 percent agreed with the idea. A larger share of voters (47 percent) said it was more acceptable for candidates to raise money for their campaigns from much-maligned political action committees. Ninety-three percent had no problem with individual contributions made by ordinary citizens. ""For years now, polls have suggested that many Americans don't see the point in giving tax dollars directly to politicians,"" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. ""That's why public financing of campaigns has not been wildly popular, as shown by the relatively low number of taxpayers who use the checkoff box on their tax forms to allocate money to the system that Obama has opted out of."" Indeed, since public financing of general elections first came into effect for the 1976 campaign, the percentage of taxpayers choosing to contribute to the presidential election fund has steadily declined. In 1976, almost 28 percent of taxpayers contributed to the fund. In 2006, slightly less than 11 percent agreed to steer $3 of their taxes to the fund. If Obama's campaign is hurt at all by this decision, that damage may result more from a public perception of hypocrisy than from any consternation over a rejection of taxpayer dollars. The McCain campaign has seemed to acknowledge so by criticizing Obama for flip-flopping on the issue instead of trying to defend the merits of public funding. Moving forward, McCain said Thursday that he will take public financing this fall. The senator from Arizona may be trying to make a virtue out of necessity. Unable to compete with Obama's fundraising prowess, McCain may try to claim the moral high ground by portraying himself as a straight-talking underdog, while simultaneously painting Obama as an untrustworthy adversary. Obama likely will continue to defend his decision by criticizing McCain for failing to rein in the Republican-leaning organizations such as those that launched such damaging attacks against Kerry. At the same time, securing an overwhelming financial advantage in the final months of the 2008 campaign in exchange for a small slap on the wrist from groups such as Common Cause isn't such a bad tradeoff. As the old saying goes, money probably will always be the mother's milk of politics.","Sen. Barack Obama first candidate to reject public funding since system's creation .

"(CNN) -- As her friends, her family and the world celebrated Maya Angelou last weekend, I am struck by the imprint she left on me. Maya Angelou was a shining example of how powerful and strong, good and giving, courageous and dignified, gracious and lovely a human being can be. Her generosity of spirit is truly beautiful. Whether she was doing an interview with a stranger or talking to a friend, she was so giving of her spirit, always making whomever she was talking with feel important and lifted up.

Because she saw the best in us, we could see it in ourselves. And once we saw it we had a responsibility to live it. We were talking once about writing songs and why I had been hesitant for so long to really jump in and write my own songs. She said, ""Sometimes it's not the fear of failing at something that holds us back. It's the fear of succeeding. Because we know that once we take that step and do whatever we've been holding back and succeed at it, the world will expect more of us."" So true. Maya's wisdom and generosity of spirit inspired us all. What if she had hid that light? She was brave enough and open enough and strong enough to share her brilliant mind and spirit with the whole world. And we are all better for it.

"Washington (CNN) -- A gun recovered from this month's shooting at the Pentagon was once in the possession of the Memphis Police Department, a law enforcement official told CNN. Memphis, Tennessee, police seized the Ruger 9 mm handgun during a traffic stop in 2005 and in 2008 traded it to a distributor in Georgia. It passed through a distributor in Pennsylvania and a dealer in Las Vegas, Nevada, before being sold at a gun show, after which the trail goes cold. Memphis Mayor A.C. Wharton, a Democrat, said he would review the Police Department's practice of selling or trading guns in police possession, in spite of the revenue it brings. ""I just don't want our city having any role in getting a confiscated gun back on the streets,"" he told CNN affiliate WREG on Sunday. Authorities say John Patrick Bedell, 36, of California, armed with two 9 mm handguns, shot and wounded two security guards outside the Pentagon on March 4 before he was fatally shot. Bedell had repeatedly tangled with police and had been institutionalized at least three times for mental problems, according to California authorities. Some cities destroy weapons that come into their possession. A former New York Police Department official said the city sends as many as 20,000 guns a year to be smelted for scrap metal. But a bill signed on the same day as the Pentagon shooting bars Tennessee police from destroying contraband guns. It says they must either sell such weapons or use them unless a police official ""certifies to the court the weapon is inoperable or unsafe."" Police in Memphis also once possessed the gun used in January shootings at a Las Vegas, Nevada, courthouse, according to the law enforcement official. As reported first by the Associated Press, the shotgun used in that attack, which killed an officer Stanley Cooper, was confiscated in 1998 in Memphis and handed over to county officials. The Shelby County Sheriff's Office traded it to a gun store in Massachusetts several years ago, and it was shipped to a store in Arizona and eventually sold to someone at a gun show. Shelby County sheriff's spokesman Steve Shular said trading confiscated guns for upgraded weapons is an efficient way to get adequate equipment for officers protecting the public at a time when law enforcement is asked to make cutbacks in personnel and operating expenses. He added that now, Shelby County trades only used law enforcement weapons, not confiscated weapons. Wharton said the revenue from trade-ins is not worth it. ""You ask the people in Vegas, and ask those officers at the Pentagon: Was it worth $100,000 for those guns to be used against them?"" Gun rights advocate Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America said it doesn't matter whether a gun has passed through the hands of a police department if it is sold legally. ""It's no different for a law enforcement agency to sell its guns than it is for a private dealer to sell its guns,"" Pratt said. ""They're both going to be going into the private market."" Memphis police spokeswoman Karen Rudolph said her department would have a hard time controlling what happens to weapons after they are traded. ""It is an unfortunate coincidence, and not within the control of the Memphis Police Department, that the firearms used in both of these high-profile incidents were not properly and legally distributed after being legally obtained by federally licensed law enforcement weapons dealers,"" Rudolph said. The suspects in neither the Las Vegas attack nor the Pentagon case were eligible to buy a gun at a store. In the Las Vegas case, suspect Johnny Wicks would have been ineligible because of a prior felony conviction. Bedell, who had a history of mental illness, failed a background check when he tried to buy a gun in Sacramento, California, his family said. He received a letter from the California attorney general's office in January saying he could not buy a gun because of his history. Because both guns were sold at gun shows, where records and background checks are not required, authorities are uncertain how either weapon ultimately got into the hands of the suspects. While some cities are selling guns, cities including Miami, Florida; Boston, Massachusetts; and Oakland, California, have mounted efforts to buy guns from the public. A federal gun buyback initiative, begun under President Clinton, ended under President George W. Bush amid debate over its effectiveness.

"(CNN) -- A new variation of bird flu that the WHO says has caused at least 11 deaths in China has genetic characteristics that make it well-adapted to infect people. In a report published late Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine, samples from three patients -- all of whom died -- had mutations that have previously been shown to increase transmissibility, and to help the virus grow in a mammal's respiratory tract. The analysis comes amid a modest but steady stream of human cases since the end of March. Saturday, China reported a 7-year-old Beijing girl is the latest person to become infected with the H7N9 flu strain, bringing the total to 44. The strain is normally found in birds, and until last month was never known to infect people. ""The H7N9 situation is evolving very quickly,"" said Nancy Cox, director of the Influenza Division at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""One thing of concern is the pace at which we are seeing the identification of cases."" Another death in China bird flu crisis as Hong Kong goes on alert . On a more reassuring note, investigators have found no evidence that the virus has passed directly from person to person. More than a thousand ""close contacts"" of the patients are being monitored by Chinese health officials, according to the World Health Organization. One concerning mutation, known as ""Substitution Q226L,"" was found in two of the first three victims. Past experiments have shown it to make viruses -- including the H5N1 bird flu virus -- more likely to infect ferrets, which are commonly used in flu research. The same mutation was also found in the viruses that caused the 1957 and 1968 flu pandemics. A second mutation, known as ""PB2 E627K,"" was found in all three virus samples. According to Dr. Ron Fouchier, a Dutch virologist, this mutation allows the virus to reproduce at much lower temperatures than a standard avian influenza virus. The change lets it grow in a human respiratory tract, which is cooler than the virus' natural home: a bird's gastrointestinal tract. In mice, Fouchier said, the mutation makes the infection as much as 1,000 times more virulent. A number of other mutations were found as well, including changes that are characteristic of viruses found in mammals. China's bird flu mystery . ""Known normal bird viruses have to adapt substantially to infect people, but not these,"" said Fouchier, who said the changes are enough that he would no longer call the H7N9 strain ""bird flu."" The first three patients to be identified are an 87-year-old man and a 27-year-old man from Shanghai, and a 35-year-old housewife from Anhui. The woman had visited a chicken market about a week before falling ill. The younger man was a butcher who worked in a market where live birds were sold, although he did not butcher any birds. The 87-year-old had no known exposure to live birds. All three died after suffering severe respiratory symptoms, including acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventually septic shock and multiple organ failure. In a commentary that ran with the article, Cox and Dr. Tim Uyeki, a physician with the CDC, noted that patients were not given antiviral medication until their illness became severe. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) should be administered as soon as possible to patients with a suspected or confirmed H7N9 infection, the two wrote. Cox said it remains unclear whether the severe illnesses are typical of H7N9 infection or simply the tip of a large iceberg in which a large number of mild cases are going unnoticed. ""As surveillance has expanded, we're also seeing individuals with milder cases,"" said Cox. ""We're still seeing very severe disease in some cases, but overall I think it's somewhat reassuring."" The CDC is in the final steps of refining a diagnostic test to identify H7N9 in patients, and Cox said it should be available for distribution in a matter of days. A widely available diagnostic test would allow faster identification of patients who actually have the infection, and would also help disease detectives zero in on how people are being exposed. Work has begun on a vaccine, although Cox and others said that even if it is eventually needed, a vaccine likely won't be available for several months. While the overall picture is concerning, flu experts urged calm. ""I wouldn't say a pandemic is more likely than it was a year ago,"" Fouchier said. ""The only thing we can do as virologists right now is to point out the interesting characteristics of the virus, try to get to the bottom of this story and try to stop further infections.""","A new bird flu variation has caused 11 deaths in China .

"(CNN) -- Seven years after devastating terrorist attacks brought death to New York's World Trade Centers, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field, the first permanent, on-site memorial is being dedicated Thursday at the Pentagon. An artist's rendering shows the New York 9/11 memorial, with the museum entry pavilion between two pools. Official memorials at the other two sites are still years away. In New York, construction has begun on a complex that will include a memorial with a tree-shaded plaza and reflecting pools, and an underground museum with an entry pavilion. It's part of a bigger project, including new office towers and a transportation hub, whose target date has been repeatedly delayed. The goal is to open the memorial to the public by the 10th anniversary of the attacks, in 2011, and the museum by the year after. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg stressed the importance of those dates and called progress ""frustratingly slow"" in an opinion piece published Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal. ""The memorial must be completed by the 10th anniversary,"" Bloomberg wrote. ""No more excuses, no more delays.""  Watch and listen to Thursday's memorial services » . However, on CNN's ""American Morning"" Thursday, Bloomberg said quality is more important than speed of construction. ""We want to make sure what we build is the right thing, that 100 years from now people will look back and say, 'They built it well and built the right thing,'"" Bloomberg said. ""Nobody's going to remember if it took five years or 10 years. I'd like it to go faster. I've recommended we reduce the level of bureaucracy, but that's not our number one priority."" Federal, state and local governments, as well as several agencies and private developers are involved in the planning and construction. ""It's a complex site, and there was an extensive public process involved in determining the plans for the site,"" Lynn Rasic of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum said Wednesday. ""And I think what's important now is that we look forward and do everything possible to meet the 10th anniversary date."" iReport: How are you observing 9/11? The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site, says it's on board as far as the date for opening the memorial. Completion dates for the museum and pavilion are part of a review to be finished by September 30, Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman said. ""We don't want to put any more false hopes, false dates out there in the public domain that can't be met. That's why they want to make sure this thing is a thorough review and we have realistic and achievable dates that we come out with,"" he said. Coleman said the Port Authority hasn't felt pressure from families of September 11 victims to speed up the process. ""What we're hearing from family members is that they want to see it done right, rather than rushed,"" he said. The memorial will feature two huge reflecting pools, with waterfalls flowing down their sides, where the iconic twin towers stood, according to the memorial's Web site. Engraved around the pools will be the names of those who died in the September 11 attacks as well as the victims of a 1993 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.

The Pennsylvania memorial is also scheduled to be completed by the 10th anniversary of the attacks. It will center on the site where United Flight 93 crashed after passengers apparently wrested control of the plane from the hijackers. A plaza will surround the crash site, known as Sacred Ground. Plans call for a Tower of Voices, with 40 windchimes representing the 40 passengers and crew members who died.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. expects the level of violence in Iraq to rise as it goes ahead with its planned withdrawal of troops from Iraqi cities by June 30, the Pentagon said Wednesday. Except for soldiers in advisory roles, all U.S. combat troops will leave Iraqi cities and towns by June 30. Under the terms of its agreement with the Iraqi government, the U.S. will remove all combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns -- leaving security responsibilities to the Iraqis and remaining only in a training and advisory capacity. In areas outside of the cities and towns, the U.S. military will continue to conduct combat operations and security patrols in coordination with the Iraqis. Violent attacks are at an ""all-time"" low according to Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell, but there continue to be sporadic high-profile attacks by insurgents, including a blast that killed 62 people and injured 150 others at a Baghdad market on Wednesday. Such a spike in violence is to be expected, Morrell told reporters Wednesday, ""based upon the pattern of behavior that we've seen over the past few weeks, and, frankly, historically in Iraq, leading up to seminal dates, whether it be elections or other significant dates, of an uptick in the operational tempo of terrorists and insurgents."" In a letter to U.S. troops, the top U.S. commander insisted the withdrawal was appropriate. ""This is the right time to transition security of the cities to the ISF [Iraq Security Force] who are ready for this task,"" Gen. Raymond Odierno wrote on June 21. While the U.S. has seen progress, it is not ready to declare victory in Iraq and Morrell suggested such a declaration may never happen. ""I don't think anybody's too preoccupied with declaring victory. I don't think that was necessarily something we'll ever do,"" Morrell said at a news conference at the Pentagon. The notion of declaring victory is controversial since former President Bush's declaration in May 2003 that major combat operations in Iraq were over while he was standing under a sign reading ""Mission Accomplished."" The pronouncement was premature, with violence and deaths of U.S. troops and Iraqi civilians escalating in the years that followed.","As agreed upon, U.S. will remove all combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Four female suicide bombers and a gunman killed at least 70 people and wounded almost 300 others during a string of attacks in central Baghdad and Kirkuk on Monday, officials said. An Iraqi man examines a tuft of human hair at the site of a suicide bombing in northern Baghdad on Monday. In Baghdad, three suicide bombers detonated their explosives in three locations within 30 minutes of each other. The attacks killed at least 32 people and wounded 102 others, most of them Shiite pilgrims, an Interior Ministry official said. It was the second day attackers have targeted Shiite pilgrims taking part in an annual march to one of the Shiites' holiest shrines. On Sunday afternoon, seven pilgrims were gunned down in a town south of Baghdad.  Watch the pilgrims on the move » . About 150 miles north of the capital, another suicide bomber ran into a crowd of protesters at a Kurdish political rally, a police official said. After she detonated the explosives she was carrying, gunmen began firing into the crowd from different directions, the official said. The attack killed at least 38 people and wounded 178 others, the official said. A bomb was discovered in a parked car near the site of the attack. It was destroyed in a controlled explosion by Iraqi security forces, an Interior Ministry official said. Thousands of Kurds had gathered in central Kirkuk to protest an election law that the Iraqi parliament passed last week, despite opposition from the Iraqi presidency council. The Kurds consider the region encompassing Kirkuk -- a city of Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen -- majority Kurdish. The Kurds, who have had intense political disputes with Arabs and Turkmen, oppose any power-sharing arrangement that would not reflect what they believe is their majority. They also want a referendum asking Kirkuk residents whether they want to be part of the Kurdish Regional Government.  Map » . Following Monday's attack, Kirkuk authorities imposed a curfew on the city from 3 p.m. Monday until 7 a.m. Tuesday, a police official said. All cars and pedestrian traffic will be banned, he said. The Iraqi Islamic Party, one of the main Sunni parties, condemned the Kirkuk attack, blaming it on ""sides that do not want stability in the city and are working to escalate the situation."" It said the attack comes at a ""critical and sensitive time where there has been an increase in talks about the fate of Kirkuk and provincial council elections."" The use of female bombers is an increasingly common method for staging suicide attacks in Iraq because male security forces will not search women and few women have been trained to conduct searches. Nearly two dozen suicide attacks have been carried out by female bombers in 2008 -- up from eight in 2007 -- according to U.S. military figures. Before the bombings, security officials said they had deployed more than 200 women to conduct searches in Kadhimiya, in northwestern Baghdad, because of the rise in female suicide bombers. The Sunday attack on Shiite pilgrims happened in the predominantly Sunni area of Salman Pak, also referred to as al-Madaen. The Shiite pilgrims were walking to a shrine in Kadhimiya that commemorates the 8th century death of Imam Moussa al-Kadhim. The pilgrims -- all males -- were carrying black flags and chanting religious songs before the attack. They were attacked in a region that al Qaeda in Iraq controlled before Iraqi security forces gained control. Al Qaeda in Iraq cells reportedly remain in villages around the town. In recent days, hundreds of thousands of Shiite pilgrims have begun walking to Kadhimiya for the annual commemoration of al-Kadhim's death. Many have traveled from across the country, especially from Iraq's southern Shiite provinces. Iraqi security forces have established checkpoints and are conducting foot patrols to protect pilgrims. People entering Kadhimiya are not allowed to carry weapons, bags, cell phones, radios or any type of communication devices, authorities said. Pilgrims have been warned against accepting food and drinks from strangers. They've also been told to discount rumors of suicide bombers. Such a rumor triggered a stampede that killed about 1,000 people during the pilgrimage in 2005.

"(CNN) -- As you celebrate the holidays with family, friends and those adorable companion animals known as pets, you should be thrilled to learn that the distant cousins of your pets have just won a historic victory. West Hollywood, California, recently passed a first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of fur within its city limits, effective in 2013. West Hollywood City Council member John D'Amico, who spearheaded the ordinance, told me, ""We didn't want to be a city that supported the raising of animals to be killed just for fashion."" Well put. If you wouldn't want somebody skinning your dog or cat for their fur, then why would you allow the same horror to befall other equally sentient beings? The raccoons, foxes, beavers, chinchillas, minks, rabbits, and yes, sometimes even dogs and cats that are killed for fur are not very different from your beloved dog or cat. They all have eyes, ears and hearts. They all experience pain when they are physically maimed. They shake with fear when they experience terror. ""I am just so baffled by this. This is pure politics at its worst,"" the executive director of the Fur Information Council, Keith Kaplan, said. But there's nothing to be baffled about. Historically, the exploitation of animals is driven by the desire for profit. And throughout history, the most predictable argument against progress toward civility is that change is going to cost us money. Opponents claim nearly half of the 200 apparel stores in town sell at least some fur items. But the law doesn't go into effect for nearly two years. D'Amico says that's plenty of time for stores to cycle out their fur inventory. They can either sell it off fast or -- better yet -- donate it to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. PETA in turn gives the furs away to the homeless. The councilman told me he believed the ban will ultimately bring West Hollywood much more business than it will lose. He is working to develop a ""fur-free shopping day,"" he said, and a yearly fur-free event, leading up to the time when the ban kicks in. He also plans to leverage the global attention that the fur ban has garnered to draw sympathetic shoppers to West Hollywood. There are obviously cruelty-free alternatives to fur that are very functional and warm the body even more than fur. Those can be, and are, sold for profit. Some wonder, well, if you take the anti-fur argument to its logical conclusion, is banning the sale of leather next? D'Amico responds, ""Incremental thinking about the way we are in the world is important and has always been important and this is an example of it."" Unfortunately, fur is still flying off the racks. It's a billion dollar industry. To those who say, ""I love animals, but --"" I say, check out the facts. Do you even have the stomach to watch a minute or two of these innocent creatures -- who have done nothing to humans -- trying to bite off their own legs because they're stuck in excruciatingly painful leg hold traps? Or how about watching the electrocution of fur-bearing animals on so-called fur farms? I've seen both. As an animal rights activist, I've supported the documentary ""Skin Trade,"" which shows it all. The images haunt me, particularly when I see women head to toe in fur. Irish statesman Edmund Burke said, ""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing."" Well, the good people of West Hollywood have actually done something. They've gone out of their way to fight for the most voiceless in our world -- animals. D'Amico hopes the state of California will one day follow suit and start turning the West Coast fur-free. But even though he knows of no other city that is considering a similar ban, he hopes -- as do I -- that West Hollywood's action has sparked a collective re-examination of a practice that many believe has no place in the 21st century. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jane Velez-Mitchell.","Jane Velez-Mitchell says West Hollywood recently passed ban on selling furs in the city .
She says if you would be troubled by your own pet being skinned, you should reject furs .
She says shop owners in that city have nearly two years to find alternatives to selling fur .
Velez-Mitchell: The ban is an idea that should spread among civilized people ."
"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Six car bombings in four hours killed 48 people and wounded 81 in various Baghdad neighborhoods Wednesday, according to Iraq's Interior Ministry. Iraqi soldiers survey one of the Baghdad marketplaces where car bombs detonated Wednesday. In a separate incident, five people were killed and three wounded by a roadside bomb south of Baghdad, a ministry official said. Most of the deaths came when three car bombs parked at separate but nearby marketplaces exploded in quick succession in the eastern Baghdad Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City, killing at least 45 people and injuring at least 68, the ministry official said. Three other car bombings followed. Two of those, outside a Shiite mosque in the Hurriya district of northern Baghdad, killed three people and wounded eight. The bombs exploded in close succession shortly before 9 p.m. (2 p.m. ET). A third a few hours earlier injured at least five civilians in a predominantly Shiite area of southwestern Baghdad, according to the ministry. Wednesday's series of bombings echoed an incident earlier this month, when seven car bombs detonated within about four hours. The U.S. military blamed al Qaeda in Iraq for what it called coordinated attacks. Sadr City is a heavily populated Shiite area, with an estimated 2.5 million people packed into a 25-square-kilometer area. The district was a stronghold of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army, but most of the fighters went underground after fierce fighting in April 2008. In a seventh bombing Wednesday night, at least five people died and three were wounded south of Baghdad, a ministry official said. A roadside bomb struck a minibus in Hor Rajab, a predominantly Sunni area on the southern outskirts of Baghdad. The casualties were all civilians, the official said. There has been an uptick in bombings and attacks in recent weeks, mainly targeting Shiites and Shiite areas. Last Thursday and Friday, five suicide bombings, as well as other attacks in Baghdad and Diyala province, left almost 160 people dead and 275 wounded. Earlier Wednesday, U.S. and Iraqi troops were ambushed in northern Iraq, according to Maj. Derrick Cheng, spokesman for the U.S. military's Multi-National Division-North. The troops were on a joint mission in Riyadh, southwest of Kirkuk, where coalition forces are working with local police to provide micro-grants to small businesses, Cheng said. Several individuals attacked the troops using at least one grenade and small arms fire, he said. Cheng said two of the attackers reportedly were killed and another two were wounded. A woman reportedly was injured by shrapnel from the grenade, but was treated and released, he said. A soldier was reported wounded but was in good condition, Cheng said. So far this month, 15 U.S. soldiers have died in Iraq, compared to nine in March -- most of those in non-combat-related incidents. March's death toll was the lowest monthly toll for the U.S. military since the war began 2003. The Riyadh incident comes at a time of heightened tension between the U.S. military and the Iraqi government, after two Iraqis were killed during a military raid south of Baghdad on Sunday. Iraqi state TV reported that Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki accused U.S. troops of violating the security agreement between the two countries with the raid in Wasit province. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","Six car bombs explode in Baghdad, Iraq's Interior Ministry says .

"(CNN) -- iPhone 5 owners can now get broken display screens replaced while they wait at Apple retail stores, in what could be the first step in a move to make repairs quicker and cheaper. An Apple Store employee confirmed by phone Tuesday that cracked iPhone 5 screens can now be replaced on site for $149. An Apple spokesperson later confirmed as much. Previously, the repair would have required mailing in the phone and would have cost $229 for customers who hadn't purchased the company's AppleCare insurance. The move comes less than a month after, according to reports, Apple employees were informed of a new policy under which the company plans to begin repairing mobile devices instead of routinely replacing them. The blog AppleInsider quoted an unnamed Apple tech-staff member saying the shift would save the company $1 billion. As of now, older iPhones, along with iPads and iPods, can't get the on-site screen fix. But more options may be on their way. The AppleInsider post, which accurately reported that display replacements would be rolled out in June, said that by July, cameras, sleep/wake buttons and logic boards also will be replaced in stores. The Apple spokesperson would not comment on plans. Apple Store employees already had been able to repair or replace parts like speakers, receivers and batteries. While trimming its own costs, Apple also could be cutting into a cottage industry that's sprung up around its market-leading smartphones and tablets -- third-party repairs. On the iPhone repair site Quick iFix, the price to fix the display on an iPhone 5 had dropped to $139 on Tuesday, down from $174 last month.","Apple retail stores now repair iPhone 5 displays while you wait .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- U.S. military personnel were involved in repelling a suicide bombing attack Sunday on an Iraqi military base in Baghdad, four days after the United States officially ended its combat operations in Iraq. U.S. forces ""provided suppressive fire"" and helicopter support during the attack, said Lt. Col. Eric Bloom, a spokesman for the U.S. military in Baghdad. No U.S. soldiers were injured, Bloom said. At least 12 people were killed and 36 others were injured in Sunday's attack, the Iraqi military command said. The interior ministry reported eight dead and 21 wounded.There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but a senior U.S. military official said American authorities believe al Qaeda in Iraq is responsible. The U.S. official said there were five attackers: the vehicle bomber, who detonated his explosive device; two vest bombers who were killed by the Iraqi army as they tried to get through the checkpoint but did not detonate; and two attackers, who got into a building next to the checkpoint inside the compound and detonated themselves before the Iraqi army could get to them. An Iraqi interior ministry official and the Baghdad Operations Command -- the Iraqi military command in the capital -- also said the attack was carried out by five suicide bombers. A CNN videographer was not allowed to videotape or get past the security perimeter at the scene, but reported that more than a dozen bodies were carried out more than four hours after the attack. The military base is the headquarters of the Rusafa Operations Command -- the Iraqi military command for the eastern part of Baghdad. Sunday's target was the same military base used as an Iraqi army recruitment center and attacked by a suicide bomber August 17. That bombing killed at least 48 people, most of whom were prospective recruits among hundreds lining up outside the center. The Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group for al Qaeda in Iraq, and other Sunni extremist groups claimed responsibility for that bombing. The group previously claimed responsibility for a similar attack in the heart of the capital on June 14 involving up to seven suicide bombers who struck the central bank. While U.S. and Iraqi government officials have voiced confidence in the ability of Iraqi security forces, recent attacks have raised concerns among the population about the fragile security situation. On August 28, the Iraqi government announced there were plots by al Qaeda and other groups to carry out attacks across the country and called on security forces and citizens to be on high alert. The recent violence comes amid a political crisis that has gripped the country for months. After inconclusive national elections almost six months ago, politicians are still wrangling to try to form a government. In a separate attack Sunday, at least five people were wounded in a roadside bombing in eastern Baghdad, the interior ministry said.","Sunday's attack comes days after the United States ended combat operations in Iraq .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The militant jihadist group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria killed dozens of Syrian troops and workers during an attack on a gas field in central Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, killed 270 Syrians, including national guard members, security guards and employees, after storming and seizing the al Shaer gas field in Homs province on Thursday, the group said. The death toll could climb. Another 90 security guards and employees are missing, the anti-goverment activist group added. Word of the slaughter in Homs came after ISIS violence against Christians and other minority groups in Iraq in recent weeks. The Islamist militants, now occupying large regions of Iraq and Syria, have issued an ultimatum to the remaining Iraqi Christians in the city of Mosul: accept Islam, pay extra taxes to Islamic Sharia courts, or face ""death by the sword."" The letters from ISIS were distributed in recent days to the dwindling number of Christian leaders in Iraq's second largest city. The message added that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has agreed to allow them (Christians who do not agree to convert or pay extra taxes) to leave the northern Iraqi city by noon Saturday (5 a.m. ET). After that, the message said, ""the only option is the sword."" But the international organization Human Rights Watch says the extremist group is already ""killing, kidnapping and threatening religious and ethnic minorities"" in Mosul and other Iraqi cities and towns. ""Being a Turkman, a Shabak, a Yazidi or a Christian in ISIS territory can cost you your livelihood, your liberty, or even your life,"" Human Rights Watch Middle East Director Sarah Leah Whitson said in a press release issued on Saturday from Duhok in Iraqi Kurdistan. Human Rights Watch has documented violence against these ethnic and religious minorities, reporting that tens of thousands of families have already fled their communities near Mosul in fear for their lives. Village residents have described horrific attacks by ISIS fighters, who ""seize local men and pillage homes and places of worships,"" Human Rights Watch said. The militants have summarily executed villagers and Iraqi soldiers alike, slaughtering a group of soldiers in Tikrit last month. Human Rights Watch also said ISIS extremists reportedly killed 40 Shia Turkmen, including children, in four communities in Kirkuk last month. Militant ISIS jihadists, a Sunni-dominated al Qaeda splinter group, have overrun large parts of Iraq and neighboring war torn Syria over the past months in a violent Islamist insurgency. The militants want to establish an Islamic state, or so-called caliphate, across Sunni areas of both countries. ISIS already controls hundreds of square miles where state authority has evaporated. It has ignored international borders, establishing a deadly presence from Syria's Mediterranean coast all the way south to Baghdad, making its goal of a caliphate state seemingly within reach. The magnitude of the crisis is clear from the sharp rise in the death toll over the past two months. At least 2,400 Iraqis died in violence in June, according to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq. Of those, the United Nations said more than 1,500 were civilians, including 270 civilian police officers, and almost 900 were members of Iraqi security forces.","ISIS reportedly kills national guard members, security guards and gas field employees .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama used the annual White House Iftar dinner Monday evening to briefly discuss the crises unfolding in the Mideast. ""Even as we celebrate all that we have in common, we know that in too many corners of the world, we see violence and terror, and those who would destroy rather than build,"" he said. The White House Iftar dinner was started by former President Bill Clinton. President George W. Bush continued the tradition after the 9-11 terror attacks. President Obama has also continued to host them. The dinner is meant to honor Muslims who are celebrating the end of a day of fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. On the growing conflict between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza, the President staunchly defended Israel's right to defend its borders. ""No country can accept rockets fired indiscriminately at citizens,"" Obama said. ""And so we've been very clear that Israel has the right to defend itself against what I consider to be inexcusable attacks from Hamas."" He added, though, that ""the death and injury of Palestinians is a tragedy, which is why we've emphasized the need to protect civilians."" The President also said, ""The pictures we are seeing in Gaza and Israel are heart wrenching."" He pushed for both sides to come back to the negotiating table and described a new plan offered by Egypt as ""promising,"" saying he hopes it ""will restore the calm that we've been seeking."" He said Americans ""care deeply about what is happening there, and I know there are strong views as well as differences about how we should move forward. ""Our goal has been and continues to be peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians."" Obama also restated his administration's policy on Syria, telling those gathered that, ""the Assad regime continues its brutality against the Syrian people and so we continue to help Syrians stand up to [President Bashar al-]Assad and deal with the humanitarian crisis and push back against extremists."" On Iraq, Obama said, ""We continue to call for a new government that can unite Iraqis and show all communities in Iraq that they can advance their aspirations through the political process."" Earlier, several dozen protesters gathered outside the White House to call on Arab leaders to boycott the dinner, saying the administration was unfairly taking Israel's side in the Gaza conflict.","The annual Iftar dinner honors Muslims during the holy month of Ramadan .

"(CNN) -- Each day, they live in fear. Sometimes it's the fear of rockets dropping from the sky. Sometimes it's violent fundamentalists taking over their cities. Sometimes it's the barrel bombs stuffed with TNT and nails. Exactly what horror they face depends on which border they live within. Syria, Iraq, Gaza, Israel and Libya. Each with its unique crisis, but all now unified in a heightened sense of anxiety as years of conflict come to a head. ""I would argue,"" U.S. Sen. John McCain said this week, ""that given conditions in the Middle East, this might be more dangerous than any time in the past."" Here's where the crises stand: . SYRIA . Al-Assad wins ... again . With carnage mounting every day across the country, it's hard to find reason to celebrate in Syria. And yet President Bashar al-Assad and his supporters find a way. On Wednesday, al-Assad was sworn in for his third term. It's an outcome pretty much everyone expected -- not because he is popularly adored, but because his family has ruled Syria since 1971. And no real contender ran against him. Three years of civil war have left much of the country in shambles. While regime helicopters drop barrel bombs on opposition neighborhoods, dissidents say, the government maintains its stance that it's only fighting terrorists. As if the civil war wasn't enough, the radical Sunni group Islamic State in Iraq in Syria is using this opportunity to carve its own swath of territory from the Iraq border to deep inside Syria. The United Nations says more than 150,000 people have been killed in the past three years. But at this point, many have stopped counting. ""No one is winning; no one can win,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. ""Even if one side were to prevail in the short term, the devastating toll will have sown the seeds of future conflict."" Why we should care: . For Americans thinking the Syrian crisis doesn't hit home, think again. U.S. intelligence and law enforcement have dozens of investigations under way, tracking Americans who traveled to Syria to join the fight. ""The FBI and other members of the intelligence community have made this a top priority and are taking whatever steps they can under the law to monitor and prevent those coming back from doing us harm,"" Assistant Attorney General John Carlin said. IRAQ . Threat of fundamentalism looms . This month was supposed mark Iraq's first steps toward a new government. But it's hard to tout political gains when ISIS militants keep barreling across the country, snatching entire cities and threatening to take over Baghdad. ISIS now controls land on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border -- opening the floodgates for weapons and fighters between the two countries. On Wednesday, Iraqi security forces had to withdraw from central Tikrit after fierce fighting with militants believed to be ISIS members. At least 52 Iraqi security forces were killed. Now, an unlikely pair of countries are coming to assist the embattled government -- the United States and Iran. While U.S. advisers are on the ground assisting security forces, Iraq is increasingly relying on Iranian-backed Shiite militias to stave off radical Sunni ISIS militants -- especially around the capital. Why we should care: . Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney said the crisis in Iraq now involves throngs of foreigners -- possibly including Americans. ""One of the problems you've got now is a caliphate that includes part of Syria, part of Iraq, and you've got literally thousands of jihadist wannabes flooding into that part of the world from Europe -- some of them probably from the United States -- who want to participate in that conflict,"" Cheney told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""It's a threat to us, to the United States, not just to that part of the world."" LIBYA . A free-for-all . Nearly three years after Libyan rebels overthrew a longtime dictator, the country is no closer to lasting stability. The civil war that culminated in Moammar Gadhafi's 2011 death has given way to warring militias fighting over Tripoli's international airport. At least 90% of the planes there have been damaged, and it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to repair them, the government said. Maintenance buildings are destroyed. So are fuel tanks and trucks. Even the control tower has been hit. The chaos in the capital is so dire now that officials are considering asking for international troops -- even though the government is virtually powerless and has very little influence on what's happening on the ground. Not only is government is weak, but militias actually outnumber and outgun its security forces. Why we should care: . The U.S. State Department said the fighting could lead to widespread conflict. ""We affirm our support for Libya's democratic transition and urge the seating of the new Council of Representatives as soon as possible,"" the State Department said. ""We stress the vital role Libya's Constitution Drafting Assembly plays in building the new country for which Libyans sacrificed so much during the revolution."" And of course the U.S. is still trying to figure out more details on the 2012 attack that killed four Americans at a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. GAZA AND ISRAEL . Retaliation and recrimination . What was supposed to be a cease-fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militant group Hamas this week now seems like a joke. Rockets fired by Hamas on Tuesday were quickly matched by airstrikes from Israel. And so the exchanges continue. Now, a leading member of Hamas says he's not opposed to peace -- but says there needs to be more compromise. ""We hope we can achieve a cease-fire -- but a cease-fire which can protect the Palestinians and guarantee that there will be no violations,"" Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said. Israel, which accepted a cease-fire proposal by Egypt, defended its decision to strike back against Hamas. ""Instead of having this door open to a diplomatic solution, they closed the door,"" said Mark Regev, spokesman for the Israeli prime minister. ""We now have to, unfortunately, protect our people through military means."" While both rockets and rhetoric fly, Human Rights Watch said Israeli air attacks have been ""killing civilians in violation of the laws of war."" An Israeli military spokesman said civilian casualties in Gaza are ""a human tragedy"" -- but that it's Hamas' fault. The military accuses Hamas of taking civilians hostage by using places like houses, hospitals and schools to hide weapons. More than 200 people have been killed in Gaza since the offensive started a week ago, Palestinian officials said. One Israeli has also died. Why we should care: . Many credit Israel's Iron Dome for saving untold lives on the Israeli side. In 2014, the United States provided $235 million for Iron Dome research, development and production, according to the Congressional Research Service. Israel is also the biggest recipient of U.S. foreign aid, much of which has gone toward Israel's military spending. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry say's he'll return to the region if a cease-fire doesn't materialize. ""I am prepared to fly back to the region tomorrow, if I have to, or the next day, or the next, in order to pursue the prospects if this doesn't work,"" Kerry said. ""But they deserve, the Egyptians deserve the time and the space to be able to try to make this initiative work."" Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat put it bluntly: ""We need the United States."" ""Now the region is really boiling,"" he said. ""Failure is not an option here."" CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Jim Sciutto, Arwa Damon, Hamdi Alkhshali, Barbara Starr and Polo Sandoval contributed to this report.","A series of unrelated crises are blending into a regional nightmare .

As they enter the cenotaph, they pass over etched stone that reads, ""September 11, 2001 -- 9:37 a.m.,"" the exact moment of the attack on the Pentagon. The stone in which that infamous date is carved was recovered from the smoldering ruins of the Pentagon, still stained with the burn marks from the explosion and fire from Flight 77 slamming into the building. Across the memorial grounds, 184 bench-like structures, each one dedicated to a victim, are clustered in what seems like an uneven and unsettling array throughout the main grounds of the memorial.  See the symbolism driving the memorial's design » . ""We've tried to keep everything subtle to the extent that people can discover,"" said Keith Kaseman, the memorial co-designer. Thomas Heidenberger stopped recently with his son, Tom, to pay tribute to his wife, Michelle, a senior flight attendant on Flight 77. They wept as they sat on the bench honoring her. iReport: How are you observing 9/11? ""These were the first to die in this so-called war on terror,"" Heidenberger said. ""Why shouldn't we not just remember the day, but remember their sacrifice, remember their lives?"" His son said the memorial was touching because it started with an artist's rendition, but now is a reality and a fitting tribute to those who died. ""It looks great,"" he said. ""I'm very impressed."" The benches are laid out in a pattern according to the year each victim was born, from 1998 to 1930. Some rows, called birth-year aisles, have just one seat, and some have three or more. All of the granite-covered benches, called memorial units, are oriented in the direction the plane hit the building, pointing east. Each unit rises smoothly from the ground in a gentle slope to form the bench. A small pool of water beneath each one gently gurgles, adding to the relaxing nature the designers intended. On the end of each unit, the name of the victim is inscribed in stainless steel. Family members who lost loved ones have already begun leaving flowers and notes at the benches. The names on the benches face east or west, depending on where the victims were when they died. If the victim was on the plane, visitors read the name as they look toward the western sky. If the person was inside the Pentagon, you read the name looking at the building, facing east. ""The idea that this place is just an invitation for your thoughts and your interpretations is what we see as persisting through time, and I think that's what sets it apart to some extent,"" Kaseman said. Just steps from the Pentagon complex, it is like many of the Washington memorials in that access is freely available 24 hours a day. But it stands in a different place from the more well-known monuments. Tucked away on a small patch of super-secure land between a busy highway and the nation's military headquarters, the symbolism of a post-9/11 security environment is present. An iron fence surrounds the memorial, providing visitors with unintended symbolism. Just outside the fence, a Pentagon police guard shack is on one side, and a giant earthen berm -- designed to deflect bomb blasts from the Pentagon -- is on another. On a third side is a checkpoint with explosives-sniffing dogs and a secure road that leads to a Pentagon delivery facility away from the building. It is hard to imagine that a few years ago, this land was once just flat grass and the original location of the building's helicopter port before the attack. It has taken seven years to build the memorial. But the time has not lessened the memories or the solemn nature of the location, feet from the impact site. A kind of peace is still present between the whirring traffic and the occasional low-flying military helicopter preparing to land at a helipad. Plantings and trees will eventually fill it in the young memorial, creating a more private and intimate setting; and for those who lost family, friends and colleagues, the symbolism outside the memorial will be drowned out by the intimate symbolism inside. Thomas Heidenberger said those who lost loved ones in the New York attack still don't have a memorial -- ""no place to go, have no closure."" He stressed the importance of such sites to families left behind. ""We have a place to go other than a burial plot or a vacant stone in a cemetery,"" he said. ""The children who were born to 9/11 moms who don't have a dad, they have a place to go. And the elderly now have a place to go visit their children, their loved ones.""","Pentagon unveils 9/11 memorial to honor the 184 victims killed there .

"(CNN) -- Filled with regret, Kelley Fielder wishes she would have tried to stop them. She was Amanda Miller's best friend. Amanda and her husband, Jerad Miller, had moved from Indiana to Las Vegas and for two weeks had been living with Fielder. Jerad was always going off, she recalled, spewing anti-government rants. He filled his Facebook page with political cartoons that mocked police and other authorities. A recent post read: 'We must ... prepare for war."" Then something really disturbing. Around 5:45 Sunday morning, Fielder told CNN, the couple were awake. They had a cart full of ammunition. What were they doing? she asked. They told her they were ""going underground,"" Fielder said. ""The revolution has begun,"" Jerad Miller told Fielder. ""I should have called the cops,"" she said Monday. ""I'm so, so, so sorry -- to everybody. I'm sorry."" On Tuesday, Carie Stichter, Jerad Miller's mother, released a statement. ""We wish to express our greatest sympathies, thoughts and prayers to the families who have lost their loved ones in this horrible act of violence. We are profoundly saddened, confused and in shock over the senseless actions of our son and his wife. We ask that the media respect our family's privacy during this ... difficult time."" Bystander went after Jerad Miller . Within hours of Fielder's exchange with Amanda, 22, and Jerad, 31, the couple had shot to death two police officers and a bystander who apparently tried stop their rampage. That man, Joseph Wilcox, was with Jeremy Tanner, a longtime friend at a Las Vegas Walmart when the Millers walked through the door. Tanner recalled seeing Jerad Miller come into the store, seeing Miller dressed in some kind of fatigues and wearing gear. Tanner had to very quickly process what was happening. He heard Miller shout, ""This is the beginning of the revolution! Everybody get out! You will be shot!"" Tanner looked at his friend Wilcox. He knew Wilcox had a concealed carry permit and sometimes had a gun on him. Customers and staff were fleeing the store. Wilcox ""had the option to go left to exit the store to safety,"" Tanner told CNN. But he chose not to leave. Wilcox instead stayed inside and confronted Jerad Miller, Tanner said. Tanner told CNN his friend was unaware that Jerad Miller was with Amanda Miller. Wilcox was shot, authorities said. The couple retreated toward the back of the store, where police closed in. Amanda Miller shot her husband and then herself, police said. They both died. It was hours before Tanner was told that his friend was killed. He is devastated, he told CNN. Sunday's violence made him ""ashamed for the human race ... that people just have total disrespect for themselves and other people."" He can't stop thinking about it. What if he'd changed his schedule a little bit that day? What if he and his friend had not been in that Walmart at that time? ""You never expect it,"" he said. ""It's something you see on TV, in the movies. ... "" Wilcox's 18-year-old sister, C.J. Foster, told CNN that she felt her brother was brave for attempting to interfere. ""I'm very proud of him,"" she told CNN. ""I would have never done it. I would have never. I would have froze in place probably and the fact that he just rushed in after and tried to save those people, it was heroic."" Who were the victims? Two officers slain . Wilcox was the Millers' third victim. Their rampage began when they walked into a CiCi's Pizza place around 11:30 a.m. in a non-glitzy part of the city where two police officers were having lunch. The couple shot Igor Soldo, 31, in the back of the head, and Alyn Beck, 41, took a bullet to the neck, authorities said. On Tuesday, Beck friend Tracy Smith remembered the officer in an opinion piece for CNN.com. Officer Beck was kind and funny, intelligent, a tireless worker and a devoted husband and father of three. He loved his dog, Marty, she wrote. Soldo was married and had a baby. The Millers placed a ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag and a Nazi swastika on one officer's body, authorities told reporters Tuesday. On the other officer's body, authorities said, a note was pinned. It read something to the effect of, ""This is the beginning of the revolution,"" Second Assistant Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters. ""We don't necessarily believe that they are white supremacists or associated with the Nazi movement. We believe that they equate government and law enforcement ... with Nazis,"" McMahill said. ""In other words, they believe that law enforcement is the oppressor."" ""I just sat down to have lunch. The officers were sitting in front of me, at the table right next to me, and this man came in out of nowhere,"" witness Sheree Burns told CNN affiliate KTNV. ""I thought he was going to get a drink, the way he walked up and walked past them,"" she said. ""And then he turned around, pulled a gun on his right and shot the bald officer in front of me."" The pair took the officers' guns and ammunition, McMahill told reporters. As the Millers walked out of the CiCi's, they passed Alvaro Lopez. ""They had a backpack, and I saw a gun in their hand,"" Lopez told CNN affiliate KLAS. ""He just told me to tell the cops that it was a revolution and that he'd just killed two cops inside CiCi's."" McMahill confirmed that the Millers said something about a revolution while leaving the pizzeria. Opinion: Right-wing extremists strike again . A search for why . Police are still in the early stages of their investigation. They say they think that the couple acted alone and that the officers shot were targeted at random, authorities said Monday. ""What precipitated this event, we do not know,"" Sheriff Doug Gillespie said. ""My officers were simply having lunch."" Investigators searched an apartment late Sunday night that was thought to be where the couple lived. They were going through the couple's social media postings, McMahill said Monday. Police also recovered hundreds of rounds of ammunition from the couple's backpacks at Walmart, suggesting they were prepared for a lengthy gunbattle, he added. ""There is no doubt that the suspects have some apparent ideology that's along the lines of militia and white supremacists,"" McMahill said. Who were the Millers? A woman who says she lived near the couple told KTNV that the married couple liked to dress up as the villainous ""Batman"" characters Joker and Harley Quinn. The neighbor, Krista Koch, told the station the man also sometimes dressed as Slenderman, a fictional horror character that recently surfaced in the stabbing of a 12-year-old girl in Wisconsin. Ghoulish stabbing raises question: Who is Slenderman? Koch also told the station the couple had told her they were going to carry out an attack, but she thought they were ""crazy,"" so she dismissed what they said. McMahill told reporters he'd heard unconfirmed reports the pair spoke to a neighbor about the attack before it happened. ""You know we have the 'see something, say something' campaign,"" he said, urging people to call police when something doesn't feel right. ""We need to hear about those times when individuals or groups of individuals are talking about going out and committing acts of violence -- whether it's against the police or anybody else in our community,"" McMahill said. ""We need to hear from our citizens. They're the best eyes and ears that we have out there."" Canada shooting: Suspect yelled 'I'm done' at time of arrest .

"(CNN) -- It sounds more like schoolyard taunting than a debate involving presidential power, negotiating with terrorists and bringing home a captured American soldier. Political leaders escalated their rhetoric and raised new arguments on Tuesday about the secret deal that obtained the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl on May 31 in exchange for five Taliban figures detained at Guantanamo Bay. The controversy touches on a range of volatile issues -- ending the Afghanistan war, releasing Guantanamo detainees, accusations by members of Bergdahl's unit that he deserted -- and it comes in an election year that has further widened the seemingly maximized partisan divide in Washington. Costs from swap will include ""lost lives"" House Speaker John Boehner, a leading Republican voice, told reporters he had no doubt ""that there are going to be costs, lost lives associated with what came out of this,"" calling the swap a de facto deal with Taliban terrorists. On the Democratic side, Senate allies of President Barack Obama said the deal mediated by the government of Qatar came together too quickly to consult with Congress over an exchange that critics from both parties have labeled too costly. ""All I can tell you is this: (the government) knew a day ahead of time that the transfer was going to take place. They knew an hour ahead of time where it was going to take place,"" said Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, while his Democratic colleague from Michigan, Carl Levin, noted the military's top leadership fully backed the exchange. ""Whether you agree with them or not, its critically important that the American people know that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the vice chair of the Joint Chiefs strongly recommended this agreement knowing full well Bergdahl, one, had left his unit and knowing full well how bad these Taliban people were,"" Levin said. The dispute involves both the dynamics of the exchange and the endless argument between the executive and legislative branches over presidential powers. Legal requirement or courtesy? Members of both parties complain the Obama administration should have let Congress know ahead of time that the exchange was taking place. Some cite the 30 days' notice called for by the National Defense Authorization Act, while others say a simple heads-up would have sufficed. ""It's just a matter of courtesy, whether it was in law or not,"" said conservative Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a regular critic of the President. ""A matter of this importance should have been discussed with at least key leaders in the Congress."" Administration officials say the deal came together quickly, and the risks to Bergdahl and the military commandos involved in collecting him near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border required keeping the exchange top-secret. ""This was a secret military mission in which disclosure of the mission could put into jeopardy not just the life of Sergeant Bergdahl but also the lives of the American servicemen who were involved in the mission,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday. ""So discretion on this matter was important."" However, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon of California called such reasoning for not notifying Congress ""absurd."" ""Nothing in the law requires the Secretary of Defense to disclose the physical details of the transfer,"" said McKeon, a Republican. ""They are merely required to notify us in a classified manner that a transfer will take place, and of the conditions set to prevent a terrorist from re-entering the fight."" Boehner noted that he was briefed as early as six months before another significant and secret military mission -- the 2011 raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. ""I was given a heads-up several days before"" the bin Laden mission, Boehner said. ""So this idea that they couldn't trust us to not leak things is just not true."" Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate from West Virginia known for criticizing the administration at times, said his main concern was the release of five Taliban figures who could return to the battlefield against U.S forces and interests. Who was swapped for Bergdahl? Congressman: Deal gives 'no guarantee' Taliban figures will be tracked . Under the exchange, the released Taliban detainees were taken to Qatar, where the government says it will keep them under watch for at least a year. But some lawmakers fear there's no guarantee. ""How we are sure that the Qataris are going to do what they are supposed to do and we are able to keep (the released Taliban figures) from engaging again,"" Manchin told reporters. A memorandum of understanding between the United States and Qatar on the deal that freed Bergdahl offered ""no guarantee"" that the five Taliban commanders exchanged for the captured Army sergeant would be tracked, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee told CNN. Rep. Adam Schiff reviewed the agreement and said, based on his reading, that it is possible the former U.S. detainees ""might disappear even during the first year in Qatar."" Schiff told CNN's Jim Sciutto that the United States has ""some capability to track them while in Qatar,"" but after the first year, he said, all bets are off. ""We have to expect them to return to the fight,"" Schiff said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry defended the swap in an interview with CNN over the weekend, saying the former detainees would be monitored closely, and not just by officials in Qatar. He wouldn't say who else will be watching, but he said the United States is confident the conditions of their release will be honored. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Tuesday that the Obama administration had received ""assurances from Qatar"" during the deal. ""We have acknowledged that some of these individuals could attempt to return to activities that are of concern. The President said so explicitly on his trip last week,"" she said. ""But we have confidence that we will be in a position to go after them if, in fact, they are engaging in activities that threaten our defenses."" Democrats complain about lack of notice . Administration officials gave a classified briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday after a similar session on Monday with House members. On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel will appear before McKeon's armed services committee to discuss the exchange, which he signed off on as the Pentagon chief. ""He looks forward to explaining why the President's decision to secure the release of Sergeant Bergdahl was the right one, and why the process we undertook in doing so was in keeping with our national interests,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday. After the briefing to House members, some said they were told as many as 80 to 90 administration officials knew of the pending exchange ahead of time, while Congress did not. Earnest told reporters the figure of 80 to 90 officials discussed in the classified briefing referred to the number with knowledge of intelligence involving Taliban activities in Qatar. The number of administration officials who knew ahead of time of the Bergdahl swap was smaller, Earnest said, but he refused to provide a specific figure. Schiff told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that White House officials should have told congressional leaders, even if the law gave them wiggle room. ""I think the President had the constitutional authority ... to make this decision without consulting with Congress,"" Schiff said. ""But I think it would have been wiser, far wiser, for the administration to have notified, certainly the leadership of Congress in the interest of having good relations."" Polls show divide, with more disapproving . More Americans disapprove than approve of Bergdahl's release in exchange for five Taliban detainees, according to two new national polls. The surveys also indicate a wide partisan divide, with most Republicans opposing the deal while most Democrats approve of it. Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official told CNN. The prisoner exchange has become a political football, with Republicans who once called for the administration to work for Bergdahl's return now saying the cost was too high. Was Rand Paul's red meat joke a bit too raw? Slow recovery . Bergdahl is ""continuing to improve every day"" as he recovers at a military hospital in Germany, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said Monday, but he hasn't spoken with his family yet. The ""decision to speak with the family is a decision the returnee has to make when he or she is emotionally in the right place to make the phone call,"" Warren said. When he is ready, Bergdahl will be flown to the San Antonio Military Medical Center in Texas, where he may be able to reunite with his parents. As Bergdahl recovers, details are slowly emerging about the conditions he endured during five years of captivity. Citing an American official, The New York Times reported Sunday that Bergdahl told medical staff that the box he was kept in for weeks at a time was pitch black and like a shark cage. CNN reported Friday that Bergdahl has said he was kept in a small box after trying to escape, according to a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of not being identified. The official also told CNN that Bergdahl suffers from psychological trauma caused by physical abuse. Obama: 'I make absolutely no apologies' for Bergdahl swap . Opinion: Why we leave no man behind .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least nine city and provincial officials were among dozens killed when armed militants took over a government building in Iraq and held hostages this week, Interior Ministry officials told CNN Wednesday. At least two journalists, including CNN contributor Sabah al-Bazi, were among the dead when armed men assaulted and seized the building in Tikrit in northern Iraq on Tuesday. At least 56 people died and 98 others were wounded in the attack, which ended after Iraqi forces launched a raid to take back the building and free the hostages. The United States condemned the ""senseless and brutal attack"" in a statement on Wednesday. The embassy in Baghdad called it ""an attack on the very foundations of democracy that Iraqis have strived so valiantly to build."" The armed militants, clad in police uniforms, clashed with the Iraqi police, and a suicide car bombing also was reported in the fighting in Tikrit, the capital of Salaheddin Province. Three provincial council members were among the dead, as were six city council members from the nearby town of Shirqat, officials said. Overall violence in Iraq has dropped drastically over the past three years, and the insurgency there has received devastating blows. However, Tuesday's assault shows that Iraq remains an unstable country and insurgents are still able to carry out deadly attacks. ""This coordinated attack in Tikrit bears the hallmark of al Qaeda in Iraq, and the attackers were planning to take all members of Salaheddin Provincial Council as hostages,"" a senior official with Tikrit police told CNN on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to media. Al-Bazi was a freelancer who worked with Reuters, CNN and Al-Arabiya, according to his cousin Mahmoud Salih, also a freelance journalist. Salih -- who said al-Bazi died in the car bombing -- told CNN his cousin contacted him 30 minutes before he died, asking him whether he wanted to film ammunition seized by security forces. A number of gunmen inside the building were wearing explosive vests, and at least two of the attackers detonated their vests as Iraqi security forces approached, Tikrit police said. Dozens of employees were held hostage inside the building, which houses the provincial council and other government offices. Local TV in Tikrit showed video of smoke rising from the building, surrounded by Iraqi security forces, and aired the sounds of heavy gunfire. The tactics were similar to an attack on a church in Baghdad in October, when gunmen took dozens of hostages, detonated suicide belts, and killed and wounded scores of people. Authorities in Salaheddin announced a three-day mourning period for the victims of Tuesday's attack. A U.S. military spokeswoman said American troops ""assisted Iraqi security forces with securing the site of the attack and were providing aerial observation and surveillance in support of Iraqi forces on the ground."" The United States is set to withdraw all of its troops from Iraq at the end of the year in a bilateral agreement with the Iraqi government. However, it is too soon to predict whether the United States and Iraq will negotiate an agreement to keep some U.S. soldiers there after year's end.","NEW: The U.S. Embassy condemns the attack as ""senseless and brutal""

"(CNN) -- One of the heaviest babies ever born in Germany was born last week at the University Hospital Leipzig. The baby girl, Jasleen, weighed a whopping 13.47 pounds and measured nearly 23 inches long. She was born vaginally, not via a C-section, according to a hospital statement. ""We anticipated that the child would be big,"" said Holger Stepan, chief of obstetrics. ""We prepared in advance by assembling a special team (of doctors and midwives) to be ready for any possible complications."" He said he'd never before helped in the birth of such a heavy baby. The girl's mother suffered from gestational diabetes, which, when untreated or uncontrolled, can cause babies to be born larger than normal. Her condition was not discovered until the mother checked herself into the hospital while in labor. She had not previously been a patient there. The hospital said both mother and child are well. According to the website for Guinness World Records, the heaviest baby -- weighing in at more than 23 pounds -- was born in Seville, Ohio, on January 19, 1879. He died 11 hours later.

"(CNN) -- It started with older youths boarding an Australian school bus, terrifying the elementary-school-aged Jewish children aboard with slurs from ""Heil Hitler"" to ""kill the Jews,"" and it ended 40 minutes later when the older youths fled before police arrived, according to accounts from some of the young students on the bus. ""When they saw us all in tears, they were laughing,"" 12-year-old student Noa Stanton told CNN affiliate 7 News in Australia, referring to the older youths who stayed on the bus as it traveled in the suburbs of Sydney. The youths fled following the Wednesday incident, Sydney police said, but five suspects were arrested Thursday and authorities were waiting on a sixth to turn himself in. No charges were immediately filed and the youths -- described by police as intoxicated -- were released to their parents. The two dozen children, aged 5 to 12, were heading home from three Jewish schools when the older boys made their way onto the bus and began spouting threats of violence and anti-Semitic slurs, police and the Jewish students said. Noa Stanton said the boys told her and her frightened classmates they had been ""popping drugs in the city"" -- even offering the children drugs, she said. Noa's 8-year-old sister, Anais, told 7 News she also witnessed the boys holding bottles of alcohol. Several children on the bus called their parents on cell phones. Isabel Stanton said when she answered a call from one of her daughters, ""I couldn't understand a word she was saying. She was hysterical and crying on the phone."" Another mother, Jacqui Blackburn, told 7 News she received a similarly chilling call from her three daughters on the bus. Her terrified girls told her drunk men had boarded the bus and were yelling, ""Heil Hitler"" and ""kill the Jews,"" and threatening to cut the throats of those on board. The students from Mt. Sinai College, Emmanuel School and Moriah College said they endured verbal abuse from Maroubra to Bondi Junction, east of Sydney, where the teens eventually fled before police, called by parents, arrived. It was unclear Thursday whether the driver of the school bus made any effort to alert authorities or took any other action during the incident. Waverly Police Department Superintendent Jason Box confirmed to CNN affiliate Sky News that ""six juvenile males boarded the bus ... and made offensive and threatening comments towards approximately 25 schoolchildren."" The youths apparently used student bus passes to get on board and some of them were wearing school uniforms, Box said. According to Sky News, the teens are believed to be between the ages of 15 and 17. Box called the incident opportunistic, ""isolated and random."" The president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, Vic Alhadeff, called the incident ""sickening."" ""Any racist incident is unacceptable in our society. It is particularly sickening when those being targeted are young children,"" Alhadeff told 7 News. New South Wales Communities Minister Victor Dominello said Jewish leaders and local government officials were considering increasing security on school buses.

"Washington (CNN) -- Being president pays; $400,000 a year, in fact. That salary has increased over time. President Harry Truman left office in 1949 making $100,000. When Richard Nixon entered the White House in 1969 the salary went up to $200,000. It remained there for 30 years, until Congress doubled the presidential salary effective in 2001, when President George W. Bush took office. Aside from the pay, there's the free transportation in the presidential limousine, Marine One and Air Force One. And don't forget the free housing in Washington's most famous mansion, complete with a killer view of the Washington Monument, along with other perks (a personal chef, for one). When a president leaves the White House he's still on the government payroll, receiving an annual pension of about $200,000, health care, paid official travel and an office. Rent for President Jimmy Carter's Atlanta office is $102,000 per year, according to 2010 figures compiled by the Congressional Research Service. President George H. W. Bush's Houston office costs $175,000 per year. President Bill Clinton's office in the pricey real estate market of New York City is $516,000. Not too bad, huh? But these taxpayer-funded benefits are nothing compared to the big bucks presidents rake in writing books. ""My Life"" netted Bill Clinton a $15 million advance. George W. Bush earned $7 million for the first 1.5 million copies of ""Decision Points."" Jimmy Carter has written 14 books. ""He was broke when he came out of the White House,"" presidential historian James Thurber said. ""If you can write or you can write with someone else, you can write a book and make a great deal of money. Jimmy Carter did that."" President Obama wrote ""Dreams From My Father"" in his 30s. Initially, it was only a modest success, selling better as his political star rose, flying off shelves when he ran for president. ""I have been blessed,"" he said on the campaign trail in 2008. ""Before this book started selling we were living in a condo and we had two cars, but one of them was beat up."" Book sales are still the Obamas' main source of income. For the biggest payoff without too much work, speeches are the way to go. And Bill Clinton is the reigning king of the podium. Right after Clinton left the White House in 2001, the Greater Washington Association of Executives paid him $125,000 for a speech, a very standard price for a former president. ""I've never had any money until I got out of the White House,"" Clinton told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in 2010. ""But I've done reasonably well since then."" That's quite the understatement. Since 2001, he's earned $75.6 million giving speeches to corporations and organizations around the world, according to the latest financial disclosure required of his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Center for Public Integrity estimates George W. Bush has made $15 million from speeches since leaving office. All of that money raises questions. ""I think the American people think American politics is all about money,"" Thurber said. ""And this certainly doesn't change their view."" In 1989, right after President Ronald Reagan left the White House, he was lambasted for accepting $2 million for two speeches in Japan, then an economic foe of the United States. Not all presidents have gotten rich after leaving office. Harry Truman couldn't afford to answer the copious mail he received or respond to requests for appearances. This prompted Congress to adopt pensions and benefits for former presidents in the 1950s so they weren't forced into activities deemed unsuitable for a former head of state. Some presidents come into office already very rich. If elected, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney would fall into that category. With a net worth of about $200 million, he would be the third-richest president in history. Adjusting for inflation, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington were the richest people to become president. (Incidentally, the pay they made in office was, for that time, nothing to sneeze at: $25,000).

"Gaza City, Gaza (CNN) -- Each one bears his own scar. This close-knit band of paramedics and ambulance drivers risk their lives saving others on the front lines of Gaza's wars. Paramedic Alaa Abu Sheir has a shrapnel wound to the arm. But that's not the one that cuts the deepest. When we find him, he's washing the blood off a stretcher in his ambulance. That's the blood of 24-year-old Mohamed Hamdan, who was reciting the Quran when a missile from an Israeli drone struck him Monday. Abu Sheir and his colleagues scraped together the unconscious and broken Hamdan. He tells CNN how he and his colleagues struggled to plug the holes in the man's body with gauze to stop him from bleeding to death -- all while the ambulance races toward Gaza's main hospital, Shifa. It's back at the ambulance depot that we catch up with Abu Sheir and more than a dozen of his colleagues. It's here where the tragic cycle begins again. It all starts with a phone call -- the emergency number in Gaza is one, zero, one. At the ambulance dispatch center located in Jerusalem Hospital in Gaza City, workers from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society monitor phones, maps and computers while they wait for the inevitable. A board illuminated with red numbers tallies 193 dead and 1,481 injured as of Tuesday afternoon. A job that requires a lot of risk . The head of emergency services in Gaza, Dr. Bashar Mourad, directs the nearest ambulance to the latest Israeli airstrike. The fight between the Israeli military and Gaza militants began over a week ago. It's not the first time. Mourad has a deep, personal understanding of the importance of a quick response. In the December 2008 to January 2009 war between Israel and Hamas, a war that was code-named ""Cast Lead,"" shrapnel injured Mourad's then 10-year-old son. ""Time is a matter of life or death,"" says the doctor. But he's also acutely aware that every dispatch puts his paramedics in harm's way. In Cast Lead, he says he had more than 30 paramedics killed and almost all of his ambulances destroyed. In 2012's conflict, he says, one paramedic was killed and 7 were injured. This time around, he says, he's been lucky: only 15 paramedics have been injured. Back at the ambulance depot, exhausted shift manager Ayman Shahwan takes incoming calls. Paramedics work 24-hours on, 24-hours off. It puts a strain on their nerves. ""Everything is bad in the war. We do not like war,"" says Shahwan. ""We want this war to stop."" The phone rings once again, when suddenly the building shutters and windows rattle. A large bomb just exploded nearby. On the lookout for a second explosion . A controlled panic grips the station as ambulance after ambulance races toward the rising plume of black smoke. They stop short of the crater. Experience has taught them that there could be a second bomb. Paramedics and firefighters wait in the periphery until they get the all clear. This time nobody was injured. They return to base, where Abu Sheir and other paramedics sit with a feast of rice, lamb, dates and juice. Night is just beginning to fall and the ambulance men are getting ready to break their fast. This is the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, during which the faithful abstain from eating or drinking between sunrise to sunset. They joke around about being tempted to break it too early; something frowned upon. The levity is needed to dispel the day's morbid encounters. War affects each man a different way. But they say it's the emotional scars that are the hardest to bear. ""The anger boils inside us as the pressure grows, knowing our actions are a matter of life or death."" says 39-year-old Yassin Mutier, the station chief of Tel El Hawa ambulance station. ""Unfortunately, we carry those emotions home and fight with our families."" 39-year-old Ra'aid Shaheen talks about how the 20 to 30 trips a day can be dangerous. He recalls once when he ""had finished dropping off a victim and was driving past a police station while on our way back to our station. Rockets started raining down on the police and the shock wave tossed our car like a toy."" Another call haunts him, too. ""We heard two kids selling ice cream were hit in Al Shajaya neighborhood,"" he says. ""The only thing we could do for them was to collect the pieces of their bodies."" False hope and a realization . Then there is 50-year-old Jihad Seleem. There's not much this paramedic of 17 years and father of two hasn't seen. But even this stoic man has trouble talking about his worst encounter. He arrived on scene of a smoldering car hit by a bomb. ""We saw kids meticulously collecting body parts and trying to aid the injured,"" says Seleem. ""They felt it was their duty to help."" But late Monday it seemed like their nightmare was about to be over. The room erupts into cheering and song as the radio announces that the Egyptian government has proposed a cease-fire between Israel and Gaza militants for the following day. Relief spreads across their faces with knowledge that they may have survived another war. By the following day, they realized that wouldn't be the case. The militants rejected the cease-fire call by releasing a barrage of rockets. And Israel resumed airstrikes on this coastal strip. The fighting was about to get worse and the scars were about to cut a whole lot deeper. Abu Sheir got an update about his wounded patient's condition -- the young man hit in a drone strike. He didn't make it. He died at the hospital. How did this happen? Iraq, Syria, Gaza and Libya all in flames . Trapped in war: 'This is tyranny'","Ambulance crews in Gaza routinely dispatched to airstrike scenes .

"(CNN) -- Embattled Mayor Rob Ford vowed ""outright war"" after Toronto's City Council voted to strip him of most of his powers Monday in a tumultuous meeting during which a charging Ford knocked down one of its members. Nearly two weeks after Ford admitted to smoking crack cocaine in a ""drunken stupor"" -- an admission forced by a drug probe that resulted in extortion charges against a friend -- the mayor said he was done apologizing. He called Monday's vote ""a coup d'etat"" and compared it to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, warning council members, ""What goes around, comes around, friends."" ""If you think American-style politics is nasty, you guys have just attacked Kuwait,"" he said to groans and laughter in the council chambers. ""And you will never see something -- mark my words, my friends, this is going to be outright war in the next election, and I am going to do everything in my power to beat you guys."" Undeterred, the council voted 36-5 to slash the budget of the mayor's office and transfer most of his duties to the deputy mayor. City Councilor Karen Stintz said Ford ""doesn't understand the issues he's facing,"" and Monday's votes reduce him to ""a figurehead."" ""We are a great city, and the reality is Mayor Ford does not represent the face of the city,"" Stintz said. ""We are taking the steps we're taking to give the deputy mayor the powers and the responsibility and the staff to exercise the functions that the mayor no longer can."" The council already has called on Ford to take a leave of absence and voted to strip him of his emergency powers last week. In Monday's session, Ford and his brother, City Councilor Doug Ford, sparred with hecklers in the council gallery who chanted ""Shame, shame, shame,"" during a recess. During that break, Rob Ford stomped over to his brother, knocking down Councilor Pam McConnell in the process -- an apparently accidental act for which the mayor had to issue another apology. McConnell suffered a fat lip, her colleague, Councilor Paula Fletcher, told Ford. Fletcher demanded an apology from the mayor, who said the collision happened when he ""rushed to my brother's defense."" ""I apologize to anybody that I accidentally hit when my brother was in an altercation over there,"" Rob Ford said. ""I'm asking you to apologize to Councilor McConnell,"" Fletcher replied. ""Absolutely,"" Ford replied. ""It was a complete accident, and I do sincerely apologize to you, Councilor McConnell."" Apologies have become a matter of routine for Ford since his November 5 admission that he once used crack. He's now battling other allegations of excessive drinking and abusing staffers that have emerged during the drug probe, which has not resulted in charges against the mayor so far. Ford has admitted to drinking too much and has pledged to restrain his consumption of alcohol. But he's denied other accounts of public intoxication and the physical and verbal abuse of staffers. Thursday, he answered a female aide's allegation that he sought to perform oral sex with graphic language of his own, stunning the reporters who surrounded him and prompting another apologetic news conference. Ford says he didn't lie about crack use . And he has refused to step down, insisting he would let voters of Canada's largest city decide on whether to keep him next year. He still appears to have intense support in his home turf in the blue-collar northwestern precincts of Toronto, where supporters cheered him on over the weekend. Monday's vote came hours before the debut of ""Ford Nation,"" a show he and his brother now host on Canada's Sun TV news network. On the show, Ford said he hadn't had a drink in three weeks and was working on losing as much as 40 pounds. ""If council wants to strip all my powers, do whatever they want to do,"" he said. ""I disagree with it, but you know what? They have their rights. I think it's wrong. I think it's illegal. But people are going to have their say on October 27."" ""I'm feeling great, 'cause again, I know what I'm doing is right for the taxpayers,"" he added. In an attempt to head off Monday's vote, Doug Ford introduced a separate measure calling for early elections instead. It was ruled out of order. ""There are 383,000 people who voted for the mayor, and a lot of those people voted for each one for you, too,"" he said. ""They wouldn't want the mayor to take that right off each one of you, and it's the same for the mayor."" But Councilor Raymond Cho said Rob Ford -- who has touted his expansion of Toronto's subway system and vowed to derail what he calls the ""gravy train"" of city government -- was running both a ""gravy train"" and a ""crazy train."" Opinion: Is that an addict standing next to you? ""He needs help, and I said that many times, but he didn't accept it,"" Cho said. ""This is the only route that I have to choose, and I leave up to the individual councilors their decision and I hope we made the right decision."" Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly, who inherits much of Ford's authority now, said he hadn't spoken to the mayor Monday evening -- ""and given the bellicosity of his concluding remarks, I think it is wise to wait for some time."" Ford is a man of contrasts . ""We played football. We both coached football. And hopefully, using football as a metaphor, we can talk about strategies and tactics on a go-forward basis,"" Kelly said. ""But the key right now I think is to let him settle down, seek advice from others -- at least others that he listens to. Because he hasn't listened to us that well over the past few weeks. And then talk together, privately, and see where it goes from there."" But Kelly said that if Ford continues ""to get in the way of good government,"" the city could ask Ontario's provincial government to remove him completely.

"(CNN) -- In a historic decision this week, the American Studies Association voted to boycott Israeli academic institutions, endorsing Palestinian civil society's call for boycotts, divestments and sanctions against Israel until it complies with international law and ends abuses against Palestinian human rights. The decision by the American Studies Association, a group of academics involved in the study of U.S. culture and history, to boycott collaborations with institutions is important. The ASA is one of the first major U.S. academic groups to take this step, and it sends a strong message to Israeli intellectuals and elites that their nation's policies will lead only to international isolation. The boycott, divestment and sanctions movement (BDS) was started by Palestinian political parties, trade unions and political movements in 2005. Signatories include refugees, Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories and Palestinian citizens of Israel. The legitimacy of the movement's tactics comes into sharp focus in the light of Nelson Mandela's death and the struggle in South Africa against apartheid. Today, Israel practices apartheid. It's a system of unjust laws enforced by the gun to restrict the human rights of one group -- Palestinians -- with the aim of keeping political power in the hands of another demographic group -- Israeli Jews. These violations of Palestinians' rights include the denial of repatriation to refugees, restrictions on residency, the demolition of homes, destruction and seizure of land and property, restrictions on movement and discrimination in allocation of resources. Many supporters of Israel are rehashing the same arguments against BDS that apologists of the South African regime made decades ago. Perhaps the most common criticism is that Israel is not the worst regime in the world -- boycotts based on human rights concerns should focus on the worst violators first and not unfairly single out Israel. The same reasoning was made against the movement to divest from South Africa. Two Stanford professors argued in an op-ed in 1979: ""White South Africans have often been harsh in their dealings with black people but there is nothing like the mass terror characteristic of communist countries and of many African dictatorships. ... In South Africa, there has been nothing comparable to the mass expulsions of ethnic minorities that have stained the post-World War II history of countries as varied as Burma, Uganda, India, Algeria, Palestine, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Burundi and Angola."" South Africa may not have engaged in the bloodletting that happened in 1970s Burundi, but does that mean other nations should not have risen up and acted against apartheid? The authors of the op-ed say that blacks never had it as good as they do under apartheid. Blacks in South Africa, they wrote, are ""among the best paid, best educated, most urbanized blacks in Africa."" This classic colonialist trope is often unsurprisingly echoed by Israel's supporters, who argue that Palestinians under Israeli rule are similarly privileged compared with their Arab kin. The effort to distract from Israeli human rights abuses by pointing to human rights abuses elsewhere is simply aimed at silencing criticism of Israel. The movement chooses boycotts, divestments and sanctions as a strategy in part because other strategies have proved fruitless. Armed struggle has not worked. As in the case of South Africa, a native, stateless population was pitted against a highly industrialized and militarized state that had the backing of Western powers, and it led to bloody repression of Palestinians. And negotiations have acted just as a cover for continued Israeli colonization. The Israelis use their position as the stronger party, backed by the United States, to impose their will on the Palestinians. If the Palestinians reject these unfair proposals, they are promptly blamed for the absence of peace despite being the occupied party. There is a second argument we've heard in recent days against BDS and the vote of the American Studies Association. Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Mahmoud Abbas -- when he was in South Africa for Mandela's memorial -- said he supports the boycott of Israeli settlement products but not the boycott of the state of Israel itself. Some reflexive Israel supporters jumped on this comment to argue that those who endorse the BDS movement are being ""more Palestinian"" than the chairman of the PLO. It's not very useful to boycott settlements in the occupied territories without boycotting the state that supports them. Israel's colonial enterprise is not directed from the hilltops of the West Bank but from the corridors of power inside Israel's government. The state provides funding, defense and infrastructure to ensure Israel settlements grow and thrive. And, while settlements might be the biggest single challenge to Palestinian territorial contiguity, they are but one facet of a system of oppression that features a range of abuses from discrimination and displacement to denial of refugee rights. But it makes some sense that the chairman of the PLO would make such a remark. Abbas, who leads the West Bank Palestinian Authority, is engaged in U.S.-led negotiations with Israel. He relies heavily on Western donor dollars to pay his employees and security services. That funding, in the past, has routinely been used as a coercive force any time Abbas even moderately disagreed with U.S. and Israeli whims. This has compromised the independence of the Palestinian Authority's decision making for years. If Abbas came out in full support of BDS, he'd immediately be accused of ""incitement"" by his Israeli counterpart. He might even get a phone call from U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry reminding him who pays his bills. When understood in context, Abbas' comment is not a reflection of the broader Palestinian opinion on BDS but rather a product of the bankrupt U.S.-led negotiations system that makes boycotts, divestment and sanctions so necessary. BDS is growing, but at only 8 years old, it's still a nascent movement. Victories are piling up, however, and this path continues to be the most likely method of putting pressure on Israel to end its version of apartheid. Years from now, we will look back at moments, such as the American Studies Association's decision, just as we can look back today on the 1979 argument against fighting South African apartheid. And we'll remember who chose to be on the right side of history. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Yousef Munayyer.","American Studies Association voted to boycott Israeli academic institutions .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama followed in the footsteps of past U.S. leaders with a speech on Wednesday at Berlin's iconic Brandenburg Gate, where he said he would ask Russia to join the United States in slashing its supply of strategic nuclear warheads. ""We may no longer live in fear of global annihilation, but so long as nuclear weapons exist, we are not truly safe,"" Obama said in the city that symbolized the East-West divide in the decades after World War II. ""After a comprehensive review, I've determined that we can ensure the security of America and our allies -- and maintain a strong and credible strategic deterrent -- while reducing our deployed strategic nuclear weapons by up to one-third,"" he said. ""And I intend to seek negotiated cuts with Russia to move beyond Cold War nuclear postures."" Obama's speech made repeated references to Berlin's post-war history and the resiliency of its people. He called on them to manifest the same spirit that helped bring down the Berlin Wall to now take on broader challenges facing the modern world. Does cutting U.S. nukes really matter? ""Complacency is not the character of great nations,"" said the president, who perspired openly despite removing his suit jacket when he started speaking to a sun-drenched crowd. ""Today's threats are not as stark as they were half-a-century ago. But the struggle for freedom and security and human dignity, that struggle goes on."" Repeating his campaign themes of equal opportunity and freedom for all, Obama said such ideals can provide the prosperity sought by all nations -- especially longtime allies such as the United States and Germany. ""We may enjoy a standard of living that is the envy of the world, but so long as hundreds of millions endure the agony of an empty stomach or the anguish of unemployment, we're not truly prosperous,"" Obama said. ""We are more free when all people can pursue their own happiness."" In the city rife with Cold War history, Obama also heralded democratic values that helped end communist control. Nuclear weapons: Who has what? ""Because millions across this continent now breathe the fresh air of freedom, we can say here in Berlin, here in Europe: Our values won,"" he said to cheers. ""Openness won. Tolerance won. And freedom won."" Obama's speech took place almost exactly 50 years after President John F. Kennedy delivered his ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" -- or ""I am a Berliner"" -- speech of solidarity with West Berlin near the dividing line with the Soviet-occupied east on the other side of the Berlin Wall. Berlin is also where President Ronald Reagan delivered a famous line to the Soviet Union in 1987: ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"" When Obama referred to Kennedy's speech and repeated the famous phrase, the crowd cheered. He also quoted from Kennedy's speech by calling on people to look ""to the day of peace with justice, beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind."" Taking on another major issue, Obama called for a new global effort to address climate change, citing threats such as ""more severe storms, more famine and floods, new waves of refugees, coast lines that vanish, oceans that rise."" Opinion: Why U.S. needs Germany now more than ever . ""This is the future we must avert,"" he said to cheers. ""This is the global threat of our time. And for the sake of future generations, our generation must move toward a global compact to confront a changing climate before it is too late. That is our job. That is our task. We have to get to work."" Analysts said Obama's speech sought to entrench a presidential legacy of leadership on global issues, especially after the lofty expectations in Germany and elsewhere for the candidate who spoke in Berlin five years ago have given way to the realities of the Oval Office. ""It was a president who wanted to kind of put down a stake and say, like JFK, like Ronald Reagan, I share their values as an American president and these are the things I feel like I need to talk to you about today as an American president,"" said CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger. Historian Douglas Brinkley called it a ""healing speech,"" but said ""let's not confuse this with Kennedy's very important Cold War talk in Berlin or Ronald Reagan's fighting words about 'tear down this wall.'"" ""This was not a moment that's going to be a gold star on history's calendar,"" Brinkley told CNN. Opinion: No such things as a safe number of nukes . Beyond New START . Obama's latest proposals on nuclear stockpiles come two years after New START -- an agreement between the United States and Russia -- went into effect. New START, which stands for Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, calls for each country to limit its nuclear warhead arsenal to 1,550 by the year 2018. If fully implemented, his proposals on Wednesday would reduce both stockpiles by another one-third -- to roughly 1,000 warheads for each country. ""At the same time, we'll work with our NATO allies to seek bold reductions in U.S. and Russian tactical weapons in Europe,"" he said. After New START was ratified, Obama ordered a detailed internal analysis of U.S. nuclear needs and what it would take to deter other countries from attacking, the White House said. Obama has also said the United States will only consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners. A White House fact sheet released after the speech called Obama's proposals ""new guidance that aligns U.S. nuclear policies to the 21st century security environment."" Obama's guidance directed the Pentagon to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in the overall U.S. security strategy, and narrow the focus of nuclear strategy to deterrence, the White House document said. The proposals drew immediate criticism from the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Howard ""Buck"" McKeon of California, who said in a statement that Russia already failed to adhere to existing arms-reduction agreements. ""The president must make clear to (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin that the United States will not allow itself or its allies to be bullied by Russia or to allow that state to ignore its arms control obligations,"" McKeon's statement said. 5 key points from Obama's news conference in Berlin . Pressuring Iran and North Korea . The United States will continue working to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, with specific pressure on Iran and North Korea, a senior administration official said. Obama also will participate in the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague, Netherlands, the official said. The president announced Wednesday in his speech that he will host a Nuclear Security Summit in 2016 to work with other countries in securing nuclear materials and preventing nuclear terrorism. Nuclear deterrence could restrain N. Korea, Iran . Wednesday's speech took place amid a festive atmosphere at Brandenburg Gate, where Obama faced the East in contrast to Reagan's appearance when the Berlin Wall still divided the city. While the crowd was much smaller than the estimated 200,000 who jammed the area in 2008 to hear then Sen. Obama speak, people waved U.S. and German flags and regularly erupted in cheers and applause. Near the front was Gail Halvorsen, known as the Candy Bomber for being the first to drop candy to kids during the U.S. airlift of 1948-49 that supplied West Berlin following a Soviet blockade. Obama paid tribute to that moment, noting that the 92-year-old Halvorsen, who he called ""the original candy bomber,"" was present. ""We could not be prouder of him,"" Obama said as Halvorsen stood and waved. The president added: ""I hope I look that good, by the way, when I'm 92.""

"(CNN) -- They were orphaned and separated at a young age, victims of the devastating violence that ravaged Rwanda in 1994. But Chance Tubane and her brother Patience Nduwawe were reunited nearly 10 years after the genocide and have now joined forces to help develop their country and link all Rwandans together. The two siblings have combined their skills in IT and communication to launch Tohoza.com, Rwanda's top online advertisement platform. Similar to the popular Western website Craigslist, Tohoza is a web-based classified ad directory where Rwandans can post or look for job vacancies as well as buy, sell and rent just about anything -- from houses and cars to watches and shoes. Just two years after its launch, Tohoza is today the third most popular website in Rwanda, with about 9,000 visitors per day. ""We said we had to create a product that would help a lot of people,"" says Nduwawe. ""What Rwandans need now is information, so we started Tohoza to deliver the most accurate and timely information to them."" Read this: 15 African tech startups to watch in 2014 . Tubane says the main objective of their business venture is not to make money but to present a different, more optimistic narrative about their country. ""When you went to Google and you wrote Rwanda, you used to have all the stories about the genocide,"" she says. ""But now, if you write Rwanda, you can have jobs, cars and get another image of the country -- a positive image that's bringing hope to people."" Separation, despair, euphoria . It's this deep desire to help Rwanda overcome the legacy of conflict that's been driving Nduwawe and Tubane's efforts -- a sentiment rooted within their troubled past and their personal tales of loss, struggle and survival. Back in 1994, the two siblings, along with their parents and brother, fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo to escape the violence plaguing Rwanda. But while in Goma, their mother passed away from blood loss following surgery. It was then that it was decided that it'd be better for Tubane, who was 11 at the time, to go and live with her godmother in Belgium. Nduwawe, six years older than Tubane, stayed behind with his father and brother and continued his school education. But in 1996, just after Nduwawe had traveled to the city of Bukavu by himself to take his university entrance exams, violence erupted in the eastern DRC, forcing his father and brother to head back to Rwanda. For Nduwawe, however, there was no escape route. Alone in a foreign country, he had to ""follow the refugee direction,"" he says. ""During all those years, I was struggling in the DR Congo,"" adds Nduwawe, ""without knowing if my father or my brother or my sister, were still alive -- I was without any information."" Read this: Old boat sails turned into uplifting art . Back home, no one knew anything about Nduwawe or his whereabouts. His father and relatives were constantly trying to track him but their efforts were proving fruitless, since Nduwawe had found refuge in Walikale, an isolated region in eastern DRC situated in the middle of equatorial forest. The days without news turned to weeks and the weeks turned to years. As time passed by, some of his relatives lost hope -- but not his younger sister in Belgium. ""They were saying that you should forget about him because nine years is too long to hope that someone is alive,"" remembers Tubane. ""But I couldn't believe that!"" Tubane's faith was rewarded in late 2003 when some relatives managed to finally trace Nduwawe in Rwanda's neighboring country. ""When you are in the DR Congo there is a lot of misleading information, like 'in Rwanda there is no life,' or 'once you reach there you will be killed,'"" says Nduwawe. ""But this man came with a photograph of one member of my family as a proof they'd met each other,"" he adds. ""He told me 'they need you' so we can arrange how you can meet your family."" Convinced that his relatives were still alive, Nduwawe embarked on the dangerous journey on foot. Passing through armed militia and traveling at night, he traversed the eastern DRC's tough terrains for one week before managing to reach Bukavu. There, a family member was waiting for him to get him back home and sadly inform him that his father had passed away a couple of months before. ""I still have, today, a picture of me where my father has written at the back saying that they're still searching for me,"" says Nduwawe. ""Even if he died, he died with that hope I'm still alive,"" he continues. Read this: Ex-refugee builds toilet paper empire . ""All family members were very happy (when I came back) and I saw what we were hearing on the other side of the border was not true."" In Belgium, Tubane was also ecstatic about her brother's return. ""It's like a fairy tale,"" she says. ""Sometimes he says, 'Chance, I know that we're going far, because if God kept us alive, it's for a reason, so this is why I am here and that is our story.'"" Connecting a country . The two siblings have now added a new chapter to their long story with the launch of Tohoza. Currently, they are the company's only staff -- Nduwawe, who went on to do computer courses after his return, is in charge of IT, while Tubane, an information and communications graduate, is dealing with marketing and PR. ""We have to work hard,"" says Tubane, who also works full-time as an administration coordinator for a Kigali-based NGO. ""So we are, for now, the web masters, we are our own bosses, we are the ones marketing, we are the PR. Although Tohoza barely makes a profit at the moment, the two entrepreneurs have big plans for the future. By next year they aim to advance the site so visitors can navigate its information without an internet connection, using the simplest mobile phones -- over 60% of Rwanda's population have mobile phones, a much larger number than people with access to the Internet. Nduwawe and Tubane are exploring voice options and SMS technology as they look to grow their company. But for this brother and sister team, boosting connectivity amongst all Rwandans through their business will be the ultimate success. ""We are inspired by our parents because they taught us that nothing is impossible,"" says Nduwawe. ""They were like, 'if you have an idea, go for it, there is no limit -- you just need to work hard,'"" adds Tubane. READ MORE: Hackers board the StartupBus .

"(CNN) -- Apple's Internet-based messaging service, iMessage, has long had problems when it comes to interacting with non-Apple devices. Now the company is finally acknowledging the problems and rolling out a slate of bug fixes to make Apple-to-Android messaging less of a nightmare. Instead of sending regular SMS text messages via wireless carriers, iMessage transfers messages across Apple's own servers to allow iPhone users to message one another without paying carrier fees. But some people who switch from an iPhone to a non-Apple device have found it difficult to dissociate their phone numbers from iMessage. That leads to text messages from friends getting sucked up into Apple's database and disappearing instead of being sent along to the person's new phone as a traditional SMS message. Users can turn off iMessage on all their Apple devices to remedy the problem, but sometimes the issue persists, especially if a user doesn't disable iMessage before selling his or her old iPhone. One frustrated customer is suing Apple over the issue, claiming that iPhone defectors are being ""penalized and unable to obtain the full benefits of their wireless-service contracts."" The claimant is seeking class-action status for the suit. The growing backlash has now forced Apple to address the problem directly.

"Editor's note: Jane Velez-Mitchell hosts ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell,"" a topical event-driven show with a wide range of viewpoints that airs every night at 7 p.m. ET on HLN. New York (HLN) -- It's racing season in America! The Kentucky Derby is this weekend. Then it's the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes. Get out the fancy party hats and pop the champagne! But it's not a cause for celebration for America's horses. These magnificent, yet voiceless, creatures cannot tell you about the exploitation underlying America's racing industry. Where do thoroughbreds go after they lose one too many races, throw one too many riders or develop a limp? Many thousands of thoroughbreds end up being slaughtered for horse meat. The unpleasant truth is horse meat is eaten in Europe and Asia. Despite the myth that they end up knee-deep in grass on some idyllic farm, the reality is that horses are very expensive to keep. When they outlive their usefulness, they often are sent on a hellish journey that ends in a slaughterhouse. Toward the end of the line, these horses are sold priced per pound. I know. I've bought perfectly healthy horses for a couple of hundred dollars just as they were about to be loaded on a slaughterhouse-bound truck. The fortunate few end up at a sanctuary. The others are bought at auction, end up in overloaded trailers and travel thousands of miles without food or water to the slaughter plant. Some are dead on arrival. According to the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), tens of thousands of live horses are transported every year across the border to slaughterhouses in Mexico and Canada. Part of the problem is that the horse racing industry breeds for perfection. For every stallion or mare that looks like a winner, an untold number of foals get left in the dust. As the saying goes, they can't all be winners ... and they can't all be riding or school horses either. There is a severe horse overpopulation crisis caused by overbreeding in the racing industry. It's time for that industry to accept responsibility for its castoffs and take dramatic action to protect a species that has so loyally served humankind. They've got the money to create enough retirement homes to accommodate all the horses that pass through their gates. Horse lovers won a huge victory when America's foreign-owned horse slaughterhouses were shut down several years ago. Before that, the HSUS estimates 100,000 horses were being slaughtered every year in America. Ever since, horse slaughter proponents have aggressively campaigned to reopen such plants, despite public revulsion. For too long, Congress has been mulling over a Horse Slaughter Prohibition bill (H.R. 503) that would ""prohibit the shipping, transporting, moving, delivering, receiving, possessing, purchasing, selling, or donation of horses and other equines to be slaughtered for human consumption, and for other purposes."" This bill passed in the House of Representatives in 2006, but languished in the Senate. It's time for compassionate Americans to send a wake-up call to their members of Congress and demand passage of legislation to end the wholesale slaughter of America's horses once and for all. Then, the racing industry will be forced to do something about its addiction to breeding. The time to be oh-so-polite about the industry's dirty little secret is over. This secret is out of the gate. Now, the race to end the cruelty must begin in earnest. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jane Velez-Mitchell.","HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell wants to save all horses in U.S. from slaughterhouse .

"(CNN) -- As pretty on the eyes as they are dramatic on the ears. That's how we should appreciate some of the world's concert halls, according to building data company Emporis. The Hamburg-based company has put together a list of what it's calling the world's most spectacular concert halls. ""These days concert halls also have remarkable architecture, offering audiences a great show even before they have taken their seats,"" the report said. ""More and more concert halls are being built that stand out by virtue of their eye-catching shapes, colors and materials."" It highlights the Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku, Azerbaijan, as an example of an ""extraordinary"" concert structure: ""The white building's curved, wave-like shape makes it seem as if it has been 'poured' into the landscape."" Berlin's Philharmonie building, completed in 1963, also makes the list, as do the Cidade das Artes in Rio de Janeiro and Singapore's Esplanade Concert Hall. The United States and Spain both get two entries -- Los Angeles' Walt Disney Concert Hall ""has the appearance of curved metal plates piled into one other and which ... make the design look like an outlandish fantasy,"" the report said. One surprising omission from the list of 15 is Sydney's famous Opera House. But it does get a mention in the report, illustrating how long some of these structures take to build. The Sydney Opera House took 14 years to complete, and one concert hall in construction, Hamburg's Elbphilharmonie building, will be completed in 2016, nine years after having started.

"(CNN) -- A Tennessee man convicted and jailed for abusing his two infant children is charged with murder -- 23 years later. Anthony Shannon Lane was convicted in 1992 of beating his 5-week-old daughter Amanda so badly she lived the rest of her life in bed: blind and unable to talk or move, except for seizures, said her mother, Nancy Woodall-Holmes, who first fostered and then adopted Amanda. Amanda died last year at age 22 and on Monday, Lane, 41, was charged with first-degree murder in Amanda's death. ""She was such a treasure,"" said Woodall-Holmes, who became Amanda's foster parent on a Christmas Eve. At the time, she was told Amanda had a short life expectancy and her placement would be temporary. ""I can't put into words just how precious she was,"" said Woodall, who adopted Amanda at age 4 . ""We will work with the district attorney's office in the prosecution of this case for justice for Amanda,"" said Rutherford County Sheriff Robert Arnold. According to an autopsy by the state medical examiner's office, Amanda's death was a homicide, caused by complications of blunt force head injury. Lane's first court hearing is scheduled for July 18. Second infant abused . After serving a 10-year sentence for aggravated child abuse of Amanda, Lane had a son, Ryan, who was abused at 3 months old, according to court documents.

"Tijuana, Mexico (CNN) -- On Tijuana's Avenue de la Revolucion, street vendor and sidewalk philosopher Juan Ramon Rocha leaned on his coin and jewelry cart and waited. But the tourists from across the border never rushed into the streets of T.J., as it's often called. Rocha made one sale, to a local resident, in an hour. ""The business, you can see for yourself, it went down 95 percent,"" he said. ""Please tell them, the Americans, it's safe to come here. We are all Americanos, North Americanos. Do you see any problems here?"" A few yards away, there was a donkey painted like a zebra, hitched to a cart full of sombreros, a Tijuana photo opportunity. But no smiling tourists stepped into the picture frame. Visitors have been scared off because at least 18,000 people have been killed in Mexico since President Felipe Calderon dispatched the army to fight the drug cartels in December 2006. Tijuana's grisliest murders include decapitations, dismemberments, dozens of police killings and the deaths of three teenagers at school. Fear of Tijuana's streets seeps deep into California. As groups of 240 students from Westmont College near Santa Barbara, California, drove down the coast to do missionary work in Ensenada, Mexico, none ventured to Tijuana. The missionaries doing spring break volunteer projects in poor neighborhoods were given a simple edict: Do not stop in T.J. Hanna Walker kneeled, pounding nails into shingles, on a rooftop of a small house taking shape on a dirt road high above Ensenada. ""To be honest, I was a tiny bit nervous crossing the border,"" Walker said. ""I've been to Mexico before, but not for service projects. But now that I have been here [Ensenada] a couple days, I am perfectly comfortable."" The Westmont students are taking precautions as part of their annual Potter's Clay missionary work. ""We are staying in a group,"" Walker explained. ""We are making sure that I am with someone all the time. When we went downtown for dinner, we just paired up and walked around in twos, the buddy system. We locked cars. We're just being smart about it."" Ensenada welcomes any business it can get, as its tourism trade has also been choked off by concerns about border violence. Fortunately, cruise ships still dock in Ensenada's Bahia de Los Santos, a daily divine arrival that spills cash-carrying tourists onto shore. But we saw just two visitors who said they drove over the border to visit Ensenada. All the other beer-carrying, trinket-buying tourists came from the ship. ""People are afraid of driving by Tijuana,"" said Papas and Beer manager Cesar Marquez. ""That's what's hurting us [Ensenada] the most."" Later, in Tijuana, as the shadows stretched out with the dropping sun, we were approached by a man with an outdated nylon jacket. His cheeks were chipped by acne scars. The camera was far out of sight. ""I can help you find whatever you need,"" he said. ""What do you want? I help people find the good clubs and get dates and more. You pay me."" We told him we were journalists on a story and not interested. ""Oh then pay me, and I will tell you a lot for your story, about everything that goes on here,"" the hustler said. Everything -- did he mean drugs or guns, or both? We had no intent to find out, kept to our tight travel schedule and drove out of Tijuana to a border crossing just several cars deep. More than five years ago, that vehicle line extended so far back into Mexico, a re-entry at San Ysidro, California, could take hours. We zipped through the checkpoint in 10 minutes, another sign that Mexico's border violence is frightening off American tourists.","At least 18,000 people have been killed since Mexican army began fighting drug cartels .

"(CNN) -- The onlookers yell out at police and talk passionately with each other, their anger mixed with disbelief. At one point, a siren breaks through the murmurs and the shouts. In front of them is a young black man, his body prone and alone on the pavement. It's all in a video, captured Saturday and posted to Facebook a day later, that shows the tense, chilling scene on an otherwise placid summer day in Ferguson, Missouri. It's broad daylight; the grass is green; the trees are in full bloom. One woman heard on the video recalls having been in the shower when she heard pops. Could it have been fireworks? ""Not this time of the day,"" says a male voice, apparently from the person who shot the video on a cell phone. ""There ain't no fireworks this early."" Those lined up outside the yellow police tape waste no time discussing, often in expletive-laden terms, what happened. And the video dutifully records it all. It's not clear who saw what or what exactly transpired. Regardless, a clear consensus emerges among those heard on the recording: The young man in the street -- later ID'd as Michael Brown, an 18-year-old days away from starting classes at a technical college -- was shot dead by a Ferguson police officer. Authorities would later claim Brown attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun. But in the minutes after the shooting, the irate crowd on the Ferguson street comes to a different consensus, summed up by the video's narrator: ""They just killed this (man) for no reason."" As Brown's body lay prone -- for minutes with no one, not even a police officer, in the camera's sight -- onlookers quickly establish one key fact amongst themselves: He wasn't armed. ""There is nothing!"" a woman yells out on the video. ""Do you see a gun? Do you see a knife? Do you see anything that would have caused a threat to these (expletive) police officers?"" ""They shot that boy because they wanted to shoot that boy."" If the moments leading up to Brown's shooting were frenetic, the moments afterward -- at least right around his body -- are eerily calm as captured on the continuing video. 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . For minutes, there is nothing and no one around his body. Just a young man with a white shirt flat on the street, all alone. A police officer walks by two minutes into the video, and a minute later a man in a black shirt -- who witnesses identify as a family member -- approaches. But he's quickly guided away by officers. A short time later, a uniformed man -- perhaps a paramedic -- appears to check on Brown. Multiple officers eventually flank his body. One particularly angry, loud woman cries out: ""Where's the ambulance? Why doesn't somebody help this man? Why isn't somebody helping him?"" To which a man responds, more quietly, to no one in particular: ""They know he's dead, because they are not even trying to get him up."" Everything about Brown is plain to see. Until 10 minutes in, when a police officer comes up to lay a small white sheet over his body. As the video ends, it is only the beginning in Ferguson. Complete coverage on the Ferguson shooting .

"(CNN) -- A video that TMZ alleges is of Beyonce's younger sister having an altercation with the superstar's husband, Jay Z, has surfaced online. In what the site says is surveillance video from an elevator taken the night of the recent Met Gala in New York, a woman who resembles Solange Knowles enters just before a man who appears to be the rapper. Words seem to be exchanged, and then the woman lunges at and begins striking him before an unidentified man grabs and holds her. A woman who resembles Beyonce calmly stands in the corner of the elevator during most of the altercation. It is not yet known what caused the fight. CNN has reached out to representatives for Solange, Jay Z and Beyonce. Solange's rep is not offering comment. A representative for The Standard, the hotel where the incident is believed to have occurred, released this statement to HLN: . ""We are shocked and disappointed that there was a clear breach of our security system and the confidentiality that we count on providing our guests,"" the statement said. ""We are investigating with the utmost urgency the circumstances surrounding the situation and, as is our customary practice, will discipline and prosecute the individuals involved to our fullest capacity.""

"(CNN) -- A 21-year-old woman whose body was found in a water tank of a Los Angeles hotel in February was the victim of an accidental drowning, medical examiners reported Thursday. The decomposing body of Elisa Lam floated inside a water tank on the roof of the Cecil Hotel while guests brushed their teeth, bathed and drank water from it for as long as 19 days. A maintenance worker, checking on complaints about the hotel's water, found the Canadian tourist inside one of four water cisterns. Tests conducted by the city Health Department found no harmful bacteria in the tank or the pipes, which had to be drained, flushed and sanitized after the discovery. Los Angeles robbery-homicide detectives had treated the case as a suspicious death, since falling into a covered water tank behind a locked door on top of a roof would be an unusual accident, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Rudy Lopez said in February. See also: Carbon monoxide is the 'mystery' cause of 3 North Carolina hotel deaths . Lam checked into the Cecil Hotel on January 26, on her way to Santa Cruz, California, according to police in her hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia. Five days later, she was seen on a security camera video walking into the elevator, pushing the buttons for four floors and then peering out of the opened elevator door as if she is hiding or looking for someone. Clad in a red hoodie, Lam at one point walks out of the elevator before returning to it, pushing the buttons again. She then stands outside the open elevator doorway, motioning with her hands, before apparently walking away. It was the last day Lam was seen. Lam's parents reported the University of British Columbia student missing in early February. Her daily calls home stopped on January 31, police told reporters on February 6 at a Los Angeles news conference. Strange things began happening with the hotel's water supply later in the month, according to Sabina and Michael Baugh, a British couple who spent eight days there. The water pressure dropped to a trickle at times. ""The shower was awful,"" Sabina Baugh said. ""When you turned the tap on, the water was coming black first for two seconds and then it was going back to normal."" The tap water ""tasted horrible,"" Baugh said. ""It had a very funny, sweety, disgusting taste. It's a very strange taste. I can barely describe it."" But for a week, they never complained. ""We never thought anything of it,"" she said. ""We thought it was just the way it was here."" Two former guests, Steven and Gloria Cott, filed a class-action lawsuit against the hotel in late February. The lawsuit claims the hotel effectively failed to meet its obligation to provide proper water. ""Instead, the defendants provided water that had been contaminated by human remains and was not fit for human ingestion or to use to wash,"" the lawsuit states, claiming the Cotts believe that water was ""tainted.""

"(CNN) -- With several weeks having passed since Thailand's nationwide curfew was completely lifted, Bangkok's nightlife is back in full swing. Not only are tourists returning to the city's usual party haunts, from Khao San Road to Sukhumvit soi 11, they're coming back to notorious red light districts, such as Patpong, Soi Cowboy and Nana Plaza. Despite the evolution of the city's sophisticated nightlife, its seedier neighborhoods continue to offer what many tourists consider an essential Bangkok experience. For some tempted to sample a slice of the city's seedier side, however, the tales can be off-putting. Stories of that ""one night in Bangkok"" gone wrong are a consistent topic of posts in travel forums, ranging from complaints of paying ridiculously high prices for drinks at seedy sex shows to claims by victims of being drugged in red light zones only to wake up in hotel rooms with a headache and an empty wallet. Now, at least two companies are cashing in on the demand from timid thrill seekers who want to safely experience Bangkok's infamously raunchy shows and scandalous fetish clubs by offering the security of a chaperoned, well planned and efficient evening. Guests can customize their night on the town by choosing where to go, such as visiting a transsexual bar or doing a deeper descent into escapades too graphic to detail here. Alternately, tourists can go in for lofty, first-class treatment with fine dining, expensive cigars and high-brow entertainment -- but most customers prefer to cut to the chase and book a red-lit bar crawl, say tour organizers. These streamlined door-to-door tours include a chauffeured air-conditioned van, lots of alcohol and a guide who stays with the group the entire time. Customers usually go with friends, relatives or colleagues on private tours to celebrate a birthday or pre-wedding bash for a bride or groom, or just for fun while on vacation in Thailand. Tyson-style tats a must . The Bangkok Hangover Tour offers an imaginative and theatrical visit to some of the city's best bars and nightclubs, and honors the Hollywood movie ""Hangover Part II,"" which is set primarily in Bangkok. The Hangover Tour begins in the same bar on Soi Cowboy where several of the movie's scenes were filmed. In the movie, one of the lead characters unknowingly cavorts with a transgender Thai before waking up to discover a Maori-style Mike Tyson tattoo on his face. To emphasize that guests will be following some of that character's footsteps, Hangover Tour guides stick a washable Maori tattoo on all the guests' faces, heightening the sense of being in their own version of the movie. When the Hangover Tour recently guided the Johnson family from Kent, England, through Bangkok's nightlife, the family allowed CNN to tag along. Sons 'come of age' on Hangover tour . After the guide adorned the mother, father and their two young adult sons with Maori tattoo stickers, the visitors watched a nude show at another Soi Cowboy bar, eyes widening as their drinks kicked in. Their van then shuttled them to nearby Nana Entertainment Zone, where transgender ladies in bikinis nuzzled the giggling family. At another bar, both sons were lured on stage where two nude women spanked them with paddles made of harmless sponge, while the crowded bar's patrons roared with delight. ""My sons have absolutely come of age,"" marveled the 52-year-old father, Phil. ""Because they're slightly reserved, the guys. Anything like this, they're not used to. They've grown up. ""And we are actually acting the movie."" ""It's weird, because we are going in all the bars that they went in, in the movie, and basically you're re-living what they did in the film,"" said 21-year-old Brad, after his onstage experience. ""You go into these bars and it's incredible what you see. It's strange. You don't expect it to be how it is."" The tattoo sticker ""acts like a mask ... and you just forget about who you are back home, and you just sort of go with it,"" said Brad. ""Completely surreal,"" chimed his blushing brother, Cameron, 20. Their mother, Sharon, was stunned. ""There was full nude, semi-nude, interaction, you could watch, you could take part, it was just brilliant. Absolutely amazing. It's good fun,"" Sharon said. Seedier and sleazier as night wears on . The van then sped to Patpong Road to sleazier shows. The Johnson family chose to visit a sadomasochistic ""fetish"" club, where whips and chains hang on the walls. While his parents and brother chuckled mischievously, Cameron allowed himself to be tied to a vertical rack and stripped, exposing his bottom. His father, shrieking hysterically, followed the entertainers' lead and began lightly whipping his son in bondage, while everyone convulsed with laughter and Cameron cheerfully yelped in a mix of pain and delirium. The young man then found himself tied up, in a tall cage, and dominated by a leather-clad woman as if Cameron was a submissive character in a Marquis de Sade novel. ""We offer a visit to a fetish club, which costs an extra 699 baht ($22) per person,"" said tour supervisor Toby Newbold. ""People may not want to visit such a place on their own, but feel more comfortable doing so in the comfort of a tour. ""I would say 70% to 80% of customers include the fetish club, which has been a real surprise for us. ""Most people are shocked to find it quite erotic, and some come out of their shell and want to participate."" 'Safety and not being hassled' are sales points . Without extras, a Hangover Tour's basic price is 1,990 baht ($60), including two drinks, transportation to and from your hotel, plus a guide. More than a thousand foreign customers have taken the tour since it began in 2011, according to Newbold. ""We expected the tour to be mostly young male customers, but the tour is very popular with couples and we have lots of groups of girls and women taking the tour,"" said Newbold. ""We assume safety, and not being hassled, are a factor. ""This is a lighthearted look at Bangkok's nightlife. We just want people to have a good time."" The Hangover Tour doesn't duplicate the movie's dangerous adventures. ""In the movie, there is sex with a ladyboy, Stu gets a real face tattoo, there is drug taking and a young guy loses his finger,"" said Newbold. ""So I would have to say our tour is a little bit more toned down."" ""Crazy fun"" but at what price? Another Bangkok nightlife tour, Thailand Bucks and Hens, is similar. Five Australian male executives in their mid-20s allowed CNN to accompany their Bucks tour, but asked not to be identified. Their tour began in a scuzzier bar where girls hassled the five men for tips, confusing and embarrassing them when they were advised by their Bucks tour chaperone to give a bit of cash. Their Bucks tour then moved to the same Nana Plaza bar where the Hangover's Brits were spanked. One of the Australians was also coaxed onstage and spanked by two girls waving sponge paddles while the audience cheered. ""It's crazy fun,"" one of the group said. Capping their evening, the Aussies arrived at a popular upmarket Sukhumvit Road nightclub, and were escorted to an exclusive table. A guide from Bucks and Hens says the tours, established more than a year ago, have served more than a thousand customers, 75% of them male. Their favorite theme is ""one crazy party night, with their best friends, before they get married,"" he added. The company doesn't provide information about prices, saying each event differs, but all tours include transportation, a guide and lots of alcohol. Bucks and Hens runs tours elsewhere in Thailand, including female-only Hens nights, usually on Koh Samui or Phuket Island. Critics not impressed . Not everyone is happy about these tours. ""Sex tours to the nightlife in Bangkok, or anywhere, are harmful to both the tourist and the women,"" according to Annie Dieselberg, the American CEO of NightLight International, a Christian-based organization active in Bangkok, Los Angeles, Atlanta and elsewhere. The organization is working to end commercial sexual exploitation. ""Sex tours normalize the exploitation of women, and grooms men to believe they have the right to be entertained at the expense of the women,"" Dieselberg said after hearing about the Bangkok Hangover Tour and Thailand Bucks and Hens. ""I have spoken to several thousand women in prostitution, from over 12 nations in the last 14 years, and 99% of them hated this work and were only doing it because they saw no other way of meeting the family economic needs and pressures. ""As time passes, the women deteriorate and lose sight of their true identity and dreams for life. ""Many become [suicidal razor] cutters, and many become addicted to alcohol and drugs to cope with the shame and self-hatred,"" Dieselberg said. Richard S.

"(CNN) -- The institution of marriage is unique. It is the one institution that binds women and men together to form a family, and this serves broad societal purposes. In California, a U.S. District Court Judge last week overturned Proposition 8, the California Marriage Protection Act. It was passed in November 2008 by California voters to recognize ""only marriage between a man and a woman."" The majority of Californians, including two-thirds of the state's black voters, have just had their core civil right -- the right to vote -- stripped from them by an openly gay federal judge who has misread history and the Constitution to impose his views on the state's people. The implicit comparison Judge Vaughn Walker made between racism and opposition to same-sex marriage is particularly offensive to me and to all who remember the reality of Jim Crow. It is not bigotry, it is biology that discriminates between same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples. A marriage requires a husband and a wife, because these unions are necessary to make new life and connect children to their mother and father. Judge Walker's decision will not stand the test of time and history. Congress and the Supreme Court must act to protect all Americans' right to vote for marriage. Advocates of making same-sex marriage a legally recognized right claim that this will have no impact on traditional marriage -- that it can peacefully coexist alongside traditional marriage. On the contrary, it will have profound impacts. It will create a conflict for people of faith (and nonreligious people as well) who fervently believe in traditional man-woman marriage and the law. The Bible is so clear in its support of heterosexual marriage there is little need for us to go through an exhaustive definition of biblical marriage versus the types of unions allowed by law today. The Scriptures say in Genesis 2:24 that a man is to leave his family and cleave to his wife. This concept is repeated in Matthew 19:5 and Mark 10:7. All the scriptures in the Bible concerning marriage presuppose heterosexual marriage. We can teach our kids that there are important spiritual and societal reasons to believe in traditional marriage and oppose same-sex marriage. But if same-sex marriage becomes legally recognized across the country, our kids will be told that gay marriage is a civil rights issue and that those who oppose it are akin to the racists of history who opposed interracial marriage and supported slavery. We can teach our children at home that marriage is between a man and a woman, but our children's public schools will teach them that marriage includes same-sex couples. Both would be ""equal marriages"" under the law. What might this look like? In Massachusetts, where a ruling legalized same-sex marriage in 2004, kids in public schools are reading books depicting same-sex families. At a California charter school in 2008, kindergartners' parents objected when a school newsletter alerted them to ""National Coming Out Day;"" a parent told a local ABC-TV affiliate that a teacher at the school screened a film to kindergartners the previous year showing gay families. These kinds of ill-advised social experiments may produce a host of unexpected consequences. If gay marriage is allowed, the nation will soon begin to experience an increased degradation of the nuclear family -- resulting in fewer kids being raised by both a mom and a dad. Beyond that, those of us who believe in traditional marriage and are in a regulated profession -- such as counselor, physician, attorney or accountant -- and act in concert with our beliefs, may be vulnerable to losing our professional license and our livelihood. We can be a religious charity faithfully fulfilling our mission by serving our community, such as by providing adoption and other services, but if we refuse to provide those services to a same-sex couple, we have the choice of abandoning our beliefs or ending our mission. In 2003, Adoption.com was sued by two California homosexual men, who claimed illegal discrimination because the agency refused to serve homosexual couples. The agency lost the lawsuit and no longer serves adoptive parents in California. An even more substantive danger lies in the consequences of gay marriage on the next generation. Redefining marriage redefines family. Changing the concept of family will change both the definition and the pattern of parenting. What will the landscape of America look like if same-sex marriage is legalized across our nation? Social scientists report what most Americans have always known: Both boys and girls are deeply affected in biological and psychological ways by the presence of their fathers. If the American family loses the presence of the birth dad in the home, there will be huge consequences to the growth and stability of the next generation of children in that family. For example, repeatedly, scholarly studies focused on adolescence show that early onset of puberty in girls is associated with negative psychological, social, and health problems including depression, alcohol consumption, and higher teenage pregnancy. An eight-year study of girls and their families showed that a father's presence in the home, with appropriate involvement in his children's lives, contributed to daughters' reaching puberty at a later age. Despite the incredible adaptability of children, our entire culture should advocate for family structures that promote the most positive environments for coming generations. In addition to fighting the marriage redefinition, leaders from all sectors of our culture, including our churches, must work hard at improving heterosexual marriages. Counseling, modeling, and interventions are needed to help ailing marriages. Both battles must be fought if our families, which are the incubators of future societal greatness, are to be protected. Let's set our sights high. Let's not fall victim to the circling  argument of our opposition. We simply need an army of bipartisan leaders to strategize, organize, and prioritize the protection of marriage. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Harry R.

"(CNN) -- This is where it gets really interesting. If your interest in the World Cup died with your ousted team's dreams, do reconsider. Because, boy, will you be treated to some fancy footwork today. Brazil vs. Germany in the semi-finals. It doesn't get any more exciting than that. (Well, until tomorrow, when Argentina takes on the Netherlands.) The only time the two nations met at a World Cup was in the finals in 2002. Brazil won 2-0. But this time, Brazil is the unlikely underdog facing the very real possibility of being booted from a World Cup in their own front yard. Its goal-scoring talisman, Neymar, is out with a fractured vertebra. And its key defender and captain, Thiago Silva, is out on a second yellow card. (If you get two, you automatically miss the next game). The Germans, on the other hand, are on a tear. They have efficiently decimated their opponents, and they seem to be getting better and better with every match. Here are 5 things you should know about today's matchup: . 1. It's Muller time . Neymar's gone. Portugal's Ronaldo is gone. Colombia's James Rodriguez is gone. Germany's Thomas Muller may very well emerge as the best player in this tournament. With his power and pace, Muller's scored four goals and helped with two more so far. Fun fact: Back home, Muller stars in a yoghurt commercial for, what else, Mullermilch. 2. Getting Klose-r to a record . Let's not forget that other German dynamo, Miroslav Klose. He's scored at least one goal in the last four World Cup tournaments (only two other players can boast that). And if he scores today, he becomes the most prolific goal scorer in World Cup history with 16. He's tied with Brazil's Ronaldo at the moment. Fun fact: Ronaldo scored his 15th goal against Ghana in Germany. Klose scored his 15th goal against Ghana, in Brazil. 3. Don't rule out the one-name wonders . Brazil has held up the World Cup trophy more times than anyone else (five). And the ugly, uber-physical game it played against Colombia showed that it will do whatever it takes to get that trophy. It has committed more fouls than any other team (96) and, according to a Forbes analysis, faked the most injuries. While Neymar won't be there, Brazil will have the home crowd acting as its 12th man. And it still has two formidable attackers in Fred and Hulk (yes, he's named after the comic book character). Fun fact: So many Brazilian players go by one name because that's just the convention in the country. Even the former President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, was known by his nickname Lula. 4. Keep an eye on the keepers . Germany's Manuel Neuer has been unbelievable, charging out of his box to clear ball after ball. He's only allowed in 3 goals in 5 matches. Brazil's goalie Julio Cesar has yet to concede more than one goal in any game. Those who say he isn't the player he once was were silenced when he saved two penalties against Chile and helped Brazil advance. Fun fact: Neuer won $680,000 in the German version of ""Who Wants to be Millionaire?"" 5. A word on the card-carrier . The man refereeing the match will be Marco Antonio Rodriguez, the same guy who failed to see -- or punish -- Urguay's Luis Suarez when he chomped down on the shoulder of Italian defender Girgio Chiellini. Otherwise, Rodriguez came into the tournament as the most card-happy official. He sent off 51 players in 70 matches. (At the World Cup, he red-carded Italy's Claudio Marchisio.) Fun fact: In Mexico, Rodriguez is known as ""Dracula"" for his apparent resemblance to the actor who plays the character in a TV show there. .","Brazil, without Neymar, is the unlikely underdog .
If he scores, Klose becomes highest goal scorer in Cup history .
Brazil has committed more fouls than any other team .
Referee for match is the man who didn't notice Suarez bite ."
"(CNN) -- A pro-Palestinian college professor's tenure offer at the University of Illinois was allegedly rescinded after he made anti-Israel tweets about the war in Gaza. Dr. Steven Salaita's case ""is sort of unprecedented in a way,"" said Baher Azmy, the legal director for the Center for Constitutional Rights. The organization's legal team has advised Salaita as they consider potential legal avenues. In October 2013, the university offered Salaita a tenured position in the American Indian Studies program, which Salaita accepted, according to Azmy. But on August 1, 2014, Salaita received a letter from Chancellor Dr. Phyllis Wise terminating the appointment. By then, Azmy said, Salaita had resigned from his tenured position at Virginia Tech, rented his home in Virginia and was preparing to move his family to Illinois. Virginia Tech Department Chair Joseph Eska confirmed Salaita had resigned and would not be returning in the fall. According to University of Illinois protocol, once an offer is made, the chancellor's office must make a recommendation to the board of trustees for final authorization. Azmy said Wise rescinded the offer before it went to the board. Azmy said he believes the reason was Salaita's ""political expressions"" in social media. Salaita's Twitter feed includes messages like ""#Israel's message to #Obama and #Kerry: we'll kill as many Palestinians as we want, when we want. p.s.: f--- you, pay me. #Gaza"" Another post reads, ""Only #Israel can murder around 300 children in the span of a few weeks and insist that it is the victim. #Gaza #GazaUnderAttack"" University spokeswoman Robin Neal Kaler said, ""As a matter of university policy and practice, we do not comment publicly upon nor discuss generally any personnel matters, including matters involving employment or tenure."" In an open letter sent to Wise, Azmy cites ""viewpoint discrimination"" as the reason for the dismissal, calling it a ""serious First Amendment violation."" ""He resigned from a job that gave him tenure, the pinnacle of academic achievement, with the expectation that he would have tenure at the next university and it was taken away in an unlawfully retaliatory way for his political views,"" Azmy said. CNN was not able to reach Salaita but spoke to his wife, who declined to comment other than to confirm her husband had been consulting with Azmy. CNN also was unable to reach Wise for comment. Neal Kaler did not clarify why last month she defended Salaita's right to tweet his views during an interview with The News-Gazette, a local newspaper. She said then, ""Faculty have a wide range of scholarly and political views, and we recognize the freedom of speech rights of all of our employees."" Salaita's controversial views were no secret at the time the university made him an offer. He is the author of six books, including ""Israel's Dead Soul"" and the ""Anti-Arab Racism in the USA."" Salaita's opinions, Azmy said, constitute the basis for his scholarly research, which was the reason he was offered the position to begin with. Salaita believed the principles of academic freedom ""would permit him to share his views without fear of censure or reprisal,"" said Azmy. Wise's move to block the appointment has drawn criticism and support. Cary Nelson, a longtime English professor at the university and a past president of the American Association of University Professors, supported Wise. He said, ""I believe the decision not to offer him a job was the right one."" ""I find many of his tweets quite loathsome â€”as well as sophomoric and irresponsible,"" he said, adding that ""while universities need to study all positions on an issue, even the most outrageous ones, I see no good reason to offer a permanent faculty position to someone whose discourse crosses the line into anti-Semitism."" Nelson has written on the topic of academic freedom in the past. In an essay posted on his website, he said academic freedom ""is the principle that guarantees faculty members the right to speak and write as they please without interference from the university, the state, or the public."" The Illinois Conference Committee A on Academic Freedom and Tenure of the American Association of University Professors released a statement supporting Salaita. ""Professor Salaita's words while strident and vulgar were an impassioned plea to end the violence currently taking place in the Middle East,"" the statement read. ""The University of Illinois cannot cancel an appointment based upon Twitter statements that are protected speech in the United States of America."" A Change.org petition created by an American professor of Palestinian descent in support of Salaita had garnered over 11,000 signatures. Azmy said he had not received a response from Wise. Meanwhile Salaita's professional future remained in limbo. ""I don't think he knows what he is going to do,"" Azmy said. ""He is a scholar and scholars should be in university setting.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Additional U.S. military advisers are now on the ground in northern Iraq with the Obama administration considering a possible air evacuation of thousands of minority Yazidis under threat from Islamic State militants and trapped on Mount Sinjar. President Barack Obama ordered nearly 130 advisers to Irbil to assess the situation, and it's now likely that a small number of them will travel to the mountain area to get a first-hand look at what might be possible. The new group comprised of Marines and special forces adds to the hundreds of other American advisers already in the country advising Iraqi troops in their fight against Sunni militants from the Islamic State, an al Qaeda off-shoot formally known as ISIS. The group has waged a brutal campaign while seizing large areas of territory this year in Iraq. It's aiming to establish a caliphate. Hundreds of thousands of Iraq's ethnic and religious minorities have fled ISIS fighters. Nowhere is the crisis more evident than the Sinjar Mountains, where an estimated 40,000 minority Yazidis are hiding. The plight of the Yazidis, coupled with the ISIS assault against Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region, prompted the United States to begin targeted airstrikes over the past several days. The aim, according to Obama, is to help protect U.S. personnel in the area and to destroy ISIS positions around the mountains to ease the threat to minority groups. Air evacuation option . Obama has also authorized humanitarian airdrops to help the Yazidis, and is now weighing an air evacuation, a U.S. official told CNN on Wednesday. Focusing on a possible air option -- rather than a ground one -- is due to initial indications that going by land would take too long would up the risk to the Yazidis, according to the official who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and asked not to be named. In addition, many of the stranded Yazidis are in poor medical condition to make a lengthy journey, the official said. However, American officials did say that a ground option is still under consideration as well. If an air operation is proposed and approved by Obama, it would require putting U.S. ground troops both on the mountain and at a nearby airfield, the official said. The operation will be characterized as a short-term humanitarian mission, not a combat one. But U.S. troops would have the right to defend themselves against any ISIS attacks. As part of an air evacuation, American forces would establish a security corridor around the area to try to provide airspace for helicopters and other aircraft to pick up people. The newly arrived advisers would form the beginning of a joint task force to carry out such an operation, the official said. They would work to develop procedures for rescuing and then processing people taken off the mountain. But there are still several unresolved questions -- such as, where will the Yazidis be flown to? Asked about a potential evacuation operation on CNN's ""New Day,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said he didn't ""want to get too far out in front"" of any potential scenarios. ""We shouldn't be jumping to a conclusion right now that there is or won't be a rescue operation in particular,"" he said.","Washington is looking at options for evacuating Yazidi refugees .

"Washington (CNN) -- The federal government said Monday it is proceeding with a plan to require gun dealers in four Southwest border states -- California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas -- to report the sales of high-power rifles under certain conditions in an effort to stem the flow of guns to Mexican drug cartels. Critics immediately called the move an illegal expansion of gun-control laws and an effort to divert attention from the ""Operation Fast and Furious"" gun controversy. And the National Rifle Association said it will file suit to stop the move. Under the new policy, gun dealers in the four border states will have the same reporting requirements for certain long guns that gun dealers nationwide currently have for hand guns. They will be required to give purchaser information to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) if someone purchases two or more semi-automatic rifles in a five-day period, but only if the guns are greater than .22 caliber and have the ability to accept a detachable magazine. If no investigative leads result from the information, the information will be purged in two years. Deputy Attorney General James Cole said in a statement the new rule is tailored to focus on guns that ""are highly sought after"" by criminal organizations near the border. The rule, he said, ""will improve the ability of the (ATF) to detect and disrupt the illegal weapons transfers"" from gun buyers in the U.S. to drug traffickers in Mexico and along the border. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, praised the action, saying ATF agents testified to Congress recently they needed the ability to track weapons to disrupt the cartels. Brady Campaign Acting President Dennis Henigan urged President Barack Obama ""to do all in his power to protect this valuable new initiative from the gun lobby's inevitable efforts to attack it in Congress and the courts."" He also called for stricter laws to prevent trafficking in the first place. But critics called the action a ""diversionary tactic"" to take attention away from Congress's ongoing investigation into the ""Fast and Furious"" program, in which the ATF allowed people suspected of being straw-purchasers of weapons to sell their weapons, hoping to build bigger cases against Mexican criminal organizations. ""This political maneuver seems designed to protect the careers of political appointees at the Justice Department and not public safety,"" Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, said in a statement. The National Rifle Association agreed. ""This (Fast and Furious) has become a full-blown scandal, and I think they're trying to change the subject from Fast and Furious to something else,"" said NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre. LaPierre said the action defies the clear intent of Congress regarding the reporting of gun sales. ""What you've got here is the Obama administration stepping into the shoes of Congress and essentially legislating,"" LaPierre said. ""We are immediately filing lawsuit in federal courts."" LaPierre said the NRA would file suit as soon as the ATF delivers the first ""demand letter"" requiring a licensee to report the sale of a long gun. LaPierre said the new rule is ""an attempt to inch President Obama's (anti-gun) agenda down the road. Once they get into four states, they'll expand it to Tennessee, Rhode Island, Wyoming. I think it's a nose in the tent,"" he said. The long-gun reporting proposal pre-dates disclosures about the ""Fast and Furious"" controversy. The ATF first published the proposal in the Federal Register, seeking public comment, on Dec. 17, 2010, and published a second notice on April 29, 2011, requesting public comments for 30 days. But critics said the administration moved forward with the proposal to re-frame the ""Fast and Furious"" debate. Rep. Cummings, meanwhile, said he plans to introduce legislation with Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, to establish a dedicated firearms trafficking statute ""to provide law enforcement with an additional tool to combat gun traffickers."" Cummings issued a report last month that recommended ATF collect reports of multiple long gun sales.","The policy applies to gun dealers in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least 17 people died Tuesday when two car bombs exploded in central Baghdad, police in the Iraqi capital said. One of the blasts occurred near the emergency police department headquarters in al-Andalus Square, and seven police officers were among the dead. Another blast occurred minutes later outside an Iraqi passport office two kilometers (slightly more than a mile) away. At least 110 people, including 21 police officers, were wounded in the two explosions, which occurred in separate locations in central Baghdad's Karrada district, police said. The area is a predominantly Shiite district and busy shopping area. After the bombings, three people authorities described as suicide bombers went into a building near the police department that houses a federal security unit, the major crimes directorate. Security forces shot and killed one of the suspects. Another blew himself up and gunfire was heard after the explosion. The third person was inside the building and forces searching for the person sealed off the area. Police say they believe the three were planning to break into a detention center to free people affiliated with the al Qaeda in Iraq militant group. In the northern city of Mosul, gunmen barged into the house of a TV journalist, killing him and wounding his family members, police said. He was identified as Ghazwan Anas, 29, a presenter for Sama al-Mosul Satellite Television. The incident occurred as the family was eating after ending their Ramadan fast. No immediate motive was known, and police are investigating. Opinion: Violence in Iraq? It's the politics, stupid! At least 103 people were killed on July 23 in coordinated attacks across the country, the deadliest day in Iraq this year. Violence has dropped dramatically in Iraq since the peak of Sunni-Shiite clashes in 2006 and 2007 and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country in December. But insurgent attacks against civilians and security forces persist in the country, still smoldering with sectarian tension and political infighting.

"(CNN) -- A few weeks ago, my 11-year-old daughter was cut from her travel soccer team. Two years ago this month, my son wasn't accepted into the sixth-grade honors math. Was I disappointed? Absolutely. Bitter? Definitely. But after initially reeling from both of these losses, I learned to embrace the failure. Parents are hardwired to want their kids to succeed. It's probably biologically rooted in our ultimate survival. In an earlier evolutionary period, failure was fatal. Today, failure is not making a competitive sports team, a select program or the college of your choice. We are the generation of drone parents hovering above and swaddling our kids in bubble wrap so they don't get hurt when they fall. In fact, we do everything possible to not let them fall. In an uber-competitive age where we exhaust ourselves in the pursuit of perfection for our children, even from the womb, parents have bought into the myth of how to turn out successful people. We are living in a world of tutors, private lessons and specialized coaching, thoroughly believing that with all the right scaffolding, we can guarantee our kids WILL soar. Ironically, at a time when our parenting culture is all about ensuring success, the innovative business culture of Silicon Valley celebrates failure. New York Magazine recently had a cover story called ""The Failure Fetish of Silicon Valley."" There are books, blogs and even conferences devoted to embracing the flop. There's no stigma or shame. In fact, a failed venture is a notch in the belt, an honor of distinction, a bragging right. The founder of a start-up that goes belly up may even be courted to take the helm of another company. They turn failure into a rite of passage among the best and the brightest. Reinvent and move on -- that's the ethos of enterprising entrepreneurs today and perhaps that is a great lesson for parents, too. As the economy has shifted from an industrial to information one, experimentation is key. The ability to pivot, shift and keep trying is critical. Failure is an inevitable part of that process. ""Agility is the new smart,"" says Annmarie Neal, founder of the Center for Leadership Innovation. Neal is a trained psychologist, former chief talent officer at Cisco and author of ""Leading from the Edge: Global Executives Share Strategies for Success."" She is also a mother of an 11-year-old son. Neal says that in today's economy, the secret sauce for kids' future success is to raise children in an environment where they are encouraged to test boundaries, engage with the world, and yes, even fail. ""If you haven't failed, then you haven't significantly learned anything to be able to move to the next stage,"" Neal said. ""When kids don't learn how to fail, it creates a neurotic energy around perfectionism. They get stuck in a loop around perfect and they lose that opportunity to learn from the experience."" Failing spectacularly is probably not what we are hoping for when it comes to our vision for our children. Personally, it's painful to flop and watching our own kids struggle can be heartbreaking. Two years ago, when I got the letter that my son didn't make it into the honors math class in sixth grade, not only was he crushed -- I, too, spent the summer miserable that he would not be in the coveted math class. But my son worked hard that year and was promoted to honors math in seventh grade. Recently, my son's honors math teacher told me that the kids who try the hardest in her class are those who weren't in the sixth-grade class. The kids who got bumped up into honors just continue to work harder. This is when I realized that failing fast could ultimately pay off, not only in an entrepreneurial environment, but for our children, too. We don't want our kids to be paralyzed by the fear of failure. To succeed in a world where innovation and creativity is the new currency, we want our kids to have the courage to try to push limits and take risks. ""The world is so flat and the competitive landscape has changed,"" says David Roth, CEO and founder of the technology company AppFirst. He is also the father of two girls, one of whom just found out that she was cut from her high school travel softball team. ""Kids need to learn lessons on how to work through this stuff and not become stressed out or paralyzed. We don't want them giving up their dreams. We also need to create some toughness and mental skills around having to navigate disappointment so failure is not crushing."" When Roth hires employees, one of the things he looks for are people who can own their mistakes and not hide them. He's found that among Millennials he's hiring now, the ones afraid to fail or admit failure are the ones who don't survive at his company. ""The more disruptive, innovative and game changing of an environment that you are trying to create, the more you need personalities that can try to work through it and deal with falling down,"" Roth says. This is the culture of the changing economy. When our travel soccer league merged two teams into one a few weeks ago, nearly one-third of the girls were cut. At first, none of the parents wanted to tell their daughters the devastating news. We were scrambling to see if we could create a second team by pulling players from other places, all to avoid the disappointing truth that our daughters were no longer on the team. Within a couple of days, I decided to take our girls and join a local recreational soccer team that was competitive and had some great parent coaches. Pick up and move on -- that's what I advised my fellow parents. I also thought this was a teachable moment for my own daughter. ""Resiliency and flexibility and the ability to adapt to the world is more important than ever,"" Neal said. Failure has never felt so good. How have you helped your kids through failure?

"Washington (CNN) -- Long before computers or televisions existed, a man who would become a U.S. senator and then president started an affair with his neighbor's wife. Even telephones were relatively new back then, so Warren Harding wrote Carrie Phillips smoldering love letters during their 15-year relationship that ended prior to his inauguration in 1921. ""I love you more than all the world, and have no hope of reward on Earth or hereafter, so precious as that in your dear arms, in your thrilling lips, in your matchless breasts, in your incomparable embrace,"" said a 1910 letter first revealed in the book ""The Harding Affair"" by James David Robenalt. Snail mail . Almost a century later, the snail mail between Harding and Phillips becomes fully public later this month, revealing the most intimate secrets and thoughts of a man destined for the pinnacle of power as America endured the First World War. In his book, Robenalt examines the possible historical impacts of the affair, noting that Phillips may have spied for Germany and influenced Harding against running for president in 1916 as the war approached. ""The Harding Affair"" ""There's that sex steamy side to these letters,"" he told CNN in an interview Monday. ""But there's also the big question of whether the United States should get involved in the First World War. They really debated that back and forth. She was really pro-German, he was very pro-American."" Of equal interest, especially in the modern era of celebrity scandal mongering, is the pure salaciousness of the letters' content. ""They really are very graphic love letters,"" said Robenalt, who came across them while researching his 2009 book. ""And people think that 100 years ago nobody had sex fantasies and I keep telling people if those people didn't have sex fantasies, we wouldn't be here today."" Keeping such a secret seems impossible in today's digitally monitored world. Not so back in 1905, a decade before the first coast-to-coast long distance phone call. Salacious details . As outlined by Robenalt's book, Harding was married at the time and serving as Ohio's lieutenant governor. He recommended that his friend and neighbor Jim Phillips, Carrie's husband, go to a sanitarium that spring to help recover from the death of their 4-year-old son a year earlier. Meanwhile, Harding's wife Florence was recovering from a kidney disease. By August, Harding's affair with Carrie commenced, though it only became physical three years later, according to Robenalt's book. ""I do love you so,"" he wrote in 1913, two years before his election as Republican senator from Ohio. "" I wonder if you realize how muchâ€”how faithfully, how gladly, how reverently, how wistfully, how whole-heartedly and how passionately. Yes, you do know the last, you must have felt the proof, but you can't know the others."" The same letter also showed Harding's concern about the affair being discovered, long before the Internet age. ""I have been thinking of all those letters you have,"" wrote, adding that ""I think you have a fire, chuck 'em! Do. You must. If there is one impassioned one that appeals to you, keep it until you are tired of it, but chuck the rest. Why it frightens me to think I ever dared mail them to your address."" By 1916, circumstances had changed, according to another letter. From ""enraptured bliss"" to ""depths of anxiety"" ""It is a little more than thirty-six hours since I saw you, and they have all been given to you, amid the perturbation I could not shake off,"" Harding wrote after what Robenalt said was a secret visit to Phillips in Marion, Ohio. ""If you designed to punish me you have succeeded fully,"" the letter continued. ""I came with heart a hungering, I knew the flight to enraptured bliss, and was then suddenly plunged to the depths of anxiety."" The problem? Someone named Robinson, described by Robenalt as a rival lover, came to Marion. ""I had feared for a year, but would not surrender,"" Harding's letter continued. ""I know now of my failure. I sought the impossible, and I am defeated."" Robenalt noted the influence of the pending war at that time. ""He ultimately voted for war,"" the author said of Harding. ""He knew that it would probably ruin their relationship, and kill him politically in a state that had a lot of German-Americans."" The affair ended four years later, as Harding ran for president in an election he won easily over Democrat James Cox. He didn't survive his first term, dying of illness in 1923. In a recent statement, the Library of Congress announced it would make the more than 1,000 pages of love letters public on July 29, with a discussion about them scheduled for July 22 in the Mumford Room of the James Madison Building in Washington.

"Santa Cruz, California (CNN) -- The arrest of Alix Catherine Tichelman in the death of a Google executive has shed a new light on the so-called sugar daddy websites where women are paid, sometimes thousands of dollars a month, by older suitors for their company. Tichelman, 26, is suspected in the death of Forrest Timothy Hayes, 51, a married father of five who was found dead in November on his 50-foot yacht. On Wednesday, she pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and other charges in a Santa Cruz County, California, court. Her defense asked that she be released on her own recognizance, but a judge said no because he was ""uncertain"" that she would return to court. Her family was in the courtroom. The judge also denied a request to reduce her bond, which remains at $1.5 million. She went back into custody, and her next court appearance is October 20. Authorities say Tichelman gave Hayes an injection of heroin and then, as he began to die, she sipped her wine, gathered her belongings and walked away. Prosecutors say the pair met through a site called Seeking Arrangement, which bills itself as ""the leading Sugar Daddy dating site where over 3 million members fuel mutually beneficial relationships on their terms."" And what are those terms? ""The women who are on the site, or as we call them 'sugar babies,' are looking for men who can provide financial assistance for them,"" said Angela Jacob Bermudo with Seeking Arrangement. ""Aside from that, they're also looking for men who can help them in terms of mentorship, whether it's to find their own independence in the professional world or ... with providing life guidance."" CNN talked to one such woman. For sugar baby ""Bella,"" that financial assistance comes in the form of an allowance -- $3,000 to $5,000 a month. ""The way I see the allowance isn't anything more than enriching and empowering my life with something they have a lot of, their wealth,"" she said. It's been a profitable arrangement for college grad Bella, who has managed to cut her college debt in half over the last two years, knocking $30,000 off the total. ""I'm able to live the lifestyle I want without slaving for it,"" she said. ""I'm being taken care of by someone I truly care for and they're caring for me."" Georgia case reopened after alleged prostitute accused in yacht death . What about sex? Bella, 28, said she's only been intimate with two men. ""They only want to date you. It has nothing to do with intimacy per se,"" she said. ""They just want good conversation."" Critics say the sugar daddy sites are nothing but fronts for prostitution, one of the crimes Tichelman has been charged with. ""Seeking Arrangement is in no way or form a prostitution or escorting service,"" Bermudo said, instead calling it a dating website. ""We provide a quality platform for successful individuals as well as those looking to date a generous partner who is willing to help better their lifestyle."" Complicating matters, the exchange of funds isn't clearly visible and the website profiles don't necessarily solicit sex. ""I don't think that makes it legal in California or any other state where prostitution is illegal,"" said Mel Robbins, a CNN contributor. ""I just think it just makes it sticky to prosecute."" For the record, Seeking Arrangement doesn't say sex isn't involved. ""Just like traditional relationships you don't sign up and sex isn't part of the arrangement,"" Bermudo said. ""Certainly as with any healthy relationship, if both parties do become a little bit more connected and do decide they want to become more intimate, then that's up to the two consenting adults."" For Bella, there's a clear distinction between what she's doing and prostitution. ""An escort gets paid to leave,"" she said. ""I get a part of their wealth to see them again ... to give them a smile with a text before they sleep. I get paid to make them happy."" Death of Google executive . In the case of Tichelman, authorities say she had an ""ongoing prostitution relationship"" with Hayes. Online, Tichelman has boasted of having more than 200 client relationships. Security footage from Hayes' yacht shows her administer the heroin injection and what happened afterward, as he was dying, police say. ""Rather than provide first aid or call 911, Ms. Tichelman proceeds to gather her belongings including the heroin and needles,"" the police statement reads, adding that Tichelman stepped over Hayes' body several times. The video also shows Tichelman leaving the boat and then reaching back to lower a blind, concealing the victim's body from outside view, police say. How heroin kills you . Two months before Hayes died, Dean Riopelle, whom Tichelman identified online as her boyfriend, died at his home in Milton, Georgia. Tichelman was there at the time, and she called 911. The medical examiner ruled Riopelle's death an accidental overdose from heroin and alcohol. ""At the time, we never thought anything different,"" Capt. Shawn McCarty of Milton police said. Now authorities are taking a new look at that death ""to make sure there's nothing (else) to it,"" he said. Tennessee man accused of chopping up woman and eating her remains .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan federal authorities on Thursday dispatched their ""best investigators"" to track the kidnappers of Major League Baseball catcher Wilson Ramos, the country's justice minister said. Ramos, a rising star for the Washington Nationals, was snatched from his family home in central Venezuela by gunmen Wednesday night, a team spokeswoman said. The 24-year-old emerged as the Nationals' top catcher this past season. He had a .267 batting average with 15 home runs and 52 runs batted in. This past year was his rookie season, and he was back in his home country playing for the Aragua Tigers in Venezuela's winter league. The Nationals could not confirm the kidnapping, but they published a statement citing Tiger's spokeswoman Kathe Vilera. Ramos was kidnapped by four armed men from his home in Santa Ines, in Carabobo state, Vilera said on Twitter. ""It's sad, worrisome and true that Wilson Ramos was kidnapped,"" she wrote. The vehicle believed to have been used in the kidnapping was found in the town of Bejuma, about 60 miles from where Ramos was kidnapped, the country's justice and interior minister, Tareck El Aissami. ""The best investigators we have"" are on the case, he said. The federal agency in charge of the case said they had assembled the police sketches of two of the alleged kidnappers. ""Prudence and an even head are important in this difficult moment that the Ramos family is going through,"" Tigers President and General Manager Rafael Rodriguez said in a statement. ""With God's help we will end up well in this complicated situation."" Unlike most Latin American countries, it is not soccer that rules in Venezuela, but baseball. A number of Venezuelan players make it to the major leagues in the United States. But along with the success and paydays in the United States, Venezuelan natives and their families have faced threats at home. The targeting of baseball players by criminal groups is not unheard of in Venezuela, but Ramos' case could be the first time that a player himself was kidnapped. In 2009, the 11-year-old son of Texas Rangers catcher Yorvit Torrealba, as well as his brother-in-law, were kidnapped for ransom. The pair were released the next day, reportedly with no ransom paid. Former major league pitcher Victor Zambrano's mother was also kidnapped that year, and rescued in a police operation. The brother of Arizona Diamondbacks catcher Henry Blanco was kidnapped and killed in 2008. The trend of Venezuelan ballplayers being at risk goes back at least to 2005, when the mother of former big-league pitcher Ugueth Urbina, was kidnapped and held captive for months. The FBI on Thursday informed the government of Venezuela that it is prepared to assist in Ramos' case if asked to, an FBI spokesman said. So far the government of President Hugo Chavez has not requested U.S. assistance. Currently the FBI is not involved because Ramos is not a U.S. citizen and the crime did not occur in the United States, so Washington authorities have no jurisdiction to investigate the case unless asked. The U.S. State Department has warned of the increasing cases of kidnappings in Venezuela. In 2009, the number of reported kidnappings in the country doubled from the previous year, and police admit that many cases don't get reported.

"(CNN) -- In Kenya's Tsavo East national park, a herd of elephants take up water in their trunks and squirt it on their backs. Some wade and stomp in the shallow pool of muddy water -- the coolness is a sweet relief from the baking savannah heat. As the sun begins to dip behind the hills, they form a single file and lumber slowly into the distance, lucky to be alive. At the beginning of the year, 12 elephants were slaughtered in this park by poachers and stripped of their tusks. It was Kenya's single biggest killing of elephants in the last two decades. According to the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), so far this year a further 200 elephants have been killed across the country for their ivory. Reports by the KWS say that in the early 1970s the elephant population stood at an estimated 167,000, but in just five decades, it has plummeted to slightly more than 35,000. Read more: Drone to spy on rhino poachers . Conservationists warn that if the trend continues, in 10 years, elephants in Kenya will be wiped out. Robert Obrein, an assistant director at KWS, showed CNN what they call the ""elephant graveyard."" This section of the park has rows and rows of old elephant skulls and jaws -- a memorial site for elephants that died from drought and at the hands of poachers. ""This is just part of maybe a quarter of what is out there,"" says Obrein. ""These are hundreds of elephants, hundreds of elephants -- dead."" Kenya's park rangers number just over 2,800, a paltry number compared to the vast scale of parks and conservation areas they need to protect from intruders. ""I am overwhelmed, the rangers are overwhelmed"", said Obrein. ""Sometimes you can't even send rangers on leave, you can't even send them off duty."" Poaching is propelled by a growing demand for ivory in Asian countries such as China and Thailand. The ivory confers status and people are willing to pay high prices for the illegal commodity. As the price for ivory soars in the black market, so does the number of poachers, and recently, they've become well armed and highly organized. Read more: Hong Kong seizes Nigerian container in major ivory bust . ""The guys are coming with different ways of doing jobs,"" said Obrein. ""They are coming with the night vision, they are coming in with silencers, and they are coming in with new weapons."" In an effort to combat the new caliber of poachers, the Kenya government recently commissioned a rapid response anti-poaching team; it consists of men drawn from various security agencies in the country. The highly militarized team is trained in laying ambush, shooting accurately and disarming poachers. But wildlife rights groups say more boots on the ground is not the solution to halting ivory poaching. They say creating awareness and teaching people about the importance of elephants as a national heritage is a more effective strategy. Wildlife Direct is a Kenya and U.S.-registered charitable organization that provides support to conservationists in Africa. It recently initiated an online campaign #HandsOffOurElephants to stop elephant poaching. Kenya's first lady, Margaret Kenyatta, is the ambassador of the campaign. She spoke to CNN about the campaign while she was visiting Tundani, her adopted baby elephant. The baby elephant lives at David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in Nairobi with other orphaned elephants. The orphans were rescued after their mothers were killed, usually by a poacher's bullet. ""Awareness is the start, pushing communities together, helping them to realize that, especially where they live together with the elephants, they can coexist"", said the first lady. ""They are not just part of Kenya's national heritage, they are part of Africa's national heritage and we can't afford to lose them. I mean, in 10 years' time, if there aren't any elephants left in the wild it would just be heartbreaking because you would just go to a zoo elsewhere to look at an elephant it would be heartbreaking,"" she added. Read more: Wildlife photography in Namibia . Once it takes effect, a new wildlife and conservation bill in Kenya will put in place stiffer penalties for poaching, especially poaching of endangered species. Allan Maina, a ranger with KWS for the past 12 years, says this new legislation will act as a key deterrent to not only poaching but other wildlife crimes. ""If you arrest somebody they look at our court system, I can say it's about the penalties,"" said Maina. ""We say an adult buffalo weighs about 250-300 kilos. If you sell that meat it's about 100 Kenya shillings per kilo. If you take that person to court, you will find that maybe the penalty will be about a fine of not exceeding 10,000 Kenya shillings. So tomorrow you will get the person again in the park -- poaching."" Tourism is the second largest source of Kenya's foreign exchange revenue. The visitors mostly come for tours to look at wildlife in the national parks and game reserves. Park rangers such as Maina understand only too well the critical role they play in conserving this national asset. And he remains hopeful about victory. ""We are hoping that even in the years to come, in 15 years tourists will be coming and seeing the animals,"" he said. ""The efforts we are putting, we feel like we are going to win the war of poachers.""","Kenya's elephants are under threat from poachers .

"(CNN) -- Unlike their Western counterparts, Africans take elections very seriously -- rising up early to queue patiently in line for hours under the hot sun and cast their ballots. Any misguided attempt to nullify or steal their votes will evoke a strong reaction from them. In fact, it explains why the destruction of an African country often begins with a dispute over the electoral process or transfer of power. In recent years, allegations of electoral fraud have stirred political violence and civil war, causing death and destruction in Ethiopia (2005), Kenya (2007), Zimbabwe (2008), DR Congo (2011), among others. The adamant refusal of their respective leaders to relinquish or share power damaged or destroyed these African countries: Liberia (1990), Somalia (1991), Rwanda (1994), Zaire, now Congo DR, (1993), Sierra Leone (1998), Ivory Coast (2000, 2011), Egypt (2011), Libya (2011). This largely motivated Mo Ibrahim, the telecoms billionaire mogul, to offer a $5 million prize to any African leader who shows ""excellent leadership"" and who steps down peacefully when his term expires or loses an election. This year -- and for the third time since the inception of the prize in 2006 -- he found no eligible recipient. Read related: Can Ghana's economy prosper against the odds? Though none of its leaders has won the prize, Ghana has successfully held elections and transferred power on five occasions since 1992 without imploding -- unlike its Western neighbor, Ivory Coast. What are the secrets to Ghana's democratic success or maturity that other African countries can learn from? Four factors account for this. The first is the existence of a free media; in particular, print and broadcast media. In Africa, radio is the life and death of information transmission and the proliferation of FM radio stations in Ghana provided an invaluable tool to expose problems, hold government accountable and ensure transparent elections. In the 2000 elections, for example, FM Radio stations sent their reporters to every polling station. Anything suspicious or unseemly was immediately reported on the air, leading electoral officers and observers to rush to the scene and fix the problem on the spot. Watch: Media's role in Ghanaian politics . They did not have to wait months for a voluminous report to expose the problem, by which time it would have been too late. Thus, the FM Radio stations ensured a level of transparency seldom seen in African elections. So impressed was New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, that he wrote: ""Let's stop sending Africa lectures on democracy. Let's instead make all aid, all IMF-World Bank loans, all debt relief conditional on African governments permitting free FM radio stations. Africans will do the rest,"" he wrote. Sadly, Africans have not been able to do the rest because, currently, only 10 of the 54 African countries have a free media. In Ethiopia, for example, there is only one government-controlled television network for 83 million people. The second factor has been the existence of vibrant and vigilant civil society groups and NGOs -- all made possible by freedom of association, of expression and movement, as well as improvements in communication technology such as cell phones and text messaging. There are hordes of NGOs -- promoting a diverse range of issues such as good governance combating corruption, among others. Some have been formed specifically to oversee the December 7 elections. One with impressive credentials is the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), which organized the presidential debates. The IEA also facilitated the crafting of a ""Political Parties Code of Conduct"" and the setting up of a National Enforcement Body to enforce the code. Eight parties have signed on. The code ensures that the political parties behave responsibly and can be held liable for any unlawful or unethical acts they commit. Nearly all civil society groups, including religious leaders have been preaching peaceful elections. Even former president Jerry Rawlings, the architect of ""macho-men"" violence in the past, is now campaigning -- not for any political party candidate -- but for peace. Read related: Ghana farmers lose out in gold mining boom . To this group may be added Ghanaians in the diaspora, who have a passionate interest in the affairs of their home country. Last year, they reportedly sent more than $14.5 billion in remittances. They can shape and influence political opinion, as well as support various political candidates. With access to the foreign media, governments and institutions, they can raise a stink over electoral shenanigans in Ghana. In most other African countries, the space for civic activism is severely restricted. In Ethiopia, journalists critical of the government have been branded ""terrorists"" and jailed. There is no privately-owned news media left in Eritrea, the ""North Korea"" of Africa, and one can be jailed in Zimbabwe for insulting the president. By contrast, Ghanaian presidents expect to be insulted. The third important factor has been the maturing of political leaders, which was stupendously displayed in the 2008 elections, which the ruling NDC party won by a mere 40,000-vote margin. Elsewhere on the continent, an election that close would have spelled trouble -- angry calls for a recount and descent into violence. But Nana Akuffo-Addo, the losing candidate and now a contender, graciously conceded defeat. Having hosted refugees fleeing political violence and mayhem in neighboring countries, Ghanaian politicians and the people are now well aware of the destructive consequences an irresponsible political decision may cause. Political maturity was also on full display following the death of former president John Atta-Mills in July. Not only was the transition to a new president extraordinarily smooth but Ghanaians of all shades and stripes, buried their differences and came together to grieve over their departed president. A violent and chaotic election this week would dishonor his memory. A nod should also be given to regional leaders, in particular those of Ghana's neighbors. Borders are porous in Africa and violence in one country can send refugees streaming across the border. Ghana has hosted refugees from civil wars in Liberia and Ivory Coast. In the past, regional leaders have also helped ensure free, fair and transparent elections in Ghana. For example, for the 2000 elections, the former and late president of Togo, Gnassingbe Eyadema, closed the Ghana/Togo border to prevent some of his citizens from crossing it to vote illegally in Ghana's elections. The fourth factor has been sheer luck. Ghana was fortunate to have one of its sons, Kofi Annan, serve as the United Nations Secretary-General (1997-2006) and co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. During his tenure, he hop-scotched around the world, trying to end conflicts, douse political flames. He is the first on call when a country implodes to broker a peace deal -- Kenya (2007), Syria (2011), etc. Imagine Annan telling combatants in Kenya and Syria to bury their differences when his own country is on fire with politicians at each other's throat. Kofi Annan has an NGO in Accra and plays an important role in ensuring peaceful elections in Ghana. Though other African countries may not have a ""Kofi Annan,"" the other three factors are still potent in ensuring free, fair and peaceful elections. Alarm bells have been sounded over the possibility of massive fraud in the December 7 elections. But, given the current atmosphere in Ghana, it would be foolhardy for any politician to even dream of committing fraud in Friday's elections -- unless he wants to commit political suicide. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of George Ayittey.","Ghana heads to the polls on December 7 .

"(CNN) -- The Venezuelan oil refinery whose explosions killed 42 people suffers mismanagement, delays in major maintenance and underinvestment, according to analysts and an engineering firm's recent report. The state-run oil company that operates the refinery has been hampered by how Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez uses the refineries as ""a cash cow"" to fund social programs such as building homes for low-income voters, taking funds away from plant improvements, an analyst said. Venezuela is one of the world's largest oil exporters. The fires at the Amuay refinery since Saturday have been described as ""the most lethal industry accident in Venezuela to date"" by analysts and come as the country faces other infrastructure problems, apparently because of a lack of maintenance, including a bridge collapse in Caracas, analysts said. The United Socialist Party of Venezuela said this week, however, that the 197-foot bridge was rebuilt in record time. New tank burns at Venezuela refinery; death toll revised down . In the aftermath of the fires, the government's refinery manager said the explosion wasn't due to a lack of maintenance, according to government television. Chavez has also said that such suggestions are ""irresponsible"" because investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the accident. The Venezuelan embassy in Washington and the state-run oil company. Petroleos de Venezuela, didn't have an immediate comment Wednesday. Earlier this year, an engineering firm's inspection of the giant Paraguana refinery complex in Falcon state, which includes the Amuay plant, found problems in major and routine maintenance, according to a March 2012 report prepared by RJG Risk Engineering of London. The report also said 100 fires occurred in 2011 at the refinery complex, which includes a second refinery called Cardon. The Amuay refinery is one of the world's largest, producing more than 1 million barrels per day, according to OPEC. The engineer firm's report was circulated on the Internet, and CNN confirmed its authenticity through a source who had a copy of the original. ""Overall, we see some positive progress, although we continue to rate this large refinery complex as 'in need of improvement' as in 2010,"" the report said. ""A stronger 'proactive' approach is necessary in our opinion. ""Major maintenance (turnarounds) has been seen to be suffering from delays, typically of one or two years,"" the report said. ""Routine maintenance suffered a significant 'low' in 2009, the effects of which are still being felt, evidenced by a marked increase in the ratio of corrective to preventive maintenance,"" the study said. ""The effects are also evident in the maintenance backlog particularly for pumps and motors, and in a higher than target proportion of 'Emergency' and 'Urgent' work orders."" The deadly incidents at Venezuela's largest refinery highlight serious problems at the state-run refineries and are ""a reminder of the bleak outlook for the company's declining production and investment capacity,"" said the analysis firm Eurasia Group in a note Wednesday to investors and media. The firm conducts global political risk research and consulting. Chavez is up for re-election in October, and while the accident is ""not a game changer,"" it could help boost the chances of opposition candidate Henrique Capriles, the analysis firm said. The state-run oil company is faced with ""significant operational problems stemming from both severe mismanagement and underinvestment,"" the analysts said. When Chavez overhauled the oil company in recent years, he fired numerous senior managers and experts with technical know-how, said Eurasia Group analyst Risa Grais-Targow. At the same time, the company has taken on more responsibilities, as Chavez uses oil revenues for subsidies to the elderly and families with children, among other programs, Grais-Targow said. ""The company has been stretched in a lot of different directions, and they don't have the money to make the investments they need,"" especially in the past two years as Chavez has prepared for this fall's elections, Grais-Targow said. ""He's really been doling out money, and a lot of the money has been coming from PDVSA's funds,"" Grais-Targow said. ""It's turning out to be the cash cow for the government."" The engineering firm's report was prepared at the request of the oil company's underwriters and examined progress made on recommendations by the underwriters' risk engineers during their survey visits in 1993, 2002, 2005, 2007 and 2010, the study said. At the time of the March assessment, the refinery complex was faced with 46 action items, and the engineering firm found that 11 of them had ""no progress,"" 19 were ""in progress,"" and 16 were completed, the report said. The report also found 222 reported incidents at the two refineries, ""including some 100 fires, many of these being in contaminated pipe trenches,"" the report said. ""Although there is a good procedure for incident investigation, we were disappointed to not(e) that few had progressed past the stage of setting up a study committee, and only nine were 'closed', with recommendations carried out,"" the report said. Among those killed at the Amuay fires were 18 members of the national guard and 15 civilians, officials said.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraq's civilian death toll lingered at more than 4,000 for the third straight year in 2011, a sign of the country's ""persistent low-level conflict,"" according to a public online database. A total of 4,063 civilians died violent deaths in 2011, according to the Iraq Body Count website. The figure is only a slight change from site's tally of 4,045 civilian deaths in 2010 and down by 650 from its 2009 number. ""There has now been no noticeable downward trend since mid-2009,"" the site reported in an analysis released Monday. ""As observed in IBC's previous annual report, recent trends indicate a persistent low-level conflict in Iraq that will continue to kill civilians at a similar rate for years to come."" Iraq Body Count is an independent public database that uses media reports as well as figures from hospitals, morgues, nongovernmental organizations and official statements. Official Iraqi government figures are typically lower, and getting an accurate picture of the Iraq war toll is difficult at best. The site has tracked Iraqi civilian deaths since the U.S. invasion in March 2003. Though the war's bloodiest years were 2006 and 2007, sporadic attacks on government installations, civilians and other targets continued throughout 2011. For example, a suicide car bomber hit the entrance to Baghdad's heavily fortified Interior Ministry compound on December 26, killing at least five people and wounding more than three dozen others. And nearly 70 people were killed and 200-plus wounded in a string of bombings that targeted mixed Sunni-Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad four days earlier. While the number of Iraqis killed by U.S. and allied forces has declined since 2009, when American troops pulled back from Iraq's cities, ""the rate caused by Iraqi state forces has increased,"" the site noted. Deaths attributed to Iraqi soldiers and police rose to 140 in 2011, up from 96 the previous year, it reported. Iraq Body Count says between 104,000 and 114,000 Iraqi civilians have died since 2003. The last American troops left Iraq in December, and the site noted that ""time will tell"" whether the U.S. pullout will affect the numbers.

"(CNN) -- For decades, skyscrapers have served as iconic symbols of national pride or flashy trophies of corporate wealth, reshaping the skyline of the world's major urban centers. Perhaps in the future, the high-rise superstructures could also help revolutionize the way we travel. That, at least, is the fanciful concept behind the Vertical Hyper-Speed Train Hub, a futuristic proposal of two UK-based architects envisaging trains roaring up and down the side of specially-designed skyscrapers nearly as high as the Empire State Building. Towering above the crowded streets of future metropolises, these giant buildings are designed to minimize the large slices of real estate that major railway terminals occupy by flipping them on their side. The goal, designers Christopher Christophi and Lucas Mazarrasa say, is to free up valuable space in the densely-packed cities of tomorrow, which will be significantly challenged by overcrowding and a sharp drop in public space availability. ""In 60 years' time, it will be very difficult for governments to find attractive pieces of available land for public use in the heart of megacities,"" says Christophi, 27. ""Governments will be able to take advantage of such spaces in order to re-adapt the cities' structure to society needs,"" he adds. How it works . The designer's vertical station concept calls for a tall cylindrical skyscraper whose small footprint would allow the transformation of the surrounding area into an urban park. Passengers arriving at the tower would use a lift to make their way up into the platform and from there into their carriage, which could accommodate 10 people sat in two rows opposite each other. But, you might wonder by now, how could commuters stay on their feet whilst the train slides in hyper speeds along the huge tower's faÃ§ade? The main idea is that instead of traveling on normal rails beneath, the carriages would be supported by magnetic tracks running up the skyscraper's exterior. Each carriage proportion is designed as a cubical shape to enable it to function both vertically, when docked, and horizontally, while traveling After the train's departure, the wagons would pivot like a ""Ferris wheel,"" allowing commuters to remain in an upright position and enjoy breathtaking views of the city. Connecting cities . The radical proposal won the designers an Honorable Mention at this year's eVolo Skyscraper competition, which encouraged people from around the world to propose new ideas for vertical structures of the future. The designers say the towers, which would be capped off by a rooftop green plaza, are envisioned as individual pieces of infrastructure that could be replicated in cities around the world. The hope is to connect a new hyper-speed network of underground tunnels and overground routes where superfast trains would cover distances of 300 miles in 30 minutes. This, they claim, would not only save commuting time and simplify the way public transport is being used, but would also help to cut down CO2 emissions by replacing ways of transport powered by fossil fuels. ""Our conceptual design is based upon utilizing existing and viable technologies that can currently be seen in hyper speed rail networks, for example in China,"" says Mazarrasa, 29, adding that is a matter of time before we're able to reach the rail speeds their concept requires. ""The Maglev trains currently travel at 360 miles per hour -- this technology by the 2075 will in no doubt move leaps and bounds from what it already is today, making the hyper-speed trains probably the fastest and safest way of transporting goods and people."" Of course, there are a number of limitations to the project -- the proposal deals only with stations designed to accommodate city by city travel, not to mention efficiency issues around loading trains in high volume terminals and connecting train routes. Yet, like in most futuristic transport proposals, practical details are best to take a back seat for now to allow us to enjoy the thrilling ride -- that is, unless you're afraid of heights.","A futuristic proposal flips the traditional designs of today's major train stations vertically .

"(CNN) -- Last year on the 50th anniversary of the creation of the contraceptive pill its inventor Carl Djerassi spoke of the coming dramatic changes to reproductive options -- of the technologies that will have just as big an impact on society in the 50 years to come. After sex without reproduction, reproduction without sex. In an article in the UK's ""traditional values"" tabloid, the Daily Mail, titled ""A Terrifying Future for Female Fertility,"" Djerassi said, ""There are an enormous number of well-educated, proficient women who, when facing the biological clock, first pay attention to their professional ambitions...in the next 20 years, more young people will freeze their eggs and [sperm] in their 20s, and bank them for later use. They will do away with the need for contraception by being sterilised, and withdraw their eggs and sperm from the bank when they are ready to have a child via IVF."" That is certainly one option as we develop greater capabilities to store eggs more reliably and safely so that they are not damaged by the freezing/thawing process meant to preserve them. But in the next 20 years, there could be other developments on their way to the clinic. For example -- also to avert damage -- freezing strips of ovarian tissue instead of eggs, or tapping into recently identified reserves of ovarian stem cells that could be turned into a fresh supply of eggs for a woman, at any age; or even creating to order eggs (or sperm) from skin or bone marrow stem cells of men and women. Early experiments with mice have shown that both sperm and eggs can be generated from the stem cells of males, and eggs from that of females, and that they can be fertilized to produce viable young. Djerassi described the idea of being able to access healthy eggs later in life as something set to be a fundamental tool of family planning, and one that will empower women just as the pill has. He talked of female colleagues on tough career trajectories just at the time in their life when they are most fertile, and then on into the years leading into sterility. It's no coincidence in the decade of our life when we are most biologically capable of reproducing, men and women are also working full steam on their studies or on building their careers. In our 30s, fertility declines - after 35, exponentially so -- and specifically for women. Around age 50, while the rest of our faculties continue functioning beautifully, the ability to reproduce comes to an abrupt stop. There have recently been a spate of reports and discussions about equality -- the dearth of women in science, on the boards of top companies and of the pay gap that has yet to be bridged, but it is not clear that those taking part in this discussion fully appreciate that in pursuing in parallel the fulfilling goals of education, work and having a family, we are limited by both social and biological barriers. In achieving the hoped-for 40% of leadership positions being held by women, executive bodies like the European Commission and governments could, for example, legislate interventions like free or cheap childcare in all workplaces. However, only technology can tackle the biological brick wall of menopause, with all its detrimental effects on a woman's health, and especially at a time when she is likely to live another 50 years in this condition. In the quest for reproduction, only technology can give same-sex couples the chance of having their own genetic children. If eggs can be made from the stem cells of men, with the advent of an artificial womb (already in use for sharks, in development with mammals and projected to be in use for humans within 100 years), it will also give them an organ they currently have to pay surrogate mothers for the use of. So if it is to be the egalitarian society that we hope to see for ourselves and our children -- particularly our daughters, and those whose relationships and family choices still find themselves the topic of social and religious debate -- then technology that gives an individual the capability to generate healthy eggs and sperm from his/her own body and allows a baby to be gestated independently could offer us a more ethical option than what we do today. In our world, girls study just as hard as boys but face far more difficult choices once in the workplace. To make money, poor women from countries like India or the Ukraine ""donate"" eggs or their wombs, or churches refuse to marry gay couples because they cannot be fruitful and multiply. Freedom, power, choice? It's the alternative that sounds terrifying to me.

"Washington (CNN) -- Ten years after its formation, the Transportation Security Administration on Wednesday got the type of birthday card no one wants to receive -- a blistering report from Republican lawmakers who said the agency is ""bloated"" and ""inefficient"" and has done little, if anything, to improve aviation security. Rep. John Mica, R-Florida, a longtime critic who has fought to privatize TSA screening jobs, said Congress never intended the agency it created in November 2001 to ""mushroom"" into a workforce of 65,000 employees, ""top heavy"" with bureaucrats. ""I can tell you, in our wildest dreams ... no one ever envisioned 4,000 administrative personnel in Washington, D.C., making on average ... almost $104,000, and then nearly another 10,000 out in the field,"" Mica said. But the most scathing comment came from Rep. Paul Broun, R-Georgia. ""Americans have spent nearly $60 billion funding TSA and they are no safer today than they were before 9/11,"" Broun said. Pressed on the accuracy of that statement, Broun and Mica said the TSA has never stopped a terrorist attack, and gave credit to private citizens or others for terrorist plots disrupted thus far. ""Unfortunately, the focus has been diverted from security ... into managing a huge bureaucracy,"" Mica said. Broun concurred. ""We must focus on identifying terrorists and stopping them instead of patting down grandma and children. And we must stop worrying about political correctness,"" he said. ""TSA needs to put their resources into intelligence and technologies that can be more effective when it comes to catching highly elusive and dangerous terrorists."" The lawmakers said they are preparing legislation to reform the TSA. A TSA spokesman called the GOP report ""an unfortunate disservice to the dedicated men and women of TSA who are on the front lines every day protecting the traveling public."" The country's aviation system is ""safer, stronger, and more secure than it was 10 years ago,"" spokesman Greg Soule said. The agency has screened more than 5 billion passengers over the past decade, he said, and has prevented more than 1,100 guns from being brought onto passenger planes this year alone. Mica and Braun released the GOP report at a news conference held in the main concourse of Reagan-Washington National Airport. Their remarks criticizing the state of aviation security were amplified over a loudspeaker, and drew sidelong glances from passengers headed to airport checkpoints. One day earlier, TSA Administrator John Pistole stood in the same location to discuss holiday travel preparations, touting advancements in screening technology and saying passengers are happy with changes that have reduced the number of pat downs of children. The report released Wednesday was prepared by Republican staffers on House Transportation and Oversight committees. It is largely a compendium of earlier critical reports of the TSA, looking at its deployment of failed technology, such as puffer machines; the failure to interdict terrorists, such as 2001 ""shoe bomber"" Richard Reid and 2009 ""underwear bomber"" Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab""; and the lack of card readers for the 1.8 million ID cards issued to transportation workers. The report says the agency has grown nearly four-fold since its inception, from 16,500 workers to more than 65,000, while commercial passenger traffic has increased less than 12 percent. But a TSA spokesman said the agency had approximately 56,000 security officers in 2002, the year it started screening, and has approximately 52,000 today. The report by the Republicans contains 11 recommendations, saying the TSA must act with greater independence from the Department of Homeland Security, and the administrator's stature must be elevated. The TSA has become ""lost"" in the Homeland Security bureaucracy, Mica said. It also calls on the agency to contract out more screening jobs to private industry. Currently, 16 airports, including San Francisco International, have ""opted out"" of federal airport screening and use private screeners under what is known as the Screening Partnership Program. The screeners wear the same uniforms, use the same technology and follow the same procedures. Mica advocates the continued privatization of airport screening jobs, but administrator Pistole has been less supportive, at one point saying he would expand the program only if there was a clear advantage to doing so. In other TSA news, a travel industry group Wednesday said the agency's screening procedures remain ""inefficient and frustrating"" for travelers. The U.S. Travel Association released the results of an online survey it conducted last month of about 600 people. According to the survey, ""four of the top five air traveler frustrations relate to the checkpoint process,"" including the top frustration: ""People who bring too many carry-on bags through the security checkpoint."" But five of the 11 options on the survey pertained directly to TSA checkpoints, and the remaining options did not include some common irritants, such as excess baggage fees. The survey says 66.2 percent of air travelers are ""somewhat or very satisfied"" with the TSA's overall performance as it relates to security, 21.2 percent are neutral, and 12.5 percent are ""somewhat or very dissatisfied."" But frequent air travelers are less happy, with 54.6 percent ""somewhat or very satisfied."" The group said that despite the TSA's new initiatives to improve passenger screening, an ""overwhelming majority"" have not recognized any improvements in checkpoint efficiency when compared to the previous year. It said 81.8 percent plan to arrive at the airport the same amount of time before a flight as they did last year. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent. The TSA said it was pleased to see the vast majority of travelers polled believe the agency is moving in the right direction, and said checkpoint screening has gotten speedier, taking less than 20 minutes for more than 99 percent of passengers last year. ""The increased number of carry-on bags impacts our ability to further reduce wait times, but not the level of security we provide, which remains our priority,"" the agency said.","The Transportation Security Administration is top heavy, Rep. John Mica says .

"(CNN) -- For once in Hollywood, aging is seen as a majestic, magical thing. With the new movie ""Boyhood,"" writer/director Richard Linklater has created something wholly unusual: he took 12 years to film and finish the project, and its central conceit is watching a young boy, Mason, go from child to young man as his older sister and parents have their own maturation, too. Yet rather than tell the usual ""first"" stories, Linklater zeroes in on those moments in-between the typical life milestones, creating something that resonates as emotionally and visually authentic. Critics have fallen in love with the new release, which earned a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes. ""Boyhood"" will roll out slowly in select cities across the United States starting July 11. Star Ethan Hawke, who plays the dad in ""Boyhood's"" story, says it's truly unlike anything he's ever done -- and unlike anything you've ever seen. ""Everything is kind of in the spirit of something else,"" Hawke told CNN, listing some of his biggest hits. "" 'Dead Poets Society' is like 'Goodbye Mr. Chips,' ... 'Training Day' is like 'The French Connection,' 'Gattaca' is like 'Alphaville.' "" But ""Boyhood""? ""This isn't like anything,"" Hawke said. The 43-year-old actor plays the father of Mason, who's portrayed over the 12-year span by Ellar Coltrane. Patricia Arquette plays Mason's mom, and Linklater's daughter, Lorelei, plays Mason's older sister. ""I was trying to tell a story about growing up, and I couldn't really pick a moment ... all my ideas were spread over the years,"" Linklater told CNN. ""I'd kind of given up, (and) that's when this epiphany hit me: 'Oh, I could film a little bit (each year), that could work.' "" That is a long commitment, both for the actors and the filmmaker, but on the other hand, it's also a snapshot of the past 12 years of their lives, captured in the frames of a single film. For Arquette, that was one of the big draws. ""That's part of what I was excited about with the whole premise,"" she said. ""(M)e and Ethan would be getting older, and in Hollywood there is such a pressure to not age and you're supposed to look a certain way, and it's a false pretense. I wanted to really ignore all of that."" Watching the movie back is a bit surreal, Hawke added. ""It's a very strange thing -- the kids grow up and we age,"" he said. ""We are watching them bloom as we are watching us wilt, you know? It's powerful."" To create that effect, Arquette, Hawke and the rest of the cast had to put full trust in Linklater, since there wasn't a completed script. When Linklater pulled his cast together, there was no way of knowing what the future would hold for his characters. While most coming-of-age stories are set in a specific period and have a script that can detail that story from the outset of production, Linklater's had to leave an ""openness"" to it, Arquette said. ""Maybe in 12 years we'd have a war and kids would be having to enlist and his friends would be dying,"" she continued. ""We didn't know what was going to be happening -- he could be a football player, and go in that direction."" It sounds like an incredible gamble of money and time, especially without the certainty that Coltrane, who was just 6 when the film began production, would even be the right casting choice by the time they reached the story's end. ""I realize 12 years later why it hadn't been done before,"" Linklater joked. ""It's a wildly impractical, rather insane idea."" But that's how ""Boyhood,"" as fictional as it is, is also an eerie reflection of real life. ""You can't say exactly where you are going to be 12 years from now, you hope to be somewhere, if you're not unlucky,"" Linklater said. ""You just have to believe in the future, that we'll be able to deal with the reality."" CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","Richard Linklater's ""Boyhood"" was filmed over 12 years .
The actors embraced aging on camera .
The script had to have an ""openness"" to allow for future changes .
In that way, ""Boyhood"" is reflective of life ."
"London (CNN) -- The success of France's anti-euro National Front party in the first round of the country's presidential elections thrust the far right into the headlines. A day later in the Netherlands, the refusal of the far-right Freedom Party to back austerity measures led the Dutch government to collapse. Two very different scenarios, but with a common thread: the efforts of extremist parties to win support by plugging into popular discontent over the financial crisis, against the backdrop of a wider social unease and anti-immigrant sentiment. Across Europe, anger at a perceived mismanagement of the economic crisis, and accompanying high unemployment, low growth and painful cuts, has seen the fall of half a dozen governments. Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Finland and Italy are among them -- and unless President Nicolas Sarkozy pulls a victory out of the bag in the second round of voting on May 6, France may be the next to see power change hands, this time in a shift to the left. Sarkozy, for his part, says he will keep an open ear to the concerns of the National Front party, led by Marine Le Pen -- but rejected any notion of striking a deal with the far-right group. ""There will be no pact with the National Front, there will be no National Front ministers, but I refuse to demonize the men and women who in voting for Marine Le Pen expressed a crisis vote, a vote of anger, a vote of suffering and a vote of despair,"" he said on French radio Wednesday. ""I have to take their message into account, I have to listen to them, I have to hear them and not hold my nose."" Even so, will the region's economic insecurity translate into greater gains for the far right? Europe's far-right parties are definitely seeing a resurgence, according to Dr. Matthew Feldman, director of the Radicalism and New Media Research Group at the University of Northampton, but the austerity crisis is only one part of the picture. He says the far right movement has been gaining ground for years, thanks partly to efforts to revamp its previously overtly racist and fascist image. This doesn't mean that those racist or Nazi-sympathizing elements don't still exist within different countries' far right groups, he said, but those at the top have often learned to present a more acceptable public face. Instead of open racial attacks, they play up a threat to national identity and criticize multiculturalism, Feldman said. On the campaign trail, National Front leader Marine Le Pen called for France to leave the eurozone and restore its own currency, the franc, as well as criticizing its political integration into the European Union. But her rhetoric also drew on an anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim sentiment that has deep roots in France and elsewhere. A report by rights group Amnesty International released Monday highlighted the issue, saying Muslims in Europe face discrimination in education, employment and religious freedom. This discourse was likely a factor in Sarkozy turning the labeling of halal meat into an election issue, in a bid to win far-right supporters from Le Pen. Dr. Michael Minkenberg, a professor of political science at the European University Viadrina in Frankfurt (Oder) who has also taught at New York, Cornell and Columbia universities, said concern over immigration, law and order ""and the feeling that things aren't what they used to be any more"" are at the heart of support for Europe's radical right. Euroscepticism, as resistance to greater European political integration is known, is also on the increase, he said, and ""there's this anxiety about what will happen, a growing complexity and not much reassurance from either national governments or the European Union."" Coupled with a mistrust of the political elite, this has also led to a swell of support for the far right in Austria, Belgium and Scandinavian countries, Minkenberg said. Despite that trend, analysts caution against drawing sweeping conclusions from the far right's success in France. The National Front has been well entrenched in France's political life for decades, under Jean-Marie Le Pen before his daughter Marine took charge last year, said Thomas Klau, of the European Council on Foreign Relations. As such, its achievement in taking a fifth of the votes in Sunday's election, while notable, does not indicate a sudden rise to prominence for the far right, he said. Socialist Francois Hollande, who is favored to win on May 6, told France's daily Liberation newspaper that he saw the strong showing for the National Front as an expression of people's ""social anger"" rather than a firm adherence to the party's more extremist views. It revealed a discontent particularly in rural areas and among working class voters, he said, with many feeling abandoned by the government. His job will be to persuade them that his left-wing party will listen to and answer their concerns, he said. Klau argued that a feature of recent ballots in Europe has been the readiness of voters to change their governments without turning to the political extremes, pointing to Spain's election last November as an example. ""Voters have been single minded across the eurozone in terms of expressing their dissatisfaction at how the crisis has been run by the government in charge, whatever their political hue,"" he said. ""But at the same time, they have sufficient confidence in their own political system to replace their governments with the mainstream political opposition."" If the major parties can convince voters that they hear their concerns, they are less likely to turn to the extremes of left or right, said Minkenberg. But Sarkozy's failure to deliver on his promises on immigration during five years in power has undermined his support from the right-wing electorate despite his attempt to appeal to them in campaigning, Minkenberg said. In the Netherlands, Klau said the impact of Dutch politician Geert Wilders' decision to withdraw his Freedom Party's support for the government, triggering its collapse, will have only a temporary destabilizing effect. The economy will be central to the election of a new government, but the far right does not attract the same level of support as in France. Wilders, who wants a referendum on the euro, preferred to exit the coalition than lose political credibility by backing the painful cuts demanded by Europe, said Dr. Kostas Gemenis, at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. Outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte urged lawmakers to act responsibly. ""The economy is stalling; unemployment is threatening to rise; and the national debt is growing more quickly than we can afford. These are the facts, and we cannot ignore them,"" he said Tuesday. Debt-ridden Greece also faces an election on May 6 that hinges on the economy. The situation is very fluid there, but the far-right LAOS party, with a couple of lawmakers in parliament, has lost ground to the ultranationalist Golden Dawn party, which has a history of street violence, Gemenis said. Opinion polls suggest Golden Dawn may pass the threshold of 3% of the vote, which could give the party eight or nine MPs in a parliament of 300, he said. ""They won't be able to make any difference, but it's a very strong message when people vote for such an extreme party,"" he said. At the moment, the most likely outcome is another coalition between the two main parties, Gemenis said. But if the radical groups manage to tie anger over the austerity measures mandated under the country's international bailout to a sense of nationalism, they might pick up more disaffected voters. So, does the far right present a broader threat to European freedoms? How extreme the anti-immigration debate becomes depends very much on the individual country, Minkenberg said. Farther east, a different strand of far-right thinking dominates in countries like Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, he said. There, far-right groups poll around 10% but tend to be more nationalistic in tone, he said, with anti-Semitism and anti-Roma views seen as more legitimate there than elsewhere in Europe. Feldman highlights the far right's recent apparent moves to establish a pan-European cultural movement as the biggest risk. Far-right groups from Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, Germany and Eastern Europe gathered last month in the Danish city of Aarhus for what they said was a rally to make their governments aware of the threat of Islamic extremism. Although it was dwarfed by a left-wing counterdemonstration, the protest was significant as an attempt by the far-right groups to create a common trajectory, he said. What remains to be seen is how much traction their extreme views can gain. ""It's clear that a large minority across Europe isn't comfortable with these things, demographic change and multiculturalism,"" Feldman said. ""But what the far right offers is not something that many can accept.""","France's National Front gained 20% of the vote in the first round of the presidential election .

"(CNN) -- A little good, a little bad and a whole lot of nostalgia were in play at the Paley Center's ""Facts of Life"" reunion in Beverly Hills, California, on Monday. It's been 35 years since the '80s sitcom, about four boarding school girls and their house mother, debuted as a spinoff from ""Diff'rent Strokes."" Although ""Facts of Life"" has been in reruns since 1988, an upcoming DVD release brought the series' stars together again. Nancy McKeon, who played Jo, joined Lisa Whelchel (Blair), Mindy Cohn (Natalie) and Charlotte Rae (Mrs. Garrett) at the reunion event. Kim Fields, who'll always be known as Tootie to some, made an appearance via video. The sitcom still has plenty of fans (and the theme song can still get stuck in your head after one listen), but the stars of the series don't think ""Facts of Life"" would work on the air today. During the panel, Cohn said the networks would probably pass on a show with a lesson in every episode, while Rae thinks it could be updated. And the religious Whelchel, who says she wouldn't let her character lose her virginity on the show, is pretty sure ""Facts of Life"" could happen today ... if it were handled very differently. Maybe ""if we were all naked,"" Whelchel joked. The cast was just as wholesome off-set as they were in front of the camera. In fact, there was just one cast member who affected life on set with an addiction problem: Rae. The older actress' smoking habit apparently drove the cast crazy. ""The girls didn't want me to smoke,"" Rae said. ""I used to smoke five cigarettes a day, and they'd pull them out of my mouth."" But Rae, who let some profanity slip while on stage during the reunion, reminded the crowd that she's not Mrs. Garrett. Geri Jewell, who played Geri Tyler on the show, also made an appearance with the cast. Jewell, who has cerebral palsy, was the first person with a disability to be featured on a TV series, and she credits the show with changing her life. ""That first episode was so special to me,"" she said. ""It was a dream come true."" Jewell wasn't the only actor to get a break on ""Facts of Life."" The show had a long list of notable guest stars, and the list of unknown actors who later achieved success is just as impressive. It includes Helen Hunt, David Spade, Dennis Haysbert, Juliette Lewis, Seth Green, Mayim Bialik, Larry Wilmore and some other guy who has done OK for himself, George Clooney. The cast said Clooney has come a long way since the days when he and McKeon sported similar mullets. But he may not have left much of an impression, as Whelchel said she has to refer to YouTube to recall an onscreen kiss she and Clooney shared. ""I am all for repressed memories,"" Whelchel joked, ""but why I repressed that one, I don't know!""","Most of the cast of ""Facts of Life"" reunited on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Revered forecaster Punxsutawney Phil may have predicted six more weeks of winter, but the fashion world is looking ahead to another season: fall. Despite more impending snow and ice potentially impacting attendees' footwear flair, New York Fashion Week will take place February 6-13. See all of CNN Living's New York Fashion Week coverage . Fall 2014 will be all about Americana and wild, wild West inspiration with fringe scarves, frayed edges, equestrian-inspired boots and blanket coats leading the charge, says Sheila Aimette of fashion forecaster WGSN, the official trend sponsor of the biannual Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. The season's street sense will be inspired by the audacious avenues of Nashville and Austin, Texas, says Aimette. (Chanel's MÃ©tiers d'Art collection for 2013/2014 even took place at Fair Park in Dallas). On a similar wavelength, Aimette expects a rise in heritage fabrics like plaid, houndstooth and gingham, but re-colored in bright hues. This gives way to the bigger androgynous trend of decorated menswear-inspired shoes, oversized sweaters and tailored sportswear. Meanwhile, the spring crop top trend is traveling south: we'll see more cropped pants come fall. ""Crop tops are moving towards more boxy tops,"" says Aimette, citing higher waisted pants paired with short but not midriff-baring blouses. ""The seasons are becoming less about weather-related clothing and more about key items a woman needs for her lifestyle,"" said Joyann King, Harper's BAZAAR Digital Director. King says this includes ""a wardrobe of coats to lust after."" The sportswear trend will continue but not dominate the ensemble; instead, athletic styling will be used to accent distinctively feminine pieces. Michael Kors paired sneakers with skinny brocade pants in his pre-fall collection. The counterintuitive pairings don't mean that buyers will abandon their feminine privy toward timeless elegance: Pearls as both jewelry and detailing on dress backs and collars will be the envy of every Hepburn-inspired fashionista. As for the palette, Aimette says there will be an onslaught of teal and berry tones that are anchored by traditional colors of caramel, gunmetal and navy.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A series of bomb blasts killed at least 37 people across Iraq on Tuesday, including 30 in an explosion at a vegetable market in Diwaniya, police officials said. In that attack, some 99 miles (160 kilometers) south of Baghdad, a suicide bomber parked a truck packed with explosives concealed by watermelons and began calling shoppers to the truck. He then detonated the bomb, killing 30 and wounding 100, according to police. The bombing in the largely Shiite city was among a series of attacks across Iraq, including a car-bomb attack in an outdoor market in Karbala, killing four people and wounding 30 others, according to Haider Jaber Jasim in the Karbala governor's office. Jasim had previously said 10 people died and 14 were wounded, but he said security officials had mistaken some unconscious victims for fatalities. On Tuesday evening, a car bomb exploded along a busy road near the al-Nidda Sunni Mosque in northeastern Baghdad's al-Qahira neighborhood, police officials said. One person died and five were wounded, according to police. Earlier, eight roadside bombs exploded in quick succession in Taji, 12 miles (about 20 kilometers) north of Baghdad, killing two people and wounding 14 others, police in Baghdad said. The assailants were targeting an Iraqi police checkpoint in the Tuesday morning attack, police said. In a western Baghdad neighborhood, a roadside bomb exploded, wounding three people. Also in western Baghdad, gunmen attacked a checkpoint manned by local Awakening Council members, wounding two of them, police said. The Awakening Councils, also known as the Sons of Iraq, are made up predominantly of Sunni Arab fighters who battled Iraq's al Qaeda militants after turning on them in late 2006. More than 230 people were killed across the country in June, according to a CNN tally. Despite the recent spate of attacks, violence has drastically dropped across the country since 2008. For example in January 2007, 1,990 civilians were killed across the country, according to Iraq's Interior Ministry.","NEW: Baghdad blast brings day's death toll to 37 .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Two car bombs targeted Shiite pilgrims Saturday in Baghdad, killing at least 32 people and injuring 68 others, police said. The bombs detonated as a religious commemoration for Imam Moussa al-Kadhim, one of the 12 revered Shiite imams, was winding down in the northwestern Baghdad neighborhood of Kadhimiya. One bomb exploded near a bus station in the Shulaa neighborhood, where dozens of pilgrims were waiting for buses home after attending the commemoration. At least 14 people were killed and another 32 were wounded. A second bomb went off in Sanaa Square killing 18 more people and wounding 36 . The car bombs followed a wave of attacks Wednesday that targeted pilgrims headed to Baghdad and killed at least 93 people. Another 100 were injured in what amounted to the the deadliest day of the year in Iraq. Rising death tolls from bombings make for deadly days in Iraq . The Islamic State of Iraq, an al-Qaeda-linked group, claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attacks. Its statement called the Shiites ""satanic"" and vowed to avenge losses suffered by Sunnis in Iraq. Shiites form a majority in Iraq but for years they were dominated by minority Sunnis empowered by Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein. The U.S. invasion of 2003 ousted Hussein and elevated Shiites to positions of power but the war also fanned longtime tensions between the two groups. Many feared hostilities would explode into protracted civil war, though the violence had ebbed by the time the last U.S. soldiers exited Iraq in December 2011. However, militant Sunnis have not stopped attacking Shiite pilgrims and the scale of this week's attacks sparked fears of renewed violence on levels of the past.

"(CNN) -- Bolivia's president wants a peaceful solution to a two-week-old protest by residents of a remote Andean city who have cut off all roads, train and air traffic with the rest of the world, a government spokesman said Tuesday. About 6,000 of the 16,000 residents in Potosi, in southwestern Bolivia, have mounted the blockade. They say President Evo Morales has abandoned them after they supported his presidential bid four years ago. The protesters have blocked all the roads into town, as well as the rail line to neighboring Chile. On Saturday, the villagers also closed down the airport. Some protesters also launched a hunger strike, which has been joined by Potosi Province Governor Felix Gonzalez and other officials as well as union leaders. At issue is a boundary dispute with the neighboring department of Oruro. Protesters also say the government hasn't invested enough in their area and have made demands such as better roads and the construction of a modern airport. Presidential spokesman Ivan Canelas said Tuesday the government has no intention of mounting a military operation to end the blockade and urged protesters to come to the negotiating table. The protesters ""should put aside their intransigence, end their pressure tactics and partake in dialog as the best path to solve the region's demands,"" Canelas said at a news conference. ""Thousands of children are harmed because schools are closed, as are the health centers and the food markets."" More than 100 foreign tourists are believed trapped in the area, news reports said. The leftist Morales, who is indigenous, relied on a broad base of support among indigenous people and the poor -- nearly always one and the same in Bolivia -- for his election victory. Whites in Bolivia account for only 15 percent of the population, according to the CIA World Factbook. About 30 percent of the population is Quechua and another 25 percent are Aymara, both indigenous groups. Meztizos, who are of mixed white and indigenous ancestry, account for 30 percent of the population.","Protesters say President Evo Morales has ignored their plight .

"(CNN) -- Bill Clinton's speech accepting the Democratic nomination for president in 1992 went through 22 drafts. But from the first to the last, he insisted on including a call to service. America was mired in a recession. The deficit was high, and confidence was low. But the young governor of Arkansas was determined to try to inspire a new generation of young people the way President John F. Kennedy had inspired him. ""Just think of it,"" he told the nation. ""Think of it. Millions of energetic young men and women serving their country by policing the streets or teaching the children or caring for the sick. Or working with the elderly and people with disabilities. Or helping young people to stay off drugs and out of gangs, giving us all a sense of new hope and limitless possibilities."" Through persistent, bipartisan effort, that dream became law 20 years ago this week. Nearly a million Americans have spent 1.2 billion hours serving their country, their community, their neighbors in AmeriCorps. They helped mend hearts after September 11. They helped mend communities after Katrina. Today, they help children from broken homes and veterans with no homes. They have taught countless kids, comforted countless seniors, touched countless lives. Chad Clanton was in the first class of AmeriCorps volunteers. An idealistic kid from Waco, Texas, Clanton had just graduated from the University of Texas. He joined VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) and was soon building houses for -- and with -- the poor in San Antonio. ""It really was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had,"" he said. ""I just met the most wonderful people. And all kinds of people: hippies, yuppies, cowboys, church people, corporate executives, plumbers, electricians, rich, poor, you name it. Everyone was out there because they wanted to do something -- swing a hammer, hang some Sheetrock, paint a fence -- to chip away at the problem of poverty housing."" Clanton went on to become a successful international political consultant, advising politicians across the country and around the world, but he says those days sweating in the South Texas sun was the best job he ever had. Ely Flores did not come to AmeriCorps wanting to save the world. He was sent there by a criminal justice system that was trying to save him. ""At 17 years old, I was at a crossroads,"" he said of his youth in Hollywood and South Central Los Angeles. ""I had a choice. Either I was going to continue the lifestyle that had forced me into community service or choose an AmeriCorps program called YouthBuild. My year in AmeriCorps with YouthBuild not only helped put my education back on track, put money in my pocket and ultimately helped me shape the foundation of social justice I stand on, but it completely transformed my view of service. "" Ely helps young people affected by the incarceration of family members. He has rebuilt homes and schools and lives. When asked his occupation, he proudly says, ""community builder."" He has earned his undergraduate degree, is looking to get a masters and is organizing LEAD, Leadership through Empowerment, Action, and Dialogue, which seeks to breathe new life into Lincoln Heights, Los Angeles' oldest -- but far from wealthiest -- neighborhood. There are 900,000 Floreses and Clantons. They have created ripples of hope that will continue to radiate out into the lives of millions of people. Surely, that is something to celebrate. When President Obama stands on the South Lawn of the White House on Friday to swear in new volunteers, he will almost certainly look back on two decades of getting things done. But he will also, I hope, focus on all there is yet to do. There is a growing movement to take national service to the next level, to make a year of service a rite of passage for every American who wants to serve. Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who was America's top commander on the battlefields of Afghanistan, has a new mission: ""All young Americans should have the opportunity and feel the responsibility to serve their country,"" he wrote this summer in Politico. ""We need to create a culture in which at least a year of service is culturally expected, if not quite mandatory by law."" Just as the members of the Greatest Generation were bound together by their common service in the second World War and just as Vietnam vets have a kinship that crosses partisan lines, so too should today's young people. So on this 20th anniversary of AmeriCorps, let's pause a moment to thank the Man From Hope for giving us all a sense of new hope and limitless possibilities.","Paul Begala: Bill Clinton was determined to include a call to service during his administration .

"(CNN) -- Punk rock fuel-injected the beat of rock and roll in the mid-1970s with a frenetic tempo. On Friday, the drummer who gunned out those rhythms with pioneering punk band the Ramones passed away. Tommy Ramone was 65 and the last living original member of the band, which debuted its first album in 1976. Ramone was also one of the band's composers. A notice of his death was posted on the band's Facebook page with his age. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame reported that he was 62. Ramone was reportedly battling cancer when he died. With their racing-pulse beat and disparaging, cynical lyrics that were combined with oddly florid but loud guitar riffs, the Ramones kicked off a music and counterculture movement in New York that quickly spread to Britain. It came echoing back from London in variations from groups like the Clash and the Sex Pistols. Glue-sniffing darkness . Their debut album, ""Ramones,"" left little doubt about the direction of the new rock style with song titles like: ""Beat on the Brat,"" ""Chain Saw,"" ""Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue."" Not all of their lyrics were dark. Some were playful ruckus, but most of them seemed to come ""from a sullen adolescent basement of the mind,"" as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame put it. Their head-banging rock cut like a machete into the candy-glazed, infatuated glam pop of the time that was vaulting the band ABBA to Beatles-like elevations. A flock of similar kissable, bell-bottomed groups were riding their coattails. Then punk rock slammed into the party head-on. Clashing with glam pop . The Ramones' black leather, torn jeans and canvas sneakers clashed with the rainbow satin, sequins and platform shoes that had overtaken youth culture. The everyday heroes the Ramones sang about had dumped surfboards and disco gyrations for lives as pogo-ing punk rockers in the urban grit of places like Berlin and New York. The Ramones were practically the house band of the hole-in-the-wall rock bar CBGB on lower Manhattan's Bowery, a neighbor to skid row. Other American punk and new wave acts like Blondie, the Cramps and Joan Jett joined them there. The Hall of Fame credits the band with saving rock music ""from one of its lowest ebbs."" ""The Ramones got back to basics: simple, speedy, stripped-down rock and roll songs. Voice, guitar, bass, drums. No makeup, no egos, no light shows, no nonsense."" Tommy Ramone said the intention was innovation with a statement. ""It wasn't just music in the Ramones: it was an idea. It was bringing back a whole feel that was missing in rock music -- it was a whole push outwards to say something new and different,"" he said. Iron Curtain . While his Hall of Fame biography states that Ramone was born Tom Erdelyi in Budapest, Hungary, he was actually born in that city as Erdelyi Tamas, on January 29, 1949, and his name was changed to Tom Erdelyi after he emigrated with his family to the United States in 1957, according to Andy Schwartz, a representative of Ramone's longtime domestic partner, Claudia Tienan. It was during the morbid wake of World War II, when the Soviet Union was beginning to cement Eastern Europe into a communist bloc. Some of the Ramones' music reflects that Cold War background with songs like ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" and the album ""Rocket to Russia."" Ramone built his music career on the band but handed over the drum sticks in 1978. In subsequent years, he still drummed, composed and produced for other bands, including the Talking Heads. But in the decade prior to his death, he didn't play drums for any band, including Uncle Monk, the acoustic duo he formed with Tienan, Schwartz said. Ramone also stopped composing for other artists during this period, Schwartz said. The other original band members passed away between 2001 and 2004, according to the Hall of Fame. Joey Ramone, born Jeffrey Hyman, died of cancer in 2001 at age 49. Dee Dee Ramone, born Douglas Colvin, died from an apparent overdose in 2002 at age 49. Johnny Ramone, born John Cummings, died of cancer in 2004 at age 52. People we lost in 2014 .","The Ramones are credited with kicking off the punk rock movement .

"(CNN) -- Blasting off from Earth and hurtling through space at thousands of miles an hour, it takes astronauts three days to reach the moon -- a tiny distance in a universe measured in light years, but a fantastic voyage on a human scale. Buzz Aldrin walks on the moon on July 20, 1969. NASA is preparing to send astronauts back and build a lunar base. Now plans are under way to go back, even as the future of U.S. human space exploration is under close scrutiny and pressure is growing on NASA to aim for another alien world. It's a crossroads Neil Armstrong could have hardly imagined on July 20, 1969, when he became the first human to set foot on the moon and uttered his now famous phrase: ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" Today, NASA is working to return astronauts to the moon by 2020 and establish a lunar base that would allow them to stay on the desolate surface for up to six months by 2025. The goal this time is for the explorers to make themselves at home, study the terrain and learn how to work in a harsh environment to prepare for trips beyond the moon. ""The next giant leap has begun,"" NASA promises on the logo of its Constellation Program, the new fleet of space exploration vehicles that the agency's former administrator, Michael Griffin, once famously called ""Apollo on steroids."" Set to replace the space shuttles, Constellation builds on the legacy of Apollo -- the program that landed humans on the moon six times in the late 1960s and early '70s -- but incorporates modern technologies and influences. Will it fly? Constellation grew of out the Vision for Space Exploration, outlined by President George Bush in 2004, but its future now lies in the hands of the U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee. The independent panel is reviewing NASA's plans, including Constellation's estimated $100 billion cost by 2020, and taking a look at ""potential alternatives"" this summer at the request of the Obama administration. It is expected to present its results in August.  Watch why there is a new space race » . If Constellation goes forward, it would take astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit for the first time in decades. It may also surprise a generation accustomed to watching the shuttles carry both humans and heavy cargo, like the Hubble Space Telescope, into space. The new program splits up those tasks among two new rockets, as recommended by the board that investigated the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster. The Ares I would launch the Orion crew capsule carrying up to six astronauts, while the much beefier Ares V would carry cargo, such as the new moon-landing craft. ""It's like having your sports car that's super safe and your large SUV,"" said John Olson, director of the NASA office that plans and integrates programs including Constellation. Orion's first manned flight -- scheduled for 2015 -- will take it to the international space station. NASA.gov: Watch how Constellation is designed to work . For a future trip to the moon, Orion's crew would dock with the Altair lunar module already in Earth's orbit and escape the planet's gravity by firing the powerful engine of an Earth departure stage. Arriving at their destination, the astronauts could land anywhere on the moon, including the far side and the poles -- a big improvement over Apollo, which limited landing sites mostly to the equator on the near side of the moon. The search for prime real estate has already begun. Last month, NASA launched the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, an unmanned spacecraft tasked with finding landing sites and resources. At this point, NASA is favoring the heavily cratered south pole because of its scientific interest and the possible presence of water ice, Olson said. NASA.gov: Watch what it might look like to land on the lunar south pole . The lunar water could be used for drinking, or as a source of oxygen and hydrogen for air and rocket fuel, NASA says on its Web site. When humans are ready to go, the agency envisions seven-day missions at first, followed by 180-day stays once a lunar outpost is in place. ""We're not doing flags and footsteps,"" Olson said. ""We're going for a long-term sustained human presence that's affordable and safe and built so that we can use the moon as a stepping stone to Mars and near-Earth asteroids and other exciting locations in the solar system."" A potential manned mission to the Red Planet wouldn't take place until at least 2030, Olson added. The allure of Mars . Is it the right way to go? Critics say NASA should skip the moon and set its sights directly on Mars. They argue such a mission would open new frontiers for humans, answer key questions about life in the universe and reignite excitement about the space program.  See the past, present and future of moon and Mars exploration » . Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon, has been an especially outspoken supporter of following ""Star Trek's"" motto: To boldly go where no man has gone before. ""We won the moon race; now it's time for us to live and work on Mars,"" Aldrin wrote in a commentary for CNN.  Watch Aldrin make his case for Mars » . He went even further in an article in Popular Mechanics, warning that NASA's current plan will waste time and money, and calling the return to the moon a ""glorified rehash of what we did 40 years ago."" Aldrin instead suggests a course of action that would have humans landing on Mars' moon Phobos around 2025 and ultimately living permanently on the Red Planet as ""Martian homesteaders."" Aldrin plans to present his vision to the U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee, Popular Mechanics reported. Blog: Meet the strange moons of Mars . Olson counters that NASA is looking to go to Mars, but must first tackle the enormous challenges of safely sending humans to the Red Planet -- a journey that would take 6 months and span more than 30 million miles. Earth's moon would be a great test bed to try out technologies and infrastructure necessary for more ambitious space travel, Olson said. But Mars exploration advocates say the country is now much closer to being able to send humans to Mars than it was to sending them to the moon in 1961, when President Kennedy called for a lunar mission by the end of that decade. ""This idea that you have to know how to do it before you can commit yourself to the program is completely false,"" said Robert Zubrin, president of the Mars Society. ""We didn't know that we could do Lewis and Clark successfully before we set them out"" to explore the American West in the 1800s, he added. Zubrin, who plans to testify before the U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee next month, said that if President Obama were to commit the nation to a mission to Mars this year, astronauts could be there by the end of his potential second term in office. ""NASA was not created to do nostalgia acts. It was created to storm heaven,"" Zubrin added. ""For NASA to make as its central goal repeating technical accomplishments it did 50 years before is a complete abandonment of its purpose."" A problematic gap . NASA's plans are controversial for another reason. The agency is preparing to retire the space shuttle fleet in 2010, leaving a five-year gap until Orion is scheduled to be ready to launch. In the meantime, U.S. astronauts will have to hitch rides to the International Space Station aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft. ""Relying on the Russians between when we're retiring the shuttle and having the Constellation program flying is something that I'm not very proud of,"" said former Kennedy Space Center Director Bob Crippen, who piloted the first space shuttle mission in 1981. ""It's OK to work with them as partners, but to be totally dependent on them is a mistake in my opinion."" The space shuttles could continue to fly safely until NASA has another vehicle ready to go, Crippen argued. NASA's Olson called the gap a ""significant challenge,"" but said there are no plans to keep the space shuttles flying beyond their current manifest. ""We as much as anyone wish we did not have a gap. However, that is the fiscal reality that we're in and we're doing our absolute best to mitigate it,"" Olson said. That reality, 40 years after America's first fantastic voyage to the moon, isn't taking away from the allure of exploring the final frontier. ""This is the beginning of the next space age,"" Olson said, ""and it's truly an exciting time.""

"(CNN) -- Iraq is placing big stakes on the success of this week's Arab League summit in Baghdad. ""It is a recognition of the new Iraq that emerged since 2003 by its new leaders, its new constitution, its new policies, its new political system at the heart of the Middle East,"" Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said Monday. ""This summit could truly be called the Arab Spring summit,"" he declared. Previous summits included Arab leaders who no longer hold power due to the uprisings in several nations, including the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, former Tunisian President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, and former Yemeni Persident Ali Abdullah Saleh. Zebari described the summit as ""the most important event for Iraq."" It will mark the first time Arab leaders have held the summit in Iraq since 1990. The summit will take place Thursday, but it is considered a three-day event because many leaders begin gathering Tuesday. The country is spending more than half a billion dollars on it, Zebari said. U.S. President Barack Obama has highlighted the summit's importance as well. ""For the first time in two decades, Iraq is scheduled to host the next Arab League summit. And what a powerful message that will send throughout the Arab world,"" he said in a December news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. ""People throughout the region will see a new Iraq that's determining its own destiny, a country in which people from different religious sects and ethnicities can resolve their differences peacefully through the democratic process."" The gathering tests Iraq's ability to provide critical organization and security in the country where deadly violence remains a weekly norm. It was originally scheduled to be held in Baghdad last year, but was postponed due to the unrest. Last week a militant group with links to al Qaeda claimed responsibility for a deadly wave of bombings, saying they were designed to undermine security for the summit. The blasts were meant to target the security plan ""of the government of fools inside the Green Zone, in preparation of the meeting of Arab tyrants in Baghdad,"" said a statement from the Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group that includes al Qaeda in Iraq. The Interior Ministry said ""all protective measures"" have been taken to host the delegations and media at the summit. In a statement, the ministry described the summit as a ""great political achievement that suits Iraq's importance and geopolitical position in the region."" It slammed terrorists ""racing to prove their propaganda presence by carrying out hysterical acts aiming to affect the atmosphere of the summit."" Unprecedented security measures are in place for the event. While the interior ministry has said it's unlikely roads will be closed off or a curfew will be imposed, the capital already appears to be in a state of lockdown. Most of the main roads in central Baghdad, including those leading to the Green Zone -- the highly fortified area that includes government buildings -- have been cut off to vehicle traffic. Cars are being thoroughly inspected at checkpoints, causing hours-long delays. But similar checkpoints did not stop the large-scale bombings that recently hit the capital. Following those attacks, Iraq announced a national holiday from March 25 to April 1. The traffic jams and additional security measures are keeping most people indoors -- and many who still need to get to their jobs are making their way on foot. ""How can we survive, how can we live?"" asked Abu Ahmad, a street vendor. ""I live from day to day and I make about $10 U.S. a day to support my family. Now how can I support my family in those coming days?"" ""This is not the time for this summit,"" said another angry Baghdad resident. ""If it was the right time, they would not have to shut everything down.... Shame on them. For weeks they have been planning on how to protect Arab leaders while Iraqis are not protected."" But Iraqi leaders insist the summit is shaping up to be a success. All member nations plan to attend, except Syria, Zebari said Monday. Syria was not invited because its membership was suspended amid a violent government crackdown on an uprising, . The league includes 20 countries in addition to Iraq and Syria. Zebari said it's unusual to attract leaders from all the invited countries. He did not say who would represent each country. One leader who will attend is Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and genocide. Iraqi state television reported Bashir's plan on Sunday. Bashir has traveled to other Arab countries despite the ICC warrants against him for alleged war crimes and genocide in the Darfur region, where rebels have fought government forces and allied militiamen such as the Janjaweed since 2003. Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby arrived Sunday in Baghdad with a small delegation in advance of the summit. The agenda includes 10 central issues, the most important of which is Syria, Zebari said. While the Arab League has discussed Syria at numerous meetings in recent months, Zebari said the summit will be ""a golden opportunity for the Arab leaders to think together collectively"" about the mounting crisis and stalemate. Other issues include Somalia, Yemen, the Arab-Israeli conflict, international terrorism and making the Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction, Zebari said. To prepare for the big event, ministries were allocated about $500 million for expenses including building and renovation of palaces, hotels, convention centers, and more, said Zebari. Baghdad municipality and other agencies have spent to cover costs related to the summit as well, he said. It is Iraq's biggest challenge in many years, said Zebari, pointing to the era under Saddam Hussein when Iraq was sanctioned and boycotted. ""In fact, this country was isolated many years ago,"" he said, adding that that's why the summit ""is a very, very important thing.""
