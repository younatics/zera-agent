"(CNN) -- A Texas inmate in a wheelchair, who escaped on foot from two armed guards as he was being transferred between prisons, is now on the U.S. Marshals' list of the 15 most-wanted fugitives. Arcade Comeaux Jr., 49, ""produced a weapon and fired upon two correctional officers, took them hostage and forced them to drive to Baytown, Texas,"" the U.S. Marshals Service said in a statement. He then put the officers in the back of the van and took their weapons and one of their uniforms, the statement said. Comeaux was serving three life sentences for aggravated sexual assault and two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. He escaped Monday during transport from Huntsville, Texas, to Stiles, Texas. The 6-foot, 200-pound man was shackled and in a wheelchair, ""which he had claimed was needed for mobility,"" Michelle Lyons, director of public information for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Huntsville, said in a statement. About 45 minutes into the trip, as they were driving through Conroe, 40 minutes north of Houston, the prisoner pulled out a pistol and ordered the guards to drive south to Baytown, east of Houston. He fired once, but hit no one during the escape about 9 a.m., officials said. Law enforcement officers found the unharmed officers an hour later. Comeaux was being transferred so he could be near John Sealy Hospital in Galveston for treatment of the supposed paralysis he had suffered during a reported stroke, officials said. At least $16,000 in reward money has been offered for information leading to Comeaux's rearrest and a task force of more than 100 investigators is searching for him, focusing on the Houston area, where he grew up and has family. His escape has led the man who oversees Texas' criminal justice system to call for a shakeup of the prison system. ""I just think enough's enough,"" said Sen. John Whitmire, the Texas Democrat from Houston who is chairman of the state Senate's Criminal Justice Committee. ""We need a complete shakeup of the leadership of our prison system and/or an outside review by third parties,"" he told CNN by phone Wednesday. ""We just can't have security breaches of this nature."" Whitmire said the guards had failed to pat down Comeaux while he was in his wheelchair and before they began the trip. ""Sure enough, he has a firearm,"" he said. ""The question is, are there others (in the prison system)? I think you have to assume that there are until you find out differently."" So far this year, more than 900 cell phones have been confiscated from the 112 locations that house the state's 158,000 prisoners. ""It's pretty rampant,"" he said. ""I want the director to come forward and tell us what it's going to take"" to solve the problem, he said. John Moriarty, inspector general of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said such lapses are highly unusual in the state's penal system. ""We have no open gun investigations other than this one,"" he said. ""The last one was several years ago."" Texas Department of Criminal Justice Executive Director Brad Livingston, who has been in the job since 2005, did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.","Arcade Comeaux Jr. was in wheelchair when he pulled gun on officers .

"New York (CNN) -- President Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday by talking about war and the limits of nonviolence. But he also praised the peacemakers of the past and said the world can and should still strive for peace. ""Let us reach for the world that ought to be,"" he told the 1,000-member audience at Oslo City Hall in Norway. ""Clear-eyed, we can understand that there will be war, and still strive for peace."" The Nobel committee's choice of Obama as this year's laureate sparked debate, in part because he is a president waging two wars abroad. Obama said force is sometimes necessary, but said that is simply ""a recognition of history, the imperfections of man and the limits of reason."" Read a transcript of Obama's acceptance speech . Fareed Zakaria, author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria: GPS,"" spoke to CNN about the speech . CNN: What message was President Obama trying to send the world in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech? Fareed Zakaria: The speech reflected his basic philosophy, which is why it worked so well. I think Obama is somebody who is a realist-idealist. He tries to balance idealism with the realities in the world. He clearly believes in the idea of doing good in the world, but believes you have to be pragmatic and realizes the dangers of over-reaching. CNN: Will the focus on the Afghanistan war being ""just"" be well received by world leaders? Zakaria: Most of the world supports the war in Afghanistan. The UN approved it, and over 50 countries are participating one way or another, so countries won't react negatively. Obama wanted to remind people, including those in his own party here in the U.S., that the Afghanistan war has a morally legitimate basis and that there are occasions in history where force is necessary. CNN: Are there any potential pitfalls to spending so much of the speech defending the war on moral grounds? Zakaria: The great danger of moral certitude is that you get distracted from the practical issue of whether things are working. Are we creating a stable government? Are we being successful against the Taliban and al Qaeda? From Woodrow Wilson to Vietnam, the question of whether a military action is morally legitimate can overshadow whether it works. CNN: Does the speech give us any window into how Obama might conduct U.S. foreign policy going forward? Zakaria: The Afghanistan speech last week and the Nobel speech are the two clearest statements of his worldview. He isn't making a broad statement like President Bush, when he vowed to end tyranny in the world. Obama says the U.S. is a force for good, but is engaging with the world and is trying to avoid open-ended commitments. Obama wants the U.S. to play a world role that is progressive and idealistic, but remains aware of the practical limitations inherent in trying to operate in a messy world.","Fareed Zakaria: president's speech shows he's trying to balance idealism, world realities .

"(CNN) -- The suspect in the September attack on a woman that led to the discovery of 11 bodies at his Ohio home pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that he raped and choked the woman. Bail for registered sex offender Anthony Sowell was set at $1 million on the rape charges. Bail had already been set at $5 million on five murder charges related to the grisly discovery of the bodies at his home in Cleveland. ""I don't think a $1 million bond is unfair under the circumstances,"" Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge John O'Donnell said at Friday's hearing. Sowell was arraigned Friday in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court on multiple charges, -- including attempted murder, rape and kidnapping -- connected to the September 22 assault on the 36-year-old woman. Sowell said he could not afford a lawyer, and O'Donnell appointed one. The victim encountered Sowell while walking in his Cleveland neighborhood, and he took her back to his home, where he became violent and raped her, Cuyahoga County prosecutors said. ""While raping her, he strangled her with a cord until she lost consciousness,"" the prosecutors said in a written statement. ""When she regained consciousness, he led her out of the house."" Police investigating that case searched Sowell's home and yard, finding the 11 bodies. Sowell, 50, is charged with five counts of aggravated murder, rape, felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with those deaths. He served 15 years in prison for a 1989 attempted rape. He was released in 2005. Neighbors and police have told CNN that other women were seen at Sowell's home from time to time, and that he would offer them beer and other alcohol. Police say he also might have offered them drugs. Neighbors on October 20 reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor of the home. Firefighters and police responded and later notified police. But the woman told officers she fell off the roof while she was at the home ""partying,"" and no charges were filed. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Bail for Anthony Sowell set at $1 million on rape charges .

"(CNN) -- A body found Monday beside a North Carolina road is that of 5-year-old Shaniya Davis, who was reported missing a week ago, police said Tuesday. The official cause of death was undetermined as of Tuesday afternoon, Fayetteville police said in written statement. An announced afternoon media briefing was rescheduled for Wednesday morning. Earlier Tuesday, police said additional charges are expected in connection with the case and any charges will be made public as soon as they are filed. Shaniya's mother, Antoinette Nicole Davis, has been charged with human trafficking and other offenses. Davis was ""prostituting her child,"" police spokeswoman Teresa Chance said after Davis' arrest over the weekend. Another suspect, Mario Andrette McNeill, has been charged with kidnapping in the case. Shaniya's father, Bradley Lockhart, made a tearful appeal before reporters Tuesday afternoon, asking that ""everybody makes it a point not to ignore, to look past a situation where a person, a child, or anybody might be in danger ... so that we don't have another tragedy like Shaniya."" He said authorities have given him limited information, but he was to meet with them later. ""It's not the result I wanted, it's not the result any father or family would want for their children,"" he said. ""But God has a greater calling for all of us."" Shaniya's mother reported her missing from their Fayetteville home in a mobile home park on November 10. According to police, surveillance video taken that day from a hotel in Sanford shows Shaniya in the company of McNeill. ""The investigation at this point indicates that Shaniya Davis was alive at the time she left the Sanford hotel,"" police said in the statement Tuesday. The road where the body was found is near Sanford, which is about 30 miles northwest of Fayetteville. Shaniya's half-sister, Cheyenne Lockhart, said on HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" Monday that she found it difficult to believe Davis had treated her daughter so poorly. ""She seemed like the sweetest woman. She didn't come from much, but ... she had the sweetest voice, she had the sweetest personality, and especially toward me. I would never think that she would do anything like that,"" said Lockhart, who shared a father with Shaniya. Their father said Shaniya went to her mother's home on October 9. CNN's Gabriel Falcon contributed to this report.","NEW: Grieving father, speaking to media, urges people not to ignore children in peril .

"(AOL Autos) -- With fuel prices still high enough to put a hole in your pocket, where does one turn? BMW's MINI division is the best average fuel-economy automaker. For some, it's a vehicle that's been engineered to sip, not guzzle. The question then: Which brand is more likely to ease you out of the gas station without feeling you've been turned upside down and shaken? Perhaps surprisingly, it's not always the Asian-based carmakers that come up on top where fuel economy ratings are concerned. A look at the U.S. government's official fuel economy ratings (published by the Department of Energy, the Office of Energy Efficiency and the Environmental Protection Agency) might not be light reading, but it does give a new sense of perspective on what is a very complex issue. One observation: Carmakers are, on the whole, doing a pretty good job of bringing choice to the market when it comes to fuel economy. AOL Autos: Best-selling fuel-efficient cars . There may, however, be two races to win: the most fuel-efficient car on the road and the automaker that ""on average"" is most likely to save you money at the pump. AOL Autos: Fuel-efficient used cars for sale . On a single car basis, the Toyota Prius comes out on top, its hybrid technology delivering 48 city miles on a gallon (like other hybrids, its fuel efficiency drops slightly on the highway, to 45). With fuel prices hitting hard, where are motorists more likely to find relief? On a fleet basis, the best performing manufacturer is BMW's MINI division, with three models averaging out at just over 27 mpg city/highway. But fitting a family any bigger than two or three in the MINI isn't possible; Honda might be a more realistic choice, its 27 models average out at almost 24 mpg combined. Domestically, the winner in average fuel economy is Chevrolet, its 88 models average a combined 23.26 mpg combined city/highway, only slightly lower than Honda's 23.81 mpg average. AOL Autos: Three cheap, fuel-efficient new cars . What's more impressive is that Chevrolet's numbers factor in a full line of trucks, not the case with Honda (its only offering in that category being the Ridgeline). But as shoppers would be quick to point out, it's not the fleet that we're buying. It's the individual car or truck. AOL Autos: Cars with 30+ MPG for $300 or less per month . By category, the 2008 Fuel Economy Guide singles out the leaders, and there it's more than a little apparent that the traditional Asian and European brands aren't about to give up their leadership position. For two-seaters, it's Mercedes' Smart brand that delivers 33/41 mpg city/highway, followed by Mazda's MX-5 and its 22/27 mpg rating. AOL Autos: 10 cars with the best gas mileage . MINI stands alone in the next size category (mini-subcompact), with its two variations (manual and automatic) delivering 28/37 combined and 26/34 respectively. An interesting side note: the traditional argument that manual transmissions deliver higher fuel economy no longer holds true. Several carmakers boast higher fuel economy with the automatic transmission than with a manual (if available). Toyota's Yaris takes top honors in the subcompact category, posting 29/35 with an automatic transmission (29/36 for the manual). The compact category has the Honda Civic Hybrid at the top of the ratings, with its 40/45 mpg, followed by Toyota's Corolla and its 28/37 mpg rating. A little bigger vehicle will still take you further, notably if it's the industry leading Toyota Prius. In second place is the Nissan Versa and its 26/31 mpg rating. The federal government's ""large car"" category has the Honda Accord at the top with 21/31 mpg (manual) and 22/31 mpg (automatic). Honda once again takes top honors in the small station wagon category, the Fit coming in at 27/34 (automatic) and 28/34 (manual). Volkswagen's Passat came out on top in the midsize station wagon category with 20/28 mpg for the automatic and 20/29 with manual transmission. Where pickups are concerned, the differences between manufacturers are only slight, with Ford's Ranger two-wheel-drive Ranger pickup tying with its Mazda cousin, the B2300 at 21/26 mpg city/highway, followed by Toyota's Tacoma two-wheel-drive version delivering slightly less -- 19/25 mpg. In the standard pickup truck category, 15/20 mpg city/highway seems to be the standard, only the Dodge Dakota and Mitsubishi's Raider (both two-wheel-drive) eking out a slightly higher 16 mpg city. GM apparently owns the cargo van category when it comes to fuel economy, its Chevy 1500/2500 and GMC version delivering 15/20 mpg. And the Mazda5 has similar bragging rights in the minivan category, with 21/27 mpg (automatic) and 22/28 mpg (manual). The sport utility vehicle category has Ford Motor Co. taking top honors, not only with the Ford Escape Hybrid at 34/30 but its virtually identical hybrid cousins the Mazda Tribute and Mercury Mariner. The Jeep Compass and Patriot, both with manual transmission and two-wheel-drive, are rated at 23/28 mpg city/highway. So who's the worst when it comes to earning the gas guzzler label? Look to the so-called ""exotics."" The average Lamborghini, for example, will average just over 11 mpg (combined city and highway), only slightly outdoing the two-seater Bugatti Veyron's 10 mpg. But people who buy those cars aren't nearly as likely to wince as the gas pump numbers go flying by. The lesson: Just about any way the numbers are sliced and diced, there are options for car buyers looking for fuel relief. And the differences may be surprising. Comparisons based on data available in the Model Year 2008 Fuel Economy Guide, published by the U.S. Department of Energy, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Number of vehicles for each manufacturer includes variations in transmission, engine and trim, and fuel octane requirements.","Two fuel-efficient races to win: best car and best all-around automaker .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A 15-year-old boy remained in a psychiatric facility Tuesday after Monroe, New York, police arrested him in connection with a plot to attack his former high school on the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting, police said. Police say the boy targeted Monroe-Woodbury High School, although he was no longer a student there. He was charged as a juvenile and faces two felony counts of criminal possession of a weapon, Monroe Police Chief Dominic Giudice said. Police withheld the name of the teen, who was arrested Monday after police executed a search warrant at his residence. There they found four bottles filled with gasoline, a torch, machete, black trench coat, three propane tanks, two computers, items that could be used as fuses and several other electronic devices, according to a Monroe Police Department press release issued Tuesday. The supplies were found in the garage, Giudice said, but the teen's parents had been unaware of their son's intentions until he told police what he had planned to do. Police also discovered the teen had actively been seeking a military assault-type weapon that could ""hold as many rounds as possible."" The boy told police investigators he had been bullied by fellow students and had been told that he resembled Columbine shooter Eric Harris, the press release said. A detective on the case told Giudice that the teen appeared to be composed during the interview, as if he were just having another conversation. Police said the plot was planned for April 20 at Monroe-Woodbury High School, which is the anniversary of the Columbine shooting in Colorado, in which 12 students and a teacher were killed. The date also is Adolf Hitler's birthday. ""He said that he had a lot of hatred toward a lot of the kids who attend that school,"" the press release said. The boy had attended the Monroe-Woodbury Central School District but recently began attending another school, police said. In a statement released by the Monroe-Woodbury Central School District today, superintendent Joseph DiLorenzo indicated that students had come forward with information that may have averted the alleged plot. ""We are working closely with law enforcement to do everything possible to keep our children safe,"" he said.","Monroe, New York, police say boy, 15, had bomb materials .

"(Budget Travel) -- It's every city's favorite excuse for a party. Here are ten spectacular ways to ring in 2009. Brilliant and colorful fireworks light up Australia's Sydney Harbour Bridge last New Year's Eve. Bangkok: A fresh tradition . If Times Square's light show doesn't cut it for you, head to the capital of Thailand, where a 52-foot-high Greeting Ball Tower signals the arrival of midnight. Outside of the giant CentralWorld shopping mall, about 500,000 revelers join hands to count down to the New Year. Earlier in the evening, events include seven concert performances by Thai stars. Grab a glass of Chang beer from an outdoor garden for about $1.50. BudgetTravel.com: See slideshow of New Year's hot spots . Details: handsbangkokcountdown.com or tourismthailand.org. Hot tip: Catch traditional Thai dance and folk music on the city's historic parade ground, Sanam Luang. At midnight, fireworks explode over the banks of the Chao Phraya River. Berlin: The best and the wurst . Despite temperatures of around the freezing point, Berliners host an open-air New Year's Eve bash, and the city claims that it is the largest such party in the world. Roughly one million merrymakers pack the nearly mile-and-a-quarter-long stretch between the Victory Column and the Brandenburg Gate. Colorful lasers illuminate the sky while music -- mostly pop and dance -- blares from giant speakers. Elsewhere in town, Germans are as law-abiding on Silvester (New Year's Eve) as always, lighting their private fireworks in designated spaces under police watch. But they also cut loose with practical jokes, such as filling homemade doughnuts with mustard instead of the usual jelly. Details: silvester-berlin.de. Hot tip: If you need a breather, duck into one of the scattered party tents. Rest on free heated benches and munch on specialty sausages, such as bratwurst for around $3. Or else head to Unter den Linden Boulevard, which presents a clearer, less claustrophobic view of the fireworks. Cape Town: Where the Second is best . A slave's only day off in 18th-century South Africa was on January 2, and so it's on Tweede Nuwe Jaar (Second New Year) that Cape Town parties the hardest. Up to 2,800 minstrels paint their faces white and storm the streets for the Cape Town Minstrel Carnival. Expect crowds of more than 80,000. Clad in bright colors, participants carry instruments (such as whistles) and umbrellas while parading from Keizersgracht Street past City Hall and into Rose Street. South African wares and local delicacies are hawked along the route, and troupes compete for titles like Best Dressed. Details: capetownminstrels.co.za and tourismcapetown.co.za. Hot tip: Pop into a café along the cobblestone streets of the Bo Kaap residential neighborhood. Watch from indoors as minstrels perform patterned dances past brightly painted houses. Edinburgh: Scottish night lights . The Scottish capital toasts every New Year with a four-day festival called Hogmanay (pronounced hog-muh-NAY). On the Monday before New Years 2009, a torchlight procession along Princes Street whisks a giant wicker lion to Calton Hill, where it's torched. Then on New Year's Eve, indie rockers like Glasvegas blast away in the streets, while more mainstream rockers like Paolo Nutini perform at the Princes Street Gardens. Nearby, there's a ceilidh, a traditional Scottish party where locals dance gigs and reels to a piper's beat. Details: edinburghshogmanay.org and visitscotland.com. Hot tip: Practice the traditional Scottish song ""Auld Lang Syne"" in advance. Everyone belts it out when the clock strikes 12. Hong Kong: Reaching for the stars . The waterfront promenade Tsim Sha Tsui is a fine vantage point to take in the midnight pyrotechnics above the city's tallest building, 2 IFC. For an even more memorable view, jump aboard the Shining Star Ferry for a two-hour cruise of Victoria Harbour. It departs from the Tsim Sha Tsui pier; price has still not been set but will probably be around $20 per adult. Details: discoverhongkong.com. Hot tip: A carnival in Sha Tin Park will include roving street performances of music and puppetry. It's a 15-minute tram ride from downtown (plus a roughly 7-minute walk). Las Vegas: The glittering Strip . Vegas lives up to its rep as a party town on December 31, with lunatic stunts, a massive light display, and performances by well known entertainers. The Strip hosts the free portion of America's Party, an extravaganza with a fireworks display launching from various spots. On Fremont Street, folks pay $20 a head to see Tribute-Palooza, a set of eight bands that imitate major acts like U2, Kiss, and Elton John. Details: For Fremont Street, see vegasexperience.com. For the Strip, see visitlasvegas.com. Hot tip: The Las Vegas Monorail runs until 3 a.m.; a special one-day pass costs $12. New Orleans: Gumbo and pigskin . As in years past, New Orleans puts its own twist on New York City's ball drop. Its spotlit gumbo pot drops from the Jax Brewery at midnight. Its fall prompts a nightlong bar crawl in the historic French Quarter. This year, is the 75th anniversary of the Sugar Bowl, and the football matchup takes place on January 2. Expect a football theme for most of the weekend's events. For example, in Jackson Square after the gumbo pot drop, a light-and-sound display will synchronize the fight song of each team playing in the Bowl this year with the appearance of each team's colors in the sky. Details: neworleansonline.com. Hot tip: Hop the ferry from Canal Street to Algiers Point (friendsoftheferry.org), where you can get a comparatively peaceful view of fireworks. The free ferry departs every 30 minutes from 6:15 a.m. to 1:15 a.m. on New Year's Eve. Reykjavík: Fantasy and flames . Icelandic law allows a firework free-for-all on New Year's Eve, making for a raucous night in the capital city. Friends and neighbors sing folk songs at roughly half-a-dozen bonfires scattered across Reykjavík. Note that on this holiday, local bars and clubs open a little after midnight. Details: visitreykjavik.is. Hot tip: Temperatures typically dip to about 23 degrees Fahrenheit. The warmest way to enjoy the celebrations is to take a coach tour. Iceland Excursions' Gray Line stops at the largest bonfires for $71 per adult. A midnight toast of sparkling wine is included, of course. Rio de Janeiro: Beach party . The two-and-a-half mile stretch of Copacabana Beach plays host to more than two million partygoers decked out in traditional white. Cariocas (as the locals call themselves) make offerings of red roses and white gladioli to Iemanjá, the goddess of the waters, before an all-night whirlwind of dancing and live concerts. Head to majestic Sugarloaf Mountain for a somewhat quieter vantage point for taking in the fireworks display. Details: rioconventionbureau.com.br. Hot tip: Looking for passion? Wear a hint of red to send the right message. Sydney: First to cheer . Because of its location, Sydney is among the first major cities to greet the new year. The city will synch up its pyrotechnics with colorful lighting effects on the arches of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Revelers gear up earlier in the day. Waterfront events attract crowds of Sydneysiders in T-shirts and shorts -- plus indigenous people in traditional garb. Between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., aircraft will run hourly flyovers above Sydney Harbour Bridge. After 9 p.m., 55 illuminated ships circuit Sydney Harbour, foreshadowing the barrage of light and sound to come. Details: sydneynewyearseve.com.au ; the site lists dozens of vantage points and other info. Hot tip: Lay down a blanket at North Head at Sydney Harbour National Park, a relatively uncrowded hangout for gazing at the fireworks. Additional reporting by Amy Cassell.

"(CNN)  -- Three inmates who escaped from prison in Indiana last week then allegedly stole a truck, money and guns were captured Thursday in Nebraska after a high-speed car chase, authorities said. The three escapees, (from left) Jerry Sargent, Christopher Marshall and Bobby Cockerell, were captured in Nebraska. Nebraska State Patrol spokesman Mike Meyer said officers apprehended Christopher Marshall, Jerry Sargent and Bobby Cockerell in Alliance, Nebraska, after a nearly 60-mile chase with speeds reaching up to 100 mph. According to Meyer, law enforcement officers tried twice to spike the tires of the minivan the men were traveling in. They succeeded on the second try about five miles east of Alliance, but the suspects kept driving on flat tires until they were inside the city limits. The men started running when the vehicle stopped. Two were caught, but the third tried to carjack a vehicle at gunpoint before being arrested by an Alliance Police officer, according to Meyer. It is not yet known which escapee tried to take the vehicle at gunpoint. No shots were fired and no one was seriously injured, Meyer said. The three men broke out of the Branchville Correctional Facility near Tell City, Indiana, last week, authorities said. Tell City is about 80 miles west of Louisville, Kentucky. Police believe the three stole guns during a home-invasion robbery in Sanders, Kentucky, earlier this week. New arrest warrants charge them with possessing stolen firearms as well as felony possession of firearms, said George Huffman, spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Because they were convicted of violent crimes, he said, they are not allowed to possess firearms at all. Police suspect the three of stealing a truck from a town near the prison and robbing three brothers in Sanders, about 65 miles east of Louisville, early Monday. The brothers were attacked, bound and held in their home for about an hour and a half while their assailants made off with guns and money, according to the Kentucky State Police. One of the three brothers was hospitalized after the attack, while the other two were treated and released. CNN's Melissa Roberts contributed to this report.","The men were captured in Alliance, Nebraska, after a car chase .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The only checks Chris Chelios should be concerned about are the ones he's writing for his children's college tuition, but instead he still has the next body check into the hockey boards on his mind. At 48 years old, Chelios is the oldest American and second oldest player ever to play professional hockey. The veteran of 26 seasons in the National Hockey League has won the Stanley Cup three times, once in Montreal, Quebec, and twice in Detroit, Michigan. Now, the Chicago, Illinois, native has been called up from the American Hockey League's Chicago Wolves to the NHL's Atlanta Thrashers. ""Hopefully I can provide a little bit of leadership with what I bring to the table,"" Chelios said. ""It is a black cloud over my head -- that 48,"" he said. ""I got to go out on the ice and prove it."" Chelios is 30 years older than his youngest teammate, Evander Kane. Six of his teammates weren't born when his NHL career began. Still, cracks about age don't come up in the locker room. ""Most of the guys from my team have been pretty respectful that way, but I'm so used to hearing it from the fans and from other teams that it doesn't bother me,"" the defenseman said. Teammate Ron Hainsey said the jokes are minimal. ""You probably won't hear too many from these guys because he might start skating circles around guys here."" Hainsey, like most of the Atlanta Thrashers, grew up watching Chelios play. ""He's in as good of shape as anybody here,"" Hainsey said. ""It's just simply incredible for his age."" In his 9th NHL season, Hainsey has played in about 600 professional hockey games compared to Chelios' 1,600 professional games. ""If there's anybody who's seen just about everything, he's got to be the guy who's it,"" Hainsey said. ""We're going to soak up everything we can from him while he's here."" Chelios still plays hard, but he doesn't play as many minutes as he did in his 20s. When he is on the ice, Hainsey said, Chelios seems to always be in the right place at the right time. ""I think I'm a little smarter than the young guys, but they got their speed that makes up for the lack of smarts,"" Chelios said. Thrashers Head Coach John Anderson is just five years older than Chelios. ""He loves the game. He loves to play and it's not about the money anymore. It's about wanting to win and wanting to play,"" Anderson said. ""I was kidding our defense coach [Todd] Nelson,"" Anderson said. ""I said this is probably the last time in your whole career you're going to get to coach somebody older than you."" Chelios is married with four kids who live in the Detroit area. He has two daughters in high school, one son in college and another son heading to college soon. ""It's been a pretty tough adjustment for me not being with them,"" Chelios said.

"(CNN)  -- Lionel Messi has replaced David Beckham as the best-paid player in world football, according to France Football magazine's annual ""rich list"". Beckham has topped the list for the last two years, but World Player of the Year Messi is now the highest earner. The Barcelona star has estimated annual earnings of €33 million ($44.1m) with Beckham left trailing on €30.4 million ($40.64m). Beckham suffered World Cup heartbreak when rupturing his Achilles tendon while on loan at AC Milan from Los Angeles Galaxy, dashing his hopes of appearing in the finals for the fourth time with England. Blog: Is Messi better than Maradona ? He has suffered a slight drop in income compared to 2009, partly due to the falling value of the dollar, but Beckham has been in the top two of the list for the past nine years to show his enduring appeal. Messi, in outstanding form for reigning Spanish and European champions with successive La Liga hat-tricks, boosted his earnings through bonuses as Barcelona did the treble last year under Pep Guardiola. According to France Football, Messi's annual wage is made up of a €10 million ($13.36m) basic salary, €4 million ($5.36m) in bonuses and €19 million ($25.4m) from endorsements and sponsorships, which include Adidas, Pepsi Cola and Gillette. Messi's predecessor as World Player of the Year, Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo is a close third in the list on €30 million ($40.08m) but there is a big gap to the fourth-placed player, Ronaldo's teammate Kaka on €18.8 million ($25.11m).

"(CNN) -- The nickname was meant as a joke, a little needle from Marvel Comics mainstay Stan Lee to artist Jack Kirby. Jack Kirby drew himself surrounded by his creations, including Captain America and the Fantastic Four. But more than a decade after Kirby's death, the name still fits: He is ""The King."" Consider some of the heroes Kirby helped create, many of which now pervade pop culture: The Fantastic Four, the X-Men, the Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America. His distinctive action-packed style became the model for many comic-book artists. When he died in 1994, artist Gary Panter did a two-page spread in The New Yorker as a tribute. Michael Chabon dedicated his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about two comic book creators, ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,"" to Kirby. Not bad for a guy whose chosen medium was looked down upon for decades. ""Jack ... was a brilliant man and an incredibly hard-working man,"" said Mark Evanier, author of the new ""Kirby: King of Comics"" (Abrams), a lavishly illustrated biography of the artist. ""He produced an incredible volume of work.""  Gallery: The work of Jack Kirby » . It's not surprising that Marvel's art -- and those it influenced -- would start to look distinctly Kirby-esque, Marvel artist Herb Trimpe said at a Kirby panel in February. ""Everyone was so influenced by him -- his work was so powerful and unique -- that it was inevitable."" Kirby was born Jacob Kurtzberg in New York and grew up on Manhattan's Lower East Side, where his adventures with gangs would later filter into many of his heroes. In particular, the rough-and-tumble Ben Grimm, also known as the Thing of the Fantastic Four, was a self-caricature, Evanier observes. After short stints at a newspaper syndicate and as an animator, he ended up at Marvel's predecessor, Timely Comics, where he and partner Joe Simon created Captain America, a huge hit during World War II. With Captain America came some of Kirby's comic book innovations, Evanier says. Comic books, which had started as reprints of newspaper comic strips, had adhered to that form's look of repetitious boxes. Kirby and Simon used different-sized panels, varying shapes, even full pages. ""They kind of invented things that made comic books different than strips,"" Evanier said. They realized they ""had the whole page to play with. ... They'd take three or four pages for a single action scene."" Simon and Kirby went to Timely rival DC and then formed their own studio after serving in World War II. The popular genres then were crime and horror comics, and Simon-Kirby created a handful, including the dramatically named ""Justice Traps the Guilty."" They also pioneered the romance genre, juxtaposing Kirby's innately thrilling style with primly dressed women and men in neat suits and sweaters. But while competitors like E.C. Comics dangled severed heads on their covers, Kirby and Simon opted for a lower key. ""They kept it tamer, deliberately,"" Evanier said. ""Jack didn't like the gory stuff."" Ironically, the one area in which Kirby was willing to draw blood, so to speak, was with war comics: The cover of a 1954 title, ""The Guys in the Foxhole,"" pictures a heavily bandaged soldier writing a letter home, with the obvious aftermath of a battle behind him. ""The Guys in the Foxhole"" wasn't the kind of comic to be approved by the Comics Code Authority, the organization set up to placate authorities railing against the crime and horror comics, and soon it -- and dozens of other titles -- were out of business. Kirby bounced around for a few years. Then, back at the company soon to be named Marvel, he and Stan Lee created the Fantastic Four in 1961. As Evanier writes, the heroic quartet ""had uncommon depth and personality"" for comic book personalities. That kind of humanity would become the mainstay of the Lee-Kirby work and what many still think of as a golden age of comics created by them and other Marvel talents, including Steve Ditko and John Romita. Heroes were born one after another: Thor (1962), Spider-Man (1962), Iron Man (1963), the X-Men (1963), Daredevil (1964). In ""Kirby: King of Comics,"" Evanier notes that from 1962 to 1964 alone, Kirby drew more than 3,000 pages and 285 covers. He was a workhorse, and he was becoming famous, but he wasn't becoming rich. ""Jack was not a good businessman,"" Evanier said. ""He didn't take a week off; he was a Depression-era kid. And he was terrified of not having a weekly paycheck."" When Evanier met Kirby in 1970 -- he served as Kirby's assistant for two years -- ""he was as successful as you could be in comics, but he wasn't particularly well-paid."" Kirby left Marvel in 1970, not long after the company was sold. (The garrulous Stan Lee, who was assumed by the new owners to be the company's creative genius, stayed on.) Kirby went to DC for a few years, but the company ""didn't give him much better terms,"" Evanier said. But as new generations discovered comic books, they discovered Jack Kirby, defending him amid the corporate takeovers and boosting his spirits. He got some of his work back -- rights issues plagued him -- and he never lost his creative power. (However, with great power comes great responsibility: Kirby didn't drive a car, Evanier said, ""because with his mind going, he'd run off the road. Most people's minds go from A to B to C; Jack's mind went from A to K to W."") Kirby was matter-of-fact about his talent; he loved to draw, and he tried to treat his readers with respect. ""I don't think the average reader believes in fairy tales, and I've never given them fairy tales,"" Kirby once said. ""Yes, I've given them fictionalized drama, but this is drama that is enacted by real people."" Fourteen years after his death, his power continues to radiate. ""When I go to comics conventions, I walk around, and there's Kirby everywhere,"" Evanier said. ""And I'm constantly encountering people who tell me what Jack meant to them."" Though he didn't leave his widow with a fortune, as he had hoped, he left a reputation as a good man and a great artist. He may even, Evanier says, have had a little bit of the superhero about him. ""He took the comic book to a different level,"" the author said. ""There was a very positive force of energy around him."" E-mail to a friend .","Jack Kirby helped create many famed superheroes .

"(CNN) -- A woman to woman talk between Oprah Winfrey and the former head of her South African girls school ended with the settlement of a defamation lawsuit against the talk show host, their lawyers said. Lerato Nomvuyo Mzamane sued Winfrey, contending she defamed Mzamane when talking about an abuse scandal at the school she ran in 2007. The case was set for trial in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, starting March 29. ""The two parties met woman to woman without their lawyers and are happy that they could resolve this dispute peacefully to their mutual satisfaction,"" the attorneys said in a joint statement Tuesday. Mzamane was immediately suspended and later fired after several students at Winfrey's South African leadership academy complained about abuse. A dorm mother was later charged with abusing and assaulting students. The lawsuit contended that Winfrey's statements at a private meeting with parents, which later became public, and at a news conference defamed the headmistress by implying she knew of the abuse and covered it up. Mzamane said the abuse complaints were never brought to her and that Winfrey never let her explain. ""Ms. Winfrey testified in her deposition that she did not intend the implications placed on her words by the plaintiff,"" the joint statement said. ""Ms. Mzamane testified in her deposition that she has no evidence that Ms. Winfrey knowingly made a false statement about her or entertained serious doubt about the truth of what she said."" U.S. District Judge Eduardo Robreno ruled a week ago that Winfrey's comments could potentially be interpreted by a jury to be defamatory. The decision cleared the path for a trial. The suit quoted Winfrey telling parents that ""any person that has caused harm"" to students would be let go. In the next sentence, Winfrey said she fired Mzamane because she had lost confidence in her ability to run the school. Winfrey also told the parents that when students brought their complaints to the headmistress, she ""had not taken them seriously,"" the suit said. The suit said one Winfrey quote cited suggested Mzamane, a native of the African kingdom of Lesotho, did not have a high-enough level of care for the students: . ""It was my intention by putting somebody in charge who was African, and was female, I believed that she would care as much for these girls as I do myself. I'm sorry I was let down."" Mzamane's suit said the damage to her reputation resulted in her not being able to get another education job for a year. When Winfrey opened the school at the beginning of 2007, she said she hoped it would provide opportunities to girls from poor backgrounds. She personally approved each of the students, many of whom were at the top of their classes.","The talk show host founded a girls leadership school in South Africa in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- A December rampage that killed hundreds in the Democratic Republic of Congo went largely unreported because of lack of communications in the remote area, a United Nations official said Sunday. The Lord's Resistance Army carried out the brutal campaign in northeastern Congo over four days, killing at least 321, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. Rebels also abducted 250 others -- including at least 80 children -- when they attacked villages in Makombo area, the human rights group said Saturday. Alan Doss, a United Nations Special Representative for Congo, confirmed the massacre and said the world body was made aware of the attacks in December and confirmed some deaths in January. ""The area is remote, there's no intelligence or communications, we had to cross check,"" Doss said. The United Nations cannot corroborate the number of deaths reported by Human Rights Watch, but has confirmed more than 100 killed so far, he said. ""The area is the size of Spain,"" Doss said. ""It has no infrastructure ... we are working on efforts to get better communications to make it less isolated."" The Lord's Resistance Army was initially based in Uganda, but now works near the borders of Central African Republic, Sudan and Congo. It has been accused of killing, abducting and mutilating scores of people in the past. In the Congo attack, gangs tied up villagers -- including women and children -- and hacked them to death, Human Rights Watch said. They also crushed their skulls with axes and heavy wooden sticks, the report said. The anti-Ugandan government rebel group is led by self-declared prophet Joseph Kony. It claims its insurgency aims to replace the Ugandan government with a democracy based on the Ten Commandments. President Yoweri Museveni pushed it out of Uganda in 2005. Five years ago, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for senior rebel leaders for crimes in northern Uganda, but those indicted remain at large. The Makombo massacre is the deadliest documented attack by the LRA since rampages around Christmas 2008 left scores of Congolese dead. Dozens of other attacks against civilians have been carried out in other areas in recent months, Human Rights Watch said.","A rebel group in Congo killed at least 321 civilians, Human Rights Watch said .

"London, England (CNN)  -- British citizens who travel to Israel should be aware that their passport details could be captured for ""improper uses,"" Britain's Foreign Office warned Tuesday. It follows Britain's expulsion of an Israeli diplomat and its accusation that the Israeli government was responsible for forging British passports used in an international murder plot. Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Tuesday that there are ""compelling reasons"" to believe Israel was behind it. Twelve suspects in the January murder of Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, who was found dead in his Dubai hotel room, used British passports, the Dubai police have said. Miliband said the passports had been copied from ""genuine British passports"" in a ""highly sophisticated operation,"" indicating that a state intelligence service was responsible. The Foreign Office changed its official travel advice Tuesday for British citizens going to Israel, to warn them about the risk of their passport details being compromised. A British investigation ""found circumstantial evidence of Israeli involvement in the fraudulent use of British passports,"" the advice says. ""This has raised the possibility that your passport details could be captured for improper uses while your passport is out of your control. The risk applies in particular to passports without biometric security features. ""We recommend that you only hand your passport over to third parties, including Israeli officials, when absolutely necessary."" Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency concluded that the 12 British people whose passports were cloned were ""wholly innocent victims of identity theft,"" the foreign secretary said. Israel has a stated policy on security matters of neither confirming nor denying involvement. Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said the British government would be giving its report on the passports to the Australian Federal Police, who are investigating how some of their country's passports came to be used by the Dubai suspects. In an interview Tuesday with the Australian Broadcasting Company, Smith said Australia was not taking any action yet. ""We have an investigation underfoot, and we will await the results of that investigation by the Australian Federal Police,"" Smith said. He added: ""We're treating this matter very seriously. Israel understands that, and when I receive the report (from the federal police), we'll make judgments which will be in Australia's national interest."" Dubai police had previously said three Australian passports were used in the murder plot, but Smith said there were four. He said there is nothing to indicate that the holders of the passports were anything but ""innocent victims"" in the crime. Al-Mabhouh, a founding member of Hamas' military wing, was found dead January 20 in his Dubai hotel room. Police believe he was killed the night before, allegedly by the secretive Israeli foreign intelligence unit Mossad. A source close to the investigation said Wednesday that the total number of suspects had increased to 28, from 27, after Australia confirmed the use of a fourth passport. Six suspects used Irish passports, four used French documents, one had German papers and four had Australian papers. There is also one Palestinian suspect, police have said. Interpol expands search for suspects . Lt. Gen. Dahi Khalfan Tamim, Dubai police chief, has said not all the suspects had fraudulent passports. ""We know some of the names are real,"" he said. Interpol, the international police agency, has issued ""red notices"" to help search for the suspects. The notices are not international arrest warrants, but are a way of alerting police forces around the world that the suspects are wanted by United Arab Emirates authorities.","UK warns citizens who travel to Israel passports could be copied for ""improper uses""

"(CNN) -- A rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo killed at least 321 civilians and abducted 250 others -- including at least 80 children -- in a previously unreported rampage late last year, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Saturday. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) carried out the brutal campaign in northeastern Congo over four days in December, the report said. LRA forces attacked at least 10 villages from December 14 to 17, killing and abducting hundreds of civilians -- including women and children, according to Human Rights Watch. LRA combatants tied up villagers in the nation's remote Makombo area and hacked them to death with machetes or crushed their skulls with axes and heavy wooden sticks, the report said. Most of those killed were adult men, but at least 13 women and 23 children were among the dead -- including a 3-year-old girl who was burned to death, according to Human Rights Watch. The LRA also killed those they abducted who walked too slowly or tried to escape, Human Rights Watch said. According to those who managed to escape, children captured by the LRA were forced to kill other children who had disobeyed the LRA's rules, the report said. In numerous cases, children were ordered to surround the victim in a circle and take turns beating the child on the head with a large wooden stick until the child died, the report said. ""The Makombo massacre is one of the worst ever committed by the LRA in its bloody 23-year history, yet it has gone unreported for months,"" said Anneke Van Woudenberg, a senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""The four-day rampage demonstrates that the LRA remains a serious threat to civilians and is not a spent force, as the Ugandan and Congolese governments claim."" CNN could not independently confirm the massacre. Human Rights Watch said that the roughly 1,000 United Nations peacekeeping troops in LRA-affected parts of northeastern Congo are insufficient to protect civilians. The peacekeeping force is considering removing some troops from the area under pressure from the Congolese government, a move Human Rights Watch warned against on Saturday. The U.N. Security Council is planning to visit Congo in mid-April to discuss the peacekeeping force's plans for withdrawal and the protection of civilians, Human Rights Watch said. The Congolese government denies that the LRA is still a serious threat in the country, which may have contributed to the absence of reports about the December massacre, Human Rights Watch said. ""We have been forgotten,"" an 80-year-old Congolese man whose son was killed during the massacre told Human Rights Watch. ""It's as if we don't exist."" ""The government says the LRA are no longer a problem, but I know that's not true,"" he said. ""I beg of you, please talk to others about what has happened to us."" The LRA is led by self-declared mystic and prophet Joseph Kony, who claims his insurgency -- which began in 1986 -- is aimed at replacing Uganda's government, led by President Yoweri Museveni, with a democracy based on the Bible's Ten Commandments. After being pushed out of Uganda in 2005, the LRA now operates in the remote border area between southern Sudan, Congo, and Central African Republic. In 2005, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for senior LRA leaders for crimes they committed in northern Uganda, but those indicted remain at large. The two commanders who perpetrated the December massacre report to one of those indicted leaders, according to Human Rights Watch. The Makombo massacre is the deadliest documented attack by the LRA since killing sprees around Christmas 2008 left scores of Congolese dead, but dozens of other attacks against civilians have been carried out in other areas in recent months, Human Rights Watch said.","A rebel group in Congo killed at least 321 civilians, Human Rights Watch said .

"Washington (CNN)  -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced Thursday that the Pentagon will start to ease its enforcement of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy prohibiting homosexuals from serving openly in the military. Among other things, Gates said the Pentagon is raising the threshold for what constitutes an appropriate level of information necessary to launch a ""credible inquiry"" into allegations of homosexual behavior. The change, which will take effect in 30 days and apply to all current cases, is a reflection of ""common sense"" and ""common decency,"" Gates said. ""These changes reflect some of the insights we have gained over 17 years of implementing the current law, including the need for consistency, oversight and clear standards."" President Obama and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, support a legislative repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" which was first enacted in 1993. Some senior members of the military, however, have expressed concern over the impact of the ban's repeal on unit cohesion and morale, among other things. Is this the right move? Share your thoughts . Last month, Gates announced the Pentagon had taken the first steps to prepare for a repeal of the policy. Laying the groundwork for such a change will take more than a year, he said. In the interim, he said, the Defense Department will start enforcing the policy ""in a fairer manner."" Gates said Thursday that, moving ahead: . • The Pentagon will raise the level of the officer authorized to start a fact-finding inquiry or separation proceeding as a result of alleged homosexual conduct to a general or flag officer in the accused service member's chain of command. • Only a lieutenant colonel, Navy commander or higher ranking officer will be authorized to conduct a fact-finding inquiry. • Only a general or flag officer in an accused service member's chain of command will be authorized to initiate expulsion proceedings. • The Pentagon will revise what constitutes credible information to begin an inquiry or separation proceeding. For example, Gates, said, the Defense Department will specify that information given by third parties should be given under oath. The use of ""overheard statements"" and ""hearsay"" will be discouraged. • The Pentagon will revise what constitutes a ""reliable person"" upon which an inquiry can be initiated. According to Gates, ""special scrutiny"" will be given to ""third parties who may be motivated to harm a service member."" • Certain categories of confidential information will no longer be used in discharge proceedings, including information provided to lawyers, clergy and psychotherapists. Information provided to a doctor as part of a service member's medical treatment or to a medical official in the course of a public health inquiry also will not be used in discharge proceedings. Information given for either a security clearance investigation or in the course of seeking professional assistance for domestic or physical abuse also will be excluded. Last month, Gates told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that ""a guiding principle of our efforts [to change the policy on gays in the military] will be to minimize disruption and polarization within the ranks, with special attention paid to those serving on the front lines."" Gates also said the Pentagon will ask the RAND Corp. to update a study it conducted in 1993 on the impact of allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the military. Since the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy was implemented, more than 13,500 service members have been discharged, according to U.S. Rep. Jim Moran, D-Virginia. In 2009, there were 428 discharges under the policy, the lowest rate of discharge since implementation, he said. The highest year was 2001, with 1,227 discharges. Sixty-nine percent of Americans believe openly gay people should be allowed to serve in the military, according to a February 12-15 CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll. Twenty-seven percent are opposed to such a change, the survey found. In 1994, shortly after the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy was implemented, 53 percent of Americans believed openly gay people should be allowed to serve in the military, while 41 percent were opposed.

"Searchlight, Nevada (CNN) -- Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin kicked off a Tea Party rally Saturday in Sen. Harry Reid's hometown, encouraging disgruntled Americans to ""take back our country"" while attacking what she called the ""Obama-Pelosi-Reid spending spree."" ""There's no better place to kick off the Tea Party Express than Harry Reid's hometown,"" Palin said at the rally, dubbed ""Showdown in Searchlight,"" aimed at conjuring up support for the Senate Majority Leader's defeat in November elections. Activists -- some of whom are calling the gathering the largest retirement party in the world -- hope it will carry a strong symbolic message. Reid, the Senate majority leader, is credited with helping push through Congress the controversial health care bill that President Barack Obama signed Tuesday, as well as the ""fixes"" measure that passed Thursday. ""Washington has broken faith with the people that they are to be serving,"" Palin told the crowd, which numbered in the thousands. Palin said the message to government leaders was ""loud and clear."" ""The big government, the big debt, Obama-Pelosi-Reid spending spree is over. You're fired,"" she said, prompting cheers from the crowd. Are you there or at another Tea Party? Share your video, images . Palin's speech Saturday echoed many of her recent appearances at Tea Party events as she promoted ""common sense conservative values"" and decried ""elites in Washington"" and big government spending. She addressed recent criticism of a post on her Facebook page that called for conservatives not to retreat in the wake of the health care vote, but ""reload."" Some critics have suggested the post encouraged violent acts against those who voted in favor of the legislation. ""Let's clear the air right now,"" she said. ""We're not inciting violence. Don't get sucked into the lame-stream media lies about Americans standing up for freedom. it's a bunch of bunk that the media is trying to feed you. Don't let them try to divert"" attention from the issue. Other expected speakers included Gov. Jim Gibbons, a Republican, who told CNN's Ed Henry the event was ""a great way to kick off a very intense political season."" In a statement to CNN, Reid said he was ""happy so many people came to see my hometown of Searchlight and spend their out-of-state money especially in these tough economic times. Ultimately, though, this election will be decided by Nevadans, not people from other states who parachute in for one day to have a tea party."" Not far from the rally site, the State Democratic party and the Reid campaign have set up a hospitality tent. ""We are serving tea and donut holes in recognition that Sen. Reid just passed health care reform, and [that] we're closing the Medicare donut hole,"" said Zac Petkanas, deputy communications director for the Reid campaign. It's staffed, he added, ""with real Nevadans from Nevada and folks from Searchlight who support Reid."" The senator, meanwhile, is spending Saturday with the National Rifle Association's executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre. The Reid campaign describes LaPierre as ""one of the senator's supporters."" The two are attending the grand opening of the $60 million Clark County Shooting Park north of Las Vegas that, according to the Reid campaign, wouldn't have opened without the senator's help. Reid is arguably the Tea Party's top target. He carries a lot of political baggage in a year that finds much anger directed at incumbents. ""He is one of the three faces of the Democratic agenda in Washington, which right now is unpopular,"" said Nevada political newsletter editor Jon Ralston. Recent polls from the Mason-Dixon organization show 33 percent of those polled have a favorable view of Reid, while 52 percent said they have an unfavorable view of the senator -- some of the worst numbers he has faced in years. ""I don't think many voters in Nevada dislike me. I think we have an economic situation in Nevada that is very difficult,"" Reid told CNN in a recent interview in Las Vegas. The state's economy is in dire straits. It leads the nation in foreclosures, and its 13 percent unemployment rate is second only behind Michigan's. Those vying to challenge Reid on the Republican side are pouncing. ""He has lost touch with what is going on here in Nevada,"" said businesswoman and former state GOP Chairwoman Sue Lowden, who is leading the pack among the Republican hopefuls. ""It is all about jobs. His solution is to put the country more in debt -- to tax the country more -- to put our children and grandchildren at risk for years and years of being in debt,"" she added. Earlier this month, Lowden told CNN she's a proud member of the Tea Party movement. Another Republican challenger, businessman Danny Tarkanian, said Reid has ""alienated himself from the people of Nevada, and the economy is getting worse and worse and worse."" Also not helping Reid were two recent quips by Obama about not wasting money in Las Vegas. Reid, who is not facing a serious primary challenge, last year aired ads aimed at promoting what he has done to help improve the economy, as well as introducing himself to hundreds of thousands of new voters who have moved to Nevada since his last election. ""To say Harry Reid is going to run a scorched-earth campaign against whomever this nominee is ... he has a reputation for doing whatever it takes to win -- no more so than this year. And he is going to have all the money to do it,"" Ralston said. For his part, Reid -- known as a tenacious fighter who has come out ahead in previous close elections -- will push the message against his opponents of how much he has done for the state. But he said he will not campaign differently than he has in the past. ""People in the state of Nevada know me,"" Reid said. ""I'm not going to be changing who I am for an election. I'm just who I was when I started this a long time ago, and I continue to be the same person I used to be, as I am today, and will work very hard to meet the additional requirements that come with a changing economy that we have."" The Tea Party Express is scheduled to end up in Washington on April 15 -- tax day. The group's travel plans are part of its ""Just Vote Them Out! Tour."" Some local organizers prefer to call the Searchlight gathering a ""conservative Woodstock.""

"(CNN) -- World No. 2 Novak Djokovic stumbled at the opening hurdle at the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami, but Rafael Nadal and Andy Roddick cruised into the third round. Second seed Djokovic, who had a first-round bye, was surprisingly beaten 6-2 6-7 (7-9) 6-4 by Belgian Olivier Rochus on Friday. The world No. 59 could have won in straight sets after leveling at 6-6 in the tie-break, but held his nerve to break Djokovic in the final game of the decider to triumph. Serbian Djokovic, the 2007 champion, successfully defended his Dubai title last month but bowed out in the last-16 at Indian Wells two weeks ago. The reward for Rochus is a third-round clash with Brazilian 27th seed Tomaz Bellucci, who defeated American James Blake 3-6 6-1 6-2. Nadal, the tournament's last second seed to lose his opening match in 2006, had no such problems this time as he beat another U.S. player, Taylor Dent, 6-4 6-3. The Spanish fourth seed -- beaten in the semifinals at Indian Wells by Djokovic's conqueror and eventual champion Ivan Ljubicic -- will next play Argentine wildcard David Nalbandian, who overcame Serbian 30th seed Viktor Troicki 6-3 4-6 6-4. Sixth seed Roddick, last weekend's losing finalist, gave home fans some cheer as he crushed Russia's Igor Andreev 6-4 6-4 to set up a clash with Ukraine's Sergiy Stakhovsky. Eight seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga also progressed with a 6-4 6-3 win over Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, and the Frenchman will next play German 28th seed Philip Kohlschreiber. World No. 1 Roger Federer begins his bid for a record-equaling 17th Masters 1000 tournament victory against Ecuador's Nicolas Lapentti on Saturday, while third seed and defending champion Andy Murray takes on American Mardy Fish. In the women's tournament, Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin made it a good day all-round for Belgium as the former world No. 1s progressed into the third round. Clijsters, the 14th seed but champion in Miami in 2005, crushed 20-year-old Czech Petra Kvitova 6-1 6-1 to earn a third-round clash with Israel's Shahar Peer. Henin, seeded 33rd after receiving a wildcard, beat Elena Dementieva for the second time in her comeback season, winning 6-3 6-2 against the Russian fifth seed. The Australian Open runner-up will next play Slovakian 26th seed Dominika Cibulkova. Second seed Caroline Wozniacki came from behind to defeat Bulgarian qualifier Tsvetana Pironkova 3-6 6-3 6-4 and set up a third-round tie with Russia's Maria Kirilenko. The Dane had to come back from 3-1 down in the second set and 3-0 adrift in the decider. Fourth seed and defending champion Victoria Azarenka also progressed with Indian Wells winner and No. 7 Jelena Jankovic, No. 9 Samantha Stosur and Russia's No. 11 Vera Zvonareva.","World No. 2 Novak Djokovic loses opening match at Sony Ericsson Open in Miami .

"(CNN)  -- Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin spoke Friday at a rally for her former running mate, Sen. John McCain, urging voters to support the senator in his re-election bid in Arizona. The rally, in Tucson, Arizona, was their first joint public appearance since McCain conceded the 2008 presidential election. McCain faces a primary challenge from former Rep. J.D. Hayworth and has come under criticism for being too moderate on a variety of issues, including immigration. Several leading Tea Party activists in Arizona have decided not to endorse McCain or Hayworth, criticizing both of their records while serving in Congress. But some national Tea Party members came out this week in support of Hayworth. While several said they were not upset with Palin's endorsement of McCain, a few said they were disappointed. The enthusiastic crowd greeted Palin with shouts of ""Sarah, Sarah,"" as she, her husband, Todd, and McCain took the stage. ""Everybody here, supporting John McCain, we are all part of that Tea Party movement,"" Palin said. ""I think he's gonna win this one,"" she said. ""Before there were protests on Main Street and marches on Capitol Hill, there was the maverick of the Senate, fighting for us."" Palin railed against the health care legislation, saying that McCain fought against ""Obamacare."" And McCain, speaking after Palin, said the bill will be repealed. ""It is historic that it is also the first time that on a pure partisan basis a major piece of legislation has been passed and it is going to be historic because it is going to be repealed and replaced,"" he said. ""And it is going to be done soon."" Palin's remarks at the rally were preceded by an op-ed piece in Friday's Arizona Republic. She wrote that she respected McCain long before she was his running mate, a theme she reiterated in her public appearance. Read the full article . ""I admired his tireless crusade against the old pork-barrel-spending, earmarking-backroom-dealing ways of D.C. that make a whole lot of us pretty ill,"" she said. After a town hall meeting on Thursday night attended by about 120 people, Hayworth downplayed the significance of Palin's visit. ""I think what we are seeing from the governor is a very understandable level of gratitude. After all, it was John who gave her entrée to the national stage. We all understand gratitude. That is fine,"" he said. The campaign appearance comes as Palin is being criticized for a fundraising appeal she posted on her Facebook page with what looked like crosshairs marking the districts of House members who voted for health care reform. She asked for donations to her political action committee to help defeat 17 congressmen who voted yes and who are running for re-election. In a Twitter message earlier in the week Palin said ""Don't Retreat-Instead, RELOAD!"" urging supporters to keep up the fight on the issue. The messages came as members of Congress were reporting threats in retaliation to their votes on health care reform. However, McCain told CNN's ""John King, USA"" on Thursday that Palin's language was not over the top. ""The rhetoric that we use in everyday language about political campaigns -- battleground states, it's going to be a war -- all of those are things that we have used for years and years. They are in the crosshairs."" From Arizona, Palin heads to Searchlight, Nevada, to be the keynote speaker Saturday for the kickoff rally of the Tea Party Express cross-country caravan to protest big government spending.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods' popularity has plummeted -- but most Americans will still be rooting for him to win when he tees up at the Masters tournament in April, a new national poll suggests. Nearly 60 percent of those who answered a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey said they wanted the embattled golfer to win the event at Georgia's Augusta National course, which would be his fifth victory there. Twenty percent said they did not want him to win and another 20 percent said they did not care. The Masters will be Woods' first time back in professional golf since his November car crash outside his home and the media frenzy about his extramarital affairs. And even though Woods has taken a hiatus from playing, 52 percent of those polled said they think Woods will win the Masters, the first of the golf season's four major tournaments which runs from April 5-11. An overwhelming majority of those polled, 75 percent, thought it was appropriate for Woods to return at the Masters and that he did not have to wait longer. But still, a majority of those polled, 45 percent, had an unfavorable view of Woods. Forty-three percent had a favorable view. These numbers are in striking contrast to 2005 when about 85 percent of those polled had a favorable view of Woods. Woods' public woes began with an early-morning crash November 27 outside his Orlando-area home, when he suffered minor injuries after striking a fire hydrant and a tree with his Cadillac SUV. Woods was not required to talk to police about the wreck and declined to talk with investigators on several occasions. Eventually, he was cited for careless driving. The accident occurred days after the tabloid National Enquirer named Woods as having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess. The woman has denied the allegation, but several others have come forward to claim that they had sexual relationships with Woods, who has two children with his wife, former model Elin Nordegren. In a carefully-managed March statement, delivered to a small, hand-picked crowd, Woods said he was in inpatient therapy for 45 days from the end of December to early February for ""issues,"" which he did not explain. The controversy prompted several major sponsors to suspend or drop their relationships with Woods, who also apologized to his business partners for his behavior.","Tiger Woods' popularity has plummeted since media frenzy about his extramarital affairs .

"Washington (CNN) -- Public schools in Western states can continue teacher-led reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance, after a federal court ruled against a group of atheist parents. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, California, ruled 2-1 Thursday that the pledge does not represent a government endorsement of religion, prohibited by the Constitution. ""The Pledge of Allegiance serves to unite our vast nation through the proud recitation of some of the ideals upon which our republic was founded and for which we continue to strive: one Nation under God,"" wrote the majority. ""Millions of people daily recite these words when pledging allegiance to the United States of America."" The ruling applies only to the 11 states and territories in the West covered by the 9th Circuit, but it reinforces other rulings from other courts upholding the pledge. The same appeals court also ruled separately Thursday, upholding the use of the words ""In God We Trust"" on U.S. money. The lawsuit was brought by several parents in the Sacramento, California, area who objected to the school policy. Among them is Michael Newdow, a prominent attorney and atheist, who had brought his long-standing dispute to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2004. The justices had dismissed that earlier appeal on purely technical grounds, over questions he lacking standing as a custodial parent to bring the lawsuit on behalf of his school-age daughter. Newdow then recruited other parents into the current case. Newdow said he would appeal Thursday's decision but acknowledged his dim prospects going forward. ""This was the appeal and this is the end of the road in terms of what you're guaranteed,"" he said. Newdow said he'll ask for a rehearing and, if that fails, will appeal to the Supreme Court. ""But they don't have to take it,"" he said, referring to the nation's high court, ""and the odds are pretty good that they won't."" A woman identified only as Jan Roe was a key plaintiff, arguing she did not believe in God. She claimed the daily recitation interfered with her right to direct her child's upbringing and that it indoctrinated her child with the belief that God exists. Children are not required to stand and repeat the pledge, but some parents said the social pressures to conform were an improper infringement of their rights. The plaintiffs now have the option of asking the Supreme Court to hear the case. The appeals court framed the issue as a dispute over whether was a traditional patriotic exercise or a blatant religious message. The same court in 2002 agreed with Newdow and other atheist parents. In dissent to Thursday's ruling, Judge Stephen Reinhardt said the pledge was an overtly religious message. ""Carrying out such an indoctrination in a public school classroom unconstitutionally forces many young children either to profess a religious belief antithetical to their personal views or to declare themselves through their silence or nonparticipation to be protesting nonbelievers, thereby subjecting themselves to hostility and ridicule,"" he wrote. The Supreme Court previously has ruled the mere mention of God or religion by the government in a public setting does not necessarily mean a violation of the ""Establishment Clause"" of the Constitution, which ensures the separation of church and state. Examples that have met high court scrutiny include Ten Commandments or Chanukah menorah displays in a public park; opening a legislative session with a prayer; granting tax breaks for religious organizations; and reimbursing transportation costs for parents whose end their children to parochial schools. The pledge was written in 1892 by Baptist minister and educator Francis Bellamy, who made no reference to religion in his version. It was originally worded: ""I pledge allegiance to my flag and the republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."" It quickly became a part of public school programs. In 1954, Congress added the words ""under God,"" at the urging of the Knights of Columbus and other groups. Another modification was to change ""my flag"" to ""the flag of the United States of America."" ""This decision is a victory for common sense,"" Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson of the Knights of Columbus said in a news release. ""Today, the court got it absolutely right: Recitation of the pledge is a patriotic exercise, not a religious prayer. ... Every reasonable person knows that, and today's decision is a breath of fresh air from a court system that has too often seemed to be almost allergic to public references to God."" The case is Newdow v. Rio Linda Union School District (05-17257).","NEW: Prominent attorney, an atheist, said prospects are dim, but he plans to appeal .

"Vacaville, California (CNN) -- You might think green eggs are only found in a Dr. Seuss classic. But at a small, family-run and highly regarded chicken farm on the outskirts of the San Francisco, they're a relatively common sight. ""Isn't that beautiful?"" said Soul Food Farm owner Alexis Koefed as she held one of the green gems. ""The thing about farm eggs is, once you've had them you can't go back to the store and buy eggs again,"" she said. Chickens at the Soul Food Farm roam freely around the farm's 50 acres. They enjoy vast fields of natural grass and generally live a stress-free life, feasting freely. It's a philosophy unlike that of the industrial chicken farm, and Koefed and her loyal customers believe it produces better eggs and chicken. Soul Food Farm's rise to popularity wasn't limited to locals and the farmer's market regulars. Instead, Koefed's methods attracted the attention of many of the Bay Area's top restaurants and their celebrity chefs, including Alice Waters of the nationally renowned Chez Panise in Berkeley. But an overnight fire in September 2009 raced down the rolling hills surrounding the farm nearly put an end to it. By the time it was extinguished, much of the farm and some 1,200 chicks had perished. With the existence of Soul Food Farm at stake, determined friends, neighbors and loyal customers of the Koefeds came to the rescue. ""It was so inspiring and heartwarming, Koefed said. ""It was a wonderful feeling to know that people cared about the farm as much as I did."" Friend Bonnie Powell organized a fundraising effort of raffles, silent auctions, and dinners. She helped raise $30,000 to build new coops and replace the chicks killed in the fire. ""You can't hear something like that and just go, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry that this thing you have worked so hard for is done and there's nothing anyone can do about it,'"" Powell said. Through the intrepid determination and loyal commitment of a true community, Soul Food Farm is  back on the map.","Soul Food Farm is highly prized by customers, including fine restaurants .

"London, England (CNN)  -- British pensioner Ethel Kendall was ""only 72"" when she left the United Kingdom in 1986 to be closer to her family in Canada. At the time, she was receiving the full British pension of just over £38 ($58) a week. Twenty-four years later, she is still receiving the same amount, and after a European Court of Human Rights ruling Tuesday she is not likely to receive any more. ""You know this isn't about me,"" the 96-year-old told CNN on the phone from her home in Canada. ""It's about the British government's deception and dishonesty. Our contributions were deducted from source with the clear understanding that we would get a full pension on retirement, but somewhere along the lines they changed the rule. In my book, in our book, they're guilty of both fraud and deception."" Kendall is one of more than half a million British expatriates living in countries including Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, whose pensions are not linked to inflation. On Tuesday, the European Court of Human Rights ruled by a majority of 11 to six that the British government had not breached their human rights by failing to ""up-rate"" their pensions to bring them into line with the cost of living. Under British rules, pensioners in a number of countries who do not have reciprocal agreements with the UK receive the same pension they were entitled to in the year they left Britain. People who emigrated before retirement age receive the amount they would have received at retirement age in the UK. In Britain, men qualify for a pension at 65, women at 60. A British expatriate who retires to Australia, for example, receives less money each week than if they had contributed the same amount during their working life and then emigrated to Barbados, Croatia, the Philippines, the United States, or one of more than 40 countries which do have reciprocal UK agreements. Margaret Oxley moved to South Africa at the age of 23 after World War II. Now in her 80s, she receives a UK pension of just £2 ($3) a week. ""The exchange rate is ten to one. Then the bank takes charges you see. No, you can't survive. A loaf of bread is ten rand. I get around 20 rand a week. So it's really not worth bothering about,"" she said. Aging expatriates who have seen their pensions dwindle due to inflation and the falling value of the pound have been campaigning for change. The first court case was brought against the UK government in 2002 by Annette Carson, a British resident who moved to South Africa in 1989. According to court documents, she receives a basic state pension of £67.50 ($103) -- £14.55 ($22) less than she would have received if her pension was index-linked. After failing to make her case in the British High Court, she took her claim to the British Court of Appeal and then the House of Lords. Many saw this week's ruling in the European Court of Human Rights as the last legal avenue for recourse, but they are reluctant to give up the fight. ""I don't think we're going to make it the end of the road,"" said John Markham, director of UK parliamentary affairs for the International Consortium of British Pensioners. ""Certainly I think we're going to mobilize public opinion with the new parliament,"" he added, referring to the upcoming British election expected on May 6. The Vice President of the British Australian Pensioners Association, James Nelson said: ""Now it is up to the people still working or living in Britain to tell their government that they will no longer stand for this injustice. By paying increases in some countries and withholding them in others, the UK government severely limits our freedom of choice regarding where we can retire."" It is estimated that around 250,000 British pensioners living in Australia are affected by the British policy. ""This is a devastating result and it will affect the lives of many British expat pensioners. The living standards of many will only continue to decline,"" said Jim Tilley, Chairman of British Pensions in Australia, who says one elderly woman there receives less than £7 ($10) a week after moving to the country in 1974. In a short statement, the British Department for Work and Pensions said it had noted that the court found in favor of the government. ""We do not therefore plan to make any changes to the current arrangements, which allow for the exportability and up rating of UK State Pensions."" Ethel Kendall is still angry. Not only for herself, she says, but for the pensioners in Britain who may now be reluctant to leave. ""There are many very lonely people we know in the UK who would give anything to come to Canada to join their families but they don't take that risk,"" she said. A former nurse, Kendall worked part-time during and after World War II to ensure she could continue to support her three sons should anything happen to her husband. He was injured but lived for another 26 years after the war ended. A few years after his death, Kendall remarried. Only after losing her second husband in the mid-1980s did she move to join her family in Canada. She sold her home when prices were low but she says it didn't take long before her capital was eroded and she was relying on her UK pension for basic needs. ""It finished up with my family, not exactly subsidizing me with money, but buying big things for me,"" she said. ""I'm 96 now. I've been fortunate; Canada has been good to me. I've been in subsidized housing for 20 years but it shouldn't be that way."" If her pension was indexed Kendall would be receiving £82 ($125) a week, more than twice as much as she does now. ""We'd be lucky the way things are going now if we get a dollar for a pound. So, £82 would be a darn sight better.""","British pensioner Ethel Kendall left the UK in 1986 to be closer to her family in Canada .

"(CNN) -- An Irish bishop resigned amid a Catholic church sex abuse scandal, apologizing in a statement Wednesday for any abuse that occurred in his diocese. Bishop John Magee of the diocese of Cloyne said he tendered his resignation to Pope Benedict XVI on March 9. ""I have been informed today that it has been accepted, and as I depart, I want to offer once again my sincere apologies to any person who has been abused by any priest of the Diocese of Cloyne during my time as bishop or at any time,"" Magee said in a statement posted on the diocese Web site. ""To those whom I have failed in any way, or through any omission of mine have made suffer, I beg forgiveness and pardon."" Child abuse by Catholic clergy in Ireland has become such a widespread scandal that the pope addressed it in an unprecedented pastoral letter to Irish Catholics. Benedict said he was ""truly sorry"" for the abuse. The pope addressed the crisis that has rocked the Irish Catholic Church in an 18-page pastoral letter, which was made public Saturday. Critics said the pope did not go far enough in the letter. The acceptance of Magee's resignation came only days after the pope's letter was published. The leader of Ireland's Roman Catholics, Cardinal Sean Brady, wished Magee well in a statement, but said he had to focus on the victims of abuse. ""Foremost in my thoughts in these days are those who have suffered abuse by clergy and those who feel angry and let down by the often inadequate response of leaders in the Church,"" said Brady, who has himself come under fire for failing to report what he learned during an investigation into a priest who became one of Ireland's most notorious child abusers. Brady was part of an internal Church investigation into Father Brendan Smyth in 1975. He did not report his findings to the police and asked two teenagers who gave him evidence to sign oaths of secrecy. In the past five years, Ireland's Catholic Church has had three separate outside investigations into child abuse -- both sexual and physical -- by priests, nuns, and staff at Catholic-run institutions such as schools and orphanages. Four bishops tendered their resignations in the wake of the most recent, the Murphy Report, which found a widespread tendency to cover up child abuse in the archdiocese of Dublin between 1975 and 2004. Only one of those resignations has been accepted -- that of Bishop Donal Murray on December 17. The resignation of Bishop Magee is not related to any of the recent statutory reports, said Patsy McGarry, religious affairs correspondent for the Irish Times newspaper. Instead, it is rooted in an internal church report on child protection practices in his Cloyne diocese in southern Ireland. In 2008 the Catholic Church's own child protection watchdog, the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland conducted an audit of child protection practices in every diocese in Ireland, McGarry explained. It found those to be ""inadequate, and in some respects dangerous"" in Cloyne diocese. Its findings were published in December 2008, prompting calls for Magee to resign. Magee did not resign, but he was effectively stripped of his authority in March 2009, when Archbishop Dermot Clifford of the neighboring diocese of Cashel and Emly was appointed ""apostolic administrator"" of Cloyne diocese. The Murphy Commission -- which produced the report into the Dublin archdiocese -- is now investigating Cloyne diocese, McGarry said. It is expected to report later this year. Magee, 73, had been bishop of Cloyne since March 1987, according to the Irish Catholic Bishops Conference. Bishops normally retire at 75.

"(CNN) -- China's Li Na took down the No. 4 seed Caroline Wozniacki at the Australian Open on Monday in Melbourne, following compatriot Zheng Jie into the quarterfinals -- the first time Chinese women have made it this far in the season's first Grand Slam. Though Li, the No. 16 seed, had 34 unforced errors compared to Wozniacki's 22, she also nailed 21 winners against three for her opponent. She also made 70 percent of her break point conversions as opposed to 42 percent by Wozniacki. ""Against her, you need to just play on your highest level the whole match through and keep concentrated and keep a lot of balls in play,"" Wozniacki told australianopen.com.

Schiavone hit five aces compared to none for Williams, but she also made more unforced errors -- 32 -- as opposed to 29 for her opponent. ""She played really well in the first set. I have to give her credit. She just played really aggressively. You know, she was making her shots, doing everything she needed to do to win the match,"" Williams told australianopen.com. ""But, you know, obviously it takes a lot to close out a match, especially on an important match like that one. I was able just to get some footing back in and start to execute the way I wanted to.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The high speed, high-rolling world of Formula One is not a sport you would associate with something as mundane as the boiler tucked away in a dusty cupboard in your house. The Fast Forward exhibiton shows how F1 technology can improve all our lives. If you thought that motor racing and the real world are poles apart then an exhibition currently running at the Science Museum in London, England might change your mind. The ""Fast Forward"" exhibition has put together 20 examples of how Formula One technology and innovation has helped improve the wider world. It is testimony to all the hard work, intelligence and ingenuity of the engineers who make the sport what it is today, according to Katie Maggs, one of the exhibition's curators. ""Rather than treating it as a traditional design exhibition, we wanted to look at how the engineers in Formula One use technology in ways that can be experienced in other industries, in the home or in hospitals."" The ""Boiler Buddy"" is a good example of Formula One technology that can be found in the home. Designed to help improve the efficiency of home heating systems, the technology uses the magnetic principles which informed the filter that keeps F1 engines free of particles of dirt and dust. The filter device can be found on the shelves of many hardware stores. There is an impressive variety of objects on display. A bicycle fitted with sensors to monitor wheel speed, angles of lean, heart rate and humidity while riding, is a direct descendant of the sensors attached to Formula One cars which track the performance. The Carbon fibre composite chassis design first introduced into Formula One by McLaren engineer John Barnard in the 1984 has found its way into a range of products outside the sport. Lightweight and incredibly robust, technology using carbon fibre composites are being used to create state-of-the-art furniture. An elegant table on show at the exhibition has a carbon fibre surface that is just two millimeters thick. But it is perhaps in the healthcare sector where Formula One is making its most impressive and important contributions. Inspired by the monocoque cockpit which keeps drivers safe, the BabyPod II is allowing paramedics to transport newborns quickly and safely. The Ovei -- a pod-like structure designed to help capture healthcare data and transmit results to doctors and therapists around the world -- is also made from carbon-fibre composites. A wheelchair, designed by Formula One engineer Mike Spindle, improves not only the safety of a user, but also their comfort and mobility thanks the monocoque structure at its heart.  View a gallery of the F1 innovations » . ""The one-piece carbon fibre seat can be molded to fit the user,"" Maggs said. ""Because it is carbon fibre the wheels can be fixed further forward and at an angle which makes it easier for the user to get around."" Some of the sport's innovations aren't necessarily tangible, but are delivering improvements to hospital patients all the same. Using the expertise of McLaren and Ferrari's pit stop crews, Great Ormond Street Hospital in London has been able to improve the efficiency of patient handovers from one department to another by up to 40 percent. When the exhibition was officially opened by former McLaren team principal, Ron Dennis earlier this year it attracted the sort of media scrum usually witnessed on the grid prior to a race.  Watch CNN's coverage of the exhibition opening » . As the exhibition shows, Formula One is about improving performance.

"New York (CNN) -- The Pablo Picasso painting ""The Actor"" will undergo repair work, after a woman visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art fell onto the painting and tore the canvas, according to the museum. The museum said the Picasso work was damaged Friday when a visitor lost her balance and fell onto the unusually large 6-foot, 4-inch work. The six-inch tear is on the lower right-hand corner of the painting, the museum said in a news release Sunday. The museum did not provide details of the incident beyond saying the visitor fell onto the painting. Repair work should be ""unobtrusive,"" the museum said. The painting should be ready in time for the late April exhibition of 250 works by Picasso, the museum said. The painting marked Picasso's move from his ""Blue period"" to his ""Rose period,"" when his creations showcased costumed acrobats reminiscent of characters in Italian comedy stage plays, according to the museum.","Woman visiting Metropolitan Museum of Art falls onto painting, tears the canvas .

"(CNN) -- One of the Web's basic tenets is that small contributions from lots of people can amount to something powerful in the aggregate. Fans of the Japanese band Sour contributed images to a music video. Now, a growing group of writers, musicians, visual artists and videographers is turning this Wikipedia-era philosophy into online collaborative art. Twitter users are banding together to write an opera for London's Royal Opera House. Bands like My Morning Jacket and Sour, out of Japan, are turning to fans to help film their music videos. Programmers are pulling quotes from online social networks to make automated poems. More than 50,000 animators are divvying up work on an upcoming animated film called ""Live Music,"" and amateur videographers are re-filming ""Star Wars"" in 15-second bites. This crowd-sourced creativity online is putting a new twist on traditional ideas of artistic ownership, online communication and art production. ""What's exciting is that it's being tested out by a lot of people who have access to [the technology],"" said Mary Jane Jacob, executive director of exhibitions at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. ""I think that we're in a great communal workshop."" In recent months, the collaborative projects have been showing the professionalism it takes to get noticed amid the clutter of content on the Internet, said Ze Frank, an online personality who orchestrated several early online art projects. Sign up for a CNN art project . Frank said people have been making collaborative online art ""since the beginning of the Web."" But much of it wasn't worth looking at. Some collaborative books proved to be too much work for even herds of people to tackle. Efforts to create massive drawings with thousands of contributors sometimes ended up looking like random scribbles, for example. But for some reason -- either because people are getting savvier with cameras or because the projects are getting more visibility -- things are starting to click, Frank said. Even if some of the latest collaborative efforts fail to produce masterworks, the real value is the process, he said. ""Even if the [Twitter-written] opera ends up sucking as a performance, the value may have already been played out in the theater of the creation of it,"" he said. Many of the projects aim to hit on universal themes. ""The little elements that aren't synchronized"" in the group art projects remind people that our differences are what make us interesting, said Matt Maloney, associate dean of the school of film and digital media at the Savannah College of Art and Design, referring to this music video, which features fans of the Japanese band Sour. ""The backgrounds change, the people move differently, the quality and temperature of the photography varies from component to component,"" he said. ""If that phenomenon didn't exist, if we were all the same and we were all uniform, this type of collaboration"" would not be powerful. Jacob, of the Art Institute of Chicago, said the projects speak to how people yearn to communicate and to be heard in these hyperconnected, digital times. ""It lets you ... meet other people,"" she said. ""We're not talking eHarmony, but all these things, they're interesting and they are of the moment. When people want to use [communication technologies] in a creative way, that's really exciting."" The online art collaborations grow out of a parlor-game tradition called ""exquisite corpse,"" she said. Around 1920, famous surrealist artists gathered to draw portraits in pieces. They folded up large sheets of paper so that each artist could see only the edges of what had already been drawn. The pictures made sense only after the paper was unfolded. The online versions of this concept take the idea further because they involve people all over the world who often know nothing of each other, she said. For example, Darren Solomon's site, inbflat.net, features 20 YouTube videos of musicians, many of whom don't know each other, playing various melodies in the key of B flat. Visitors to the site can play the tunes in any order or combination they choose, meaning that each user in a sense becomes part of the artwork, Solomon said. Solomon, who once played bass with Ray Charles and now writes music for TV ads, said the ""In B Flat"" project shows that ""the world can come together and we all speak that [musical] language."" ""Something about it is very hopeful,"" he said. One key to the project's success, he said, is that it takes relatively little effort for musicians to send in Web-quality videos of themselves playing a short melody in a certain key. ""They're happy to start picking up a video camera and start shooting or they're happy to pick up an instrument and start playing,"" he said. Solomon finds that idea so compelling that he's participated in other projects. With his two sons, ages 7 and 11, he shot three of the 15-second clips of the user-generated ""Star Wars"" that will be stitched together by the site Star Wars Uncut. In one of the videos, he and the boys act out a scene with puppets. In another, his sons wear hooded sweatshirts and fight with light sabers in a New Jersey tunnel. In some cases, people don't even know they're making contributions to online art. Andrei Gheorghe, a Web developer in Romania, created the ""Longest Poem in the World"" by aggregating public Twitter posts and arranging them in rhyming couplets. Computers add 10 to 20 lines to the poem each minute, he said. Gheorghe said he doesn't consider his work art. ""It was just a random idea that popped up and I played with it. And it is what it is,"" he said. Art professors said deciding what is and isn't art is a complicated process. In some ways, these collaborative projects are fine art, they said. In other ways they're like games or means of communication. Like all good art, these projects are trying to ""stand convention on its ear,"" said Maloney, from the Savannah College of Art and Design. ""That's going to keep happening,"" he said. ""So as soon as we finally nail this down you'll have another group of talented artists that are going to say, 'Well, I'm going to do something completely different.'""","Large groups of people are creating collaborative art projects online .

"(CNN) -- Severe storms hammered North Carolina on Sunday evening, but no fatalities had been reported as of Monday morning, and injuries were minor, officials said. Residents reported as many as eight tornadoes touching down -- overturning mobile homes, ripping out trees and plunging neighborhoods into darkness. Survey crews were meeting with local officials throughout the state to get a clearer picture of the storm damage, said Ernie Seneca, spokesman for the North Carolina Department of Crime Control and Public Safety. There were reports of damaged houses and downed trees, but injuries were limited, he said. ""It looks like people heeded the warning to seek shelter when the storm came,"" he said. ""It really did sound like a train. It was pure noise,"" said William Schlaeppi, who lives on a farm in High Point, North Carolina, where the National Weather Service reported damage to at least 20 homes. ""I literally watched my fields disappear in front of me under a wall of water -- circular, spinning water."" A broad band of severe thunderstorms Sunday brought heavy rain and hail, and prompted tornado warnings from Florida to Virginia, the weather service said. A tornado touched down in Oakland Park, Florida, just north of Fort Lauderdale, between 8 and 8:30 a.m. Monday, said Tyrone Mosley, a weather service specialist. There was debris but no immediate report of injuries, he said. In North Carolina, at least eight unconfirmed tornadoes were spotted along the Interstate 85 corridor between Charlotte and Greensboro on Sunday evening. Metal roofing was ripped off an industrial building in Belmont, west of Charlotte, littering nearby trees with clumps of yellow insulation. News14: Spencer residents survey damage after storm . Multiple mobile homes were overturned in Linwood, outside of Lexington, and at least three people were reported injured. And what looked like a huge funnel cloud loomed over High Point, near Greensboro. ""It's been a very active evening for most of central North Carolina,"" said Julia Jarema, spokeswoman for the state's Division of Emergency Management. The storms caused power outages throughout the state, but because of the multiple bands of storms, ""things are changing so rapidly, we haven't been able to confirm numbers,"" Jarema said Sunday night. Is severe weather happening near you? Send photos, video . Local law enforcement reported another tornado north of Greensboro, the weather service said. The storm also produced 70-mph winds and hail as large as baseballs. Late Sunday, High Point emergency management officials were going house to house to check for injuries. Schlaeppi said he spent much of the night in his darkened house, going out with his neighbors to clear downed trees whenever the rain let up.

"(CNN) -- Two men charged in the 1978 disappearance of five teenagers in Newark, New Jersey, pleaded not guilty to five counts of murder Wednesday morning as about 40 family members of the victims looked on. Lee Anthony Evans, 56, and Philander Hampton, 53, were arrested Monday night. That was about 18 months after the investigation into the disappearance of the five boys was given new life; a witness came to detectives with information that the 1978 arson of an abandoned building in Newark was connected with the case, acting prosecutor Robert Laurino said. Evans and Hampton also pleaded not guilty to arson charges. Evans' attorney, Michael A. Robbins, maintains his client's innocence, citing Evans' full cooperation with authorities during the 1978 investigation into the disappearance of Randy Johnson, 16, Melvin Pittman,17, Ernest Taylor, 17, Alvin Turner, 16, all of Newark; and Michael McDowell, 16, of East Orange. ""In a case such as this, where the evidence has been lost, great care must be taken to prevent outrage, anger and emotion acting as a substitute in court for competent testimony, evidence and proof,"" Robbins said. ""The magnitude of the tragedy in the case should not diminish the very sacredness of Mr. Evans' right to a fair trail."" Hampton is being represented by John McMahon from the Essex County public defender's office. The family members of the victims sat silently as they watched Evans and Hampton enter their pleas. Evans had been under suspicion in 1978 but was released after passing a lie detector test. Witnesses said they had seen the boys getting into Evans' pickup truck. Helen Simmons, Michael's aunt, said she had never let go of her suspicion of Evans. ""Five kids did not run away. They were not runaways. They had no reason to run away. Five kids did not run away all at the same time, all having been picked up by Lee Anthony Evans,"" said Simmons, who was in the courtroom Wednesday. ""Michael's mother, my sister, died just 13 months after this, never knowing what happened to her son,"" she said. ""We have not forgotten Michael the last 32 years,"" she added. ""Michael is always with us. It's just that now we do feel that we will achieve the most we can get from justice, which is empty, which is to have [Evans and Hampton] to spend the rest of their lives in jail. I would love for [Evans] to live at least another 32 more years. In jail."" Authorities believe that the alleged killings were in retaliation for the teens' breaking into one of the defendants' homes to steal marijuana. The remains of the victims have never been found. A third suspect, Maurice Woody-Olds, died in March 2008. Officials allege that Evans and Hampton, with the aid of Woody-Olds, lured the five boys at various times into Evans' pickup and took them to the abandoned building on Camden Street, where they held them at gunpoint before setting it ablaze, officials said. The case will next be presented to a grand jury on a date to be determined. Evans and Hampton are being held at Essex County Correctional Facility in lieu of $5 million bail.","Two men charged in disappearances of five teens in New Jersey .

"(CNN)  -- The Marine Corps' top officer says he would want to avoid housing gay and heterosexual Marines in the same rooms on base if the ban on gays openly serving in the military is lifted. ""I would not ask our Marines to live with someone that's homosexual if we can possibly avoid it,"" Marine Commandant Gen. James Conway told a Web site in an interview posted Friday. ""And to me that means we've got to build [barracks] that have single rooms."" Asked about the possibility of gay and straight Marines living together, Conway told the site Military.com that he would ""want to preserve the right of a Marine that thinks he or she wouldn't want to do that -- and that's the overwhelming number of people that say they wouldn't like to do so."" Conway said the Marine Corps is the only branch of the armed services that houses two to a room. On Thursday, Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced that the Pentagon will start to ease its enforcement of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy prohibiting homosexuals from serving openly in the military. Among other things, Gates said the Pentagon is raising the threshold for what constitutes an appropriate level of information necessary to launch a ""credible inquiry"" into allegations of homosexual behavior. The change, which will take effect in 30 days and apply to all current cases, is a reflection of ""common sense"" and ""common decency,"" Gates said. ""These changes reflect some of the insights we have gained over 17 years of implementing the current law, including the need for consistency, oversight and clear standards,"" Gates said. President Obama and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, support a legislative repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" which was first enacted in 1993. Some senior members of the military, however, have expressed concern over the impact of the ban's repeal on unit cohesion and morale, among other things.","Marine Commandant Gen.

"(CNN) -- Every week, Jackie Kaminer of Roswell, Georgia, buys fish for dinner at the local market. Although she knows it's full of nutrients -- including good-for-your-heart omega-3 fatty acids -- she's careful of the types of fish she brings home. Jackie Kaminer contemplates fish choices; she  buys only ""safe"" fish, like salmon, haddock and tilapia. Her concern? Mercury and the dangers it poses to her children. So, she sticks to certain varieties: salmon, cod, tilapia and haddock are ""safe fish,"" but she stays away from swordfish, sea bass and tuna. As a mother of three, Kaminer should be concerned. Released into the atmosphere by industrial pollution, mercury contaminates water systems (and soil) when it rains. As fish feed on one another, the mercury stores up in their bodies. The toxic metal affects the nervous system. And although studies have shown large amounts of mercury can also affect fertility and blood pressure, and possibly cause memory loss in adults, it's particularly dangerous to young children and fetuses. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, during the first several years of life, a child's brain is still developing and absorbing nutrients. Prenatal and infant mercury exposure can cause poor mental development, cerebral palsy, deafness and blindness. Even in low doses, mercury may affect a child's development, delaying walking and talking, shortening attention span and causing learning disabilities. Having mercury levels that are too high isn't someone else's problem. In a recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one out of 17 women of childbearing age in the United States has mercury in her blood above the level that could pose a risk to a developing fetus (5.8 micrograms per liter). So the federal government advises pregnant women and those thinking of becoming pregnant to avoid certain fish, such as shark, swordfish and fresh tuna, usually found in fish markets and sushi. Canned tuna seems to be less of a threat, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture says consumption should be limited. Why avoid these kinds of fish? According to Andrew Heyes, a scientist with the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, Edgewater, Maryland, the older and larger the fish, the more mercury it has stored. ""As it grows older, it can't eliminate mercury as fast as it takes it in,"" he says. ""So there's an accumulation in the fish.""  Watch more on fish and mercury » . Because mercury is a growing threat to us and our environment, companies have started to take mercury out of thermometers, switches and even batteries to prevent it from entering our soil. Now, many regions, like the Chesapeake Bay states of Maryland, Virginia and Delaware, have instituted new rules to limit mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, one of the largest sources of mercury pollution in the region. Researcher Cindy Gilmour, also with the SERC, says that is a positive development because mercury contamination is getting out of hand. ""We've opened Pandora's Box and we've let that mercury out from where it was buried underground, into the atmosphere and into our soils and waterways,"" she says. ""All that excess mercury causes problems, not just in people."" In an effort to make sure these new regulations on mercury emissions are effective, scientists like Heyes and Gilmour are measuring levels of the toxic metal in watersheds near the bay. Gilmour says the research is needed. ""All those rules are starting to go into place, and we are starting to put those controls on our power plants. So what we want to find out here is whether those rules work and if the money we are investing in these technologies is really going to help,"" she says. As they monitor mercury, scientists are also learning more about how it behaves in nature. Gilmour says mercury contaminates more than just the soil and water. ""Mercury has a large impact on all kinds of animals -- loons, amphibians, songbirds, are all affected,"" she says. It will be several years before researchers know if the regulations are making a difference. Until then, health experts say enjoy fish -- it's good for you -- but be like Jackie Kaminer and pick your fish wisely.","We're told to eat fish, but some varieties contain high levels of mercury .

"Washington (CNN)  -- The United States has renewed a travel alert to Mexico, citing increased violence in the country. The alert, issued Sunday by the State Department, is in effect until August 20 and supersedes an alert issued August 20, 2009. ""Recent violent attacks have caused the U.S. Embassy to urge U.S. citizens to delay unnecessary travel to parts of Michoacan, Durango, Coahuila and Chihuahua ... and to advise U.S. citizens residing or traveling in those areas to exercise extreme caution,"" the alert says. ""Drug cartels and associated criminal elements have retaliated violently against individuals who speak out against them or whom they otherwise view as a threat to their organization. These attacks include the abduction and murder of two resident U.S. citizens in Chihuahua."" More than 16,000 people have died in Mexico since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after assuming office in December 2006. Ciudad Juarez, in Chihuahua state across the border from El Paso, Texas, is the most violent city in the nation. ""The situation in the state of Chihuahua, specifically Ciudad Juarez, is of special concern,"" the alert says. ""Mexican authorities report that more than 2,600 people were killed in Ciudad Juarez in 2009,"" the report states. ""Additionally, this city of 1.3 million people experienced more than 16,000 car thefts and 1,900 carjackings in 2009. U.S. citizens should pay close attention to their surroundings while traveling in Ciudad Juarez, avoid isolated locations during late night and early morning hours, and remain alert to news reports."" But the problems are not limited to Juarez, the State Department says. ""Mexican drug cartels are engaged in violent conflict -- both among themselves and with Mexican security services -- for control of narcotics trafficking routes along the U.S.-Mexico border,"" the report says. ""In order to combat violence, the government of Mexico has deployed military troops throughout the country. U.S. citizens should cooperate fully with official checkpoints when traveling on Mexican highways. ""Some recent Mexican army and police confrontations with drug cartels have resembled small-unit combat, with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades. Large firefights have taken place in towns and cities across Mexico, but occur mostly in northern Mexico, including Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana, Chihuahua City, Nogales, Matamoros, Reynosa and Monterrey. During some of these incidents, U.S. citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area."" A number of areas along the border continue to experience a rapid growth in crime, with robberies, homicides, petty thefts and carjackings increasing during the past year nationwide, the alert says. The State Department reports notable spikes in Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and northern Baja California. ""Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana and Nogales are among the cities which have experienced public shootouts during daylight hours in shopping centers and other public venues,"" the alert says. ""Criminals have followed and harassed U.S. citizens traveling in their vehicles in border areas including Nuevo Laredo, Matamoros, and Tijuana. Travelers on the highways between Monterrey and other parts of Mexico to the United States (notably through Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros) have been targeted for robbery and violence and have also inadvertently been caught in incidents of gunfire between criminals and Mexican law enforcement. Such incidents are more likely to occur at night but may occur at any time,"" the alert says.","The new State Department travel alert is in effect until August 20 .

"(CNN) -- Dubai sent investors reeling Thursday after asking creditors to freeze the debt repayments of one of its biggest holding companies, Dubai World. The announcement came after the market close on the eve of the Eid holiday and Thanksgiving in the U.S., leaving traders' hands tied over their exposure to investments in the Emirate. Shares dropped in London and Europe as bankers struggled to gauge the implications of the debt freeze without additional guidance from Wall Street. With very little information being distributed from Dubai, the market has been left to question the motives of ruler Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum and the financial future of Dubai World and its huge portfolio. So what happened? Late Wednesday, the government of Dubai issued a statement saying it had authorised the Dubai Financial Support Fund to ""spearhead the restructure of Dubai World with immediate effect."" The first step, it said, was to ask all providers of financing to Dubai World and Nakheel to ""standstill"" its debt repayments until at least May 30, 2010. It added, to the market's surprise, that the proceeds of a $5 billion bond issue raised hours earlier wouldn't be used to bail the company out. Odd timing wasn't it? Dubai's decision to release its statement just before the Eid holiday in the Middle East, and on the eve of Thanksgiving in the U.S., provoked consternation. ""Dubai have certainly picked their moment to finally own up to a need to restructure their debt. I would imagine the news has ruined a few Thanksgiving dinners today,"" David Morrsion, a strategist at GFT told the Financial Times. Read CNN's John Defterios' take on the Dubai debt fears . How did the markets react? Banking stocks led equity markets lower in London and Europe as traders moved to distance themselves from a potential debt hole in the Middle East. Technical problems in London halted trade for some time, providing further frustration for traders with exposure to Dubai World's lenders. What is Dubai World & Nakheel? Described on its Web site as ""Dubai's flag bearer in global investments,"" Dubai World is a holding company with stakes in everything from ports to real estate and transport. It includes the world's largest privately held real estate company Nakheel, which is the mastermind behind such architectural feats as the man-made residential islands, ""The Palm Islands"" and ""The World."" Dubai World also invests in global markets through its investment arm Istithmar World, which boasts a ""global footprint"" in finance, capital, leisure, aviation and other business ventures. How severe is the debt? Dubai World is said to account for some $59 billion of Dubai's $80 billion debt burden. Nakheel had been due to pay a $3.5 billion convertible loan which expires on December 14. More debts were due to be repaid next year. ""This is not just a couple of billion story,"" Turker Hamzaoglu, EMEA economist at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research told CNN. ""For instance, Dubai has to service $10 billion including the Nakheel debt in December and $15 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 2010,"" he added. How much damage has the announcement done? That's incalculable at this stage. Markets in the Middle East and the U.S. don't open until next week so the full impact won't be known until then. It also depends on Dubai's next move. The surprise announcement has shaken confidence in the Emirate as a place to do business. ""The key here is the communication of this strategy. I guess everybody is on the same page regarding the need for consolidation in Dubai and for the region. But the only market-positive implication would be if this comes with a clearly open and a predictable way,"" Hamzaoglu said. ""The problem is, here we have a lack of transparency and all these policy reactions are either coming at the last minute, or for example, the recent one just before the long holiday."" ""I think this is going to shake some investor confidence which may not be reversed as quickly as people expect. So they have to be careful,"" he added. Who will bail them out? Abu Dhabi has been a lucrative source of funding for its neighbor. The $5 billion bond issue was take up by UAE banks. The question now is whether it will continue to give its backing to its debt-laden neighbour. It may have the money to do so, but does it have the will? What comes next? Ideally, the market wants guidance as to Dubai's debt strategy. It has said that the Dubai World debt freeze is the first stage of a restructuring plan. Investors want to know what comes next. Right now, the region is seen as a risky bet for nervous investors. Hamzaoglu says there are other options for those who want to back similar markets. ""From an investor perspective, if you want to still play for the global backdrop of oil prices, etc. there are some other markets, say Brazil or Russia, that investors can be interested in, rather than taking this high risk for the region,"" he said.","Dubai stuns global investors by calling for a debt ""standstill"" on Dubai World and Nakheel debts .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- The Shanghai court trying an Australian Rio Tinto executive on charges of bribery and theft of commercial secrets will deliver its verdict on Monday. Australian consular officials will be in court when it renders its decision on the fate of Stern Hu, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether the court will also announce on the same day the verdict against three other Rio Tinto employees who were tried on the same charges. The three-day trial of the four employees of the mining giant ended Wednesday. Charged in the case were Stern Hu, an Australian citizen of Chinese origin who was the general manager of Rio Tinto's Shanghai office. Hu has been in detention for nine months, along with Rio Tinto's three Chinese employees -- Liu Caikui, Ge Minqiang and Wang Yong. Rio Tinto, a British-Australian company, is one of the largest mining companies in the world. The case has raised fears of a government crackdown on foreign companies doing business in China. When is a gift considered bribery? The trial was closed to foreign news organizations, hindering independent confirmation of developments. Australian consular officials were allowed in the Shanghai courtroom for the bribery phase of the case, but were barred from witnessing the theft portion. Hu is accused of receiving two bribes: one for 1 million yuan ($146,490) and another for 5.3 million yuan ($790,000). The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said he ""made some admissions concerning these amounts,"" but did not elaborate. The Chinese government initially accused the four of stealing state secrets when they were first detained, but the charges were reduced to theft of commercial secrets several months ago. Hu and the others were detained in July. China says the four bribed executives from 16 of the nation's major steel mills to obtain industry information. In China, obtaining commercial secrets carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison. Rio Tinto has called the allegations surprising and said it was not aware of any evidence. The detentions took place about a month after Rio Tinto broke off an investment deal with China state-owned Chinalco, a resources company, that was worth more than $19 billion. The deal with Chinalco was signed in February 2009 and was awaiting a review by Australia's foreign investment board. The deal soured as opposition party members in Australia ratcheted up their disapproval, saying it would put Australian resources at strategic risk. Others saw the deal as an alliance that would further link resource-rich Australia with the commodities-hungry Chinese market.","Mining firm executive on charges of bribery and theft of commercial secrets .

"(CNN) -- The Guatemalan army stole at least 333 children and sold them for adoption in other countries during the Central American nation's 36-year civil war, a government report has concluded. Around 45,000 people are believed to have disappeared during Guatemala's civil war, 5,000 of them children. Many of those children ended up in the United States, as well as Sweden, Italy and France, said the report's author and lead investigator, Marco Tulio Alvarez. In some cases, the report said, parents were killed so the children could be taken and given to government-operated agencies to be adopted abroad. In other instances, the children were abducted without physical harm to the parents. ""This was a great abuse by the state,"" Alvarez told CNN on Friday. Investigators started examining records in May 2008 for a period that spanned from 1977-89, said Alvarez, the director of the Guatemalan Peace Archive, a commission established by President Alvaro Colom. Of 672 records investigators looked at, Alvarez said, they determined that 333 children had been stolen. The children were taken for financial and political reasons, he said. Alvarez acknowledges that many more children possibly were taken. Investigators zeroed in on the 1977-89 period because peak adoptions occurred during that time frame, particularly in 1986. They will investigate through 1995 and hope to have another report ready by early next year, he said. A presidential ministry has determined that about 45,000 people disappeared during the nation's civil war, which lasted from 1960 to 1996. About 5,000 of those were children, the ministry said. Another 200,000 people died in the conflict between the leftist guerrillas and right-wing governments. The nation's public ministry and attorney general's office will determine whether anyone is prosecuted over the abductions, Alvarez said. Asked if he would like to see prosecutions, Alvarez answered, ""I hope so."" Alvarez said he has attended several reunions of abducted children -- now adults -- and family members. ""I can't tell you how happy that makes me,"" he said. Adoption has served as a source of income in Guatemala for decades. The war just made it easier for abuses at the hands of soldiers to occur. Guatemala has the world's highest per capita rate of adoption and is one of the leading providers of adoptive children for the United States. Nearly one in 100 babies born in Guatemala end up with adoptive parents in the United States, according to the U.S. consulate in Guatemala. Adoptions can cost up to $30,000, providing a large financial incentive in a country where the World Bank says about 75 percent of the people live below the poverty level. Officials fear that often times mothers are paid -- or coerced -- into giving up their children. Some unscrupulous lawyers and notaries, who have greater power in Guatemala than they do in the United States, have taken advantage of the extreme poverty and limited government oversight over adoptions to enrich themselves. Alvarez said corrupt lawyers and notaries were the driving force behind many of the army abductions of children. The problem is confounded because many Guatemalan parents can't provide for their children. The United Nations' World Food Programme says Guatemala has the fourth highest rate of chronic malnutrition in the world and the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean. Chronic undernutrition affects about half of the nation's children under the age of 5, the U.N. agency said. Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom Caballeros declared a state of national calamity this week because so many citizens do not have food or proper nutrition. Despite the nation's problems, Alvarez hopes some good will come of the report, which was released Thursday. ""We have to tell the truth about what happened,"" he said. ""Guatemalan society must know what happened and must never allow it to happen again.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Steve Karas and Matthew Welling share a special bond. Matthew Welling, left, received a bone marrow transplant from Steve Karas, right. They aren't related. In fact, they had never even met until 3-year-old Matthew needed a life-saving bone marrow transplant two years ago. It turned out that Karas, 51, of Newton, Massachusetts, was a perfect match. ""My heart went a hundred miles an hour, and I couldn't even conceive of what this meant,"" Karas recalled. He had signed up for the National Marrow Donor Program registry 17 years ago and had never given it another thought. The call to donate came out of the blue. Karas remembered hearing, ""It was a little 1-year-old boy with this horrible disease called osteopetrosis, and the only cure was a bone marrow transplant, and would I be willing?"" He said there was no other answer than ""of course."" Karas is one of 11 million Americans who have volunteered to be marrow donors. Every day in the United States, an estimated 6,000 people need a transplant. There are two ways to donate bone marrow: Either a doctor must insert a needle into the back of the hip bone to retrieve the marrow, or cells are collected through a procedure called peripheral blood stem cell donation, or PBSC. ""Bone marrow is the source of early blood stem cells, and they make all kinds of blood cells that fight infection,"" said Dr. Ann Haight, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist at the Aflac Cancer Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Bone marrow transplants can help treat cancers such as leukemia and blood disorders such as sickle cell disease. Matthew was suffering from a rare disorder that increases the density of bones and crowds out bone marrow.  Watch more on bone marrow donation » . His father, Michael, said waiting for doctors to find a donor match was terrifying. ""There is no more difficult, hard-to-stomach feeling than watching your child be sick and suffering and not be able to do anything,"" he said. Welling said his ailing son started turning the corner after receiving a transplant in November 2007. Doctors told him that Karas' bone marrow donation helped save Matthew's life by stopping the progression of the disease. Unfortunately, Matthew developed an infection a month after the transplant and the cells stopped working. He required a second transplant from another donor. That transplant worked, and while Matthew still suffers from side effects, his father reported the boy is cured of his initial disease. But the story doesn't end there. Karas' boss, Paul Amos, got word of his good deed and was so inspired that he launched a bone marrow registry drive among his 4,000 employees at Aflac, a supplemental insurance company based in Columbus, Georgia. As of Friday, nearly 1,100 workers had volunteered to join the national registry. ""We're not asking for money,"" Amos said. ""we're not asking for any additional time except for a couple of seconds on a coffee break. Think of all the things you've ever given, and that's the simplest you could ever give."" Joining the registry involves completing a donation kit (available at marrow.org). Cotton swabs are swiped on the inside of the cheeks to determine the tissue type. The sample is then sent along with an in-depth health history questionnaire to the National Marrow Donor Program. Dr. Haight said anyone over the age of 18 can join the registry provided he or she meets the health criteria. Those with conditions such as HIV, insulin-dependent diabetes, hepatitis and autoimmune diseases are generally excluded. ""The biggest need we have for additional donors is in racial and ethnic minorities,"" she said. ""That's because transplant tissue type will run with your racial and ethnic background. ... We need more African-Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Americans and Hispanics."" Karas found the actual harvest process to be relatively simple, with little pain. He ended up donating through the PBSC process, a nonsurgical outpatient procedure. The donor's blood is removed through an intravenous needle and passed through a machine that separates out blood-forming cells. The remaining blood is returned through a needle in the donor's other arm. ""I felt like I had the flu, and those symptoms lasted three or four days,"" he said. Karas went back to work as a sales coordinator at the Boston, Massachusetts, office of Aflac within days. About a year ago, he received another call out of the blue and was asked if he wanted to meet Matthew and his parents. Michael Welling said the reunion was filled with tears. ""There was a part of us that felt, 'I almost hope he thinks we were worthy of this unbelievable gift he gave us.' "" Karas reassured the family that there was never a doubt his mind, especially after seeing that Matthew was healthy and thriving. ""It was one of the most emotional moments of my life,"" Karas said. ""Short of fathering my own three sons, clearly this is the greatest thing I've ever been able to do.""","A doctor inserts a needle into the back of the hip bone to retrieve the marrow .

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania man attempted to resuscitate ""a road-killed opossum,"" state police say. But this was one possum who wasn't playing possum -- the ugly creature remained dead. Troopers responding to the scene in Oliver Township on Thursday determined that Donald J. Wolfe, 55, of Brookville, was drunk, according to the police report. Several witnesses observed Wolfe's failed resurrection of the flattened marsupial, police said. It was not immediately clear how he endeavored to restore the possum's life. The arresting officer in the incident was unavailable for comment Friday. Attempts to reach Wolfe were also unsuccessful.

"(CNN) -- In 1967, the Mamas & the Papas had a hit with a song that detailed, with bittersweet harmonies, the checkered history of the band. The song, written by the group's John Phillips and his wife, Michelle, was called ""Creeque Alley."" Michelle Phillips, Denny Doherty and John Phillips, here in 1998, were members of the Mamas & the Papas. If the song were to be updated today, it might have to be retitled ""Creep Alley."" With the claims by John's daughter, Mackenzie, that she had an incestuous relationship with her father, the story of Phillips and his group -- in music, models of California dreams and California dreamin' -- takes on a darker hue. The story was already tangled, a motley love- and drug-soaked tale of excess set to the group's distinctive four-part harmonies. Phillips left his first wife, Mackenzie's mother, Susan Adams, for 18-year-old Michelle, whom he'd met in a San Francisco club while touring in the early '60s, according to the band's biography on Allmusic.com. The band's lead male singer, Denny Doherty, later had an affair with Michelle; she was forced out of the group for a time. The fourth member, Cass Elliot, had an unrequited crush on Doherty, the biography noted. After the Mamas & the Papas' success with such singles as ""California Dreamin' "" and the No. 1 hit ""Monday, Monday,"" the Phillipses bought a Bel Air mansion from which they ruled over the Los Angeles music scene. In his 1986 memoir, ""Papa John,"" John Phillips, who died in 2001, remembered hosting parties for the Beatles when they visited town. John Phillips, the band's primary songwriter, was at least six years older than the others and did not shy from the task of addressing the group's pain and confusion in song. In such songs as ""Got a Feelin',"" ""I Saw Her Again Last Night"" and ""Trip, Stumble and Fall,"" he cast a cold eye on the band's romantic entanglements, even as his melancholy and sometimes cutting lyrics were often belied by those sunny harmonies and Lou Adler's slick production. ""One doesn't try to hold Cass and Denny and Michelle together,"" he said in a 1995 interview. ""It's a useless task to start with. You just sort of stay out of the way and let things roll as they can."" In 1968, the group split up. There was a 1971 reunion that produced the contractually obligated album ""People Like Us,"" but the experience was ""horrible,"" John Phillips recalled in the liner notes to the group's anthology, ""The History of the Mamas and the Papas."" The group members had mixed success after the breakup. Elliot, who died of a heart attack in 1974 (and not by choking on a sandwich, as urban legend has it), pursued a solo career; she had a handful of hits. Doherty and John Phillips also tried their hands at solo careers; the latter's 1970 ""John, the Wolf King of L.A.,"" produced a minor hit and is now considered a classic but sold relatively poorly upon release. More common were the stories of trouble. Michelle and John Phillips divorced in 1970; late that year, Michelle was married to Dennis Hopper for eight days. John Phillips, who married Genevieve Waite in 1972, became increasingly immersed in drugs, says his Allmusic biography, to the point where he couldn't finish an album commissioned by the Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. In 1981, he was convicted of drug trafficking. By that point, daughter Mackenzie says, she was also a full-blown drug addict. ""I grew up in a place where there were no rules ... which did not serve me well, and everybody, I think, knew that,"" she said on a reunion special for her '70s sitcom, ""One Day at a Time."" According to Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh's ""The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows,"" Phillips missed the 1980-81 season while in rehab for addiction issues. In her new book, ""High on Arrival,"" she claims she had become sexually involved with her father in 1979, after he forced sex on her the night before she married a rock manager, Jeff Sessler. (Earlier that year, the house she shared with Sessler burned down, taking all her belongings with it.) According to Mackenzie Phillips, the affair with her father lasted 10 years. She told Chynna Phillips, her half-sister, about the affair in the late '90s, according to an interview with Chynna in Us magazine. ""Somebody could have dropped a piano on my head, and I probably wouldn't have felt it,"" Chynna Phillips told the magazine. ""But I knew it was true. I mean, who in their right mind would make such a claim if it wasn't true?"" She says the news sent her into ""a deep, deep sadness and depression for about 10 days. A part of me died when I found out."" John Phillips also underwent rehab but struggled for the rest of his life. He had a liver transplant in 1992 but was photographed drinking several months later. He toured with versions of the Mamas & the Papas, some including Mackenzie. He died in 2001 of heart failure. Chynna Phillips and Mackenzie's ""One Day at a Time"" co-star Valerie Bertinelli have since rallied around her. But others have not. ""I am stunned by Mackenzie's terrible allegations about her father,"" Waite, John Phillips' third wife, wrote in a statement released to ""The Oprah Winfrey Show."" Mackenzie Phillips appeared on the show Wednesday. ""I would often complain about her overly familiar attitudes towards him, and he said it was just her way. John was a good man. ... He was incapable, no matter how drunk or drugged he was, to have sexual relations with his own child."" And Mackenzie's half-brother, Tamerlane, the follower of an Indian guru, is having none of it. ""My family is and always will be a decrepit bowl of dog urine compared to Nityananda of Ganeshpuri. That is how great Nityananda is,"" he told the New York Post's Page Six. ""Worship Nityananda, not the Phillips family.""","John Phillips' reputation taking hit with claims of incest by daughter Mackenzie .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- A U.N. maritime task force was scouring the stormy waters off the coast of northern Lebanon Friday, searching for survivors from a livestock carrier that sank the night before. ""The operation that commenced last evening continued through the night in difficult weather conditions,"" said a statement from the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). As of 3:15 p.m. local time Friday, rescuers had found 42 survivors and four bodies, according to a release from UNIFIL. Four of the survivors were sailors who were picked up by other ships. The Lebanese navy said there were 83 people aboard the cargo ship that was packed with sheep and other livestock. The Panamanian-flagged carrier, the ""Danny F II,"" sank about 12 miles off the coast of Tripoli. The Lebanese navy sent a distress signal to UNIFIL indicating the ship had capsized Thursday night, the U.N. task force said. ""UNIFIL Maritime Task Force immediately responded to the location with three ships, the frigate 'Zeffiro' (Italy), mine hunter 'Laboe' (Germany) and supply ship 'Mosel' (Germany), that have since been engaged in the search and rescue operations in collaboration with the Lebanese Navy,"" Friday's statement said.

"(CNN) -- The outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness has spread to more passengers on a U.S. cruise ship, with nearly 450 falling sick while at sea, the cruise company said Tuesday. The Celebrity Cruises ship Mercury departed Charleston, South Carolina, February 15 and headed for the eastern Caribbean, according to a Celebrity Cruises statement. On the way, 419 of the 1,838 passengers fell ill, along with 27 of the 849 crew members, the cruise line said. The number of affected passengers increased from the 353 reported the day before. Their symptoms included upset stomach, vomiting and diarrhea, Celebrity Cruises spokeswoman Cynthia Martinez said. Guests who were in isolation while ill will receive compensation, she said. The sickened passengers and crew have been administered over-the-counter medicine and are responding well, Celebrity Cruises said. But it is still unclear how they became sick, Martinez said. Medical samples will be sent to a lab for testing Tuesday, she added. The ship's medical facility first started treating guests Sunday, Martinez said, and by Monday, hundreds of others were sick, too, Celebrity Cruises reported. A doctor and two nurses joined the cruise medical staff Monday to help with the overload of patients when the ship stopped in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, according to the statement. The ship does not return to Charleston until Friday and will be at sea until then, Martinez said. To control the outbreak, the crew has stepped up cleaning of the ship, which is advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness occurs. Norovirus commonly causes viral gastrointestinal illness outbreaks on cruise ships, the CDC says. It can spread from contact with contaminated food or drink, by touching objects infected by people who are already sickened, or through close contact with people who are infected, according to the CDC. So far this year, three gastrointestinal illness outbreaks have occurred on cruise ships that docked at a U.S. port, according to the CDC. Norovirus was the cause of two outbreaks on the Mercury in 2009, the CDC reported. The outbreaks reported and investigated by the CDC infected at least 3 percent of the people onboard the cruises carrying at least 100 passengers for anytime between three days to three weeks.","Celebrity Cruises ship departed South Carolina on February 15 and headed for the Caribbean .

"(CNN)  -- Three teenagers and a 4-year-old were among the eight deaths in a Virginia shooting, state police said Wednesday. Christopher Speight, 39, is being held without bond at the Blue Ridge Regional Jail in Lynchburg, Virginia, after being charged with a single count of first degree murder, police said, adding that further charges are pending. Speight surrendered peacefully early Wednesday morning after an overnight manhunt left him hiding in the woods surrounded by a several-square-mile perimeter set up by authorities, Appomattox County Sheriff O. Wilson Staples said. Speight was wearing a bulletproof vest but had no weapons when he surrendered, Staples said. State police identified the victims of Tuesday's shooting as Ronald I. Scruggs II, 16; Emily A. Quarles, 15; Karen Quarles, 43; Jonathan L. Quarles, 43; Dwayne S. Sipe, 38; Lauralee Sipe, 38; Joshua Sipe, 4; and Morgan L. Dobyns, 15. All were from Appomattox except Scruggs, who was from Dillwyn, about 25 miles away. Police did not say how the victims were related nor did they describe a motive for the shootings. Earlier, they said that Speight lived at the Appomattox home where seven of the eight were found, that he co-owns it and adjoining land and that he was acquainted with all the victims. Police were alerted to the incident Tuesday after noon when a person was discovered badly wounded in the middle of Route 703. That person later died at a hospital. When police arrived at the scene they heard gunshots, authorities said. Authorities established a perimeter around the area, including dogs and helicopters. One of the helicopters was hit at least four times by bullets but ""was able to make an emergency landing in a field near the scene,"" state police said. A search turned up the remaining seven bodies in and around the home, which is about 75 miles southwest of Richmond, Virginia's capital. On Wednesday, a search of the home turned up explosive devices, Molinar said. He said authorities were safely detonating the devices but he did not describe them.","NEW: Suspect lived at the Appomattox home where seven of the eight victims were found .

"Singapore (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama, on his first Asia trip since taking office in January, arrived Saturday in Singapore to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. In addition to the meetings with the APEC heads of state, Obama planned to hold three bilateral meetings -- with the leaders of Russia, Indonesia and Singapore. APEC's 21 member nations represent more than half of the world's economic output. The forum sees its goal as ""facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region."" Obama will become the first U.S. president to take part in a summit of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economic alliance. The formal meeting is Sunday. Earlier Saturday, Obama told a packed house at Tokyo's Suntory Hall that all Americans should know that what happens in Asia ""has a direct effect on our lives at home."" The president leaves Sunday for Shanghai, China. The trip, which lasts more than a week, is Obama's first to Asia since taking office in January. In his Tokyo speech, Obama touted himself as America's ""first Pacific president,"" and pledged a renewed engagement with Asia Pacific nations based on ""an enduring and revitalized alliance between the United States and Japan."" He touched on nearly every part of the Asia Pacific region during his speech, and talked about a boyhood visit to Japan with his mother, his birth in Hawaii, a childhood spent partly in Indonesia and the United States' position as a Pacific nation. ""There must be no doubt: as America's first Pacific president, I promise you that this Pacific nation will strengthen and sustain our leadership in this vitally important part of the world,"" he said. He emphasized that the United States was not interested in containing the emerging economic growth in China. Obama also called on Myanmar to make more definitive moves toward democracy, including releasing all political prisoners. He urged North Korea to return to the Six-Party Talks so the reclusive nation can be reintegrated into the world stage and pledged America's support for eliminating nuclear weapons and efforts to reduce the global effects of climate change. In China, Obama will continue efforts to define and strengthen the United States' relationship with the world's largest emerging economy, which has a growing influence in Asia, said Jeffrey Bader, the National Security Council's senior director for East Asian affairs. Bader cited North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the economy, climate change, human rights and Afghanistan as among the top issues for the China swing. On human rights, Bader said Obama is likely to address ""freedom of expression, access to information, freedom of religion, rule of law and, certainly, Tibet."" Obama will make clear to Chinese President Hu Jintao that he intends to meet with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, Bader said. China, which rejects Tibetan aspirations for autonomy, opposes such high-level contacts with the Dalai Lama.","U.S. President Barack Obama arrives in Singapore for APEC summit .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Pop singer Ricky Martin declared publicly this week what he avoided discussing for years: He is gay. ""I am proud to say that I am a fortunate homosexual man,"" Martin wrote on his official Web site. ""I am very blessed to be who I am."" A decade ago, when ABC's Barbara Walters pressed Martin to address rumors about his sexuality, he declined to confirm or deny them. ""I just don't feel like it,"" Martin said. Now, Martin wrote, ""these years in silence and reflection made me stronger and reminded me that acceptance has to come from within and that this kind of truth gives me the power to conquer emotions I didn't even know existed."" The 39-year-old Puerto Rican native started off with the Latin boy band Menudo before launching his solo career in 1991. His song ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" rose to the top of the music charts in 1999 and propelled Martin to stardom. Martin said he decided years ago to not share ""my entire truth"" with the world because people he loved warned him that ""everything you've built will collapse."" ""Allowing myself to be seduced by fear and insecurity became a self-fulfilling prophecy of sabotage,"" he wrote. ""Today I take full responsibility for my decisions and my actions."" The decision to come out was initiated a few months ago, when he began writing his memoirs, he said. ""I got very close to my truth,"" he wrote. ""From the moment I wrote the first phrase I was sure the book was the tool that was going to help me free myself from things I was carrying within me for a long time,"" he wrote. ""Things that were too heavy for me to keep inside."" Martin said that disclosing his secret is important because of his two sons, born via surrogate. ""To keep living as I did up until today would be to indirectly diminish the glow that my kids were born with,"" he wrote. ""Enough is enough. This has to change. This was not supposed to happen five or 10 years ago, it is supposed to happen now. Today is my day, this is my time, and this is my moment."" Writing the seven paragraphs, he said, ""is a solid step towards my inner peace and vital part of my evolution."" ""What will happen from now on? It doesn't matter.

"Washington (CNN) --  The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that office rents in Washington are poised to overtake rents in New York City. Washington now boasts the lowest office vacancy rate in the nation. New York City is bleeding jobs, unemployment is over 10 percent. Washington is booming as government agencies like TARP and the General Services Administration expand. New York's crisis and Washington's growth is more than a business page story. Over two centuries, American culture has been shaped by the physical separation of politics and finance. The British might centralize everything in London, the French in Paris, the other countries of Europe in their great capitals, but the United States divided these functions. The Constitution of the new republic provided for an autonomous federal district. It did not specify where that district should be. Mexico and Argentina both have federal districts that coincide with their greatest cities, and that option was at least theoretically available to the United States as well. Instead, the capital was sited on the swampy banks of the Potomac, far from the great commercial centers of the founding era: Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Charleston. This decision had profound effects for the first 150 years of the new country's life. If a business leader wanted to talk to a member of Congress or the Cabinet, he had to take a long train ride, often a very long train ride. Simpler and easier to leave the job to a lobbyist. Sheer physical distance interposed itself much of the time between the country's financial, business, and political leaders. It was an event when the great J. Pierpont Morgan made his way here, and most of the titans of 19th century industry never appeared at all. In our own era, however, the distance has shrunk, decade by decade, faster and faster all the time. It's not a coincidence that the impressive new premises of the Securities and Exchange Commission are located across the street from Washington's Union Station. The power brokers don't even have to hail a cab on disembarking from the Acela. And now the distance has vanished to nothing, and the one-time junior partner has gained the upper hand. The crisis of 2008 -- and the Great Recession of 2009 -- has interpenetrated government and finance in a way never before seen in the history of the United States. The kind of proximity to power once required only by defense contractors is suddenly required by all kinds of firms. Hilton Hotels will move from Beverly Hills to Washington. The accounting firm Deloitte will consolidate operations here, as will the legal firm McGuire Woods as it develops a new focus upon lobbying. The Federal government is now the majority owner of the lending arm of General Motors, GMAC. It owns the nation's largest insurance company, AIG. It is banker, automaker, and lender of last, second and first resort. President Obama joked at his first White House correspondents' dinner that he had just been named Auto Executive of the Year. Who wouldn't want to lease the office next door? The Federal Reserve has acquired a portfolio of $1 trillion in mortgage securities. The government regulates salaries in the companies in which it holds interests -- and pay czar Kenneth Feinberg has lamented in a television interview that his power does not extend even further. ""The biggest disappointment, I think, is that under the statute my jurisdiction is so narrow, and so circumscribed, that I have no real direct mandatory power over other Wall Street or other national companies,"" he said. But as Washington gains, the country loses. It loses something more than its ideals of free enterprise and private ownership. It loses the very American idea of a capital as a specialized locale to which specific tasks are delegated -- not an American Versailles where favors are distributed and attendance is mandatory. Not so long ago, Microsoft didn't even have a Washington office. Today Microsoft and Google are deadlocked in fiercer struggles than those that divide the oil lobby and the eco lobby. For those of us who reside in Washington, the change is mostly positive. Certainly the restaurants are vastly improved. But maybe the country was better when the food in the capital was worse. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum .","Rents for offices in Washington could soon be more expensive than in New York .

"(CNN) -- SeaWorld will resume killer whale shows while the company and two federal agencies investigate the death of a whale trainer at SeaWorld Orlando, company and federal officials announced Friday. The shows, which were suspended at all SeaWorld locations after the death Wednesday at SeaWorld Orlando, will resume Saturday with new precautionary measures in place, said Jim Atchison, president of SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment. Earlier Friday, the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service announced they were looking into the death of Dawn Brancheau, 40. Brancheau was pulled underwater when a killer whale named Tilikum grabbed her ponytail. A source at SeaWorld said that after seizing her, the whale dove deep underwater. Trainers eventually had to wrangle the animal into a smaller pool before they could retrieve her body about 40 minutes later. WESH: Watch tourist's video just before attack . A former head of animal training said Friday that Brancheau left herself vulnerable to attack and that she may have broken the park's training protocol. ""Dawn, if she was standing here right now, would tell you that that was her mistake in allowing that to happen,"" said former SeaWorld trainer Thad Lacinak, who had worked with Brancheau in the past, on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" Lacinak called Brancheau ""one the best killer whale trainers I ever worked with."" Still, he said, Brancheau should not have been lying in a slideout -- a platform covered by roughly 4 inches of water -- so close to a killer whale. ""When I was there we did have a protocol that you would not do that, you would not lie down in a slideout and get that close to his mouth. ""Now, whether she broke that protocol or not I don't know, or if the protocol changed in how they were working with him,"" Lacinak continued. ""But I'm pretty sure it was her breaking the protocol."" Atchison said Friday that it's too soon to tell if Brancheau violated protocol. ""It's far too early to get to that point,"" the SeaWorld president said. ""We're really still trying to collect information, trying to understand the nature and scope of the event."" He declined to discuss SeaWorld's training protocols, saying they are ""proprietary documents."" Atchison had high praise for Brancheau and said a charitable foundation is being formed to support causes she was interested in. He told reporters that video images in connection with the accident have been made available to the appropriate authorities. Atchison said Tilikum ""is a wonderful animal"" and ""will remain an active and contributing member of the team despite what happened."" ""He's a very special animal that requires special handling. Obviously the procedures that we've had in place are something we're revisiting at this point,"" he said. Tilikum's size and weight -- 12,000 pounds, compared with 6,000 to 9,000 pounds for the facility's other killer whales -- was one reason there were separate procedures in place for him at the Orlando facility. When the shows with killer whales resume Saturday at Orlando and other SeaWorld parks, trainers won't get into the water with the animals. ""Direct interactions"" with the animals were suspended in all three SeaWorld parks after the death. Various other improvements and changes will be enacted, Atchison said. iReport: Photo taken moments before attack . Labor Department spokesman Mike Wald said the safety and health agency is looking into whether OSHA workplace standards were violated in the incident. It will complete a report within six months, he said. If workplace infractions are found, OSHA will propose financial penalties, Wald said. If that happens, the company could accept the penalties and make any necessary workplace changes or appeal proposed penalties before an OSHA review commission. David Sacks, Agriculture Department spokesman, said inspectors are looking into the incident from the animal welfare perspective. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service wants to know if there were any violations of the Animal Welfare Act, a federal set of minimum-care standards for entities that get USDA licenses, including facilities that exhibit warm-blooded mammals to the public. Sacks said the incident will trigger a ""focused"" investigation, in which inspectors will go to SeaWorld to gather facts. If they think any welfare-act violations contributed to the incident, a formal investigation will begin. Such violations could trigger fines and even license suspensions and revocations. ""If we feel animals are suffering, we can confiscate the animal,"" Sacks said. He said SeaWorld Orlando has never been the object of a penalty enforcement. In a video posted on SeaWorld's blog, Chuck Tompkins, head of animal training for SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, mourned Brancheau's death and raised the issue of safety standards. ""We need to evaluate our safety procedures and how we interact with these animals,"" he said, and he stressed that it's ""extremely important that we continue to take care of these animals the best way possible."" The same whale was linked previously to two other deaths. Tilikum and two other whales were involved in the drowning of a trainer at a Victoria, British Columbia, marine park in 1991. The trainer fell into the whale tank at Sealand of the Pacific and was dragged underwater as park visitors watched. In 1999, Tilikum was blamed for the death of a 27-year-old man whose body was found floating in a tank at SeaWorld, the apparent victim of a whale's ""horseplay,"" authorities said then. The Orange County Sheriff's Office said the man apparently hid in the park until after it closed, then climbed into the tank. Nancy Black, a marine biologist who has studied whales for 20 years, said Tilikum could have been trying to play with Brancheau or get her attention or companionship. Such whales play with seals and sea lions in the wild, tossing them in the air, she said, but end up letting them go. But she said the whale could also have been frustrated for some reason. The incident raises larger questions about the captivity of wild animals. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said dolphins and other sea animals in aquariums ""routinely die prematurely of stress and other captivity-related causes,"" and human casualties also occur. The incident occurred about 2 p.m. Wednesday. Tompkins said the whale had just finished a session with Brancheau, who was leaning over and rubbing his head. They were in knee-deep water, he said. ""She had a long ponytail that brushed in front of her and apparently got in front of his nose,"" Tompkins said. ""He probably felt it."" Tilikum grabbed the ponytail and pulled Brancheau into the water, he said. Rescuers were not immediately able to reach her because the whale was too aggressive, the sheriff's office said. She was recovered by SeaWorld staff members after Tilikum was coaxed into a smaller pool and lifted out of the water by a large platform on the bottom of the smaller tank, authorities said. iReport: Dawn Brancheau performing at SeaWorld in June 2009 . Brancheau had wanted to be an animal trainer from the time she visited SeaWorld as a 9-year-old, her sister Diane Gross said. ""It was her dream job,"" Gross said.

"Frankfurt, Germany (CNN) -- Lufthansa airline will fly a bit over half of its normal flight schedule Tuesday, a day after pilots suspended their strike. ""It will obviously take a few days until we are back to normal,"" spokeswoman Claudia Lange said. The airline is planning to fly about 1,000 of its normal complement of 1,800 flights, ""plus, where we can, single, additional flights,"" she said. The airline is hoping to return to its full flight schedule by Friday. The announcement came shortly after both sides in a pilots strike against German-based Lufthansa, one of of the world's largest airlines, agreed to suspend the standoff beginning at midnight (6 p.m. ET) Monday. The suspension will expire March 8, barring an agreement before then, both sides said in a Frankfurt labor court. ""The judge was very clear,"" Lufthansa spokesman Klaus Walther said. ""He recommended the union to stop the strike action and to return to the negotiation table."" Walther predicted the two sides would reach a final agreement ""pretty fast."" The pilots' union previously had said resuming a normal schedule would take time, because the union had to inform striking pilots of the agreement before they could return to work. In addition, passengers whose flights have been canceled will have to be rebooked. Hundreds of flights were canceled Monday. The walkout by more than 4,000 members of Vereinigung Cockpit, the pilots' union, began at midnight Sunday after a last-ditch effort at negotiations over pay and job security failed, the company said. The strike threatened to disrupt travel on more than two dozen partner airlines, including United, US Airways and Continental. In 2008, Lufthansa was the No. 2 international carrier, with 42.2 million passengers, according to the International Air Transport Association. The industrial action was the largest in German aviation history, Lufthansa said, and it signaled growing labor unrest across Europe. Hours after it started, the union representing most of British Airways cabin staff voted to strike, but did not set a date. On Wednesday in Greece, a mass public and private sector strike is planned to protest the government's austerity plan. British Airways cabin crews vote to strike . In addition, French civil aircraft staff, including air traffic controllers, said Monday they plan to strike Tuesday through Saturday. Four unions called for the strike, denouncing a government project to merge air traffic control operations with those of five other European countries -- Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland, according to Eric Heraud, spokesman for France's civil aviation authority, DGAC, or Direction Generale de l'Aviation Civile. The unions are afraid of dismantling DGAC, Heraud said. Under the new proposal, ""nothing will change geographically,"" he said. ""The control towers will stay where they are."" Only the ""map of the sky"" will change, or the sphere of the controllers' concern, Heraud said. Half of Tuesday's flights at Paris, France's, Orly airport were to be canceled because of the action, he said. Twenty-five percent of the flights at Charles de Gaulle Airport were to be canceled. The labor unrest comes as the airline industry is digging out of the worst one-year drop-off in business, according to International Air Transport Association. ""It is the kind of death throes, I guess, of the very strong legacy airline unions,"" said Simon Calder, a travel expert. ""Now, all the old airlines like BA, like Lufthansa, are struggling"" to cut costs, he said. In 2009, air carrier revenues dropped nearly 15 percent worldwide after a record $535 billion the previous year. Passenger travel fell a record 3.5 percent and freight fell more than 10 percent, according to International Air Transport Association figures. Many of Lufthansa's pilots have been working without a contract since March and more than 90 percent of the union's members had voted to strike, a union representative said. The union, which is seeking a 6.4 percent pay increase, is also concerned with the airline's recent buying spree of small regional carriers, such as BMI and Austrian Airlines, a practice that it said cannibalizes flights from union-flown routes. Lufthansa is one of the largest carriers on the Star Alliance, a network of 26 airlines that share ticketing and routes for international travel. Other Star Alliance member airlines are: Adria, Air Canada, Air China, Air New Zealand, ANA, Asiana Airlines, Austrian, Blue 1, BMI, Brussels Airlines, Continental Airlines, Croatia Airlines, Egypt Air, Lot Polish Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, Spanair, Swiss, Tap Portugal, Thai Airlines, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines and US Airways.

"Paris, France (CNN)  -- The future of social networking, the real-time Web and a host of apps and gadgets were the talk of the annual Le Web conference as it opened here Wednesday. The phenomenal success of microblogging site Twitter and its plans for the future dominated the two-day event's opening sessions for bloggers and industry leaders, held in a converted morgue in the city's northeastern suburbs. Top executives from Twitter faced off with rivals from Facebook and MySpace as all three social media sites unveiled technical innovations designed to capture more users. On the heels of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's unveiling of Square, a device that accepts credit card payments on cell phones, Twitter platform director Ryan Sarver said the site now has 50,000 dedicated applications making use of its constant stream of blog updates. Sarver also announced the company's ""firehose"" feature, which throws open its data stream to any developers who want to use it. This is a first for Twitter, which has yet to disclose any major revenue streams even as others use it to harvest profits. Facebook developer Ethan Beard touted his own site's 500,000 applications and its power to drastically boost hits to news sites such as The Huffington Post through the 60 million users it now claims for its Facebook Connect feature. Meanwhile, MySpace Chief Operating Officer Mike Jones announced that his site is incorporating real-time status updates to its platform -- like Twitter and Facebook -- amid MySpace's struggles to find an identity. Jones also announced unrestricted developer access to MySpace's content and a $50,000 innovation prize to attract developers, but refused to comment on rumors of a potential partnership with rival Facebook. The social networking execs declined to discuss their sites' revenues or widely rumored stock market flotations. Chad Hurley, co-founder of Google-owned YouTube, also refused to disclose company revenues but said some popular users have earned more than $1 million since advertising was introduced to the video-sharing site. ""We didn't implement [advertising] initially on YouTube because we didn't want to skew the motivation of why someone would publish video. We wanted to be a video community,"" he told the conference. ""We saw over time the opportunity to introduce that secure revenue without distorting what we've become, and we've been quite successful,"" he said. But Hurley said he had no secret formula for anyone wanting to create a viral sensation on YouTube. ""You could punch me in the face right now, that would get a lot of views,"" he joked. ""Something shocking will get a lot of views, but there's no magic recipe. That's not really what the site is about -- to define the secret ingredient to get the hits. It's about celebrating the fact that everyone has a chance to participate."" On the sidelines of Le Web, the chatter was focused on the Facebook vs. Twitter battle and the opening of data streams to app developers. Attendees also wondered aloud about the fickle and unpredictable nature of Internet success. ""It is interesting that everybody now is announcing awards and conferences, but what's next?"" said delegate Katrin Weber of Deutsche Telekom. ""In the end, who is going to win? People are also asking what the formula for success is -- why do some applications or platforms succeed, and why do some fail?"" Social media marketing agent Vero Pepperrell said, ""I'm pleased that Twitter is starting to acknowledge how much of an ecosystem it has with its developers, so on that level, they are doing the right thing."" Blogger Gabriel Jorby believes that Square, Dorsey's credit card gadget, represents a new trend that's likely to shape the future for people trying to profit from the Internet. ""Today, if you want to run a service, you need something to bring the physical world. You cannot depend only on an online application, you need to do something tangible,"" he said. ""It is the future, it is not only [about] the screen experience, it is about something more physical. People need to be producing more than just apps."" More than 2,000 participants from 46 countries were expected in Paris for the Le Web conference, one of Europe's largest annual tech events.","The future of social networking was the talk of the Le Web conference as it opened in Paris .

"(CNN) -- Is she hurt? Is she getting help? Is she even alive? Those were the jumbled thoughts that raced through Sereth Hosty's mind in her Long Island, New York, home as she tirelessly scoured the news and Web for clues to the whereabouts of her elderly mother in Haiti. Since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 struck Tuesday, Augusta Thervil, 83, was among the growing number of people who had gone missing in the Port-au-Prince area. And her daughter was among those living in limbo. ""I check. I check. I check,"" Hosty said earlier this week. She had spent two days trying to reach her mother, neighbors and family friends by phone. She even placed a posting on CNN.com's iReport with her mother's picture. With phone lines and electricity down, people with family and friends in Haiti are struggling to live with uncertainty. ""To not know and be waiting is one of the most difficult situations to be in,"" said Therese Rando, clinical director of the Institute for the Study and Treatment of Loss. The waiting finally came to an end for Hosty on Thursday evening when she heard through a cousin that her mother was alive. And though she hasn't been able to speak with Theravil directly, she's sleeping again. ""I know there are other problems that are coming with food and water, but I feel relief that she's not dead,"" Hosty said. ""My cousin said my mommy is OK."" The toll of the quake is not yet known, but government officials said deaths may exceed 100,000. Emergency crews have already arrived in the Port-au-Prince area, but there are no indications when communication lines will be restored. Haiti is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, with a weak infrastructure even before the earthquake. The panic, anger and sadness since the quake are similar to the responses seen after the September 11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Those unexpected disasters claimed many lives and left family members who suffered losses to grieve for years, psychology experts say. Many are still grieving today. After 9/11, families frantically drove into New York City, trying to display their loved ones' photographs to the public in hopes of recovering the person -- or their body. Unable yet to travel to Haiti, families are using Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to search and connect. Several hundred submitted photos to iReport, asking for help in identifying their missing loved ones. See the ""Looking for loved ones in Haiti"" page on iReport . ""In every moment, the level of emotional anguish ratchets up, and there's nothing anyone can say to make them feel better,"" said Russell Friedman, director of The Grief Recovery Institute, a counseling organization in California that helps people deal with deaths and natural disasters. The grieving process for someone waiting to learn if a loved one has survived can be incredibly traumatic, Friedman says. They may feel more frustrated than those on the ground because they cannot help, he said. Mayka Cadet, 22, experienced these emotions Tuesday night in her Glendale, Maryland, home. She hasn't heard from five of her family members who live in Port-au-Prince. Her phone calls don't go through. There isn't even a ring. She especially misses her Uncle Sergo Cadet, who has always been her mentor. Cadet, who owns a construction business, taught her to work hard in school. ""It's just really hard for me because I'm really close to them,"" said Cadent, who posted an iReport looking for her family members. ""They come visit us every summer."" After their initial reaction to the news, people will find different ways to cope, psychologists say. Those who have missing relatives will feel sadness, anger, shock or confusion. Some may feel confused about their emotions, or struggle to even know what they are feeling. For those who learn their family members have died, the grieving process can progress, the experts said. People will often go through the stages of denial and bargaining before accepting the loved one's death. ""Everyone grieves differently,"" said Kristi Cooper, a family life field specialist at Iowa State University. ""There is no wrong way to grieve."" But time can heal emotional wounds, says George Bonanno, a psychology professor at Columbia University and author of the book ""The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After Loss."" Although coping with a loss can be difficult, Bonanno said he found that most people are resilient and able to overcome their loss. CNN iReporter Marie Aline Sillice, 26, is trying to stay positive. She encouraged her family to keep busy even though she can't locate her father. Frangel Victor, 57, worked as a lawyer in Port-au-Prince. They spoke on the phone just a few hours before the earthquake struck. Help the Sillices find their father . Sillice, a psychology graduate student at the University of Rhode Island, admits she is nervous that he may not have access to his diabetes medication. She is also keeping close contact with her family members in the U.S. and has posted an iReport in hopes of finding her father. So far, she hasn't heard anything.","NEW: Woman finds out through cousin that her 83-year-old mother is alive .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Rain pounded water-logged Los Angeles on Thursday, and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said more than 300 city residents were ordered to evacuate because of the threat of mudslides. ""We continue to urge the public who live in these areas to evacuate, to heed the warnings of our police officers and firefighters, our first responders, who are there to protect your public safety,"" the mayor said. Just over 500 Los Angeles County residents who were advised to flee their homes earlier had done so by Thursday morning, said Capt. Sam Padilla of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. The latest storm is part of a series that began Monday, drenching communities up and down the coast. Some areas have received more than 12 inches of rain this week, the National Weather Service reported. Flash flood watches were in effect Thursday night for Southern California, as well as central Arizona and southern Utah. ""While the worst of the last few storms is behind us, there still is a significant threat from thundershowers that are forming off the coast,"" Villaraigosa said at a news conference Thursday night, warning of the potential for lightning, hail and water spouts. Los Angeles had four swift-water rescue and two urban search-and-rescue teams on standby to deal with potential flooding, according to the mayor, who said more were available if needed. There were three swift-water rescues Wednesday, according to Padilla. No relief from the wet weather is expected until the weekend, increasing the threat of mudslides in communities nestled below hills that were stripped of trees and vegetation during 2009 wildfires. Villaraigosa said the brunt of the storm was supposed to hit by 6 p.m. Rainfall totals of 1 to 4 inches are expected across coastal sections of California with isolated additional rainfall amounts of 7 inches possible, forecasters said. Are you affected by the storms? Send your images and video . The rains are the result of El Niño, a warm ocean current from the South Pacific, according to CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. In coastal Pacifica, south of San Francisco, a huge mudslide left an apartment building teetering on the edge of a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, CNN's Dan Simon reported. He said the four apartments in the building were evacuated, and quoted an engineer saying the building could topple into the water at any time. TV crews could be near the structure only briefly. One man complained about being told to leave his Southern California home. ""You're talking about blocking us out of here for five days, evacuating until next week,"" he said to CNN affiliate KABC-TV in Los Angeles. ""You know what, that's too many days, that's a huge inconvenience. I understand they're looking out for our safety ... but I'm not out driving around. I'm staying put."" See KABC's coverage of the storms . Villaraigosa said Thursday that U.S. geologists, sanitation workers and street maintenance workers will head into threatened regions Friday morning to determine whether it is safe for residents to return to their homes. In the mountains of Southern California, the storms brought heavy snow, closing Interstate 15 at Cajon Pass and the Grapevine section of Interstate 5 for a time, the California Highway Patrol reported Thursday. Heavy snowfall remains in the forecast for the higher elevations in the Sierra Nevada, southeastern Utah, southwestern Colorado and southeastern Arizona. More than 73 inches of snow has fallen in Chagoopa Plateau, California, since Sunday and more than 35 inches in parts of Arizona.

"(CNN) -- As floodwater raged around their pickup, the family of a 6-year-old Arizona boy escaped to higher ground. The boy, however, was swept away. Teams were looking for his body on Friday, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said. Meanwhile, an evacuation order for some Los Angeles, California, residents was lifted, and the mayor said those people can safely return home . Authorities were classifying the Arizona operation as a recovery, presuming that a child could not survive in the raging water, the office said in a news release. The boy's name was not released. Rain has hindered attempts to find the boy after the incident Thursday night, authorities said. ""This effort continued through the night without success. Because of low visibility, along with the wind and rain, DPS (Department of Public Safety) Ranger helicopter was unable to fly over the area,"" the sheriff's office said. Are you affected by the storms? Send your images and video . The family's pickup got stuck near the northern community of Mayer, between Flagstaff and Phoenix in central Arizona. On Friday, the vehicle sat alone in a vast sea of mud, which reached nearly to the bottom of the windows and partially filled the area under the crumpled hood. The vehicle was tilted forward, as if diving into the muddy soup. According to a preliminary report, the boy was in the pickup with his 8-year-old sister and parents, who were trying to take him to a hospital when floodwater swept the pickup off the road. The mother was able to reach higher ground, and the father took the children to the bed of the vehicle for safety. By the time firefighters reached the scene, rising water had pushed the three from the bed. The father was able to reach a safe area with his daughter but the son was missing. California iReporters deal with the rain but have fun too . The flooding was the result of heavy rainstorms that started pounding parts of neighboring California on Monday and continued through the week. Upper elevations got heavy snow. Conditions in the area were not likely to improve until Saturday afternoon, the National Weather Service said. Forecasters predicted continued flooding of many rivers and streams and up to an additional foot of snow in the mountains. In Los Angeles, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said Friday that the 2,000 city residents who were evacuated because of the storms could return. The permission came after teams of geologists and structural experts determined that areas threatened by mudslides were safe enough, he said at a news conference. See KABC's coverage of the storms . Last year's wildfires burned trees and vegetation that normally hold soil in place and prevent hillsides from collapsing. Hundreds of residents also had been evacuated in Los Angeles County, and many of these were cleared to return home, according to the Coordinated Agency Recovery Effort's Web site. The storms stem from El Nino, a warm ocean current from the South Pacific, meteorologists said.

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria has set its sights on making multibillion-dollar oil deals with China amid peace moves with militants. Hundreds of militants have laid down their weapons in exchange for a pardon and a job. Lawmakers in the west African country -- one of the world's top producers of oil -- are crafting new money-making changes for its state oil corporation, as officials negotiate multibillion-dollar oil deals with China. At the same time, the government is brokering peace with bandits whose attacks have cost the oil industry millions. Nigeria's minister for state of petroleum, Odein Ajumogobia, talked this month about the developments. The changes aimed at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation will address allegations of corruption and mismanagement, he said. ""Some of the excesses we've seen in the industry are as a result of the lack of regulation,"" Ajumogobia said. ""We are going to make sure that the petroleum directorate, for example, where the minister will reside, is going to be manned by professionals who understand the industry and have the experience."" Nigeria welcomes China's recent interest in investing in Nigeria's oil industry, Ajumogobia added. The state-run China Daily reported in September that the China National Offshore Oil Corporation was negotiating with Nigeria over a $30 billion oil deal. The talks are part of China's oil-buying binge this year. Its government-controlled oil companies have closed or floated a slew of deals all over the world, including billion-dollar deals with Russian oil company Rosneft and Brazil's Petrobras. The Nigerian minister offered few details about negotiations with China. ""There is no deal yet,"" he said. ""We all know the appetite of the Chinese for energy -- a huge population and so on -- and they're looking for oil and Nigeria has a lot of it."" Oil bandits have plagued Nigeria for years, attacking pipelines and cutting production by over 1 million barrels of oil a day. But many of those attacks might end, thanks to a cease-fire with the militant group MEND, or the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta. The truce was negotiated in the summer and was extended in September. MEND has demanded a fairer distribution of oil wealth in the Niger Delta and wants oil revenue reinvested in the region, instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians. Last week, the group said it was calling off the truce, but there have not been renewed attacks. Nigeria hopes to leverage the fragile peace to reap big dollars from its oil industry, Ajumogobia said.","Nigeria aims to make huge oil deals with China and peace with militants .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari have unveiled their new car, the F10, which the Italian manufacturer hopes will see them return to the front of the Formula One grid. Last season saw Ferrari struggle to keep up with Brawn GP, McLaren and Red Bull and team boss Stefano Domenicali told the BBC that he believes the new car will be far more competitive than the 2009 version. ""We are coming off a season that was not competitive and this should mark a turning point. We want to win the world title once again,"" said Domeniciali. Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso's move to Ferrari was one of Formula One's worse-kept secrets but, now his move has been confirmed, the Spaniard admits he cannot wait to get started.

In Budapest I told him: 'you'll be back even stronger'' and he has."" Formula One rules changes have been taken into account when constructing the new F10 and Luca Marmorini, head of engine and electronics, commented: ""From a technical point of view reducing the consumption was one of the most interesting things this year. Consumption means performance. ""There won't be any refuelling anymore so consuming less means less petrol on board and therefore better lap times. Whoever consumes less will be faster on the track.""","Ferrari unveil their new car, the F10, for the 2010 Formula One season .

"(CNN) -- For everyone licking their wounds after Thursday's landmark 5-4 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission, worried that the evil corporations are now poised to ruin American democracy once and for all, in the bogus name of free speech, here's a word of potential hope: I used to be one of you, too, and today I'm happy as a clam. Maybe you can be too, eventually. Here's why: . Free speech really does mean free speech, and the laws that the ""Citizens"" ruling overturned directly and heinously restricted the stuff. Forget for the moment the broad characterization of the ruling -- such as The New York Times claim that it ""sweep[s] aside a century-old understanding"" -- and drill down to the individual case in question. Citizens United, a conservative 501(c)(4) nonprofit that has funded a dozen political documentaries over the years, produced a critical documentary about Hillary Clinton in 2008 entitled ""Hillary: The Movie."" By a decision of the federal government, which was enforcing the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (known more broadly as McCain-Feingold), this piece of political speech was banned from television. iReporter: Supreme Court ends real democracy . Let's boil it down to the essential words: Political documentary, banned, government. You don't have to be a First Amendment purist to intuit that political speech was, if anything, the most urgent subcategory covered by the First Amendment's ""Congress shall pass no law"" restrictions. And you don't have to be a Hillary-hater to imagine the shoe on the other foot. What if MoveOn.org's 501(c)(4), Campaign to Defend America, had been blocked by George W. Bush's Federal Elections Commission from broadcasting ""McCain: The Movie""? Wouldn't that stink, too? As Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion, ""The law before us is an outright ban, backed by criminal sanctions. Section 441b makes it a felony for all corporations -- including nonprofit advocacy corporations -- either to expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days of a general election. ...  If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech."" We are living in a fragmented media age in which many nontraditional sources are producing journalism, even and especially of the advocacy variety (my opinion magazine, Reason, is funded by a nonprofit 501(c)(3). Why should nonprofit journalism producers -- like the Sierra Club, say -- have to ask for the government's permission to send a political documentary across the airwaves? For many liberals I know, the free-speech objection to campaign-finance law is just a smokescreen for enabling corporate villainy. I mean, Mitch McConnell cares about the First Amendment? I used to think that way, too. But try this exercise: Check out the free-speech objections by people who don't want Goldman Sachs to take over the West Wing, or Wal-Mart to bulldoze private residences. I'm talking about anti-corporatist crusaders like Tim Carney, anti-eminent domain-abuse litigators like the Institute of Justice, or even former Federal Elections Commission chief Brad Smith. And for those many who claim to be First Amendment absolutists while also supporting McCain-Feingold -- I'm looking at you, some of my fellow journalists -- here's a question that the former begs of the latter: What if you're wrong? Even if you just can't bring yourself to believe that people who take civil liberties seriously have long-held serious civil libertarian criticisms of campaign-finance laws, or if you simply think they're all wrong, I'll offer this last salve: It has never been easier for groups of citizens to swarm together and flow money through the Internet toward campaigns and candidates who excite them. Ask Ron Paul -- or more relevantly, Barack Obama -- what's more powerful: $10 million from Dr. Evil Industries, or $10 each from 1 million people who can actually vote? The American people are not sheep, eager to be led by the highest bidder. As the Supreme Court rightly noted today, ""The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matt Welch.","Supreme Court ruling doesn't represent a step backward, says Matt Welch .

"Washington (CNN) -- The suicide bomber who killed seven CIA officers and contractors and a Jordanian intelligence official in Afghanistan was within seconds of being searched by two security contractors when he detonated his explosives, a former intelligence official with knowledge of the incident told CNN on Tuesday. On December 30, the two American guards, who worked for Xe Services -- formerly Blackwater USA -- approached the passenger side of the red 4-door sedan where bomber Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi was sitting, the official said. Al-Balawi had been invited to the base to share information he claimed to have that would lead the United States directly to Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda's second in command. The sedan was waved through the normal security checkpoints to get onto the base, and pulled up just outside a one-story building -- a temporary space that was being used to interrogate people brought onto base. Several CIA officers and contractors were standing on the driver's side of the car, opposite al-Balawi, and others were standing as far as 50 feet away, a U.S. intelligence official said. Al-Balawi started to get out of the car, with one hand in his pocket, when he detonated the explosives, the source said. ""It was no accident that some of the CIA officers were standing on the opposite side,"" the former intelligence official said. The official observed it was the safest place to be, as ""they waited for the Xe guys to do what they're paid to do and frisk him."" Also, there could have been some cultural sensitivity, with an Arab man about to be searched in front of female CIA officers who were there. The official says that ""there was no point going up to him until after the guards had patted him down."" Some of these details were first reported in The Washington Post earlier this week. The official expressed surprise at how much shrapnel tore through the area, killing seven CIA officers and contractors -- including the two Xe Services guards -- as well as a Jordanian intelligence official. Former CIA Agent Jack Rice told CNN that frequently, suicide bombers' explosive vests are wrapped in ""things like nuts and bolts and ball bearings. ""So what you create is this massive amount of shrapnel that kills everybody in the entire area,"" he said. Rice, who just returned from Afghanistan, said it was unusual to have so many officers present for a debriefing, but if they believed al-Balawi's claims that he had direct links to al Qaeda's top leadership, the excitement on the base would have been high. ""Remember, this is a career opportunity for all of these people. If you could take down al-Zawahiri, if you could take down Osama bin Laden, you are a hero for the rest of your career. Everybody wants to be in the room,"" Rice said. Al-Balawi, a Jordanian doctor, was a promising potential source. U.S. and Jordanian intelligence agencies apparently believed he was a reformed extremist and were using him to hunt al-Zawahiri. Al-Balawi had provided photographic evidence that helped establish his credibility, a U.S. intelligence official said. There were other things that also helped determine his authenticity, the official added, but would provide no further details. The former intelligence official who spoke anonymously has been to Forward Operating Base Chapman, where the attack occurred, and said body armor was worn even within the base's inner perimeter, which is unusual, compared with military bases in Kabul or Kandahar. ""You have a real sense of the proximity to the Pakistan border. Perimeters don't have the same meaning,"" the official said. While saying that a mistake was made by not searching al-Balawi before he got into the red car, the official defended the officers' decision to bring him on base. ""There's nowhere to frisk someone outside, and you don't have a whole lot of options. Let's assume they did have a safe house -- the exact same thing would have happened there,"" the official said. In a rare public defense of the CIA officers' actions, CIA Director Leon Panetta said the officers did not ignore the potential dangers because of the potential for valuable information. ""This was not a question of trusting a potential intelligence asset, even one who had provided information that we could verify independently. It is never that simple, and no one ignored the hazards,"" Panetta wrote in an op-ed this weekend in The Washington Post. ""The individual was about to be searched by our security officers -- a distance away from other intelligence personnel -- when he set off his explosives."" The official says the attack not only sheds light on the dangerous work CIA officials and contractors do in Afghanistan, but how their footprint is growing. FOB Chapman was used to conduct operations back and forth across the Pakistan border. But the official says it is just ""one of many bases in Afghanistan"" that operate outside U.S. military or NATO command. Afghan contractors guard the outer perimeter of many of the bases. ""Back in 2005, the CIA worked up an entire plan on how to increase its presence in Afghanistan,"" the official said. This effort was pursued ""very aggressively"" through the last several years of the Bush administration, and the official believed President Obama would have been briefed on that when he took office. The official says the feeling in the intelligence community is that Obama has increased the frequency and intensity of aggressive actions around the Afghanistan/Pakistan border region. Since he took office, the United States has ramped up the use of pilotless drones to strike at al Qaeda targets in Pakistan, including at least seven strikes since the December 30 attack at FOB Chapman, and approximately 51 others previously in 2009. In 2008, the last year of President George W. Bush's administration, there were approximately 34 drone strikes. ""I've seen no evidence that he's [Obama] diminished in any way the strategy of the previous administration. In fact, President Obama has not only continued what President Bush started, he's built on it,"" the official said. CNN Intelligence Producer Pam Benson and Pentagon Supervising Producer Adam Levine contributed to this report.","Bomber was invited to base to share information on al Qaeda's second in command .

"(CNN) -- Thanks to a crop of how-to dating shows, such as Bravo's ""The Millionaire Matchmaker"" and VH1's ""Tough Love,"" more people are reaching out to matchmakers, making an age-old art fashionable again. Back in 19th-century Russia -- around the time of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" -- women dreaded visits from the village matchmaker and longed to choose their own men. Today, real-life dating experts are in high demand. ""Millionaire Matchmaker"" star Patti Stanger says her off-screen business, Millionaire's Club International, is growing just as fast as her TV series, which, in its third season premiere, increased viewership by 30 percent, according to Nielsen Media Research. It's great having more clients, Stanger said, though there's more dross to sort through. ""We're on the map, everyone knows the brand, but it takes 30 to 45 guys until we find a real guy,"" she said. ""Crazy people come in [out of] the woodwork."" And while certain aspects of her club have been sensationalized for TV -- like having millionaires pick their dates out of a room full of men or women looking to date them -- Stanger tells it like it is, whether or not the cameras are rolling. ""I'll tell [clients] off. I'll say, 'You want to be 80 [and alone] in the nursing home?' "" ""Tough Love"" features Steve Ward, chief executive officer at Master Matchmakers, a matchmaking service his mother JoAnn Ward -- who also appears on the show -- founded more than 20 years ago. On the show, Ward works closely with single women who he says ""need an objective third party to give them constructive feedback that can help them find what they're looking for."" There are many people looking for answers, especially young people with nowhere else to turn, Ward said. About half of the 20,000 people who applied to be on his new spin-off ""Tough Love Couples"" were younger than 21, he said. Hiring a matchmaker can be pricey. Some services charge thousands of dollars for one-on-one consultations. However, many matchmakers will list you in their database for a smaller fee. The success of the shows has rubbed off on the matchmaking industry. Despite her general dislike for ""The Millionaire Matchmaker,"" Janis Spindel said the Bravo hit, which debuted in 2008, is somewhat responsible for spiking interest and boosting her client base. Her company, Janis Spindel Serious Matchmaking, has seen a 41 percent increase since these programs found a place on cable TV. One client, a former bachelor from Austin, Texas, contacted Spindel after his daughter inadvertently introduced him to ""The Millionaire Matchmaker."" ""His teenage daughter was watching it in the living room, and when he walked in, he heard what the show was about and took interest in the art of matchmaking,"" Spindel said. Samantha Daniels of Samantha's Table, a bicoastal matchmaking service, said she has also watched her business boom since matchmaking shows first appeared on TV. ""Miss Match,"" a romantic dramedy based on Daniels' life as a matrimonial attorney turned matchmaker, aired on NBC in 2003. Whether it aired about six years too soon, or just settled in to an unfortunate time slot, the series was canceled after one season because of disappointing ratings. Despite ""Miss Match's"" missed mark, Daniels plans to give TV another shot. She's is in the planning stages of her own reality show to teach women to be better daters. ""Putting that show on the air and going forward with more shows on the air, people are coming to understand what the business is more,"" Daniels said. ""A lot of people will say ... 'You do that in real life? I want someone to do that for me.' "" Jan Yager, author of ""125 Ways to Meet the Love of Your Life,"" said fear is the main reason people are reluctant to contact matchmakers, and she's glad that reality matchmaking shows are doing their part to ease that fear. Yager, who met her husband of 25 years through the personals, said it's important to get past the stigma that comes with hiring a matchmaker. Some people have an ""if it happens, it happens"" attitude when it comes to finding love, she said. ""But did you get to [be successful at work] because 'if it happens, it happens'? Didn't you have to plan and put time into it? Think about it."" In addition to educating viewers about how to find love and sustain healthy relationships, matchmaking shows have helped to eliminate the stigma often associated with hiring a matchmaker, said Stanger, who met her fiancé through her own service. ""Now it's not taboo to hire a matchmaker."" she said.","Nielsen Media Research: ""Millionaire Matchmaker"" season 3 ratings show up season 2's .

"(CNN) -- The Australian government apologized Wednesday for years of ""mistreatment"" that inflicted ""profound grief, suffering and loss"" on the country's Aboriginal people. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd makes the apology on Wednesday from inside Parliament. New Prime Minister Kevin Rudd read the apology Wednesday to Aborigines and the ""Stolen Generations"" of children who were taken from their families. ""To the mothers and fathers, to the brothers and sisters we say sorry. And for the indignity and degradation on a proud people and a proud culture we say sorry."" For 60 years, until 1970, the Australian government took mixed-race Aboriginal children from their families and put them in dormitories or industrial schools, claiming it was protecting them. As a result of the policy, ""stolen"" children lost contact with their families and heritage, received poor education, lived in harsh conditions, and often endured abuse.  Watch one of these ""stolen"" children discuss this legacy » . ""There is nothing I can say today that will take away the pain... Words are not that powerful,"" Rudd said in the Australian Parliament. He said that the apology was the start of a new approach towards Aborigines which included helping them find their lost families, closing pay gaps and a 17-year difference in life expectancy between Aborigines and white Australians.  Watch Rudd make the apology » . He said new policies would be introduced to provide better healthcare and education to Aborigines. ""The mood of the nation is for reconciliation now,"" Rudd said.  Watch why this apology is considered significant » . The policy was largely a secret until a decade ago, when a government inquiry and high-profile movie exposed it. That sparked a mass movement, supported by many white Australians, demanding an apology. Former Prime Minister John Howard refused to offer an apology, saying the current generation should not be held accountable for past misdeeds. He instead issued a statement of regret. Rudd, who defeated Howard last November, made an apology part of his election campaign. Howard's successor as leader of the Liberal Party, Brendan Nelson, supported the apology Wednesday. ""The apology ... is ... very much just the first step,"" said a spokeswoman for Jenny Macklin, the minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. ""We have serious inequalities between indigenous and nonindigenous Australians. The apology is symbolic, but there's a lot of hard work to be done to reverse those inequalities."" Mary Farrell-Hooker counts herself among the Stolen Generations and is now a spokeswoman for an Aboriginal activist group. She is of mixed race and was one of 12 children of alcoholic parents. Her father was in jail for raping her sister when her mother was hospitalized after a suicide attempt. ""The police came to the school and told me they were taking me to the hospital to see my mom,"" Farrell-Hooker told CNN. ""We never went to the hospital."" Instead, Mary, then 12, was taken to a series of foster centers. At one of them, she said, she was repeatedly raped by a white ""house father."" ""He would actually come into the room and force himself onto me, rape me, molest me,"" she said. ""If I didn't do what he wanted, he would threaten to do the same to my sister and (threaten to) split us up."" Her parents came to find her, she said, but were repeatedly turned away. She tried to run away but said the police always returned her to her tormentor. Aboriginal people have been waiting decades for an apology, and the Australian public appear to welcome the government's move, according to CNN's Jacqueline Head in Sydney. Head said many Australians believe saying sorry is long overdue, but some doubts remain over what it will achieve in the long term -- whether it will help open doors for Aboriginal people seeking rights and compensation or whether it will fail to secure indigenous people a better future. Some white Australians don't believe the apology will bring about reconciliation. ""I think Australians will be sorry for many generations for offering this apology now,"" said Piers Akerman, a conservative commentator. He said Aboriginal compensation claims will now gain new vigor. To symbolize what the government hopes will be a fresh approach to the future, a group of indigenous Australians performed a traditional welcome ceremony Tuesday of dancing and singing to mark the start of parliament's new session. As the traditional owners of the land which parliament sits on, the performers ""welcomed"" the lawmakers onto it. ""For thousands of years, our peoples have observed this protocol,"" said Matilda House, an Aboriginal elder at the ceremony. ""It is a good and honest and decent and very human act to reach out to make sure everyone has a place and is welcome."" E-mail to a friend .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Like many people who have done their time in Haiti, Gary Garner needs a good cry. In the past five days, the Salt Lake City, Utah, physician has held a dying man in his arms and amputated more fingers and toes than he can remember. Now, he needs a rest. Friday found him on the tarmac at the Port-au-Prince airport, searching for a way back to a normal life. ""We're going to go home and cry,"" Garner said in a low voice. Then quietly, gently, with the suffering showing in his eyes as he looks away, he starts to cry. The pain can't wait for home. Full coverage | Twitter updates . Elizabeth Bellino couldn't wait either. The New Orleans, Louisiana, pediatrician sat in her car Friday and wept because doctors at another nation's hospital would not accept a truckload of food and water from her. Nor would they let her pick up patients to take back to the University of Miami field hospital, where she's been volunteering this week. ""It's so frustrating,"" Bellino said afterward. ""Why would they do that?"" There's much crying in Haiti. There's certain to be more once caregivers and others get home. For now, though, the work continues. iReport: List of missing, found | Are you there? Bellino had an increasing patient load at the hospital, located in a dusty field adjacent to the Aeroport International Toussaint L'Ouverture. A 5.9-magnitude aftershock Wednesday had given her new patients. Even though Garner was trying to figure out how to get home, he still kept tending to patients being brought to a landing zone in three private helicopters. Those helicopters belong to Utah businessman Jeremy Johnson, who offered to take a medical team to Haiti after last week's 7.0-magnitude earthquake killed tens of thousands and injured thousands more. Garner was a last-minute addition to a team put together by financial adviser Craig Nelson, a neighbor in Utah. Nelson had been to Haiti on a Mormon mission 20 years ago, along with Steve Hansen and Chuck Peterson, now both Utah physicians. When Nelson heard about the earthquake, he decided they needed to go. Hansen and Peterson readily agreed. They were dropped off Monday at the coastal city of Leogane, nearly 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of Port-au-Prince. The city was at the epicenter of last week's earthquake, and some reports say up to 90 percent of Leogane's buildings were damaged or destroyed. Impact Your World . The U.S. doctors were among the first caregivers to arrive and were later joined by teams from Cuba, Germany, Canada and other nations. Unlike what happened to Bellino in Port-au-Prince, everyone got along fine in Leogane. ""It was like the United Nations of medical work,"" said Nelson. ""There were no nationalities,"" Garner said. They treated about 300 patients. The medicine was often rudimentary because of a lack of supplies. One doctor used a Leatherman tool to amputate a man's lower leg. Doctors also used a rack from the back of a bicycle as a makeshift orthopedic splint, screwing it into the patient's leg bones. The days were long, bleeding deep into the night. Sleep lasted three or four hours. ""We worked until our headlamps ran out of batteries and then people would bring us batteries,"" Garner said. ""You can sleep when you're dead,"" he said. ""And I'll have plenty of time to sleep this weekend."" And, no doubt, have a good cry or two.","Doctor from Utah looks for way home after 5 days of volunteering .

"Editor's note: Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. His new book, ""Arsenal of Democracy: The Politics of National Security -- From World War II to the War on Terrorism,"" will be published in December by Basic Books. Zelizer writes widely about current events. President Obama is taking a huge step in his presidency. After weeks of careful deliberation, the president has sided with military officials who have been pushing for an escalation of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Explaining his objectives and exit strategy, Obama is expected to announce that he will be sending 30,000 troops, and possibly more, into the region. With this decision, Obama inches closer to becoming a wartime president. Even though the White House insists that they will continue to work hard on their domestic agenda, historically, presidents who become involved in protracted ground wars find that their presidencies are defined by their military conflicts. The politics that surround a military operation play an enormous role in the political success or failure of an administration. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and many congressional Democrats realize the human and political risks that come from this war. As news broke of President Obama's decision, Pelosi said: ""the American people believe that if something is in our national security interest, we have to be able to afford it. That doesn't mean that we hold everything else"" stagnant because of those operations. But war sucks the political oxygen out of almost any presidency. There have been several modern presidents who started their term with an ambitious domestic vision and who ended up with their presidencies totally consumed by war. President Harry Truman, who served from 1945 to 1953, pulled off a historic upset in his reelection bid against Thomas Dewey in 1948. In the campaign, Truman castigated a ""do-nothing"" Congress. When he returned to the White House after the election, Truman fought for an ambitious domestic agenda in 1949 and 1950, which he called the Fair Deal, which included national health care, civil rights, fair housing and more. While a conservative coalition of southern Democrats and Republicans in Congress defeated most of his proposals, it was the Korean War, which began in the summer of 1950, that brought down his presidency. When the military operations against North Korea bogged down into a stalemate by 1951, Republicans ripped into the administration for refusing to use enough air power against the communists. Truman, whose approval ratings plummeted to 23 percent by 1952, decided that he should not run for reelection. ""If we had been less trusting, if we had been less soft and weak, there would probably have been no war in Korea!"" Republican candidate and military hero Gen. Dwight Eisenhower said on the campaign trail. Republicans focused their campaign on Korea, Communism and corruption. The Democratic nominee, Adlai Stevenson, lost; Republicans gained control of Congress. President Lyndon Johnson was on the verge of becoming a transformative president in the winter of 1965. Since taking office, Johnson had presided over the passage of a sweeping body of domestic measures unequaled by almost any president in American history other than Franklin Roosevelt. His accomplishments included Medicare and Medicaid, federal education assistance, civil rights and voting rights, environmental regulations, immigration reform and much more. Yet all those accomplishments seemed to disappear in the political psyche after the ""Americanization"" of the war in the spring of 1965, when Johnson authorized a vast increase of ground troops to Vietnam. By 1968, public opinion had turned against the war, with anti-war protesters organizing against ""Johnson's War."" In the history books, Vietnam has swamped our memory of Johnson's presidency and eclipsed much of what he accomplished in those early years. ""That bitch of a war,"" Johnson lamented toward the end of his life, ""killed the lady I really loved -- the Great Society."" Most recently, there was the experience of President George W. Bush. During the 2000 campaign and in the early months of his presidency, Bush pushed for a type of ""compassionate conservatism"" that sought to extend certain kinds of government programs and establish the framework for a broad Republican coalition that captured the center and right. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 extended the reach of the federal government into the nation's grade schools. After 9/11, Bush led a successful operation to knock the Taliban out of power in Afghanistan and dramatically reorganized homeland security. But once Bush sent troops to Iraq to bring down Saddam Hussein in 2003, the war came to dominate everything else. As the reconstruction of Iraq proved to be much more difficult than the White House anticipated, Bush's popularity plummeted. In 2006, Democrats took control of Congress and in 2008 Barack Obama, on a platform defined by his opposition to Iraq, was elected president. There are modern presidents who have balanced their agendas and preserved domestic policy as an integral part of their political identity even after having sent troops to war. This was the certainly the case with FDR who protected many of his domestic programs and even expanded government into new areas at home as the war unfolded. But FDR is an exception to the rule. Soon Obama will be significantly expanding an existing military operation, making this war his own. In doing so, he will be risking a huge amount of his potential impact as a president. To make matters even worse, unlike Johnson, Obama has had more trouble pushing much of his domestic agenda through Congress. While he will very likely walk away from this year with a victory on health care, most of his agenda remains bottled up. It is easy to see how Afghanistan can quickly grow in scale and scope. It would be a tragedy if a politician who headed a historic campaign based on the promise of extracting the United States from a very unpopular war would wind up bogged down in a quagmire of his own. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","With his troop decision, Obama becomes a wartime president, says Julian Zelizer .

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- A 90-year-old man from northern Germany has been charged with 58 counts of murder for the killings of Jewish forced laborers in the final days of World War Two. The man, who was not named, was a member of the feared SS serving in what is now Austria when he allegedly carried out the crimes, the state court in Duisburg, western Germany, said Tuesday. A state office responsible for the prosecution of Nazi war crimes filed the charges. On March 29, 1945, the man brought at least 57 Jewish forced laborers in several groups to a wooded area where they were forced to give up their valuables and kneel in a ditch, the court said. ""The accused and other SS members then shot the Jewish forced laborers cruelly from the back,"" the court said. That day or the next, the court said, the man made other Jewish forced laborers who were ""exhausted and no longer able to walk"" to march near the town of Jabing, which was then in Germany and is now part of modern-day Austria. He then ""insidiously"" shot them from the back, it added. ""The accusation is that the accused let himself be led by the National Socialist (Nazi) ideology, corresponding to an extremely hostile and inhumane attitude toward the victims, who he viewed as inferior,"" the court said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British businessman jailed in Dubai after being convicted with a female companion for having sex on a beach said he had acted naively as he spoke publicly Monday for the first time since returning to the UK. Vince Acors said he had been ""extremely naive"" about Muslim law. Vince Acors, 34, and Michelle Palmer, 36, were arrested on a Dubai beach in July and convicted to three-month jail terms in October on charges of public indecency and for having sex outside marriage. Their jail sentences were suspended on appeal and both returned to the UK last week. Acors, a telecommunications executive, admitted being drunk at the time of the incident after an afternoon of drinking but denied that sex between the couple had occurred and said that worldwide media interest in the case had given authorities no choice but to convict them. ""Sex in this country (the UK) is not the same as sex in Dubai,"" Acors told a news conference, adding that there was ""physical contact but intercourse did not take place.""  Watch as Acors gives his side of the story » . But Acors admitted he had been ""extremely naive"" about Muslim law in the Middle Eastern country. He described how drinking was commonplace in the Emirate's Western hotels, and how his ""champagne glass was never empty"" during a Friday afternoon ""all-you-can-drink"" reception where he met Palmer. Acors said the Dubai authorities had confiscated his passport during deportation proceedings that took three months. He returned to Britain on Christmas Eve and is now looking to sell his story. He said he and Palmer had since spoken only to discuss the case and don't have a relationship. She was not at the news conference.","British man convicted of having sex on a beach in Dubai denies sex took place .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- China summoned the U.S. ambassador on Friday to express its ""strong dissatisfaction"" over the Dalai Lama's meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama a day earlier. China didn't disclose what was discussed during the session with Ambassador Jon Huntsman at the Foreign Ministry. But Beijing had warned that a meeting between the president and the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader would damage its ties with Washington. ""The Chinese side expresses strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to this meeting,"" a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement after Thursday's meeting at the White House. ""China demands the U.S. seriously consider China's stance, immediately adopt measures to wipe out the adverse impact, [and] stop conniving and supporting anti-China separatist forces."" The U.S. Embassy didn't characterize Friday's meeting, but it provided the message Huntsman delivered to Deputy Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai. ""Now is the time to move forward and cooperate in ways that benefit our two counties, the region and the world,"" Huntsman said, according to the U.S. Embassy. The meeting has the potential to further complicate Sino-U.S. tensions, which have been rising in recent months. The Dalai Lama has said he favors genuine autonomy for Tibetans, not independence for Tibet. Beijing regards the Nobel Peace Prize laureate as a separatist who wishes to sever Tibet from China. Obama's meeting with the Dalai Lama ""runs against the repeated commitments by the U.S. government that the U.S. recognizes Tibet as part of China and gives no support to 'Tibet independence',"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said. During the meeting, Obama stressed his ""strong support for the preservation of Tibet's unique religious, cultural and linguistic identity, and the protection of human rights for Tibetans,"" according to a White House statement. The president praised the Dalai Lama's ""commitment to nonviolence and his pursuit of dialogue with the Chinese government,"" the statement added. He also stressed the importance of having both sides ""engage in direct dialogue to resolve differences, and was pleased to hear about the recent resumption of talks,"" it noted. The Dalai Lama, while acknowledging that he raised concerns about Tibet during the meeting, did not provide further specifics about his home region's political situation while addressing reporters. He said he admired America as a ""champion of democracy and ... freedom,"" and cited the need to promote ""religious harmony"" and ""human value."" He also met with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The meeting between the Dalai Lama and Obama could ""seriously undermine the Sino-U.S. political relations,"" Zhu Weiqun, a senior Communist Party leader in charge of ethnic and religious affairs, warned recently. ""We will take corresponding action to make relevant countries see their mistakes."" On Thursday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said the meeting ""grossly violated the norms governing ... international relations."" Obama did not meet with the Dalai Lama when the spiritual leader visited Washington last fall, making it the first time since 1991 that such a meeting did not occur. Ahead of a summit with Chinese President Hu Jintao, Obama persuaded Tibetan representatives back then to postpone the meeting with the Dalai Lama. Thursday's encounter took place against the backdrop of several contentious issues already threatening to sour the relationship between America and China, including trade disputes, a recent U.S. arm sales deal for Taiwan -- which China considers an illegitimate breakaway province -- and a censorship row over Internet search engine Google Inc. The meeting is ""another event in the recent, one has to say, downward spiral in U.S.-China relations,"" said China scholar David Shambaugh. It's also troublesome for the Chinese for one other important reason, Shambaugh said. ""He could have met him as a spiritual leader in a neutral place like a church,"" he said. But receiving him in the White House ""is a political act. And that is going to irritate China very much."" The meeting did not take place in the formal, official setting of the Oval Office. It was instead held in the White House Map Room, which is considered part of the presidential residence. The choice of settings was considered by many observers to be a sign of Washington's acknowledgment of Beijing's political sensitivities. Some analysts said the Chinese government could retaliate by cutting off political exchanges as they did after the Dalai Lama met with the heads of state of France and Germany. And Hu could turn down an invitation to visit Washington in April. Neither China nor the United States can afford strained relations, said Douglas Paal, a diplomat and investment banker who has served as a presidential adviser on China. ""We both need each other,"" he said. ""We need each other for a number of international security issues -- to deal with the global climate crisis, to deal with the global financial crisis."" China is the largest growing export market for U.S. companies, Paal said, expanding by 65 percent last year alone. Nearly three-quarters of all Americans think that Tibet should be an independent country, according to a new national CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll. But the survey, released Thursday, also indicates that most Americans think it is more important to maintain good relations with China than to take a stand on Tibet.

"(CNN) -- A broad band of severe thunderstorms Sunday sparked heavy rain and hail and prompted tornado warnings from Florida to Virginia, with multiple twisters reported in North Carolina, according to the National Weather Service. At least eight unconfirmed tornadoes were spotted along North Carolina's I-85 corridor between Charlotte and Greensboro, with overturned mobile homes, toppled trees and downed power lines left by the storms, the weather service said. ""It's been a very active evening for most of central North Carolina,"" said Julia Jarema, spokeswoman for North Carolina Emergency Management. The storms caused scattered power outages throughout the state, but because of the multiple bands of storms ""things are changing so rapidly we haven't been able to confirm numbers,"" Jarema said. Video showed a portion of metal roofing was ripped off an industrial building in Belmont, North Carolina, west of Charlotte, littering nearby trees with clumps of yellow insulation. Multiple mobile homes were overturned in Linwood, North Carolina, outside of Lexington, and at least three people were reported injured, said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. A video posted on YouTube purportedly showed flashes of snapping power lines as a huge funnel cloud loomed over High Point, North Carolina, near Greensboro.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- As huge numbers of desperate Haitians struggled Friday in what could be their last hours of life, the supplies many needed remained stuck in planes, ships, and cargo holds, unable to get to them. Adding to the desperation, medical personnel were seen leaving in droves Friday night from a makeshift hospital in Port-au-Prince after being told by U.N. officials to get out of the area. Medical staff had been treating 25 patients at the location. ""There is concern about riots not far from here -- and this is part of the problem,"" CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta said. ""They (doctors) want to take care of lots of patients that are actually in the tents and many more that are actually outside, but they are simply being told at this point to stop and try to get to some sort of secure location."" Sandra Pierre, a Haitian who has been helping at the hospital, said the medical staff took most of the supplies with them. ""All the doctors, all the nurses are gone,"" she said. ""They are expected to be back tomorrow. They had no plan on leaving tonight. It was an order that came suddenly."" She told Gupta, ""It's just you ... and an American soldier who retired who came here from Santo Domingo to help."" ""With medicine, we are not talking about weeks and months down the line -- this is minutes and hours in terms of what is necessary,"" Gupta said. Get the latest developments on Haiti . There was one bright spot Friday: Many residents had ready access to water. Around the fallen presidential palace, water trucks were seen servicing the masses who have taken up camp in nearby open areas. Local hotels and businesses have been putting out hoses to supply the homeless with clean water. Residents were seen waiting patiently in long lines to fill up anything and everything that could hold water -- from plastic jugs to metal drums. A U.N. distribution center also was set up in Cite Soleil, guarded by U.N. peacekeeping troops, where some 10,000 plates of cooked chicken and rice were handed out to a patient line of survivors. See full coverage of Haiti . In Port-au-Prince, a chaotic scene erupted as people clamored to reach the trucks of a World Food Programme convoy carrying water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, collapsible jugs and nutritional biscuits. At one point, a rumor spread that the food had expired and people began throwing it away. Eventually, the convoy was forced to leave the scene, with some survivors chasing after the truck trying to hold on to the back. A bottleneck at the damaged airport -- which has one runway -- was one of the impediments facing aid workers. U.S. Southern Command has determined that the airport can handle 90 flights a day, but that many are not yet being allowed in, a U.S. State Department spokesman said. Neighboring Dominican Republic agreed to open up one of its airports and a seaport to help deal with the influx of aid, according to the Dominican ambassador to the United States, Roberto B. Saladin. Authorities were trying to develop a system to prioritize the few flights that make it in, based on which have the most urgently needed supplies. But the logistical problems also included an unreachable dock, too little equipment to unload the supplies, and impassable roads covered in rubble or dead bodies. Dave Toycen, head of the relief agency World Vision Canada, said that even when roads became passable, ""There was a mile-long line to get gasoline. We are short the basics."" One Haitian man approached U.N. workers at the World Food Programme warehouse, which was already helping feed 1 million people before the quake. ""Where is the support?"" he cried as he threw down a blood-stained box carrying the human limbs that he said were from the bodies of his wife and child. Rajiv Shah, director for the U.S. Agency for International Development, said Friday the organization's Disaster Assistance Response Team team in Haiti was using satellite imagery to target rescue operations and aid delivery most effectively. Shah said ""there is an important open window of time today, tonight, and perhaps even parts of tomorrow, when we have the ability to save lives."" The USS Carl Vinson arrived off the coast Friday, carrying 19 heavy-lift helicopters, 51 hospital beds, three operating rooms, and the ability to produce hundreds of thousands of gallons of drinkable water per day. There are four U.S. disaster medical assistance teams on the ground and 265 employees from the department of Health and Human Services assisting with medical care, the State Department said. Numerous countries around the world were offering aid, including Belize, Brazil, Britain, China, Chile, Spain, Canada, Israel, Iceland, Ireland and Morocco. A long list of agencies have sent help to the region as well, and have raised millions of dollars. The Obama administration fended off criticism Friday that it should have done more for Haiti more quickly. Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, the retired general who took charge of relief efforts in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, said Thursday the U.S. military should have arrived in the country 24 hours sooner. Defense Secretary Robert Gates rejected that suggestion Friday. ""I don't know how this government could have responded faster or more comprehensively than it has,"" he told reporters at the Pentagon. ""There are just some certain facts of life that affect how quickly you can do some of these things.

"(CNN) -- Colombian Sgt. Pablo Emilio Moncayo, held by Colombian FARC rebels as a hostage for more than 12 years, was reunited with his family after being released by his captors. The young soldier arrived in the city of Florencia in a Brazilian military helicopter that transported him from the jungle, and he walked out wearing a military uniform and into his waiting father's arms. He had been held captive longer than any other hostage held by the rebels. Moncayo was accompanied by Colombian Sen. Piedad Cordoba, who helped negotiate his release. He had been captured as a 19-year-old corporal when Marxist guerrillas attacked his unit, killing 22 of his colleagues and capturing him and 18 others on December 21, 1997. ""How amazing it is to see civilization again,"" Moncayo told reporters shortly after his return. The advances in technology fascinated him the most, he said. ""I survived everything, all of these years of captivity because of my love for Colombia,"" Moncayo said. Moncayo thanked Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa for asking for his release, and presidents Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, but he did not mention Colombian President Alvaro Uribe during his remarks. Another source of tension during the rescue came after the Venezuelan-based network Telesur broadcast images of Moncayo and those involved in the handover. The Colombian government issued a terse statement calling the broadcast a violation of the protocols of the rescue. The television station denied any wrongdoing, and Cordoba said that the humanitarian party had not noticed that the network had someone in the jungle filming. During the handover, the FARC also gave Senator Cordoba the coordinates of the remains of a third hostage who died in captivity in 2006. Colombian authorities could retrieve the remains of Maj. Julian Guevara as soon as Thursday. The FARC has said that Moncayo's was the last unilateral hostage release it would make. It is asking for a prisoner swap for the remaining hostages they hold. If his experience was like that of other freed hostages, Moncayo likely spent the years chained to trees and marching from one jungle hideout to another every few days. Other captives have talked about enduring rain, cold and a blistering sun, and eating mostly beans and rice and weak soup -- when fortunate enough to get a meal. It's a reality that changed Tuesday for Moncayo when the rebels released him. The rebels had said they would release Moncayo, who was promoted to the rank of sergeant while in captivity, nearly a year ago. The FARC already released a hostage Sunday. Josue Daniel Calvo, who had been held for 11 months, was reunited with his family Sunday on a tarmac in the city of Villavicencio, where the helicopter that retrieved him touched down. The humanitarian mission to release the captives has been led by Colombian Sen. Piedad Cordoba, who has obtained freedom for previous hostages. The Red Cross also has been involved. Brazil, which is trusted by both sides, has picked up and ferried the hostages aboard its helicopters. The FARC released six hostages last year but have said Moncayo would be the last set free unilaterally. From now on, the FARC said, the rebels will demand that guerrillas held by the Colombian government be swapped for the remaining police and soldiers under rebel captivity, many for more than a decade. Moncayo was among the best-known hostages still in FARC captivity, due mostly to the efforts of his father, who walked across Colombia to garner attention and press for his son's release. Gustavo Guillermo Moncayo Rincon set out on June 17, 2007, Father's Day in Colombia, on a 700-mile (1,100-kilometer) trek from his hometown of Sandona to the capital, Bogota. The teacher became known as ""el caminante por la paz"" (""the walker for peace""). He was received by a governor and a mayor on his walk, which drew nationwide attention. Thousands of people cheered him when he arrived at the Plaza de Bolivar in Bogota in August 2007. The walk put pressure on Colombian President Alvaro Uribe to negotiate with the rebels, which he has steadfastly declined to do. The FARC announced on April 16, 2009, that it would release Moncayo in the hopes of starting peace talks with the government. Uribe responded that the rebels first had to stop ""bombing, kidnapping and drug smuggling."" Any chance for an immediate release seemed to fall apart in December, when 10 armed men killed a state governor and Uribe blamed the FARC. The hostage release came alive again this month when Brazil announced it was moving helicopters to the border near Colombia to use in the operation. Calvo was released Sunday and Moncayo was set free Tuesday. Calvo became dizzy and sick on the helicopter ride, but he was in better health than family and others expected, intermediary Cordoba said at a news conference. The soldier walked from the helicopter with his family and the aid of a walking stick. One of the best-known incidents involving FARC hostages occurred in July 2008, when a rescue operation freed former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt along with three U.S. military contractors and 11 Colombian police and military members. Betancourt had been held hostage since 2002. Colombia has previously said the rebels are holding hundreds of captives, but the government group Freedom Foundation said this month that FARC was holding about 50 people. The group attributed the revision to ""cleaning up databases."" Independent anti-kidnap organizations accused the government of minimizing the problem to try to demonstrate political gains. No independent estimate of FARC's guerrilla strength exists, though its military force has been severely compromised recently. Government estimates say the FARC fighting force could have dropped to below 7,000 from highs of around 18,000 in 2000. Security analysts have said FARC guerrillas, who are accused of trafficking in cocaine to finance their insurgency, have thousands of supporters, mostly in rural areas. The guerrilla group operates mostly in Colombia but has carried out extortion, kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador, analysts say.","Brazilian helicopter returns Pablo Emilio Moncayo to freedom .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The world's population is forecast to hit 7 billion in 2011, the vast majority of its growth coming in developing and, in many cases, the poorest nations, a report released Wednesday said. Riders cram into a train last month in New Delhi, India. India's population is expected to be 1.7 billion by 2050. A staggering 97 percent of global growth over the next 40 years will happen in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the Population Reference Bureau's 2009 World Population Data Sheet. ""The great bulk of today's 1.2 billion youth -- nearly 90 percent -- are in developing countries,"" said Carl Haub, a co-author of the report. Eight in 10 of those youth live in Africa and Asia. ""During the next few decades, these young people will most likely continue the current trend of moving from rural areas to cities in search of education and training opportunities, gainful employment, and adequate health care,"" Haub continued, calling it one of the major social questions of the next few decades. In the developed world, the United States and Canada will account for most of the growth -- half from immigration and half from a natural increase in the population -- births minus deaths, according to the report. High fertility rates and a young population base in the developing world will fuel most of the growth, especially in Africa, where women often give birth to six or seven children over a lifetime, the report says. The number is about two in the United States and 1.5 in Canada. A stark contrast can be drawn between Uganda and Canada, which currently have about 34 million and 31 million residents, respectively. By 2050, Canada's population is projected to be 42 million, while Uganda's is expected to soar to 96 million, more than tripling. ""Even with declining fertility rates in many countries, world population is still growing at a rapid rate,"" said Bill Butz, president of the bureau. ""The increase from 6 billion to 7 billion is likely to take 12 years, as did the increase from 5 billion to 6 billion. Both events are unprecedented in world history."" By 2050, India is projected to be the world's most populous nation at 1.7 billion, overtaking current leader China, which is forecast to hit 1.4 billion.

"(CNN) -- Oklahoma authorities are determining whether two bodies found Monday are those of a murder suspect and his wife's missing 7-year-old daughter, a spokeswoman for investigators said. The bodies and a car authorities said was used in the kidnapping of the girl were found in a heavily wooded area in Norman, outside Oklahoma City, said Jessica Brown, spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation. Lester Williams Hobbs, 46, was charged in the death of his estranged wife, Tonya, and the kidnapping of her daughter, Aja Daniell Johnson. Hobbs and the girl have been missing since January. Brown said the bodies are those of an adult and child, but positive identification has not been made due to decomposition. ""There's no reason to believe it's not"" Hobbs and the child, she said. The medical examiner will attempt to identify the bodies using Hobbs' fingerprints and Johnson's dental records, Brown said. The cause of death was unknown, though a note found near the car described what happened, she added. The details of the note were not released. The car had been left in the woods for several weeks, possible a month, Brown said. The search for Hobbs and Johnson took investigators through Oklahoma and Texas. Lester Hobbs is not Johnson's biological father and has an extensive criminal history, police say. Johnson's biological father was awarded emergency custody of her in November, according to Oklahoma County District Court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KWTV of Oklahoma City. At a hearing, Tonya Hobbs -- identified as Tonya Dunkin in the documents -- and the girl's father, John Johnson, agreed that she would have supervised visitation with the girl and that she would keep the child away from Lester Hobbs, the documents said.","Lester Williams Hobbs suspected in death of wife and kidnapping of her daughter .

"(CNN) -- The Mexican military has arrested a suspect in the killings this month of three people with ties to the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, police and federal spokesmen said Monday. The arrested man is Ricardo Valles de la Rosa, municipal police spokesman Jacinto Seguro said. According to Juarez newspaper El Diario, the suspect also was sought in connection with at least one other homicide: the killing of Zapata Reyes, a member of the rival Mexicles gang. Valles de la Rosa reportedly has U.S. ties, having been charged with 10 counts related to drug trafficking in the United States, local media said. The suspect is a resident of la colonia Partido Romero in Ciudad Juarez, the media said, adding that he may rent a place in El Paso. Federal spokesman Enrique Torres said the suspect was arrested sometime Friday. He did not release a name, but described him as being 42 years old and a member of the Aztecas, a local street gang affiliated with the Juarez drug cartel. ""The Chihuahua state attorney general is telling us that this guy is implicated in the killings of Arthur Redelfs and his pregnant wife, Lesley [Enriquez],"" Seguro said. El Diario reported that the suspect was captured with the help of the FBI. An FBI spokesman in El Paso, Texas, had no comment, other than to say that the investigation continues. The three victims had all been at a party in Juarez and left in two vehicles that looked similar. They were killed on the roads in drive-by shootings. Enriquez was an employee of the consulate in Juarez and was four months pregnant. Redelfs, her U.S. citizen husband, was a jailer in El Paso. The couple's 10-month-old child, who also was in the vehicle, was not injured. The third victim, found dead in the other vehicle, was identified as the husband of a Mexican employee of the consulate. His wife was not traveling with him, but two of their children in the car were wounded, officials said.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Raymond Thomas is a jolly man who laughs easily and likes to say ""Forget it"" a lot. He'd like to forget the devastation wrought at the Port-au-Prince harbor where his fleet of trucks used to pick up cargo. Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude earthquake sent a quarter-mile pier crumbling into the sea along with two of his trucks. The few workers who went into the water swam to safety, Thomas said, but the port remains shut down, and desperately needed aid cannot be unloaded quickly. ""Now we're just starving to death,"" he said, worried that the airport and smaller harbors cannot handle the necessary volume of relief supplies. ""That was the whole country right there,"" he added, pointing at two toppled cranes on the remains of the pier that stand out against the clear-blue sky. Thomas owns Raymond and Sons Trucking, a fleet of 35 trucks that haul cargo from the port. The company employed about 50 employees, all of them now out of work. ""I'm out,"" Thomas said. The port won't be back for a while. Roads have been split apart and buckled, fences have fallen over. ""Oh, forget it,"" Thomas said. ""Forget it. It might take a year to rebuild it. Forget it."" Yet he feels fortunate because although his home was destroyed and his business is shattered, no one in his family died in the quake. Asked what happened, he demurs with a hearty laugh. ""Forget it,"" he says. ""I don't want to talk about it."" He then relents, calling his family's survival ""a miracle.""

He wasn't wearing a seat belt, he admits. ""This is Haiti. In Miami, I wear a seat belt."" Another laugh. Thomas' 40-year-old daughter, Marjorie, and her 15-month-old son had just left earlier that afternoon to return to her home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

On Friday, he was wearing a bullet-proof vest after someone tried to rob him the day before. Someone wanted to take his cell phone he said, and the port is near the roughest part of town. For now, Thomas and his wife are sleeping in a tent. And for now, also, his mind is on the port. He's not alone. Tug boat owner Roger Rouzier also seem a dim future without the port. ""We cannot receive the help by plane,"" Rouzier said Friday. ""We need to receive help by boat."" Rouzier estimates that before the earthquake, more than 70 ships each unloaded about 8,000 tons of material every month. ""I personally unload three or four a day,"" he said. ""The whole country depends on this port. If we're going to save people, we have to do it by boat."" Without the port, Thomas sees serious consequences for Haiti, one of the poorest nations on Earth. ""We'll starve to death, that's all,"" he said. ""We'll just starve to death."" And it won't take long for trouble to reach the streets, he said. Especially since many of the nation's criminals escaped when Port-au-Prince's prison collapsed in the quake. ""Very soon we're going to have a riot,"" Thomas said, this time not laughing. How soon? ""I don't give you a week,"" he said. No laugh there either.","Tuesday's 7.0 earthquake severely damaged Port-au-Prince's harbor .

"(CNN) -- President Obama is expected to sign the final health care legislation into law this week, but while the action wraps up on Capitol Hill, the heated debate over reform shows no sign of cooling down. With lawmakers back in their districts for the spring work period, the conversation just moves to a different platform. For Democrats, the two-week recess is an opportunity to highlight the immediate benefits of a law the public is not yet sold on. Democrats say the health care law provides all Americans with the opportunity to receive health care and prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to those who need it most. For Republicans, it's a chance to rally support behind their efforts to repeal what they decry as a ""takeover"" of the health care system that will saddle future generations of Americans with debt. What's the one thing you want to ask your representatives? Republicans have made ""repeal and replace"" their battle cry, and Obama has said he welcomes the fight. At an event in Iowa City, Iowa, last week, the president scoffed at the Republicans' strategy, saying, ""My attitude is -- Go for it."" Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann last week introduced a bill to repeal the health care legislation, as did other Republican lawmakers. ""We need to work together, whether we're Republicans, independents, Democrats, we all have to work together for whatever is in the best interest of the American people. And repeal most certainly is in the best interest of the people because this bill will lead to economic harm if it's left in place,"" Bachmann told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" But Tim Kaine, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he doesn't think efforts to knock down the legislation stand much chance. ""They may want to push forward on a repeal of health care, to tell small businesses you're not going to get tax credits to pay for insurance, to tell families you now can't keep children on your policy until [they]'re 26, to tell folks that you're now subject to these abuses of the insurance industry. I think they'd be unwise to do it. I think the American public will reject it,"" he told CBS. Despite the opposing messages, both sides say the public supports them. Republicans say the public opposes the president's plan, but Democrats insist that people will eventually accept the plan now that it is finalized. And so far, both sides have a point. Most Americans disapprove of the health care reform law, but that does not translate into majority support for the ""repeal and replace"" strategy, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Monday. CNN Poll: Americans divided over repealing health care law . Meanwhile, polls from both CBS and Quinnipiac University suggest that there has been a slight uptick in approval of the legislation following the vote. Another survey, a ABC/Washington Post poll released Sunday, indicated that the public's overall view of the health care plan has held steady, with 46 percent supporting it and 50 percent opposed. The percentage of people who said they strongly support the health care legislation, however, increased by 10 points since February, while the percentage who strongly opposed it stayed about the same. ""We'll find out in November who won or lost this battle,"" Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, told CBS. ""What I do next is, I'm trying to replace those who voted for this bill. I want to repeal it. And I want to replace it with some real reform that puts patients in charge of their health care again,"" he said. Echoing DeMint, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he was looking forward to an election in November ""about whether this health care bill is a real fix or a phony political document trying to grow the government."" Calling the legislation a ""giant Ponzi scheme,"" the Republican senator vowed that the fight ""won't wind up just being in Washington."" Following a week of over-the-top rhetoric stemming from the health care vote, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Democrat from Maryland, cautioned that if lawmakers don't watch their own words, they'll hurt their credibility. ""If we don't take ourselves seriously and act in a serious way, we're not going to be taken seriously by the American people,"" Mikulski said. ""I have a suggestion. Let's go back to the three R's: respect, rules of engagement that promote decorum, and, No. 3 -- stop the rewards system that enables you to raise a lot of money after using outrageous and bizarre behavior,"" she added.","Lawmakers back in their districts for two-week spring recess .

"(CNN) -- Alone in the darkness beneath layers of rubble, Dan Woolley felt blood streaming from his head and leg. Then he remembered -- he had an app for that. Woolley, an aid worker, husband, and father of two boys, followed instructions on his cell phone to survive the January 12 earthquake in Haiti. ""I had an app that had pre-downloaded all this information about treating wounds. So I looked up excessive bleeding and I looked up compound fracture,"" Woolley told CNN. The application on his iPhone is filled with information about first aid and CPR from the American Heart Association. ""So I knew I wasn't making mistakes,"" Woolley said. ""That gave me confidence to treat my wounds properly."" Trapped in the ruins of the Hotel Montana in Port-au-Prince, he used his shirt to bandage his leg, and tied his belt around the wound. To stop the bleeding on his head, he firmly pressed a sock to it. Concerned he might have been experiencing shock, Woolley used the app to look up what to do. It warned him not to sleep. So he set his phone alarm to go off every 20 minutes. Once the battery got down to less than 20 percent of its power, Woolley turned it off. By then, he says, he had trained his body not to sleep for long periods, drifting off only to wake up within minutes. Woolley's job keeps him tech savvy. He oversees interactive projects for the Christian child advocacy organization Compassion International in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  CNN iReport:  Looking for loved ones in Haiti . With his injuries tended to, he wrote a note to his family in his journal: ""I was in a big accident, an earthquake. Don't be upset at God. He always provides for his children even in hard times. I'm still praying that God will get me out, but he may not. But even so he will always take care of you."" The journal is stained with his blood. After more than 60 hours, Woolley was pulled from the rubble. ""Those guys are rescue heroes,"" he said of the crew that pulled him out.  Interactive map of where to find aid, hospitals in Haiti . His colleague David Hames has not been found. The two had been standing together when the earthquake struck and the Hotel Montana crumbled. They were making a film about poverty in Haiti and had just gotten back to the hotel, heading to the elevator in the lobby. ""Then all of a sudden just all craziness broke loose,"" Woolley said. ""Convulsions of the ground around us, the walls started rippling and then falling on us. [Hames] yelled out, 'I think it's an earthquake!' I looked for someplace safe to jump to and there was no safe place."" When the shaking stopped, Woolley couldn't see. And his friend was not with him. He turned on the focus light of a camera he was wearing around his neck, but he didn't have his glasses. ""So I actually took some pictures and would look at the back of the lens of the camera and saw in one of those pictures the elevator that I ended up hobbling over to. And that became my safe place."" Once in the elevator, he used the app -- called ""Pocket First Aid & CPR"" from Jive Media -- to tend to his injuries. Woolley said his phone ""was like a high-tech version of a Swiss Army knife that enabled me to treat my own injuries, track time, stay awake and stay alive."" Woolley heard voices of some other people trapped nearby, and they spoke with each other. ""About a day, maybe day and a half in, we heard rescuers, and they had a list of our names at that point, because they were able to talk to one of the people we were talking with. And so then it seemed like, OK, this is going to happen, we're actually going to get rescued. ""But then it just took a long time and there were times where I didn't hear anything or I'd hear drilling in a far part of the building and just didn't get any reassurance they were still coming for me,"" Woolley said. ""The scene outside was a lot more chaotic and less simple than I imagined in my head. ... But eventually they came for me and did an amazing rescue."" Back home now in Colorado Springs with his wife Christina and children Josh, 6, and Nathan, 3, Woolley said he's grateful to God for getting him through the ordeal.

"Kolkata, India (CNN) -- At 65, Ian Zachariah is one of the youngest ones left. ""Can you believe it?"" he says, adjusting a borrowed yarmulke in a now-empty synagogue. His eyes scan the glittering stained glass, the blue-domed ceiling and the rows of dark wood and wicker benches, still arranged the way they were when, decades ago on the Sabbath, Maghen David was teeming. His mind races back to his childhood, when he occupied a seat in the back left-hand corner and much to his father's chagrin, gazed upward to the second floor gallery where the girls and women sat. But a hush has fallen within Maghen David's walls. There have not been prayers said here in a long time, for the lack of 10 able-bodied men needed to form the minyan, the quorum required for a Jewish service. Zachariah's heart feels empty like the synagogue's pews. He knows the end is near for the Jews of Kolkata. Once a thriving community of 6,000, their numbers can be counted on fingers now. Zachariah says fewer than 30 Jews are left in this bustling eastern Indian metropolis. Many Jews began leaving Kolkata, the city formerly known as Calcutta, after Indian independence in 1947; those who remained are slowly dying off. Zachariah, a stalwart of the dwindling community, serves on practically every Jewish administrative board. There are simply not enough people left to go around. ""Things have to be kept going,"" he says of the cultural burden weighing heavy on his shoulders. ""We're not lying down and waiting for the sunset."" He runs his fingers over the cold outdoor oven at Maghen David that once turned out fresh unleavened bread. He peers through a window into the basement where vats of wine were stored. From a wooden box, he picks up a book of prayer, the pages eaten with precision by bookworms. ""I always thought someone should take these away. Too late now. They are all in terrible shape."" Zachariah's ancestors arrived in India in the 18th century from the Syrian cities of Aleppo and Damascus. Others came from Iraq and Iran. All of them came to be known as Baghdadi Jews in India. They came to British India to trade -- in jewels, spices, textiles, tobacco, tea. They made a name as exporters and real-estate dealers and bakers. India, said Judaism scholar Nathan Katz, was one of the few places in the world that was inherently hospitable to its Jews. In Kolkata, Jewish families settled in what was known as ""gray town,"" the central city neighborhoods that separated the whites from the ""coloreds."" They built graceful buildings that lined Brabourne Road in the heart of what is today Badabazaar, Kolkata's largest wholesale market. Jewish settlers to Kolkata eventually built five synagogues, at least two schools and a hospital. The schools are still operational, though not one student is Jewish. The Beth El and Maghen David synagogues exist today more as memorials to a former era than as functional Jewish temples. They established a landmark bakery, Nahoum and Sons, in New Market, a favorite among Jews and gentiles alike who craved its fruit cake, cream rolls and lemon tarts. It, too, like every other Jewish institution, faces a perilous future -- the last of the family in Kolkata, David Nahoum, is 84 and frail. ""They were so well integrated into the upper class of Bengali culture,"" said Katz, a professor of religious studies at Florida International University who has done extensive research on the Jewish communities of India. But then came Indian independence and the birth of Israel the following year. The Jews began their exodus. ""A new social and economic order came to into being and their prospects began to dry up,"" Katz said. By his estimate, the 12,000 Baghdadi Jews in all of India in 1947 have now dwindled down to less than 100. In a nation of 1.1 billion people, they don't even qualify as a minority group anymore -- barely a blip. ""It was a beautiful culture,"" Katz said. ""I find it terribly sad."" Katz said Jewish communities have died violent and forced deaths in other places. Ironically, in India, where they did not face persecution, they left of their own accord. That's what makes the tale more poignant. It's not that someone forced the clock on the Maghen David tower to stop -- it just did one day. At 3:30. No one knows the date, though the typewritten notices posted for a board meeting give a clue. The paper is yellow and frayed. ""21st May, 1989."" It was probably that way when Rahel Musleah journeyed back to Kolkata in 1997 to cement the shadowy images of a way of life she had heard about. Her father, Ezekiel Musleah, 82, was a rabbi at Maghen David who saw prospects for his family dry up. ""It was very difficult to leave. But what can a rabbi do in a community that was dying?"" he asked. He began a new life in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1964, determined to carry on the music, the food, the spiritual norms that had taken root from a mix of Middle Eastern and Indian traditions. Rahel Musleah, a 52-year-old freelance writer who lives in Great Neck, New York, recalled her parents speaking Hindustani at home and celebrating birthdays with rasagollahs, a sugary Bengali confection. Women in the synagogue taught her mother -- who had relied on a cook in Kolkata -- to prepare Ashkenazic dishes including chopped liver, brisket and matzo balls. She also learned to replicate the Baghdadi-Indian specialties that her family craved. The stories Musleah heard about Kolkata finally drew her back to the house at 11 Bowbazar Street that bore her grandfather's name: I.S. Musleah. Her great-aunt Ramah was the only one left in the house. Musleah wandered around the dark rooms of the ancestral home, filled with heavy rosewood furniture and photographs of generations gone by. There, among the wedding pictures of her grandparents and aunts, she found her own. Rahel Musleah sipped tea from butter-yellow cups with her aging Aunty Ramah and feasted on deep-fried kachuris and heart-shaped ""queen cakes"" from Nahoum's. On the Sabbath, she sat in dim morning light at Maghen David, closed her eyes and tried to imagine her grandparents and all the people who had come before her. She tried to picture what was still vivid in her father's mind. ""What sadness for my father to sit and walk where in his bones, in his heart and soul, he felt the closeness of everyone he loved. ... All dead now,"" she wrote in an article about her trip. Rahel Musleah returned to Kolkata one other time with her sister several years ago. Two months after that trip, her Aunty Ramah died, severing her last link to that culture. She retrieved the wooden sign from the house bearing her grandfather's name. It now hangs in her home, above her grandparents' portraits. The Jews who are left in Kolkata can do little but watch a way of life disappear. Zachariah thinks he might devote time to establishing a museum showcasing Jewish history; he wants to ensure that the Archaeological Society preserves standing synagogues. ""I don't think there will be a next generation,"" he says. Kolkata, he says, was the kind of place that absorbed everyone. Evidence of that tolerance can be found on the same corner as Maghen David, where land is shared by a Christian church, a Hindu shrine and a Muslim mosque. ""Time marches on. People come. People go. When it was over here, they left,"" Zachariah says. It is 1 p.m. And at that hour, Zachariah's voice gives way to the muezzin's call to prayer.","Once a thriving community of 6,000, about 30 Jews are left in Kolkata, India .
Jews began arriving in India in the 18th century from Syria, Iran and Iraq .

"(CNN) -- About 10 men armed with pistols and small machine guns raided a casino in Switzerland and made off into France with several hundred thousand Swiss francs in the early hours of Sunday morning, police said. The men, dressed in black clothes and black ski masks, split into two groups during the raid on the Grand Casino Basel, Chief Inspector Peter Gill told CNN. One group tried to break into the casino's vault on the lower level but could not get in, but they did rob the cashier of the money that was not secured, he said. The second group of armed robbers entered the upper level where the roulette and blackjack tables are located and robbed the cashier there, he said. As the thieves were leaving the casino, a woman driving by and unaware of what was occurring unknowingly blocked the armed robbers' vehicles. A gunman pulled the woman from her vehicle, beat her, and took off for the French border. The other gunmen followed into France, which is only about 100 meters (yards) from the casino, Gill said. There were about 600 people in the casino at the time of the robbery. There were no serious injuries, although one guest on the Casino floor was kicked in the head by one of the robbers when he moved, the police officer said. Swiss authorities are working closely with French authorities, Gill said. The robbers spoke French and drove vehicles with French license plates. CNN's Andreena Narayan contributed to this report.","Dressed in black clothes and black ski masks, ten men raided Grand Casino Basel .

"(CNN) -- Walking into school Wednesday morning was not easy for Constance McMillen. The last time she'd been there was March 11, the day after her Fulton, Mississippi, high school canceled prom rather than allow her to wear a tuxedo and attend with her girlfriend. She didn't assume last week's spring break would cool things down. She expected stares, dirty looks and cold shoulders, and passing through the doors was daunting. Over these last two weeks, she said, she's had a hard time sleeping, can barely eat, feels anxious and -- until she saw a doctor for help -- often felt like she was ""going to throw up."" ""I've been very nervous about all of this,"" the 18-year-old Itawamba Agricultural High School senior said. ""I don't like being somewhere where everyone hates me."" McMillen's name made national headlines when she, with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, filed suit against her school and the Itawamba County School District, asking them to reinstate prom for everyone, without discrimination. A federal judge in Mississippi ruled Tuesday that while he wouldn't force the school to have a prom, which had originally been scheduled for April 2, he agreed that McMillen's First Amendment rights had been violated. That was good news, said her attorney, Christine Sun, senior counsel with the ACLU's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender project. It set a precedent and helped broadcast an important statement, which was made stronger by virtue of where it came from, she said. ""We're in a conservative area of the country, where people tend to think we can do what we like,"" said Sun, who lives in New York but has traveled multiple times to Mississippi for this legal push. ""This case sends a strong message that that's not going to fly anymore."" The only pending issue, Sun said, is the question of damages and the ACLU's request for attorneys' fees. An amended complaint to seek a quick resolution on this should be filed in the next 30 days, she said. Meantime, McMillen is trying to find her new normal. In many ways, she stands in an awkward balance. Though there are some people who support her in Fulton (population about 4,000), the overarching tension and what she described as ""hostility"" that she feels at school and in her community is in deep contrast to the reception and groundswell of support that's overwhelmed her nationally. As a poster child for the rights of LGBT students, she's been asked to jump on airplanes to appear on news programs and talk shows. The Facebook fan page ""Let Constance Take Her Girlfriend to Prom!"" had attracted more than 414,000 fans as of Friday morning. Wealthy individuals, including Ellen DeGeneres, have offered to pay for a prom for her school. She's received a $30,000 college scholarship from an anonymous donor and Tonic.com, a digital media company in New York that's also offered her a summer internship. She's even been invited to high school proms in cities she's never visited. ""It means a lot to me,"" she said of the outreach from others. ""The amount of support helps me to continue with the fight."" But all McMillen, who came out as a lesbian in eighth grade, ever wanted was to go to her school prom with her class, and with her girlfriend. Going to another school's prom, while a nice offer, doesn't make any sense to her. Parents at her school are reportedly planning a ""ball"" for the same night that prom was intended. McMillen said she's still trying to find out if she's free to attend with her girlfriend. She won't go otherwise. She never meant to be a spoiler for others when she sought approval to bring her girlfriend and wear a tuxedo, she said. She thought she was doing the right thing by asking in advance, since the school had stipulated in a February memo that dates must be of the opposite sex. Rather than give her permission, the school canceled the prom. McMillen said she's learning who her ""true friends"" are. They're the ones who respect her for taking a stance, defend her when others talk trash about her, don't turn their backs when she approaches and aren't afraid to be seen with her. Her girlfriend, too, has remained a constant support, even though she herself hasn't gone public. McMillen also said she's blessed to have family members who shore her up even if they don't all feel comfortable with her sexual orientation. ""My grandmother doesn't believe in it [same-sex relationships] but still stands behind me no matter what,"" McMillen said, her southern drawl thick. ""She's a conservative Christian but respects that it's my life. She doesn't think discrimination of any kind is right."" Whether she intended to or not, McMillen has inspired others -- not just nationally but in her home state, said Izzy Pellegrine, 19, a student at Mississippi State University. ""I thought for a long time I was the only gay person in the state of Mississippi,"" said Pellegrine, who came out at 15 and went to high school about 1½ hours from where McMillen lives. McMillen's actions speak for others who feel unable to speak for themselves, said Pellegrine, who's a founding board member of the Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition, which helped connect McMillen with the ACLU. The grass-roots organization seeks to protect the interests of LGBT youth and will host a ""second chance prom"" on May 8, an event Pellegrine estimated may attract as many as 500 students, thanks in large part to the way McMillen's fight empowers others. Hear stories of others helped by the Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition . ""Usually Mississippi is 10 or 20 years behind,"" Pellegrine said. ""For Mississippi to be spearheading the LGBT student movement is unheard of.  I, personally, and my co-workers are so proud to have it happen in our state,"" where ""queer flight,"" the compulsion to leave as soon as one is able, is rampant, she said. As for where life will take McMillen after graduation, she isn't yet sure. She's still thinking about that summer internship offer in New York and is pretty certain she'll attend Itawamba Community College for a couple years before going to one of her dream schools, the University of Southern Mississippi or UCLA. What she does know is she'd like to study and possibly pursue a career in psychology. ""I like helping people, and I like talking to people about their problems,"" she said. ""I find the human mind and human behavior very interesting."" Soledad O'Brien of CNN's ""In America"" unit will file an extended report on gay teens in the ""Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition,"" the group that was key in connecting Constance McMillen to her ACLU legal team. The story is expected to air in late May or early June.","Constance McMillen in news after school cancels prom; she wanted to bring girlfriend .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- The Mexican government has apologized to the families of two students killed early Friday who officials initially said were drug gang members. Jorge Antonio Mercado Alonso, 23, and Javier Francisco Arredondo Verdugo, 24, were mechanical engineering graduate students at the Technological Institute of Higher Learning of Monterrey, the Mexican Interior Ministry said Sunday in its apology for the shootings. Mexican soldiers chasing criminals who had fired on an army patrol shot and killed the students, the Interior Ministry said. Some of the criminals had fled onto the college campus. ""The Mexican government expresses its most deeply felt condolences to the families,"" the Interior Ministry said in a release on its Web page. The federal government will intensify its investigation to find out what happened, the ministry said. On Friday, Mexican officials had said the two dead men were part of the criminal gang that shot at the soldiers. University officials also said Friday that all students were safe. That account changed Saturday, when Mercado's mother tried to call him after finding out about the campus shootout. When she couldn't reach him, she traveled to Monterrey, where she identified her son's body, said the campus rector, Rafael Rangel Sostman. ""I'm certain he is with God,"" said the mother, Rosa Elvia Mercado Alonso. The school's rector blamed himself for the mix-up in identities. ""I offer a public apology and take responsibility for having given information that ended up not being correct,"" Rangel said. ""I want to offer my most deeply felt condolences to the family of our two students and offer them our support in this difficult situation."" Both men were scholarship students, the college said. Monterrey is in Nuevo Leon, one of two states in northeastern Mexico where drug cartel members blocked roads with hijacked vehicles Thursday and Friday to prevent military reinforcements from arriving. The criminals also set up roadblocks in neighboring Tamaulipas state. Three presumed gang members and one soldier were killed in various skirmishes over the two-day period, officials said. The area, which borders Texas, has seen bloody fighting between the Zetas and Gulf cartels after a recent gangland slaying. Hours-long gun battles are common, and U.S. officials were recently forced to temporarily close the consulate in the city of Reynosa. Mexico has been gripped in massive drug-related bloodshed since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the cartels shortly after coming into office in December 2006. Much of the violence has taken place around Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. There are no official government tallies, but more than 16,000 people are estimated to have died in the drug wars. The vast majority of the deaths are among reputed criminals, with some police and military also being killed. Relatively few of the deaths have been civilians. Even so, the United States and Canada have issued travel warnings, particularly along the border area. The Texas Department of Public Safety took the unprecedented step this year of recommending that students on spring break not go to border areas inside Mexico. News of the violence and the travel warnings apparently have had an effect. Mexicans say tourism along the border has declined significantly this year.","Officials say soldiers were chasing drug criminals who had fired on an army patrol .

"GITARAMA, Rwanda (CNN) -- What does Macy's have to do with healing from genocide? Nothing and everything. Iphigenia Mukantabana sits with Jean-Bosco Bizimana, her family's killer, at her home after church. Fourteen years after Hutu extremists killed between 800,000 and 1 million people -- mostly Tutsis -- in a devastating slaughter, Rwandan women are weaving peace baskets for sale at Macy's in the United States. Not only does the work bring them a regular salary, the business is also fostering reconciliation between victim and perpetrator. Iphigenia Mukantabana, a master weaver, sits in front of her house in Gitarama -- an hour from the capital, Kigali -- making beautiful baskets with her friend Epiphania Mukanyndwi. In 1994, Mukantabana's husband and five of her children were hacked and clubbed to death by marauding Hutu militias. Among her family's killers was Jean-Bosco Bizimana, Mukanyndwi's husband. ""In my heart, the dead are dead, and they cannot come back again,"" Mukantabana said of those she lost. ""So I have to get on with the others and forget what has happened."" Forgetting and forgiving everything she lost, everything she witnessed. ""Women and girls were raped, and I saw it all,"" she told CNN. ""The men and boys were beaten and then slaughtered. They told others to dig a hole, get in, then they piled earth on top of them, while they were still alive.""  Watch Mukantabana say how she survived » . Yet today, Mukantabana shares her future and her family meals with Bizimana, the killer she knew, and his wife, her friend Mukanyndwi. Bizimana did spend seven years in jail. He then went before a tribal gathering, part of a return to traditional ways by the new government in 2002 with Rwanda's justice system unable to cope and process hundreds of thousands of imprisoned perpetrators. The government decided that the master planners and worst perpetrators would face formal justice. But lower-level killers were allowed to publicly confess and apologize to the families of their victims at gacaca courts, where elders would hear grievances and decide on the punishments. ""In the gacaca court, I told them how we killed our fellow men, and I asked for forgiveness in front of the court, and the whole district was there,"" Bizimana said. ""The people who died in this very area -- I knew all of them because they were our neighbors.""  Watch Bizimana describe how he killed Tutsis » . He places blame squarely on the extremist Hutu government at the time and on vile radio broadcasts that urged on the killers during the 100-day slaughter. ""They were giving instructions all the time that was from the government, and so we thought it as the right thing because we were getting this instruction from the government,"" Bizimana said. He showed where he and a Hutu mob had killed 25 people, including members of Mukantabana's family, a few yards from where he had just shared lunch with her. ""We used machetes, hoes and wooden clubs,"" he told CNN. Mukantabana admits that it was difficult to forgive. She said she did not speak to Bizimana or his wife for four years after the killings. What put her on the road to healing, she said, was the gacaca process. ""It has not just helped me, it has helped all Rwandans because someone comes and accepts what he did and he asks for forgiveness from the whole community, from all Rwandans,"" she said. Bizimana said he did just that. ""You go in front of the people like we are standing here and ask for forgiveness,"" he said. But despite his confession and apology, Mukantabana said, reconciliation would not have happened unless she had decided to open her heart and accept his pleas. ""I am a Christian, and I pray a lot,"" she said, the pain etched in the lines on her face and around her sad eyes. But the basket business also played a key role in forging forgiveness and reconciliation after the horror. ""We knew how to weave baskets,"" Mukantabana explained. ""It helped unite Rwandans in this area because they accepted me as the master weaver, and I could not say, 'I am not taking your basket' or 'I am not helping you because you did something bad to me.' ""  See photos of the women who have learned to forgive » . Macy's sold the first ""peace baskets"" in 2005, and officials say the deal generates between $300,000 and $400,000 a year. A Rwandan weaver can earn about $14 per week -- a king's ransom in a country where so many live on less than $1 per week. The international project is a far cry from 1994, when the United States, Europe, the United Nations and the rest of the world turned away while the genocide went unchecked in Rwanda. ""They didn't care; they were totally indifferent,"" Rwandan President Paul Kagame told CNN in his office in Kigali. He said the world thought Rwanda ""was just another bloody African situation where people just kill each other and that's it.""  Watch Kagame explain why he sought reconciliation » . Today, Rwanda is an African success story. It has one of the fastest economic growth rates in the region, one of the lowest crime rates and the lowest rate of HIV-AIDS. About one-third of Rwanda's cabinet are female ministers, and 48 percent of parliamentarians are women -- the highest anywhere in the world, according to the United Nations. The country looks squeaky clean thanks to many local and national programs, including a mandatory policy that sees even government ministers participate in clean-up once a month. Plastic bags are banned. The international business community praises Rwanda's good governance and the absence of official corruption or graft. Kagame is credited not just with turning Rwanda around, but with being the driving force behind rejecting revenge. ""We were in danger of having another genocide,"" he said. ""People were so badly aggrieved they could easily have turned on those they thought were responsible for this and actually killed them in another wave of killings. But that did not happen,"" he said. ""We said building a nation is the most important thing."" Now no one talks about Hutus or Tutsis, he explained. ""There is Rwanda, there are Rwandans, and the common interest we have for a better future for this country is more important than any other interest."" In Gitarama, Bizimana said, ""It hurts my heart to see that I did something wrong to friends of my family, to people who we even shared meals with,"" he said. ""I am still asking for forgiveness from the people I hurt."" Amazingly, many seem to have forgiven.","Basket weaver's husband, five children were hacked and clubbed to death .

"(CNN)  -- The widow of an Internal Revenue Service employee killed when a disgruntled taxpayer flew his plane into a seven-story building in Austin, Texas, last week is suing the pilot's wife, according to court documents. Valerie Hunter, the wife of Vernon Hunter, is accusing Sheryl Stack, wife of Andrew Joseph ""Joe"" Stack III, of negligence, alleging she knew or should have known that her husband was a threat to others and, thus, could have prevented the attack, according to the lawsuit filed Monday in Travis County District Court. ""Stack was threatened enough by Joseph Stack that she took her daughter and stayed at a hotel the night before the plane crash. [She] owed a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury to others including [Vernon Hunter],"" the suit says. The lawsuit also seeks to bar the release of Vernon Hunter's autopsy report, saying that, if made public, it would cause Hunter's family to suffer ""severe and irreparable emotional distress."" Hunter was killed February 18 when, authorities say, Stack flew his Piper Cherokee PA-28 into a northwest Austin building that housed nearly 200 IRS employees. Authorities say Stack set fire to his $230,000 home in Austin before embarking on his fatal flight. Police have said Sheryl Stack spent the previous night in an Austin-area hotel but did not say why. Police said they had received no calls of domestic violence from the house. The only calls to police were made a couple of years ago and concerned barking dogs, officials said said. A 3,000-word message on a Web site registered to Stack railed against the government, particularly the IRS. ""I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different,"" the online message said. ""I am finally ready to stop this insanity. Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, let's try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well.""

"(CNN) -- Kevin Pearce One of the country's top snowboarders, who was considered a favorite to make the U.S. Olympic team, was in critical but stable condition Sunday after an accident while training last week at Park City, Utah. The Los Angeles Times reports that the 22-year-old from Norwich, Vermont, was wearing a helmet while attempting a twisting double back flip on an icy halfpipe. Pearce hit his head, was knocked unconscious and was then airlifted to the University of Utah hospital for surgery. He sustained severe traumatic brain injury, one of his doctors said in a statement. Pearce, a beloved athlete, was one of the few snowboarders who experts thought could challenge top contender Shaun White, who has won almost every top snowboarding medal. Los Angeles Times: Snowboarder in critical condition . Adrian Smith One of the world's most widely recognized architects is one of the principal designers of the world's tallest tower, the Burj Dubai, which opens today in the emirate of Dubai. The 160-plus-story structure has already been hailed as a monumental architectural achievement but is seen by some as a symbol of the city's unbridled excess. The majestic silvery construction houses a luxury hotel, apartments and offices. Six years in the making, the Burj Dubai reaches 818 meters, or half a mile, into the sky above Dubai, with dizzying views of the ambitious building program that has transformed the emirate and left it swamped by debt. Smith worked for four decades at the structure's architecture firm, Chicago, Illinois-based Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, which called the Burj ""a bold global icon that will serve as a model for future urban centers."" Declaring that ""tall buildings are back,"" the company predicts that the groundbreaking techniques it used to push the Burj to new heights should enable the construction of even taller towers in the future.

According to Westergaard, the man tried to enter the house by breaking through a glass door Friday night. Westergaard took his 5-year-old granddaughter into a specially built ""panic room"" when he realized what was happening, Chief Superintendent Ole Madsen said. Police said a home alarm alerted them to the scene in the city of Aarhus, and they were attacked by the suspect when they responded. Police shot the suspect and he was taken into custody. Westergaard, who has been threatened for drawing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in 2005, is ordinarily accompanied by bodyguards, but there were no guards at the house when the break-in occurred. The New York Times quoted a Danish newspaper report that Denmark's security and intelligence agency knew that the accused Somali man was held in Kenya in September for allegedly helping to plot an attack against Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who visited Kenya in August. The man was released earlier this fall by Kenyan authorities due to lack of evidence, the newspaper Politiken reported. Denmark's ambassador to Kenya told the news agency Ritzau, however, that the Somali man was arrested in Kenya for incomplete travel documents, adding that Kenyan authorities never told the embassy that he was a suspect in a terror plot.

Parker's election last month also makes her the second woman to become mayor of Houston. Other cities such as Providence, Rhode Island, and Portland, Oregon, have picked openly gay mayors. Houston is the fourth-largest U.S. city. Parker's victory is also remarkable because a few years ago, Houston rejected a referendum to offer benefits to same-sex partners of city workers. Also, the city sits in a state where gay marriage is against the law. Parker, 53, has never shied away from, nor made an issue of, her sexual orientation. She has been with her partner for 19 years and they have two adopted children. CNN: Houston elects first openly gay mayor . What makes a person intriguing? There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news. Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story. But every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in. They arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do, and why they did what they did.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- David Carradine's wife and his manager disputed suggestions that the actor's death was a suicide, while rescue workers and police in Bangkok, Thailand, said the actor's neck and genitals were found bound with rope. David Carradine was the star of the 1970s TV series, ""Kung Fu,"" and appeared in more than 100 films. After Carradine's body arrives back to the United States this weekend, an autopsy ordered by Carradine's family will be conducted, according to the actor's co-manager. ""They're doing everything possible to get to the bottom of what really happened,"" said Carradine's co-manager Tiffany Smith. Carradine, 72, became famous in the 1970s when he portrayed the traveling Shaolin monk Kwai Chang Caine in the television series ""Kung Fu."" Bangkok police said Carradine was found hanging by a nylon rope in a Bangkok hotel room closet Thursday morning. ""Our preliminary assumption is that the cause of death was suffocation, because there was a rope tied to his neck,"" said Bangkok police spokesman Somprasong Yenthuam. Autopsy results will not be available for three or four weeks, said a high-ranking Thai police source who asked not to be identified. The actor's body was released to the U.S. Embassy for a Saturday flight home after a judge signed the death certificate Friday, the police source said. A member of the emergency crew who was called to the hotel after a maid found Carradine told CNN that a yellow nylon rope was tied around the actor's neck and a black rope was around his genitals. Police later confirmed that information. The same emergency crew source said Carradine's hands were not tied, contrary to some media reports. Smith, the co-manager, also said media reports quoting the actor's management saying the hands were tied were untrue. ""I do not know if you want to call it accidental,"" Chuck Binder, Carradine's manager, told CNN's Larry King on Thursday. He said Carradine's career was on a roll. Binder said a producer of the movie, ""Stretch,"" which Carradine was to act in, called him from Thailand to tell him what was happening there. ""I do not want to get in the middle of this whole investigation, but this guy said to me for sure there was foul play,"" Binder said.  Watch Carradine's friends discuss loss » . Actor Michael Madsen told King that the one thing Carradine's wife, Annie Bierman, wanted everyone to know is, ""David was not suicidal."" Investigators found no sign of a forced entry into Carradine's room, Bangkok Police Lt. Colonel Pirom Chanpirom said. Smith would not confirm Friday that Carradine's family had hired private investigators to look into his death, but she did say a private autopsy would be done. Modern audiences may best know Carradine as ""Bill"" in Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" films. He earned a 2005 Golden Globe nomination for his role in the second movie in the two-part saga. Tarantino, also appearing on ""Larry King Live,"" called Carradine one of ""Hollywood's great mad geniuses."" ""He was a rock star at the time 'Kung Fu' came out,"" Tarantino said, holding up a vintage metal lunch box with an image from the popular show.  Watch Carradine discuss ""Kung Fu"" role » . ""I'm in shock,"" he said. Carradine's career included more than 100 feature films, two dozen television movies and theater work, according to the Internet Movie Database. ""He was clearly an actor who followed his own path,"" said Leah Rozen, movie critic for People magazine.  See photos of some of his notable roles » . ""He was never a guy who talked a whole lot. You knew, as an actor, the characters he played, you knew they had a past, you knew there was probably some unhappiness there, but he wasn't going to talk about it."" Carradine was nominated for a Golden Globe for his role as folk music legend Woody Guthrie in the 1976 movie ""Bound for Glory,"" according to a biography on his official Web site. He also made appearances in television series such as ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents."" His first starring role in a series was as the title character in ""Shane"" in 1966. iReport: Share memories of David Carradine .

His earliest work was as a sculptor and painter,"" Carradine's official Web site says. The site also includes an ""Art Bio,"" in which the actor opened up about his life. ""I've always had an especially hard time with everything I've tried to do,"" Carradine wrote. ""I've made it pretty big as an actor in spite of being terminally shy. ...

"London, England (CNN) -- Like many people, widow Penny Lally plans to be buried alongside her family. But in her case, that includes a menagerie of family pets. Her husband, John, who died of cancer three years ago at the age of 64, is already buried with their horse Super Sam, Blot the cat, Muppet the dog, and even Brian the bird. ""I often tell people that John has a canary singing in his ear, a cat purring at his feet, a dog at his side and a horse to ride on when he likes,"" Lally said. ""I know some people might find this strange, but I loved my pets and wanted them all to be close to me and my husband and to each other."" Lally, 66, runs a pet crematorium and woodland burial place in Penwith, Cornwall, in southwestern England. She has buried more than 30 owners alongside their animals and has over 100 more plots reserved for pets and their owners, she said. The idea of joint burials was first suggested to her by an elderly neighbor who died at the age of 77, a year before John's death, she said. ""Mrs. Winchcombe had seven cats and wanted to be buried with all of them when she died. It was certainly an unusual request,"" Lally said. ""We had to apply for permission to extend our license to burying humans as well as animals, but it was wonderful that we could carry out her last wishes."" Since then, Lally has seen an increasing number of pet owners in the UK seeking joint burials. There are currently only half a dozen cemeteries in the UK that allow pets to be buried in the same plot as their owners, but in January, Lincolnshire council became the latest authority to grant planning permission for a joint site. ""I think there has been more interest recently because people are starting to realize it is possible,"" Lally said. One of her customers is animal lover Carole Mundy, 54, who has reserved a plot for herself and her husband Robert next to their 17-year-old golden retriever, Dylan, who was buried at Penwith in 2008. ""I know it isn't conventional, but I'm so sick of people saying that 'it was just a dog or a cat,'"" Mundy said. ""Animals give us unconditional love and I absolutely adore my pets. If people want to call me kooky I don't care."" The UK regards itself as a nation of animal lovers, so perhaps it is not surprising that there has been an increase in joint burials, but the practice is also on the rise in the United States. ""There has been a lot of interest from the public, who are asking funeral homes if they can have their pets buried with them,"" said Robert Fells of the International Cemetery, Cremation and Funeral Association in Virginia. ""It's still a relatively new concept, so whether it's a fad or an emerging trend, I'm not sure, but it's definitely on the rise,"" he said. ""We are seeing an increase in public interest,"" said Roberta Knauf, director of Hillcrest-Flynn Funeral Home in Pennsylvania. ""The joint burial concept started in 2006, when a few people were interested -- but last year we had close to 70 joint burials in our cemetery."" In fact, the practice of people being buried with pets isn't new. It dates far back into British history when Anglo-Saxon nobles were buried with their possessions, which included their horses. Even further back, the pharaohs of ancient Egypt would be buried with their mummified cats, dogs and monkeys, which they believed shared an afterlife with humans. But after centuries of affiliation with the pagan gods of Egypt and Rome, pet rituals found little tolerance in the new Christian era. ""The more Christianity became institutionalized, the more animal practices were discouraged as it was accepted that humans were the only beings with souls,"" said Mary Thurston, a Texas-based anthropologist who specializes in the shared history of people and pets. The director of the UK's Association of Private Pet Cemeteries and Crematoria said people should be buried as they see fit. ""When you pass away, it's important to have your wishes granted and people deserve to be buried in the manner they choose if they are not hurting anyone,"" Kevin Spurgeon said. ""My horse was such a good friend and by my side through the ups and downs of life,"" pet cemetery owner Lally said. ""Like me, many others see their pets as part of the family and want to be together with them even in death.""","People and their pets can be laid to rest together at cemetery in England .

"(CNN) -- A 6.9-magnitude earthquake shook the Pacific Ocean near the Solomon Islands Tuesday night, one day after a string of earthquakes rattled the same area and another quake hit the Philippines, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The quake, considered strong in terms of earthquake magnitude, hit near sparsely populated islands in the archipelago at 11:15 p.m. (7:15 a.m. ET) at a depth of 35 km (22 miles). By 12:56 a.m. local time Wednesday, there had been five aftershocks, according to the USGS Web site. ""Usually when we see earthquakes of this size, we see aftershocks,"" said USGS geophysicist Jessica Sigala. ""The aftershocks are usually smaller in size, but are earthquakes in their own right."" No tsunamis were expected, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. The island located closest to the initial quake's epicenter was Tetepare, located eight miles to the north. Geophysicist Amy Vaughan said the USGS had received no reports of damage, and it was hard for the agency to predict what might have occurred until it hears from media or people living in the area. There was property damage from Monday's quakes, but she didn't know how extensive it was. On Monday, the Solomon Islands were hit by eight quakes in 14 hours, starting at 8:48 a.m. local time and causing damage to at least one village. Rattling the islands were a strong 6.5-magnitude quake at 8:48 a.m. and a more powerful 7.2-magnitude tremor less than an hour later. The Solomon Islands are situated in the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.","The Solomon Islands are struck by a 6.9-magnitude earthquake .

"Washington (CNN)  -- Four of the 10 American rescue teams mobilized in the hours following the earthquake in Haiti are returning home Tuesday -- having never traveled farther than their local airports. Federal government officials said the four -- including teams in Texas, Ohio and two in California -- were not flown there because Haiti could not ""absorb"" them and because they were being held as relief for crews that made it into the country. Disaster experts said a bottleneck at the main airport in Port-au-Prince could have prevented the crews from entering Haiti quickly, but they scoffed at the suggestion that the teams, skilled in locating and freeing people entombed in collapsed buildings, should be held in reserve. ""That 72-hour window [in which most rescues are attempted] is not some casual number,"" said Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. ""It's actually a very serious [calculation of when most lives can be saved]."" iReport: Search the list of the missing and found . Redlener said it made no sense to withhold Urban Search and Rescue team resources until the latter days of a disaster. A second expert said the United States has an additional 18 US&R teams it could have drawn upon if reserves were needed. In the event of earthquakes, moving US&R teams should be the ""highest possible priority,"" and the only limitation should be insurmountable logistical ones, Redlener said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency trains and funds the nation's 28 US&R teams, but in Haiti they have been working under contract with the U.S. Agency for International Development, the State Department organization heading the relief effort.

The US&R teams specialize in rescuing people in collapsed structures. The teams typically have about 80 members and travel with food, bedding and generators so they will be self-sustaining and will not be a drain on the communities they are trying to help.

Asked Monday on CNN ""American Morning"" why the four U.S. teams and some teams in Canada had not been brought to Haiti, Kenneth Merten, the U.S. ambassador to the country, said, ""I'll be honest with you.

Merten said he would look into the issue, adding the teams may have been held back because of capacity issues. He also said there are ""limitations on where these people can go, where they can set up, where they can bed down."" A USAID spokesman suggested Monday that the 43 teams that traveled from around the world to help Haiti were sufficient. They include 1,739 first responders and 161 canines.

"(CNN)  -- A single mother who chose taking care of her infant over deploying to Afghanistan has been discharged, the Army said in a statement. When her unit deployed to Afghanistan in November, Alexis Hutchinson was missing from the plane. Her lawyer said she refused to go because there was no one to take care of her then 10-month-old son, Kamani, and she feared he would be placed in foster care. But the Army contended that the young mother and now former Army specialist had plenty of time to sort out family issues and said she could face court-martial. The issue was resolved this week, the Army said in a statement Thursday from Fort Stewart in Georgia, where Hutchinson was training. ""The soldier will not be tried by court-martial and therefore is not at risk of receiving a federal conviction,"" the statement said. "" She is, however, reduced to the lowest enlisted rank, private, and subject to losing other military benefits from the Army and the Department of Veterans Affairs to which soldiers who serve honorably are entitled."" Before shipping overseas, every soldier must sign military Form D-A 53-05, which states that failure to maintain a family care plan could result in disciplinary action. Hutchinson's attorney, Rai Sue Sussman, said the soldier informed the Army that her family care plan had fallen through and that there was no one to take care of her son. She was granted a 30-day extension to deal with the issue but still was not ready to deploy after the extension had expired, the Army said. ""The investigation revealed evidence, from both other soldiers and from Private Hutchinson herself, that she didn't intend to deploy to Afghanistan with her unit and deliberately sought ways out of the deployment,"" the Army statement said.

Haiti's Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive was also in Montreal. He said the international aid effort has only just begun. ""I can simply tell you that the population is in need of more and more and more to confront the massive task of reconstruction,"" Bellerive said. The aim of the Montreal meeting is to develop a strategy for early recovery and longer-term reconstruction. Once the strategy is set, a donors' conference to secure funding for Haiti would take place. Amorim told Amanpour he expected the donors' conference is likely to take place at the end of March, possibly in New York, though that was not confirmed at the time of the interview. ""We cannot endure, we cannot see a disaster of the size of Haiti, with the poverty that exists in Haiti, and not do anything,"" he added. ""If you don't act for development, for emergency now and development immediately, you'll be having an enormous security problem."" Interactive map: Where to find aid .

The U.N. force there, known as MINUSTAH, has been led by a Brazilian general since 2004. It lost dozens of its civilian headquarters staff during the earthquake.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Survivors still emerged from collapsed buildings in Haiti's devastated capital Sunday, nearly five days after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck the impoverished island nation. U.S. and Turkish rescuers plucked three people, including an American woman, from the rubble of a supermarket Sunday, and were continuing to search for more people in the ruins. The survivors had been living on the store's supply of food and water, rescuers said. Elsewhere, a team from New York rescued a 55-year-old man from the remains of a four-story building after using a rescue camera to locate him. And an Israel Defense Forces team said Sunday it had rescued a Haitian government worker from the ruins of a customs office Saturday. The rescues lent a sense of urgency to those still working to find signs of life among the collapsed buildings, who know that time is running out for those still alive. Nearly 30 international rescue teams continue to comb the disaster areas for more survivors. While there has not been an official count, U.N. estimates of the number of casualties in the capital alone range from 100,000 to 150,000. Get the latest developments in Haiti . By Friday, 13,000 bodies had been recovered, said U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Edmond Mulet. Among the dead are 16 Americans, the State Department said Sunday. More than 300 U.N. staffers are unaccounted for. Thirty-seven are confirmed dead, including the top two civilian officials at the U.N. mission in Haiti, a peacekeeping and police force established after the 2004 ouster of then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Why Haiti is different . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was in Haiti Sunday and visited the site of the U.N.'s collapsed mission. He assured survivors of U.N. assistance despite the organization suffering the gravest loss in its history. The United Nations ""will continue to work with the major international donors who have been generous enough to provide humanitarian assistance, dispatching search-and-rescue teams. This is a moment of sadness but it is also a moment of Haiti's need,"" he said. Former President Bill Clinton, the U.N. special envoy to Haiti, will travel to the country on Monday to meet with officials and deliver aid supplies, his foundation announced Sunday. He is set to meet with Haitian President Rene Preval and other members of the local government as well as aid workers, to discuss how to proceed with recovery operations. The visit comes two days after President Obama announced the formation of the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, a major fundraising effort for victims of Tuesday's earthquake led by Clinton and former President George W. Bush.  Presidents Bush, Clinton team up for Haiti   On Saturday, a man said to be the head of the capital city's tax office was carried out of the rubble on a stretcher, to wild cheers from residents. And a 2-month-old baby with broken ribs was pulled out and airlifted to Florida in critical condition. But in many cases, rescue operations turned into recovery ones. A Los Angeles rescue team answered the desperate pleas of a mother who believed her young daughter was trapped alive beneath the rubble of a day care center in downtown Port-au-Prince. They searched for eight hours Saturday. At some point, the distinct sounds of tapping from within the crushed concrete stopped. As rescue personnel pulled away, the mother -- who stood praying silently during the rescue efforts -- stayed put, holding on to hope. How to help: Impact Your World . More California rescuers patiently chipped away at concrete and debris Sunday morning, trying to reach a woman who sent a text message saying she was buried beneath the ruins of a collapsed bank. The Los Angeles County Search and Rescue team had been looking for the woman since Saturday afternoon when a text arrived: ""I'm OK but help me, I can't take it anymore."" But the hours ticked by, with no sign she was still alive. Despite the best attempts by aid groups, the country remains in dire need of food, water and medical aid. In open fields, abandoned stadiums and empty warehouses in the capital, relief workers set up makeshift hospitals. Residents flocked to them en masse. Dr. Jennifer Furin with Harvard Medical School was tending to about 300 patients at one such hospital on a U.N. compound near Port-au-Prince's airport. Without immediate surgery, a third of them will die, she predicted. The Port-au-Prince airport remained overwhelmed by the influx of air traffic bringing in supplies, although an overhead photo Sunday showed activity and numerous planes on the ground.","NEW: Rescue teams from U.S., Israel, Turkey find people alive in quake rubble .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Touting himself as America's ""first Pacific president,"" Barack Obama called on his own connections with Asia Saturday as he pledged a renewed engagement with Asia Pacific nations based on ""an enduring and revitalized alliance between the United States and Japan."" The U.S. president, in his first Asia trip since taking office in January, told a packed house at Tokyo's Suntory Hall that all Americans should know that what happens in Asia ""has a direct effect on our lives at home."" ""This is where we engage in much of our commerce and buy many of our goods,"" he said. ""And this is where we can export more of our own products and create jobs back home in the process. ""This is a place where the risk of a nuclear arms race threatens the security of the wider world, and where extremists who defile a great religion plan attacks on both our continents. And there can be no solution to our energy security and our climate challenge without the rising powers and developing nations of the Asia Pacific."" Obama met with new Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama Friday after his arrival in Tokyo as well as with the Japanese emperor and empress. Obama touched on nearly every part of the Asia Pacific region during his speech, and talked about a boyhood visit to Japan with his mother, his birth in Hawaii, a childhood spent partly in Indonesia and the United States' position as a Pacific nation. ""There must be no doubt: as America's first Pacific president, I promise you that this Pacific nation will strengthen and sustain our leadership in this vitally important part of the world,"" he said. He stressed that the United States was not interested in containing the emerging economic growth in China. ""The rise of a strong, prosperous China can be a source of strength for the community of nations,"" he said. ""And so, in Beijing and beyond, we will work to deepen our strategic and economic dialogue."" Obama also called on Myanmar to make more definitive moves toward democracy, including releasing all political prisoners; urged North Korea to return to the Six-Party Talks so that the reclusive nation could be reintegrated into the world stage and pledged America's support for eliminating nuclear weapons and efforts to reduce the global effects of climate change. His trip is to include stops in Singapore, China and South Korea, during which Obama will hold formal talks with Asian leaders as a group and individually. The president plans to meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, Russia President Dmitry Medvedev and Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, and will take part in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. APEC's 21 member nations represent more than half of the world's economic output. The forum sees its goal as ""facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region."" During a busy day in Singapore, Obama also will become the first U.S. president to take part in a summit of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economic alliance. In China, Obama will continue efforts to define and strengthen the United States' relationship with the world's largest emerging economy, which has a growing influence in Asia, said Jeffrey Bader, the National Security Council's senior director for East Asian affairs. ""We see it as a relationship where we're obviously going to have differences, where we are going to be competitors in certain respects,"" he said. ""But we want to maximize areas where we can work together, because the global challenges will simply not be met if we don't."" Bader cited North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the economy, climate change, human rights and Afghanistan as among the top issues for the China swing. On human rights, Bader said Obama is likely to address ""freedom of expression, access to information, freedom of religion, rule of law and, certainly, Tibet."" Obama will make clear to Hu that he intends to meet with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, Bader said. China, which rejects Tibetan aspirations for autonomy, opposes such high-level contacts with the Dalai Lama. On North Korea, the State Department announced Tuesday that U.S. officials will travel to the country by year's end to seek a resumption of broader talks on ending the Pyongyang government's nuclear program. The Obama administration has claimed initial progress in its strategy of forging an international effort, including China and South Korea, to pressure North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions. Japan has been asking for a comprehensive solution to North Korea's missile tests and the abduction of Japanese citizens in the 1970s. Saturday morning, Obama made clear that both were necessary. ""The path for North Korea to realize this future is clear: a return to the Six-Party Talks; upholding previous commitments, including a return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; and the full and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,"" he said. ""And full normalization with its neighbors can only come if Japanese families receive a full accounting of those who have been abducted. These are all steps that can be taken by the North Korean government, if they are interested in improving the lives of their people and joining the community of nations."" It won't be all diplomatic meetings, though. Obama's first trip to China will include a town hall-style meeting in Shanghai and sightseeing in Beijing, including a stop at the Great Wall.","In speech, Obama renews U.S. ties with Japan, reaches out to China .

"(AOL AUTOS) -- I remember driving in eastern Pennsylvania one winter following my brother home on an hour-long trip. It had snowed earlier that morning, and by the time we got on the road the plows still hadn't reached the back roads we were on. I was driving a front-wheel drive Acura Integra with all-season tires while he had a 4WD Grand Cherokee with the proper tires for the road conditions. The idea was that he'd plow me a path to drive through as best as he could. We were just asking for something to go wrong. Not even a half hour into the drive home, I came around a corner too fast, briefly lost control and steered myself right into the front yard of a farmhouse. Luckily I didn't hurt myself or anyone else, but that day I learned what it meant not to have proper traction for the road conditions. Recently, I talked with Woody Rogers from The Tire Rack to learn about the differences between all-season tires and winter tires along with the basics to consider when purchasing a set of tires designed for the harsh winter conditions. All-Season vs. Winter Tires . Rogers explained that all-season tires are a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. ""All-season tires aren't really tuned for any one area, and suffer from not being optimum for any one area because it is compromised to be capable in all areas,"" he said. He explained that winter tires (they're just not for the snow) focus their attention on the exact conditions you'll most likely be facing during the winter season. ""They key of a true winter tire's capability is that you have a specialist, he said. ""A product that is designed to work the best in the cooler winter season temperatures, say below 45 degrees, a tread pattern and tread compound that are designed to take bites out of the snow and work well on packed snow and ice; something that an all-season tired just isn't optimized to do."" He explained that today's winter tires have come a long way: ""They go beyond the deep aggressive lug 'snow' tire that many of our parents put on the back of family station wagon."" Rogers said today's winter tires are available for certain conditions or are ideal for a particular region of the county. It's best to determine what conditions you'll be driving in and then determine the type of winter tire you will need. Rogers said it's a good idea to talk with a local retailer or do some personal investigating to choose which tire has the right characteristics for your location. ""The typical image [of a snow tire] is that very aggressive, knobby zig-zag tread pattern that isn't far removed from the farm implement tire or a piece of off road construction equipment tire,"" he said. ""No longer is that loud knobby, gnarly off-road style tread pattern required to provide good traction on snow, slush and ice."" What to Look For When Buying . When looking for true winter tire, Rogers recommends using the Canadian and American Rubber Manufacturer's standard symbol of the snowflake-on-the-mountain. Only tires that are tested in packed snow and exceed other reference tires by 10% are given the industry standard symbol. The presence of that symbol is typically a good indication of a true winter tire. Some tires barely meet the requirement and still have the symbol. Rogers said it's best to look for dedicated winter tires in addition to looking for the snowflake symbol. ""The industry really intended that symbol to be a merit badge for true winter tires, not for a multi purpose or multi use tires like on-/off-road all terrain or highway all-season,"" he said. ""I don't think we're going to see many more or many new non-winter tires coming out with the snowflake-on-the- mountain symbol."" He said presently there's no comparison between a winter tire with the snowflake symbol and an-all season tire without one. ""The symbol doesn't distinguish between the two, not yet,"" he said. ""The industry is talking about some type of grading scale. We're encouraging them to have multiple snowflakes or a 1-2-3 scale. Something that gives the consumer a real idea of how good a winter performer the tire really is."" Traction Control, All-Wheel Drive and SUVs . It seems as if there are more all-wheel drive cars and SUVs than ever, and even if you don't have those features, an increasing number of cars have some sort of traction control. So why the need for winter tires when our cars can do so much work for us? ""The winter tire really helps you get the most out of those safety features that are built into your car,"" Rogers said. ""These electronic systems are only as capable as the traction that's provided to them by the tires, because the tires are the only thing connected to the ground."" He said the all-wheel drive capability gives SUV owners driving on all-season tires a false sense of security. While they'll be able to accelerate better than 2WD vehicles in wintry conditions, they don't have an advantage when it comes to stopping or turning in those conditions. ""Ultimately, how quickly you can stop or how sharply you can turn on the snow or on the ice is determined by the grip that your tires provide,"" Rogers noted. Rogers uses snow tires on both his 2WD Toyota pickup and his Mini Cooper S and says that he can accelerate better with his two-wheel drive vehicles with snow tires than 4WD SUVs with all season tires. ""And I know I can stop better than they can, and turn better than they can,"" he added. Two Tires or Four? Rogers recommends putting four winter tires on your vehicle, even if your vehicle is two-wheel drive. ""Today's tires offer significant traction on snow and on ice, more than even good all season tires do,"" he said. ""And, because of that, our testing has shown and the industry testing has shown that the mix of two winter tires and two all season tires is a very dangerous combination. It may seem like you are spending an extra few hundred dollars to buy two more tires, but I can assure you it's less than the deductible on your insurance once you have a wreck."" He has a separate set of tires for most of his family cars so that he can change them over easily in his own garage before a snowstorm comes. If you're considering purchasing a set of winter tires and rims, Rogers said that Tire Rack and other retailers generally will do the tire and wheel mount and balance for no additional cost when you purchase certain packages. ""Once you drive in the snow on a modern winter tire, you'll never want to do anything else. I find that's it's much more like driving in the rain than driving in the snow,"" Rogers said. ""I'm no longer clenching the wheel, holding on and hoping, I just drive around. The difference is stunning, when you're driving in 3-6 inches of snow and they haven't plowed the roads, you just go. And that's even in a two wheel drive vehicle,"" he said. ""When you drive an all wheel drive or SUV with winter tires, it's virtually unstoppable."" E-mail to a friend .","Snow tires really are better than all-season tires in snowy areas .

"London, England (CNN) -- The future of English Premier League club Portsmouth was in doubt Friday after it was forced to go into administration with debts of around $90 million. The south coast side are the first Premier League side to call in administrators since the division was formed 18 years ago, fueling a financial boom in English football on the back of lucrative TV rights. ""At 10:20am today Portsmouth Football Club was placed into administration following the filing of a notice of appointment at the High Court by the chargeholder, Portpin Limited,"" the club said in a statement on its Web site. Explainer: What next for Portsmouth? Being placed in administration means an insolvent company is run by a court-appointed administrator with a view to saving it from liquidation. The administrator will assess the assets held by the company and attempt to reach agreement with creditors. Portsmouth, managed by former Chelsea boss Avram Grant, are already bottom of the table and facing relegation after raising around $100 million in player sales before the current season in a bid to reduce their debts. They will now be docked a further nine points, virtually sealing their relegation to English football's second tier at the end of the season. The club has passed through a succession of owners this season but efforts to find a fifth broke down Tuesday when present owner Balram Chainrai confirmed the club would opt for administration to avert a winding up order from the UK government. At a press conference on Friday the club's administrator, Andrew Andronikou, confirmed that Portsmouth's debts were around $100 million, but he said he was confident they would not go bust. He also said the Premier League had indicated that Portsmouth may be permitted to sell players outside the transfer window. ""There will be no firesale. We will have to sell one or two players and that is why we are talking to the Premier League,"" he said. ""The restructuring starts today and there will be significant cost cutting at all levels. I will be cutting to the bone."" Andronikou also confirmed that Grant had vowed to stay at the club until the end of the season. Portsmouth's Chief Executive Peter Storrie said it was an ""extremely sad day"" but admitted going into administration had ""kept the club alive and given someone an exceptional opportunity to take this great club on with fresh investment."" He also confirmed his intention to step down when a new buyer for the club had been found. Portsmouth's financial collapse completes a remarkable fall from grace for a side which won the FA Cup in 2008, the club's first major honor since winning back-to-back English league titles in 1949 and 1950. Portsmouth are not the first football club to run into financial problems as a consequence of debts wracked up in pursuit of success on the field. Leeds United went into administration in 2007, three years after their relegation from the Premier League and six years after the club had reached the semifinals of the Champions League. Leicester City and Portsmouth's south coast rivals Southampton also went into administration after losing their places in the top division.","English Premier League club Portsmouth went into administration Friday .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has been told to go on television to try to finally end the controversy that has forced the world's No. 1 golfer to take an ""indefinite break"" from the sport. The American superstar announced on his Web site on Friday that he was taking time out to resolve the issues caused by his ""infidelity"" to wife Elin, having been mired in controversy since he crashed his car outside his Florida mansion late last month. Since then, several women have come forward to claim having had liaisons with Woods. Woods' compatriot and fellow golfer John Daly, who has battled gambling and alcohol addiction and also been married four times, believes the 33-year-old should tell all on a television program such as the Oprah Winfrey Show, the UK Press Association reported. ""It's tough and it's going to be tough on him, but if I was him and Elin, I would go to Oprah, get on a show, get this thing aired out, tell the truth,"" former major winner Daly said. Blog: Woods cannot erase this stain. ""And then it doesn't matter what the media says anymore because it's all out in the open and it would be a big sigh of relief for both of them."" British publicist Max Clifford, whose clients have included the likes of magician David Copperfield and television mogul Simon Cowell, agreed that Oprah would provide the best platform. ""Hopefully he can go on something like Oprah, maybe even with his wife, to show that they're making a real go of it,"" Clifford said. ""The clever move would be for him to say, 'I'm coming back when Elin tells me the time is right.' That would be the masterstroke. ""The golf world will miss him more than he will miss them because you're taking the world's top player out, the biggest attraction, the one that everyone wants to see way, way above everybody else. ""That will encourage all of his fans to say, 'Come on Tiger, when are you coming back?' The demand for him to come back will get greater and greater."" Former European No. 1 Colin Montgomerie, who was second behind Woods at the 2005 British Open, believes that the 14-time major winner now seems a little less perfect. ""He is suddenly, I hate to say, more normal now,"" the Ryder Cup captain told the BBC Web site. ""There is a mystique which has been lost now and let's hope that golf isn't damaged by that, and it shouldn't be. ""There was an aura, and that wall has been split slightly, so there are cracks and I feel that it gives us more opportunity of winning these big events now.""","John Daly advises Tiger Woods to go on television with his wife Elin to end controversy .

"Editor's note: Peggy Wallace Kennedy is the daughter of George C. Wallace and Lurleen Wallace, who both were governors of Alabama. She lives in Montgomery, Alabama, with her husband, Mark Kennedy, a retired state Supreme Court justice. They have two sons, Leigh, a decorated veteran of the Iraq war, and Burns, a college sophomore. Peggy Wallace Kennedy says her father sought absolution for his segregationist views. MONTGOMERY, Alabama (CNN) -- I heard a car door slam behind me and turned to see an elderly but spry woman heading my way. The night before, a gang of vandals had swept through the cemetery desecrating graves, crushing headstones and stealing funereal objects. My parents' graves, situated on a wind-swept hill overlooking the cemetery, had not been spared. A large marble urn that stood between two granite columns had been pried loose and spirited away, leaving faded silk flowers strewn on the ground. I was holding a bouquet of them in my arms when the woman walked up and gave me a crushing hug. ""Honey,"" she said, ""you don't know me, but when I saw you standing up here on this hill, I knew that you must be one of the girls and I couldn't help myself but to drive up here and let you know how much me and my whole family loved both of your parents. They were real special people."" I thanked her for her kind words as we stood side by side gazing down at the graves of Govs. George Wallace and Lurleen Wallace. After a few moments, the woman leaned into me and spoke almost in a conspiratorial whisper. ""I never thought I would live to see the day when a black would be running for president. I know your daddy must be rolling over in his grave."" Not having the heart or the energy to respond, I gave her bony arm a slight squeeze, turned and walked away. As I put the remnants of the graveyard spray in the trunk of my car, I assumed that she had not bothered to notice the Barack Obama sticker on my bumper. When I was a young voter and had little interest in politics, my father would mark my ballot for me. As I thought about the woman in the cemetery, I mused that if he were alive and I had made the same request for this election, there would be a substantial chance, though not a certainty, that he would put an ""X"" by Obama's name. Perhaps it would be the last chapter in his search for inner peace that became so important to him after becoming a victim of hatred and violence himself when he was shot and gravely injured in a Laurel, Maryland, shopping center parking lot. Perhaps it would be a way of reconciling in his own mind that what he once stood for did not prevent freedom of opportunity and self-advancement from coming full circle; his final absolution. George Wallace and other Southern governors of his ilk stood defiantly in the 1950s and '60s in support of racial segregation, a culture of repression, violence and denial of basic human rights. Their actions and the stark images of their consequences that spread across the world galvanized the nation and gave rise to a cry for an end to the American apartheid. The firestorms that were lit in Birmingham, Oxford, Memphis, Tuscaloosa, Montgomery, Little Rock and Selma were a call to arms to which the people responded. And now a new call to arms has sounded as Americans face another assault on freedom. For if the stand in the schoolhouse door was a defining moment for George Wallace, then surely the aftermath of Katrina and the invasion of Iraq will be the same for George W. Bush. The trampling of individual freedoms and his blatant contempt for the rights of the average American may not have been as obvious as an ax-handle-wielding governor, but Bush's insidiousness and piety have made him much more dangerous. Healing must come, hope will be our lodestar, humility will reshape the American conscience, and honesty in both word and deed will refresh and invigorate America, and having Barack Obama to lead will give us back our power to heal. My father lived long enough to come to an understanding of the injustices borne by his deeds and the legacy of suffering that they left behind. History will teach future generations that he was a man who used his political power to promote a philosophy of exclusion. As his daughter, who witnessed his suffering in the twilight of his years and who witnessed his deeds and heard his words, I am one who believes that the man who, on March 7, 1965, listened to the reports of brutality as they streamed into the Governor's Mansion from Selma, Alabama, was not the same man who, in March of 1995, was welcomed with open arms as he was rolled through a sea of African-American men, women and children who gathered with him to welcome another generation of marchers, retracing in honor and remembrance the historic steps from Selma to Montgomery. Four years ago, the young Illinois senator who spoke at the Democratic National Convention mesmerized me. I hoped even then that he would one day be my president. Today, Barack Obama is hope for a better tomorrow for all Americans. He stands on the shoulders of all those people who have incessantly prayed for a day when ""justice will run down like waters and righteousness as a mighty stream"" (Amos 5:24). Perhaps one day, my two sons and I will have the opportunity to meet Barack Obama in person to express our gratitude to him for bringing our family full circle. And today, the day after the election, I am going to ride to the cemetery so that if asked, I can vouch for the fact that the world is still spinning but my father lies at peace. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Wallace Kennedy.","Peggy Wallace Kennedy: My dad, George Wallace, might have backed Barack Obama .

"KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida (CNN) -- The space shuttle Atlantis blasted off successfully Monday afternoon on NASA's fifth and final repair visit to the Hubble Space Telescope. Space shuttle Atlantis launched successfully from Florida Monday on its way to the Hubble telescope. The spacecraft rocketed into mostly sunny skies right on schedule at 2:01 p.m. ET. Atlantis will spend five days upgrading the Hubble, the orbiting observatory that's been scanning the universe for almost two decades. For the seven members of the shuttle crew, that means added pressure. ""I think [this] is motivating us because we know there's nobody coming after us to do anything we don't get done,"" said Atlantis Commander Scott Altman. ""This is it. We either get it done or it doesn't happen.""  Watch Atlantis lift off » . It's been seven years since NASA's last Hubble servicing mission in 2002, and the space telescope was designed to go only about three years between fixes. iReport.com: Share photos, video of the launch . NASA canceled an Atlantis mission to extend Hubble's operational life in January 2004 because the trip was considered too risky in the wake of the 2003 Columbia tragedy that killed seven astronauts. But public pressure and the development of safer shuttle technology led the U.S. space agency to reconsider. See shuttle astronauts discuss Hubble repair mission » . Still, some risks remain. NASA has estimated there's a 1-in-221 chance the shuttle could be struck by orbiting space debris from past missions. Thousands of objects hurtle through the heavens, some as large as several feet in diameter, and the Hubble's orbit is more crowded with space junk than that of the international space station, which orbits at a lower altitude, NASA said. While the Atlantis's shields would likely deflect a small piece of debris, a larger object could cripple the spacecraft, NASA said. Space shuttle Endeavour is on standby in the unlikely event that NASA will need to rescue the Atlantis crew members during their 11-day mission. During five grueling space walks some 350 miles up in space, a pair of two-man teams from the Atlantis will work on the Hubble inside Atlantis' cargo bay. ""This is going to be [like] running a marathon at a sprint pace,"" said Mission Specialist John Grunsfeld. Grunsfeld and fellow Mission Specialists Drew Feustel, Mike Good and Mike Massimino will change out gyroscopes, batteries and cameras on the Hubble. Grunsfeld and Feustel will handle the first 6 1/2-hour space walk, or extravehicular activity, performing what Grunsfeld calls ""surgery"" on the Hubble. iReport.com: Share photos, video and tell us what this event means to you . The two men will change out Hubble's wide-field camera and a module that allows the telescope's science instruments to be commanded from the ground. The module failed just before Atlantis was supposed to launch last October. NASA delayed the mission until now so that scientists could work out the fix. During another space walk, Grunsfeld and Feustel will repair another camera and install a new spectrograph. The work involves removing dozens of tiny bolts and replacing old circuit cards with new ones. ""It all has to line up just right so that I can go in the telescope and do all this work,"" Grunsfeld said. ""We only have that one day to finish it."" The wonderful thing about the Hubble, said former astronaut Jeff Hoffman, is that when crews service the telescope it's not just a repair -- they leave it better.  Learn more about the Hubble repairs » . ""Every time we come from a Hubble mission, Hubble is essentially a new telescope -- much more powerful,"" said Hoffman, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who flew on the first Hubble repair mission in 1993. ""And when this crew finishes with it, it's going to be. . .like a thousand times more sensitive [for making new discoveries] than it was when it was first put in orbit, and that's incredible,"" he said. Astronomers and cosmologists credit the Hubble with changing humans' understanding of the universe. The telescope, orbiting beyond the obscuring layer of the Earth's atmosphere, has helped determine the age of the universe while sending back astounding images of galaxies in all shapes and sizes. ""The discovery that essentially as far as we can tell all galaxies have black holes -- large, super massive black holes at their centers -- is something people have speculated on,"" Hoffman said. ""But Hubble has given us data actually to confirm that."" Perhaps Hubble's greatest discovery has been opening scientists' eyes to what they don't yet know. And there's a lot of it. ""We discovered in fact that all that stuff we thought we knew about accounts for only 4 percent of the known universe,"" Grunsfeld said. ""Most of the universe is made up of what's called 'dark energy.' Nobody could have anticipated it. It's the largest constituent of the universe. We still have no idea what it is."" But back in 1990, shortly after the telescope's launch, no one could think about great discoveries. Hubble was considered a disaster. The telescope's primary mirror was flawed. Its shape was off by about 1/50th the thickness of a sheet of paper -- just enough to blur the images. ""There was a time when Hubble was a laughing stock,"" Hoffman said. ""You know, the 'techno turkey.' Pictures in editorial cartoons, denounced on the floors of Congress, ridiculed in late-night television programs."" In December of 1993, astronauts on board the Shuttle Endeavour went on the first Hubble repair mission. They fixed the telescope's blurry vision. A month later, Hubble began sending back the first of hundreds of thousands of crisp, spectacular images. Hoffman calls Hubble, ""the people's telescope."" Grunsfeld, who has made two repair trips to the Hubble, said that leaving it this time will be like saying a final goodbye to an old friend. ""Regardless of my intellectual knowledge that this is a satellite and it's a satellite that people created and has electronics in it and optics and it does its job,"" he said, ""it's impossible not give it some human characteristics and feel sadness when we see it floating away.""","Space shuttle Atlantis blasts off Monday on final visit to the Hubble Space Telescope .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Tiger Woods has canceled plans to attend his own golf tournament in southern California because of injuries he suffered near his Florida home early Friday, the pro golfer said in a statement Monday. ""I am extremely disappointed that I will not be at my tournament this week,"" Woods said of the Chevron World Challenge in Thousand Oaks, California. ""I am certain it will be an outstanding event and I'm very sorry that I can't be there."" He also canceled a Tuesday news conference for the start of the tournament, which helps raise money for Tiger Woods Foundation programs. Woods suffered minor injuries in a vehicle accident early Friday in his luxury neighborhood near Orlando, Florida, according to a police accident report. State police in Florida said Monday an investigation of the single-vehicle crash ""is ongoing and charges are pending."" The incident has ended Woods' golf appearances until next season, according to a statement posted on his Web site. ""Woods will not participate in any other tournaments in 2009 and will return to action next year,"" the statement said. The PGA Tour has ended for the year, but the first tournament of the 2010 season is just five weeks away. At least one other charity event is scheduled, but it is not clear if Woods had planned to attend. The Chevron World Challenge will go on despite the absence of its host,  said Greg McLaughlin, president of Woods' foundation. ""We support Tiger's decision and are confident the strong field and excellent course will provide an exciting week of competition at the Chevron World Challenge,"" McLaughlin said. In a statement issued Sunday afternoon on his Web site, Woods offered no details of his wreck except to say he had cuts and bruises and was ""pretty sore."" ""This situation is my fault, and it's obviously embarrassing to my family and me,"" he said. ""I'm human and I'm not perfect. I will certainly make sure this doesn't happen again."" According to a police report, Woods pulled out of his driveway about 2:25 a.m. Friday in a 2009 Cadillac SUV and struck a fire hydrant, then a tree. Authorities have said they don't have details on why Woods was driving away from his home at such an early hour, but a police report said the wreck was not alcohol-related. State troopers have unsuccessfully asked three times to question him about the wreck, police said. Woods canceled the third scheduled interview on Sunday, Florida Highway Patrol spokeswoman Sgt. Kim Montes told CNN. ""We have been informed by the Florida Highway Patrol that further discussion with them is both voluntary and optional,"" said Woods' agent Mark Steinberg, in a written statement. ""Although Tiger realizes that there is a great deal of public curiosity, it has been conveyed to FHP that he simply has nothing more to add and wishes to protect the privacy of his family."" Under Florida law, Woods must show his license, registration and proof of insurance to police, but is not obligated to give a statement on the crash. His attorney Mark NeJame handed over the required documents to the troopers Sunday at Woods' home, Montes said. Opinion: Tiger Woods is only human . NeJame told CNN he stood by Woods' statement and had no further comment. ""If we're unable to meet with him, we'll move on with our investigation,"" Montes said. But she called the delays ""very unusual, because it's such a minor accident."" Profile: Tiger Woods . Last week, a story in the National Enquirer alleged that Woods has been seeing a New York nightclub hostess. The Associated Press contacted the woman and reported she denied having an affair with Woods. The 33-year-old golf phenomenon has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament each four times, as well as three U.S. Open Championships. Investigators had sought possible surveillance tapes of the wreck from neighbors, but none were found, she said. Toobin: Why Tiger Woods may not be talking . In his Sunday statement, Woods praised his wife Elin Nordegren, saying she ""acted courageously when she saw I was hurt and in trouble."" Nordegren told police she used a golf club to break out the rear window of the vehicle, then pulled Woods from the SUV after she heard the accident from inside their home. ""This is a private matter, and I want to keep it that way."" ""The only person responsible for the accident is me,"" he said. Woods and his wife have two children, a 2-year-old and a baby born in February.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to vice presidential picks, there have been some good ones and some not so good ones. Dick Cheney makes both lists; he's ranked as one of the best and worst VP picks in recent years. CNN asked conservative historian Lee Edwards to rank the VP choices since the 1950s. On his list of good VP picks, Edwards puts Dick Cheney at No. 5. The current vice president makes the list because he brought lots of Washington experience with him, something President Bush lacked at the time. Coming in at No. 4 is Richard Nixon. He was Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower's running mate. Nixon brought with him youth -- and California. The former senator also had other assets that became huge liabilities when he later ended up in the White House. ""Richard Nixon was known as the man who would cut and slash the opposition, and so that kind of dirty politics work would be done by Nixon,"" Edwards said. Next on the list, Al Gore. Bill Clinton's right-hand man comes in at No. 3 because, as the senator from Tennessee, he brought Washington experience to a ticket featuring a little-known governor from Arkansas.  Watch how this year's VP contenders are performing » . Edwards puts George H.W. Bush in the No. 2 spot. After running against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 primaries, Bush joined him on the ticket and helped unite the Republican Party. Edwards' award for best vice presidential pick goes to Lyndon B. Johnson. He was selected by Democratic presidential nominee John F. Kennedy. Kennedy was a Northerner who needed someone to balance him out in the South in 1960. ""Lyndon Johnson was the man, and he delivered Texas, which helped John Kennedy in a very close race,"" Edwards said. Johnson rounds out the good list, but who will go down in history with a not-so-favorable reputation? Edwards has four picks. iReport.com: Who would you pick for VP? Cheney is No. 4 on the list of the bad VPs. (Yes, he makes both lists.) He might have been a great choice for running mate at the beginning, but he's now one of the most unpopular figures in an unpopular administration. Spiro Agnew lands in the No. 3 slot. Edwards said Agnew helped get Nixon elected president, but after taking office, he pleaded no contest to tax evasion and money laundering back when he had been the governor of Maryland. Dan Quayle is runner-up for worst choice. He was the elder Bush's pick for VP. Quayle was supposed to become the Republican JFK, but he instead became a laughingstock to many. During the 1988 vice presidential debate, Democratic VP candidate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen delivered a famous verbal blow to Quayle. ""Senator, I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. You're no Jack Kennedy,"" he said after Quayle said he had as much experience in Congress as Kennedy did when he embarked on his White House run. Quayle became the butt of frequent jokes, and many Americans never let him live down the ""potato incident."" At an elementary school spelling bee in 1992, Quayle incorrectly told a student there should be an ""e"" at the end of the word. Finally, the Edwards' award for the worst VP pick in recent history goes to Sen. Thomas Eagleton. The Democrat from Missouri was Sen. George McGovern's pick for VP in 1972. Eagleton got dumped for Sargent Shriver after reports he'd been hospitalized for ""nervous exhaustion"" and had received electroshock treatments. Those reports raised questions about Eagleton's fitness to serve, and the concerns about his health were disastrous for McGovern's campaign against Nixon.","Conservative historian Lee Edwards ranks best and worst VP picks since 1950s .

"(CNN) -- Honda has expanded an airbag recall worldwide, covering 2001 and 2002 Accord, Civic, Odyssey, CR-V, and selected 2002 Acura TL vehicles, the automaker said. The recall also includes the Honda Pilot and Acura CL in the United States, and the Honda Inspire, Saber and Lagreat in Japan for the same model years. On its Web site late Tuesday, Honda said the driver's airbag inflators might expand with too much pressure, which can cause the inflator casing to break and could lead to injury or death. There have been 12 incidents related to an airbag inflator problem, Honda said. The original recall was issued in July 2009, and included 2001 and 2002 Accords and Civics, as well as some 2002 model year Acura TL vehicles. The global recall now covers more than 950,000 vehicles. Honda said it will notify affected customers by mail and phone with instructions on how to have their vehicles inspected and updated at an authorized dealer. Last month, Honda announced a separate recall of 646,000 2007 and 2008 Fit, City and Jazz models worldwide, after a fire hazard involving a power window switch resulted in a death in South Africa.","Honda has expanded an airbag recall worldwide to more than half a million vehicles .

"(CNN) -- When the series ""ER"" airs its finale on Thursday, the event will not only mark the completion of one of NBC's most successful shows, but it can also be viewed as the end of an era for the network. NBC's ""ER,"" which ends on April 2, helped launch the careers of several actors, including George Clooney. ""What's so symbolic about 'ER' leaving is that that 10 o'clock Thursday night slot started out what I always called the beginning of the second golden age of television with 'Hill Street Blues',"" said Robert Thompson, a professor and founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. ""In almost a quarter of a century it went from 'Hill Street Blues' Thursday at 10 to 'L.A. Law' Thursday at 10 to 'ER' Thursday at 10. 'ER' is kind of occupying sacred space."" Beginning this fall, such prime time real estate, which also previously housed another acclaimed hospital drama, ""St. Elsewhere."" will be occupied by a new talk show helmed by ""The Tonight Show"" host Jay Leno.  It's a significant move for NBC in an age where sitcoms and dramas have increasingly given way to the less-expensive-to-produce reality TV shows.   ""ER,"" which at one point was paying millions of dollars per episode just in actor salaries, definitely fit into the realm of costly productions. Despite the price tag, the show ran for 15 seasons and is the most Emmy-nominated series in television history with 122 nominations, 22 of which resulted in wins.  Check out a timeline of the show's actors » . It almost never made it out of a pile of scripts. Created by the late author Michael Crichton and steered by the creative team at Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, the concept didn't immediately tickle the fancy of television honchos. ""Every network had passed on it, twice,"" the show's longtime executive producer, John Wells, told The New York Times. ""It had all these characters and medical dialogue, and they found it utterly impossible to follow."" Once it did get the green light, it caught on like a house afire. ""ER"" quickly attracted legions of fans and catapulted many members of the ever-changing ensemble cast to superstar status -- most notably George Clooney, who played hunky Dr. Doug Ross. Baltimore Sun television critic David Zurawik, who writes about the industry in the paper's ""Z on TV"" blog, said there may never be another collection of such talent in an ensemble drama on network television. ""There's just no way in the business model of network television for a producer out in Hollywood to say 'Here's the concept, and I've got this star, this star and this star,' "" Zurawik said. ""By the time they got two sentences out, the production studio head they are pitching would say 'Who's going to be paying for that.' The economics for that are just not there, and neither is the audience."" Zurawik noted that audiences and actors alike now have gravitated to cable television, where dramatic hits such as ""Mad Men"" and ""Rescue Me"" are being produced by the likes of AMC and FX. ""Cable is growing whereas network TV isn't,"" Zurawik said. ""The better actors, the ones who work in film and theater, really like doing cable because cable has been flexible. It's not, if you sign on to this series you are going to do 22 episodes a year and you have to sign away five or six years of your life. Nobody wants to do that anymore."" Former Dallas Morning News TV critic Ed Bark, who now runs the site Uncle Barky's Bytes, said he believes in the coming years most of the Emmy-caliber shows will be on cable. Cable television benefits, he said, from the double revenue stream of both money from advertisers and subscribers, so there is not the ratings pressure network television has. Moreover, high-quality dramas are valuable calling cards, he added. Cable stations have been successful at branding themselves based on some of the shows they are producing. ""A lot of times, it takes one show to get people to look at your network as a place where you can see quality drama,"" Bark said. ""For FX, it was 'The Shield.' For TNT it was 'The Closer.' For AMC, it was 'Mad Men.' I think once you get an audience over there, you build on that."" However, at least some of cable's audience gains come at the expense of network TV's audience, which has shrunk substantially in the 15 years since ""ER"" went on the air. Indeed, the drama's demise is symbolic of long-term programming trends, said Thompson. The TV and pop culture professor, who has written several books on television, said NBC choosing to cede 10 o'clock to a talk show rather than another great drama speaks volumes, though he wouldn't count out the genre entirely. ""This is not a good time to buy television drama futures, but I don't think they are going to die,"" Thompson said. ""The TV drama is going to be like the American bison. There used to be herds and herds of them roaming the country. They're not dead, but there are just not as many.""","""ER"" ends its NBC run on Thursday, April 2, after 15 seasons .

"(CNN) -- President Obama introduced a health care plan that he says will bridge the gap between the House and Senate bills passed last year. His proposal is similar to the Senate bill, with a few nods to the House plan. Here are some of the highlights of his plan, according to the White House. Basics . The president says his health care proposal will help more than 31 million uninsured Americans get coverage. Obama says his plan includes the largest middle-class tax cut for health care in history. It establishes a health insurance market that would provide the same insurance choices that members of Congress have. Health insurance exchanges, as proposed in the Senate bill, would be created to make it easier for small businesses, the self-employed and the unemployed to purchase less expensive coverage. There is no public option, an idea strongly backed by liberal Democrats but fiercely opposed both by Republicans and key Democratic moderates. Like the House and Senate plans, Obama's proposal would bar insurers from charging higher premiums based on a person's gender or medical history or denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Key differences . Obama's plan eliminates the controversial proposal added to the Senate bill that exempts Nebraska from paying increased Medicaid expenses. It also provides additional federal financing to all of the states for the Medicaid expansion. The president's proposal closes the Medicare prescription drug ""doughnut hole."" Under current Medicare limits, seniors must pick up the costs once their drug costs reach $2,830 and pay all costs out of pocket until they reach $4,550, at which point Medicare coverage kicks back in. Obama's proposal eases the ""doughnut hole"" in the short term by providing a $250 rebate to Medicare beneficiaries who reach the limit in 2010. The plan closes the doughnut hole completely by 2020. The plan also establishes a Health Insurance Rate Authority to provide an additional level of oversight of insurance premium increase at the federal level, giving the government new authority to block excessive rate hikes by health insurance companies. Tax credits . The president's proposal increases federal subsidies to help people buy insurance. New health insurance subsidies would be provided to families making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Compared to the Senate bill, Obama's proposal lowers premiums for families making between $44,000 and $66,000, according to the White House. Compared to the House bill, it lowers premiums for families making between $55,000 and $88,000. Obama's plan also provides more cost-sharing assistance than the House and Senate bills for families with incomes below $55,000. For families making about $55,000, the president's proposal matches the assistance in the Senate bill. Penalties and fees . The House and Senate bills both require payments from individuals who choose not to get health care coverage. Obama's plan lowers the maximum penalty for individuals. Obama's plan also provides $40 billion in tax credits for small businesses to help them provide health care options for their employees. Like the Senate bill, the president's proposal does not mandate that employers provide insurance. Under Obama's plan, companies with more than 50 employees would be required to pay a fee of $2,000 per worker if the company does not provide coverage and any of that company's workers receives federal health care subsidies. The first 30 workers would be subtracted from the payment calculation. As with the individual requirement, this represents a compromise between the House and Senate plans. Obama's proposal delays the $67 billion assessment on health insurers, pushing it to 2014, when exchanges and the new health insurance market will be set up. The president's proposal also increases the revenue drawn from the pharmaceutical industry to $23 billion over the next three years -- $10 billion more than the Senate bill. It delays the implementation of these fees to 2011. Waste, fraud and abuse . The president's proposal includes a number of provisions to help eliminate waste and fight fraud. Some of those provisions include establishing Medicare and Medicaid sanctions databases, increasing access to the health care integrity and protection data bank, expanding efforts to recover overpayments made to providers and suppliers, and establishing a system to more quickly identify potentially fraudulent payments. Obama's proposal also calls for preventing delays in access to generic drugs. Questions . The president's proposal doesn't address many of the sticking points that hung up the House and Senate bills. Obama says his plan also reduces the deficit by $100 billion over the next decade and about $1 trillion over the following decade by ""cutting government overspending and reining in waste, fraud and abuse."" The White House says the plan would cost about $950 billion over the next 10 years, but that's not an official estimate. There are also not a lot of specifics on how to pay for the plan. The Senate plan, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, would cost an estimated $871 billion; the more expansive House plan has been estimated to cost over $1 trillion. The Obama plan resembles the Senate version on how to block subsidies from funding abortions, choosing it over the more conservative House version. On health care and illegal immigrants, the president's proposal follows the Senate language, which imposes far more limits on undocumented workers than the House version. Outlook . Obama's proposal is a long way from becoming law. His proposal would need to be drafted into legislation, debated and passed by the House and Senate. As the past year has shown, health care is an emotional subject, and debate can drag on for months. Immediate reaction from Republicans suggests that this time around, it won't be any easier. ""Nearly one year ago, the president moderated a health care summit that kicked off a national debate that has led us to where we are today: a partisan bill devoid of support from the American people and a diminished faith in this government's capacity to listen. Let's not make the same mistake twice,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said. House Minority Leader John Boehner revived the abortion debate, saying, ""Republicans are also standing with the American people by calling for health care reform to protect human life and not use taxpayer money to fund abortion. ... Health care reform should be an opportunity to protect human life -- not end it -- and the American people agree."" CNN's Lisa Desjardins, Kristi Keck and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","White House releases ""The President's Proposal"" for health care .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- A man accused of flying a small plane into an Austin building housing an Internal Revenue Service office last week was one of two people killed in the incident, Texas authorities confirmed Monday. The man who authorities say was the pilot, Andrew Joseph ""Joe"" Stack III of Austin, and Vernon Hunter of Cedar Park have been identified as the two people killed Thursday, according to the Travis County medical examiner's office. Both men died from blunt force injuries, said Sarah Scott, chief administrative officer for the medical examiner. Authorities say that on Thursday, Stack flew a single-engine plane into a seven-story building that held offices for nearly 200 IRS workers. Two other people were hospitalized. Hunter and his wife, Valerie, worked at the IRS office in the building, his brother Harold L. Jackson told CNN affiliate WAAY. Hunter spent the past 15 years as a collections agent and previously served 22 years in the Army. Jackson said Hunter was the youngest of five brothers. Hunter was adopted as an infant and kept his birth name into adulthood. ""We called ourselves the Jackson Five, the other Jackson Five,"" Jackson said. Agents were looking into whether the seats of the plane were removed to accommodate a fuel drum in an effort to cause maximum damage, an official familiar with the investigation said Friday. The official, who could not speak on the record because of the ongoing investigation, said that the Piper Cherokee PA-28 had several seats removed and that a fuel drum was missing from the airport where authorities say Stack took off. The single-engine plane has a fuel tank capacity of 38 gallons and is equipped with four seats, according to the Web site risingup.com. Authorities say Stack also torched his $230,000 home in Austin on Thursday morning before embarking on his fatal flight. A 3,000-word message on a Web site registered to Stack railed against the government, particularly the IRS. Read the apparent suicide note (PDF) ""I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different,"" the online message says. ""I am finally ready to stop this insanity. Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, let's try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well."" Stack's wife, Sheryl Stack, expressed her ""sincere sympathy to the victims and their families"" in a statement read by family friend Rayford Walker on Friday. Friends and former colleagues have said they had no inkling of the rage apparently building inside Stack. ""He hid that very well,"" said Billy Eli, in whose band Stack played bass until a few years ago. ""Obviously, he was in some serious distress and had some real despair. I never saw that.""","Victim worked in IRS office in building where crash happened, WAAY reports .

"Washington (CNN) -- Washington Wizards point guard Gilbert Arenas pleaded guilty Friday to illegally possessing an unlicensed handgun in the District of Columbia in a locker-room incident last month. The 28-year-old NBA all-star told Superior Court Judge Robert E. Morin that he understood he could receive up to five years in prison when he is sentenced on March 26. But Arenas' attorney, Kenneth Wainstein, told the court that the government will ask for no more than six months, under the terms of a plea agreement. ""He accepted full responsibility for his actions, acknowledged that those actions were wrong and against the law, and has apologized to all who have been affected by his conduct,"" Wainstein said in a written statement. The government has agreed to limit its recommendation to the low end of the guidelines -- ""estimated to be between six and 24 months, with probation, a split sentence, or incarceration permissible,"" U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips said in a written statement. ""Playing with firearms is no joke,"" said Phillips. ""Such reckless action can always be expected to garner a swift and firm response from this office. We commend Mr. Arenas for accepting responsibility and hope he fully appreciates the gravity of his actions."" The government statement said the incident was traced to a flight from Phoenix, Arizona, on December 19, when Arenas and a fellow teammate ""became involved in a verbal exchange after a card game."" ""Although Arenas maintains that the statements he made during this exchange were made in jest, the exchange between Arenas and the teammate involved mutual threats to shoot one another,"" it said. ""Arenas also told the teammate that he would burn the teammate's Cadillac Escalade."" Two days later, Arenas entered the team's locker room at the Verizon Center carrying at least one firearm in his backpack, the statement said. ""Once Arenas entered the locker room, he placed four firearms on the chair located directly in front of the locker of the teammate with whom he had the prior verbal exchange. Arenas then wrote the message 'PICK 1' on a piece of paper, and placed it on the teammate's chair near the firearms. Arenas remained in the locker room. ""Moments later, the teammate walked into the locker room and approached his locker. He saw the handguns and he and Arenas once again exchanged words. During this exchange, Arenas stated, 'You said you were going to shoot me, so I thought you would like some firepower. Pick one.' The teammate picked up one of Arenas's firearms from his chair, threw it across the locker room, then reportedly took out what appeared to Arenas to be a silver-colored semi-automatic handgun. ""After this exchange, Arenas admitted to team management that he brought the firearms from his home in Virginia into Washington, D.C. He also told team management that the teammate also had a firearm. The teammate has since denied that he ever had a handgun. Team management directed Washington Wizards security personnel to secure Arenas's firearms and to remove them from the premises."" The incident came to light on December 24, when authorities were notified, the statement said. Metropolitan police went to Arenas' home in Virginia, where the athlete's four unloaded firearms -- a .50-caliber gold-plated, semi-automatic Desert Eagle with magazine; a .500 Magnum Smith & Wesson revolver; a .45-caliber black, semi-automatic Kimber Eclipse with magazine; and a 9-mm Browning with magazine -- were surrendered, it said. The three-time NBA All-Star said he told authorities that he had stored the guns in his locker in the Verizon Center to keep them away from his children. ""I brought them without any ammunition into the District of Columbia, mistakenly believing that the recent change in the D.C. gun laws allowed a person to store unloaded guns in the District,"" Arenas said in his statement. He offered a public apology at the time to the league, his teammates and his fans, saying, ""I promise to do better in the future."" During Friday's court proceeding, the usually jocular Arenas appeared somber. Dressed in a dark pinstripe suit, he neither smiled nor spoke as he entered and left the courthouse. The judge ordered him to surrender his passport and said he could not possess any firearms while he awaits sentencing. Arenas' indefinite suspension remains in effect until a separate NBA investigation is complete and Commissioner David Stern reaches a decision on whether to reinstate him, a source said Thursday. The league investigation, which had been on hold at the request of federal prosecutors, will now resume, the source told CNN. In a statement this month, Arenas described the incident as ""a misguided effort to play a joke on a teammate,"" and said, ""Contrary to some press accounts, I never threatened or assaulted anyone with the guns and never pointed them at anyone. Joke or not, I now recognize that what I did was a mistake and was wrong."" Citing NBA sources, the New York Post reported in December that the teammate who allegedly also brandished a firearm was Javaris Crittenton. Crittenton's agent, Mark Bartelstein, has told CNN that his client ""hasn't done anything wrong. I'm extremely confident he'll be exonerated."" Phillips said the investigation into the second player was ongoing.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama returned to the United States on Monday morning after an unannounced visit to Afghanistan, where he met with his Afghan counterpart and reiterated the need to wipe out terror networks. Obama slipped into Bagram Air Base near Kabul under the cover of darkness Sunday. He met with about 2,000 troops at the U.S. base and told them their work is significant to security at home. ""I know it's not easy,"" he said. ""If I thought for a minute that America's vital interests were not served, were not at stake here in Afghanistan, I would order all of you home right away."" The United States has made progress in the fight against al Qaeda and its allies, Obama said. ""All of that makes America safer, and we are going to keep them on the run,"" he said. ""Because that is what is going to be required in order to ensure that our families back home have the security that they need."" Earlier, Obama met with President Hamid Karzai to discuss progress by the Afghan government in strengthening its ability to run the country and provide security for its people. After the 30-minute meeting, Obama said he wanted to send a ""strong message"" that the partnership between the nations would continue. Related: Afghanistan Crossroads . Karzai thanked the United States, pointing out that American taxpayers have helped rebuild his country. During his trip, the president made clear that the visit was to encourage the roughly 80,000 U.S. troops in the country. ""The United States of America does not quit once it starts on something. ...

"(CNN) -- You might not have wanted to bet on Billy Joel in the summer of 1977. If ""The Stranger"" hadn't been a success, Billy Joel suspects he would have been dropped from his label. For a guy whose career had started out promisingly, he'd undergone more setbacks than a wild-armed pitcher. In his teen years he was a session pianist on Shadow Morton-produced records (including, allegedly, the Shangri-Las' ""Leader of the Pack""), but failed with his groups, including a heavy-metal duo. He followed his first Top 40 hit, ""Piano Man,"" with a bitter second one, ""The Entertainer"" (in which he sang, ""If I go cold/I won't get sold/I'll get put in the back/In the discount rack/Like another can of beans,"" over an incongruous synthesizer track). He was considered a singer-songwriter with great potential but bickered with his label and his producers. Making 1976's ""Turnstiles,"" he fired producer James William Guercio -- a consistent hitmaker with Chicago -- and took the helm himself, with uneven results. And yet he still had something, remembered Phil Ramone, who was to produce Joel's 1977 breakthrough, ""The Stranger."" At a 1976 Columbia Records convention in Toronto, Joel opened a musical showcase and ""ripped the crowd up,"" Ramone recalls in a phone interview from Connecticut. ""My friends said, 'Watch this guy.' ""  Watch Joel perform ""Piano Man"" » . And then there was a series of concerts at New York's Carnegie Hall in early June 1977, featured on the new anniversary edition of ""The Stranger"" (Columbia/Legacy), out Tuesday. (A special edition of the release also includes a DVD of other Joel performances.) Known then, as now, as an exciting live performer, Joel and his band gave a series of performances that impressed Ramone -- though, he noted, the recorded versions paled in comparison. ""I watched what he had done and tracked his past records,"" he says. ""Everything I'd seen hadn't been captured on record."" ""The Stranger"" turned out differently. Joel came through with a top-notch set of songs, and four of them -- ""Just the Way You Are,"" ""Movin' Out,"" ""She's Always a Woman"" and ""Only the Good Die Young"" -- became hits. ""The Stranger"" established Joel as a best-selling artist -- reportedly, upon release, it was the biggest-selling Columbia album in history -- and propelled him to his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame career.  Watch Joel perform ""Only the Good Die Young"" in Russia » . At the time, he just wanted to make a consistent record. ""I don't recall feeling this was going to be the breakthrough. We were just happy with the album we were making at the time,"" Joel says in the press materials for the ""Stranger"" re-release. (Joel wasn't available for an interview with CNN.) He acknowledges, though, that ""The Stranger"" could have been his last stand. ""I didn't know this at the time, but had it not been a successful album, the label probably would have dropped me. 'Cause you have to remember, this was my fifth album without having had a major hit,"" he says. Joel interviewed several producers, Ramone recalls, including the Beatles' George Martin. Ramone, known for his graceful touch in the studio, was coming off Paul Simon's ""Still Crazy After All These Years"" and the Barbra Streisand ""A Star Is Born"" soundtrack. He and Joel hit it off at ""an Italian lunch that took forever,"" Ramone says, and in July went into the studio to record. The album was recorded in three weeks -- very quickly, says Ramone. The producer remembers the sessions as full of humor, with his most difficult task reining in the members of Joel's band. It was an accident that Ramone ended up included in the group portrait on the album's back cover, dressed in New York Yankee regalia -- ""I only posed because I thought, 'They'll never use this,' "" he says. ""The role I played was kind of like the captain of the team,"" he says. ""I doled out punishments -- it was a crazy, lunatic group. There were times I'd throw out [ideas] and they'd say, 'No way.' They all had great opinions."" Then there was Joel, a forceful singer who, Ramone observes, is also ""extremely vulnerable."" The singer had a tendency to hide behind his song's characters; Ramone urged him to put more of himself into the vocals in ""The Stranger,"" and continued the advice for succeeding albums. ""I would say, 'When is Billy Joel going to show up?' "" Ramone says. ""You have to adapt [the character] to you."" Running through the album's tracks more than 30 years later, Ramone says there's always something he'd like to change, but in general he's very satisfied with the record, particularly the songs ""Scenes from an Italian Restaurant,"" ""The Stranger"" and ""Just the Way You Are."" The latter, he notes, was supposed to have been spiked -- Joel, who wrote it for his then wife, thought it was too syrupy. (""A chick song,"" he's called it.) Moreover, Ramone's suggestions for the song met with resistance: Drummer Liberty DeVitto rebelled against the Brazilian baion beat, and the band was unhappy when Ramone tapped jazzman Phil Woods to play the alto sax solo. But the song proved to be the album's big hit. ""They put out 'Movin' Out' [as the first single], and it [failed]. And then out of nowhere came 'Just the Way You Are,' "" Ramone says. The song got a big boost when Joel appeared as the musical guest on ""Saturday Night Live"" in February 1978 and eventually won Grammys for song and record of the year. ""The Stranger"" was the beginning of a fruitful run for Joel and Ramone. The pair made seven more albums together, including the No. 1 records ""52nd Street"" and ""Glass Houses,"" and still maintain a warm relationship, says Ramone. Joel, who will play the final two concerts at New York's soon-to-be-closed Shea Stadium July 16 and 18, has long since put the questions of ""potential"" to rest. ""I didn't necessarily set out to be a big worldwide, international super rock star kind of guy. I set out to make a living as a musician, and this is the way it happened,"" he said.","Billy Joel was at a career crossroads in 1977 .

"(CNN) -- The second-to-last time EJ Levy was at Disney World, she used a scooter to navigate the enormous park. Her legs were weak and she suffered from foot drop caused by multiple sclerosis. That was 4½ years ago. On her most recent trip, a few months ago, Levy walked the entire time, thanks in part to a drug approved by the FDA on Friday. The FDA says the drug, Ampyra (generic name dalfampridine, formerly known as fampridine), is the first MS therapy that is taken orally and the first of its kind to receive FDA approval. It is designed help people with any type of MS improve their walking speed. The prime of her life . In 2002, Levy was in her 30s and an active hiker and skier with a job on Wall Street and later in San Francisco, California. But her life took a turn when she started stumbling, falling down and dragging her right leg. Her doctor's diagnosis? Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis, a less common form of MS and, as the name implies, one that usually plagues people with the disease after its initial course. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society defines MS as a ""chronic, often disabling disease that attacks the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves."" Symptoms of MS include extreme fatigue, difficulty walking, problems with memory and heat sensitivity. The most common form of MS is relapsing-remitting, in which people have acute attacks followed by periods of remission. In secondary progressive, however, the disease worsens steadily and there are no acute flare-ups. People with relapsing-remitting may later develop secondary progressive MS. Levy says she lived in the same building as her parents at one point because she needed them to help take care of her. She says she mostly stayed at home, and when she did venture out she usually walked only a block or two with a cane. She relied on a wheelchair for longer distances. She says she realized she would eventually be unable to walk. ""I was scared of being in a wheelchair. I was scared of getting worse and worse. I had traveled around the world before I got sick, I was super independent,"" Levy says. Trying things out . After exhausting the usual MS treatments -- and developing intolerable side effects -- Levy also became frustrated that the treatments were primarily designed for people with the more common course of the disease, and not the secondary progressive course. Levy's neurologist then discussed the possibility of trying 4-aminopyradine -- a version of the same drug the FDA approved Friday that was available only through compounding pharmacies. Just three days after taking the drug, Levy was able to walk unassisted. ""I never thought I could put my cane away for good,"" she said. Now she hopes the same drug that helped her will be able to help other people. She addressed an FDA advisory panel late last year and recommended approval of it. ""It's about quality of life,"" Levy says. How it works . Two phase III clinical trials of Ampyra showed 35 and 43 percent of patients experienced, on average, a consistent improvement in their walking speed, increasing it by about 25 percent. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, even a modest improvement in walking ability could mean that thousands of people could benefit from the drug. Dr. John Richert, executive vice president of Research & Clinical Programs at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, says the drug can be used by most people with MS. However, the drug is not for people with a history of seizures or people who have moderate to severe kidney disease. Richert says approval means patients can now skip the compounding pharmacy and get a consistent, exact dosage in a guaranteed time-released formula, which would lower the risk of getting a toxic dose instead of a therapeutic dose. ""It's likely that further study and clinical practice may help to determine the extent to which the drug may impact other functions, and may also provide hints as to which patients are most likely to respond positively to the therapy,"" Richert said. He added that the drug would not help nerves that have been destroyed and emphasized that people should try the drug to see if it works for them. Ampyra may not work for everyone. ""Like any medication, people will have different responses, so they should talk to their doctors about whether it's appropriate to start therapy on Ampyra,"" according to a spokesperson from Acorda, Ampyra's manufacturer. Moving with MS . Today, Levy is doing well. She established the not-for-profit organization MS Hope for a Cure, and in three years the organization has raised $1.8 million for research and programs to help people living with MS. She has also completed several five-mile hikes. But she says she is always conscious of where she steps. She says she occasionally has some weakness in her leg, but that she is thankful for every day: ""I don't ever take jumping out of bed for granted.""","FDA approves Ampyra, the first MS drug of its kind to improve walking speed .
Ampyra is appropriate for all types of MS, although it may not help everyone .
Further studies are needed to see if Ampyra helps with other neurological functions ."
"(CNN) -- Elizabeth McCutchen and a friend were walking to book club two weeks ago in quaint Farmville, Virginia, when they strolled by a home on First Avenue. ""Something smells dead,"" her friend said. Richard Samuel McCroskey has been arrested in connection with the killings of four people in Virginia. They were thinking animal. A dog, a cat, something like that. They never imagined they were smelling the remains of massacred humans. It was Thursday, September 17. But another 24 hours would pass before police made the gruesome discovery. Richard Samuel McCroskey III -- a 20-year-old rapper in the underground genre of ""Horrorcore"" who sang of chopping people into pieces -- has been arrested in connection with the slayings. The crime scene was so horrifying police would not even describe it, saying only that the victims died of blunt force trauma. The victims were Mark Niederbrock, 50, the beloved pastor at Walker's Presbyterian Church; his 16-year-old daughter, Emma Niederbrock; Melanie Wells, Emma's 18-year-old friend from West Virginia; and Niederbrock's estranged wife, Debra Kelley, 53, a professor at Longwood University. McCroskey has been charged only in the killing of Mark Niederbrock. Police and the prosecutor's office did not return repeated phone calls from CNN. But in late September, authorities said more charges are pending. Emma was described as a fan of Horrorcore and had met McCroskey through their mutual affection for the little-known music genre. Police said she invited McCroskey to fly from his northern California home, stay with her in Virginia and then attend the Strictly for the Wicked Festival, a Horrorcore fest in Michigan featuring bands with names like Dismembered Fetus and Phrozen Body Boy. Nobody saw what would come next. The slayings have been the talk of Farmville, a town of  7,000 that is home to Longwood University and nearby Hampden-Sydney College. Senseless is the word you hear most. It's not just the macabre nature of the killings that has people talking. It's the grotesque lyrics of the Horrorcore singer; it's that it happened under their noses. McCroskey is a young man with no criminal record who took delight in the blend of horror hip-hop that celebrated macabre killings. He went by the name Syko Sam. In one YouTube video, he holds a hatchet and sings about killing people and putting their remains in black bags: ""Last night I was the murderous rage. Now, I gotta get rid of the bodies before the corpses start to get to rotting."" 'Stinkiest rascal I've ever smelled' Authorities have not specified when the Virginia killings occurred, but at 4 a.m. on Friday, September 18, tow-truck driver Elton Napier was called out to Poor House Road to help McCroskey, whose car was stuck. Napier said McCroskey was wearing a black-hooded sweatshirt and ""was really smelling bad, like real bad. I can't describe it."" McCroskey was driving Mark Niederbrock's Honda. Napier said two sheriff's deputies were at the scene and McCroskey was ticketed for driving without a license. At the time, authorities didn't know the pastor had been slain. When McCroskey hopped into Napier's flatbed, the tow-truck driver said he started gagging from the odor and immediately rolled down the windows. ""I just held my head out the window so the wind would hit me in the face,"" he said. ""That was the stinkiest rascal I've ever smelled."" Napier drove McCroskey about four miles to a convenience store. McCroskey told Napier he was visiting his girlfriend and her father lent him the car. McCroskey fetched a black bag from the Honda before they parted. Napier went inside to get a cup of coffee. According to police, McCroskey eventually caught a cab to Richmond International Airport. By mid-afternoon that same day, police found the bodies at the home on First Avenue. McCroskey was arrested the next day at the airport, where he had spent the night. When he was being led to jail, McCroskey told reporters, ""Jesus told me to do it."" Suspect's family, community grieve . Sarah McCroskey of California told CNN-affiliate WWBT that her brother had been looking forward to his visit to Virginia for weeks. She mourned his arrest and struggled with the accusations against him. ""I want to hear his voice. I am so concerned, so worried -- not just for him [but] other people, other families involved dealing with this loss,"" she said. Read WWBT's special coverage . Defense attorney Cary Bowen told CNN, ""I don't want to say he's in shock. That's a medical term, but it's a big experience for him. ... I'm not sure he gets the severity of everything right now."" The community is still devastated by the events as it struggles to move forward. Memorial services were held over the weekend for Emma Niederbrock and her mother, Debra Kelley. The Rev. Sylvia Meadows of Farmville United Methodist Church baptized Emma at age 5 and her father when he was an adult. The pastor said the church has invited an occult specialist to speak with members of the community to help them come to grips with the dark side of humanity. ""We have looked evil in the face and cannot deny that it exists,"" Meadows said. ""God is stronger than evil. God is bigger."" Luther Glenn, a member of Walker's Presbyterian Church where Niederbrock was pastor, took issue with McCroskey's comment about Jesus telling him to act. ""I think it's deeply rooted in Satan, if you want to know the truth."" Elizabeth McCutchen, who passed the First Avenue home some time after the slayings, said the killings have affected every fabric of the community: the churches, the colleges, and their youth. ""This is the kind of town that goes to the rescue of survivors, but there's nobody [left] -- we can't do anything about it,"" she said. ""It's been really, really upsetting.""

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Jaime Escalante, the math teacher portrayed in the 1988 film ""Stand and Deliver,"" died Tuesday after a battle with cancer, according to the actor who played him. Escalante, 79, was surrounded by his wife, children and grandchildren when he died at his home in Roseville, California, said Edward James Olmos. Olmos visited Escalante's bedside Monday night, he said. ""We lost one of the true giants of education and inspiration in this country,"" Olmos said. ""He really made us understand that it didn't matter what color, race, creed or ethnicity any of us are."" Olmos disclosed earlier this month that Escalante was ""seriously ill"" with cancer and needed help paying for his medical care. He held a fundraiser in Los Angeles, California, for him last week. ""Stand and Deliver"" told the inspirational story of how Escalante turned the failing calculus program at Garfield High School in east Los Angeles into one of the top in the nation. The movie depicted events of 1982 when his inner-city student's test scores were questioned by officials. Those who were retested had their passing scores reinstated. Escalante became a hero for educators, earning him entrance to the National Teachers Hall of Fame and the Presidential Medal for Excellence in Education. ""During his tenure at Garfield High School, many of our students excelled in learning, aspired to a higher education and went on to become very successful in various careers,"" Los Angeles School Superintendent Ramon Cortines said. ""Today, they are living testaments to a teacher who demonstrated how high expectations coupled with constant support can overcome obstacles to a quality education."" The Garfield High math program floundered after Escalante left in 1991 for a teaching job in Sacramento, California. He also hosted a PBS television series that promoted math and science careers. He retired from teaching and returned to Bolivia in 1999, where he was born in 1930. Escalante recently returned to California for medical treatment.

Tim Clark, Matt Kuchar and Bubba Watson all finished tied for second place on 29 under. Haas led by two strokes after an fine start but the chasing pack reduced his lead and a birdie on 17 put him level with leaders Clark and Kuchar. He completed victory with a birdie four at the last hole after he struck a brave tee shot. Haas fired his approach at the last to within 27 feet and two putts were enough to seal a victory that matches the win his father - Jay Haas - secured at the same event in 1988. Haas, who was watched by his father, admitted the victory was even sweeter with a large family contingent present. ""It's pretty special as I didn't know my dad was here. My dad and my brother and his uncle were there,"" Haas told the tournament's official Web site. ""They knew they flew back from Hawaii last night, I thought maybe if I was in contention they might show up, but didn't see them until the end there. ""It's not easy to win.

"New Zealand maxi Alfa Romeo eased to victory in the 65th annual Sydney to Hobart ocean yacht race on Monday.

"Ithaca, New York (CNN) -- Two suspected cases of suicide on the Cornell University campus have officially been confirmed by the Tompkins County chief medical examiner, bringing the total number of suicides for the academic year to six. Cornell officials had previously said authorities confirmed four other deaths at the school as suicides. The medical examiner says his office has been in touch with the families of the latest suicide victims. ""They have all been made aware of the manner of death,"" Dr. Howard Socoff told CNN. The rash of cases has rocked the highly competitive Ivy League school in central New York State. The most recent suicides came on successive days and prompted the university's mental health initiatives director, Timothy Marchell, to declare a ""public health crisis."" In February, a freshman jumped off a bridge over one of the area's well-known gorges. The body of a sophomore engineering major was found March 11 under similar circumstances. Police are also searching for a body in another suicide witnessed March 12. David Skorton, who became president of Cornell in 2005, has been praised by counselors for encouraging openness on an issue that many schools try to cover up. In an e-mail to students on Friday, he encouraged them to use available suicide-prevention resources. Skorton placed full-page ads in the university newspaper, The Cornell Daily Sun, every day this week, which read, ""If you learn anything at Cornell, please learn to ask for help. It is a sign of wisdom and strength."" The message may be getting through. The first sentence of the quote has been written in chalk on one of the bridges where the suicides took place. The cause of the wave of suicides is unclear, Marchell said. The national average for school suicides is 7.29 per year for every 100,000 students, said Paula Clayton, medical director of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. That means Cornell, with 19,639 students, should average fewer than two suicides a year. Cornell had no suicides from 2005 to 2008, according to Marchell. And the school has consistently fallen within or below the national average, said Karen Carr, assistant dean of students at Cornell. The school has been praised by psychologists such as Keith Anderson, chairman of the American College Health Association's Mental Health Best Practices Task Force, for counseling and prevention programs that confront the issue of student suicide with comprehensive training and understanding. Cornell responded to a cluster of suicides in the late 1990s with comprehensive training for members of the university community. Everyone on campus, including janitors, administrators, residential advisers and professors, is trained to look for symptoms of depression. Freshmen are screened for indicators of psychological disorders, and multiple counseling services are available for students in need. ""I know that they've been doing a lot of outreach efforts to educate the community. Cornell is kind of a model in some ways,"" said Anderson, a staff psychologist at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, New York. In response to the current wave of suicides, Cornell will ""strengthen the capacity of the community to know what to do,"" Marchell said. ""They will be showing nonmental health professionals what role they can play and help students and faculty get the kind of support that they need."" The school also has posted guards to monitor the bridges over the gorges. On Wednesday, campus clubs such as Cornell Minds Matters took part in a schoolwide event to promote mental health awareness.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two Supreme Court justices engaged in a late-night exchange of harsh words before the execution early Wednesday of a convicted Tennessee killer who had been sitting on death row for nearly three decades. Justices John Paul Stevens and Clarence Thomas disagreed over whether to grant a stay of execution for Cecil Johnson Jr. The stay eventually was denied, and about an hour later, at 2:34 a.m., Johnson was put to death by lethal injection at a Nashville, Tennessee, prison. The 53-year-old inmate had been convicted of murder in a 1980 shooting spree at a convenience store near the state capital. The victims included 12-year-old Bobby Bell Jr., son of the store owner, who was wounded. Two other men sitting in a nearby taxicab also were shot to death. Stevens, who was initially presented the last-minute appeal by Johnson's lawyers, would have granted the stay, along with Justice Stephen Breyer. Stevens was concerned that too much time had elapsed between sentencing and the planned execution, amounting perhaps to cruel and unusual punishment. ""Johnson bears little, if any, responsibility for this delay,"" said Stevens, who said procedural hurdles at the appellate stage for capital defendants created what he called ""underlying evils of intolerable delay."" ""The delay itself subjects death row inmates to decades of especially severe, dehumanizing conditions of confinement."" It is an issue that the 89-year-old justice has long urged his colleagues to address, with little success. In his early years on the high court in the mid-1970s he had supported the resumption of the death penalty after a four-year moratorium imposed by the Supreme Court. But in recent years, he has voiced his opposition to capital punishment, particularly in cases involving inmates asserting their right to challenge their sentences. Thomas reacted strongly to Stevens' statement. The conservative jurist said the inmate had challenged his conviction and sentence for nearly 29 years and ""now contends that the very proceedings he used to contest his sentence should prohibit the state from carrying it out."" ""In Justice Stevens' view, it seems the state can never get the timing just right. The reason, he has said, is that the death penalty itself is wrong."" Thomas said. ""As long as our system affords capital defendants the procedural safeguards this court has long endorsed, defendants who avail themselves of these procedures will face the delays Justice Stevens laments."" Then Thomas goes on to say there are ""alternatives,"" citing the custom in England centuries ago to carry out an execution the day after a conviction. ""I have no doubt that such a system would avoid the diminishing justification problem Justice Stevens identifies, but I am equally confident it would find little support from this court."" The high court had been presented with Johnson's emergency appeal early Tuesday afternoon, but apparently the time needed to produce the Stevens and Thomas statements delayed the high court from issuing its denial of a stay until 1:38 a.m. Wednesday. The execution was carried out as scheduled, with no problems reported by corrections officials.","John Paul Stevens, Clarence Thomas disagreed over whether to grant a stay of execution .

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Russian police released photographs Tuesday of two women suspected of being the suicide bombers who killed at least 39 people on the Moscow metro a day earlier. Special services are also seeking three suspected accomplices of the bombers, Russian state TV reported, citing Moscow police spokesman Viktor Biryukov. They are hunting for a 30-year-old man from the Northern Caucasus who was seen on security cameras wearing dark clothes and a black baseball cap, and two women, aged 22 and 45, both ethnic Slavs, who allegedly assisted the man, state TV reported. Investigators believe that the three suspects accompanied the suicide bombers when they entered the metro, the report said. They also believe Chechen rebels may have been behind the deadly strike, although nobody has claimed responsibility. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Moscow would ""restore order by the use of force"" in the region, as part of its ""quest to eliminate terrorists and bandits"" there. But it was harder to root out corruption and clan structures, and to build an education system, he said in remarks televised by Russian state TV from his country residence. ""Those are the things that are much more difficult to handle. But it is our task and we will be dealing with those issues no matter what,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Russian-backed leader of Chechnya wrote in a newspaper article Tuesday that terrorists who target innocent civilians must be ""poisoned like rats."" ""We have always believed and we continue to believe that terrorists must be hunted down and found in their lairs, they must be poisoned like rats, they must be crushed and destroyed,"" Ramzan Kadyrov wrote in the Russian daily Izvestia, a day after the deadly rush-hour attacks in two Moscow subway stations. ""The struggle against terrorists must involve the toughest measures and defeating this evil with only persuasion and educational measures is impossible."" Moscow paused to mourn its dead Tuesday, and flags across the city were lowered to half staff as hundreds of thousands of commuters returned to the transit system. Authorities said the attacks killed at least 39 people -- an increase of one since Monday -- and wounded more than 60 others. Television stations canceled entertainment programming for the day, while some also pulled commercials. After being closed most of the day, both stations that were bombed reopened around 5 p.m. (9 a.m. ET) Monday, said Veronica Smolskaya, a spokeswoman for the Russian Emergencies Ministry. A heavy security presence was apparent throughout the subway network as police officers were visible on train platforms. ""Our preliminary assessment is that this act of terror was committed by a terrorist group from the North Caucasus region,"" said Alexander Bortnikov of the Federal Security Service, in reference to the investigation at one of the blast sites. The current round of the Russia-Chechnya conflict dates back nearly 20 years, with Chechens having laid claim to land in the Caucasus Mountains region.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government announced Monday that it has eased the requirements for orphaned children from Haiti to enter the United States on a temporary basis. The move is being made to ensure they get needed care after last week's earthquake in Haiti, said Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who made the announcement in coordination with the U.S. Department of State. ""We are committed to doing everything we can to help reunite families in Haiti during this very difficult time,"" said Napolitano in a news release. ""While we remain focused on family reunification in Haiti, authorizing the use of humanitarian parole for orphans who are eligible for adoption in the United States will allow them to receive the care they need here."" Napolitano can grant humanitarian parole into the United States to bring otherwise inadmissible individuals into the country for urgent humanitarian reasons or other emergencies. The State Department said earlier Monday it is working with DHS and the Haitian government to process nearly 300 cases of Americans who are waiting to adopt Haitian children. Of those, 200 cases are being accelerated. Twenty-four of those children, whose cases ""were at the very end of the process"" before the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck Haiti nearly a week ago, have departed Haiti and joined their new families after the embassy expedited processing for immigrant visas, said Michele Bond, deputy assistant secretary for American citizen services. Department officials said Sunday that 150 children had already left Haiti, but corrected that number Monday. Officials are reviewing every case individually to see where they are in the process, what actions have been taken in the case and whether the case can be accelerated, Bond said. The department said it will be announcing an adoption plan with travel specifics shortly. If an American adoption case was early in the process, there is no guarantee of an accelerated adoption, Bond said. Examples of being early in the process would be if prospective parents have not been properly vetted; have not been matched with a specific child; or have been matched with a child but the Haitian government is still attempting to prove absolutely the child is an orphan. The State Department is working with DHS to examine the documents in each case and show some flexibility, but this also requires the agreement of the Haitian government, she said. ""It's important to remember that the best interests of the child are at the heart of all this,"" Bond said. ""We want them to be well cared-for."" Families with active adoption cases will be contacted by the department, she said. If a family is in the process of adopting from Haiti and wants information, family members can send an e-mail to askci@state.gov. They will be contacted and told what documents are needed, she said. Prospective families need to know, however, that officials are getting thousands of inquiries. On Sunday, the department received 300 inquiries related to 16 cases, she said. So multiple calls may not be the most efficient way for prospective families to get news about their child. Are you in Haiti and safe? Share your story, photos with CNN iReport . Before last Tuesday's quake, Haiti was home to about 380,000 orphans, according to the United Nations Children's Fund. Many of them may be homeless now, since a number of orphanages are reported to have been among the buildings that were destroyed in the earthquake. The family status of many children may not yet be known, so adoption is not the first solution, Bond said. The focus is on getting the children aid and reuniting them with their families, she said. That total is expected to grow once the dead and missing from last Tuesday's disaster have been accounted for. Some children who lost parents in the quake or were separated from parents are being relocated to the Dominican Republic, a child advocacy group said. iReport: Haitians are looking for loved ones . About 50 orphaned and abandoned children will arrive in the border town of Jimani on Wednesday, Kids Alive International said. The efforts, coordinated with the governments of both countries, will eventually take the children back to Haiti. Some will be reunited with parents who lost communication with their children in the quake's aftermath, the group said. The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs has chartered a plane to pick up about 100 children Monday, spokesman Aad Meijer said Sunday. Dutch Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin over the weekend granted the children entry into the country, although their paperwork, including travel and adoption documents, was incomplete, Justice Ministry spokesman Patrick Mikkelsen said. About 44 of the orphans' adoptions had yet to be approved by a Haitian judge, even though they were matched to Dutch parents, Mikkelsen said. Dutch officials may seek the remaining approvals from Haiti once the children have already settled in the Netherlands, he said. CNN's Melissa Gray, Richard Greene and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","U.S. authorizing ""humanitarian parole"" for eligible orphans, says Department of Homeland chief .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- As he stood before the delegates of the 1964 Republican Convention in San Francisco, California, Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, the party's presidential nominee, said, ""I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."" The delegates, who had booed New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller when he called for the party to respect moderation, were thrilled. Many of Goldwater's supporters were determined to push their party toward the right wing of the political spectrum. They felt that their party leaders, including President Eisenhower, had simply offered a watered-down version of the New Deal. Yet Goldwater soon learned that extremism could quickly become a political vice, particularly to a party seeking to regain control of the White House. The right wing of the Republican Party in the early 1960s inhabited a world that included extremist organizations, such as the John Birch Society, that railed against communism. The Birchers developed a huge network of local activists, reaching more than 100,000 members. They published pamphlets and books and threw their support behind local candidates. Some mainstream conservative outlets depended on supporters who were in these groups. Many right-wing organizations in the South were opponents of civil rights and advocates of racial segregation. During the fall campaign of 1964, President Johnson devastated Goldwater and his running mate, William Miller, by painting them as an extremist duo with close ties to military hawks and racist demagogues. Since Miller, a New York congressman, was known for his close ties to the right, Democrats could charge that Republicans had not balanced their ticket. The ""Daisy"" advertisement had Americans look into the eyeball of a young girl as it reflected the image of a nuclear explosion. Another advertisement showed images of the Ku Klux Klan decked out in their garb and carrying burning crosses. The ads played on statements by the candidates and extremist organizations. The narrator of the KKK ad reminded viewers that Robert Creel, grand dragon of the Alabama KKK, had said: ""I like Barry Goldwater. He needs our help."" Democrats certainly had their extremists as well in the 1960s, as all the discussions about Bill Ayers and the Weathermen in the 2008 campaign reminded us. Yet in the 1960s, the Democratic leadership was removed from these elements of the liberal spectrum. Indeed, radical left-wing activists were primarily revolting against what they saw as the bankrupt leadership of the Democratic Party. They hated Lyndon Johnson even more than they hated Richard Nixon. Always nervous about being tagged by Republicans in a conservative era as too close to socialism, Democrats in Congress and in the White House since the 1960s have tended to distance themselves from fringe elements of the left. Now Republicans are facing the danger of being associated with extremism once again. Last week, following the vote on health care, members of Congress have were the targets of death threats and vandalism. In the final hours of the health care debate, there were reports about how health care opponents uttered racial slurs at Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis, a hero of the civil rights movement, and sexual epithets against Rep. Barney Frank, who is openly gay. Sarah Palin sent out a statement on Twitter that urged followers, ""Don't Retreat, Instead-Reload!"" Palin explained later that her use of those words was not about ""inciting violence,"" but rather about inspiring people to get involved in the political process. Some ugly elements of the Tea Party movement, which have been held in check since the original Washington protest in September, have returned to the  political debate. In the short-term, the Tea Party movement has helped to revitalize the Republican Party. Without question, the kind of energy that has been fostered by the activists associated with these groups has helped Republicans mobilize their supporters and can clearly be helpful at bringing out the vote in the midterm elections. By generating interest in the libertarian and anti-government arguments of conservatism, the movement will help keep conservatives motivated after their loss on health care. It is fair to say that many Americans who support this cause are simply expressing legitimate and deeply held antipathies toward Washington. But extremism is there, and it has flared in the past few weeks. This kind of rhetoric will not produce long-term gains for the Republican Party. Realizing the threat, Republican leaders have begun to disassociate themselves from these elements of the movement. There have been a few voices of condemnation, such as House Minority Leader John Boehner who said ""violence and threats are unacceptable."" Local Tea Party organizers have also stepped forward with words of condemnation. Leaders from the Florida Tea Party said in a letter to President Obama that they stood in ""stark opposition to any person using derogatory characterizations, threats of violence, or disparaging terms toward members of Congress or the president."" These statements are encouraging and strike the right note. Yet Republicans need to follow through by continuing to exert pressure on local organizational leaders to stamp out this kind of activity. They must also avoid contradictory messages, such as the statement of House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, who accused Democrats of ""fanning the flames"" by using the incidents as a ""political weapon."" Cantor had a bullet fired at his campaign office after receiving anti-Semitic threats, but local police described the bullet as random gunfire not directed at his office. The leadership statements must be unambiguous and firm, leaving no question in voters' minds that this is not what conservatism is about. When Ronald Reagan ran for the presidency in 1980, he worked hard to weaken the connections that existed between Republicans and the fringes. He learned the lessons of 1964 and sought to remake a Republican Party that could appeal to mainstream America. Reagan realized that if he did not, the perception of extremism would pose a long-term threat to the party's future. Now Republicans are facing the Goldwater threat once again. At the same time that conservatives have every right to oppose and challenge President Obama's agenda, they must make clear that there are limits and that the kinds of actions that we have seen in recent days are not something that either party will be willing to tolerate in the year ahead. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","In 1964, Barry Goldwater said: ""Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.""

"(CNN) -- Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o will be seeking to win a record fourth African Player of the Year award after being named in the final shortlist of five for the 2009 title. The Inter Milan player will be up against 2006 winner Didier Drogba and the Chelsea forward's Ivory Coast teammate Yaya Toure, Ghana midfielder Michael Essien and Seydou Keita of Mali. Last season Eto'o helped Spanish and European champions Barcelona to an unprecedented treble of titles, along with his former clubmates Toure and Keita. The Inter Milan player also helped Cameroon to qualify for the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa, having missed out on the 2006 tournament in Germany. The 28-year-old previously won the award in 2003, 2004 and 2005, joining George Weah and Abedi Pele as the only players to have triumphed three times. Drogba and his clubmate Essien both also helped their countries to qualify for the World Cup finals, and won the English FA Cup with Chelsea as well as finishing third in the Premier League. Essien has finished in the top three every year since 2005, being runner-up to Frederic Kanoute in 2007. Last year, when he was hampered by injuries, was the only time that Drogba has not figured in the top three since 2003. Keita is the nephew of former winner Salif Keita. The award ceremony will take place on February 25 in Dakar, Senegal, a month after the African Cup of Nations takes place in Angola.","Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o in contention to win record fourth African Player of Year award .

"(CNN) -- When the e-mail arrived the other day, I knew instantly who it was from. At least I thought I did. I recognized the e-mail address. It belonged to Kaye Kessler, an old and treasured friend. When I was a beginning sportswriter, Kessler was the veteran star of the central Ohio paper where we worked. He gave me my first byline, a kindness for which, as I have told him many times, I am forever grateful. He is long retired from daily newspaper work now, living in Colorado, but we write back and forth from time to time. So I was startled by the first words of his note: . ""I'm writing this with tears in my eyes."" He apologized for ""this odd request."" He said he was in the United Kingdom, on a vacation in London with his family. He said they had been robbed, at gunpoint. Everything had been taken: cash, credit cards, cell phone. He seemed embarrassed to have to be asking: . He wondered if I could lend him some money so he and his family could get back home. He promised to refund it as soon as he was back in the U.S. He wanted me to wire it to him: ""Please do get back to me as soon as possible."" And he signed it: ""Kaye."" I felt so bad for him. He's no longer a young man, and I was touched that, in a crisis, he would turn to me. I've never wired money to anyone before, but I started making calls to find out how to do it. Then something started to feel wrong to me. I looked at his e-mail again. The address was his, all right. But there were some sloppy phrases in the note: run-on sentences, lowercase words that should have been capitalized, some incorrect grammar. Kessler was always an extremely careful writer; he was a disciple of the Scripps-Howard Newspapers stylebook. He didn't make mistakes like that. There were other off-key things in the note. He said he was in London with his family; I knew that his wife had passed away 15 years ago. He said that they ""came down here on a short vacation""; those of us from central Ohio would speak of going down to Chillicothe, or going down to Washington Court House, or going down to Cincinnati, but we would never say we had gone ""down"" to London. Still, I thought, he was out of the country, he was in trouble, he was undoubtedly scared, so why was I being such a stickler? He needed my help. Speaking of which, the subject line of the e-mail was: . ""Help!!!"" Kessler was not a guy who ever overused exclamation points. I drafted an e-mail back to him, apologizing for the two questions I was going to ask him. But I knew that there weren't many people in the world, other than the two of us, who would know the answers: . 1. Who was the makeup editor on the sports desk, with the thick glasses? 2. What was the name of the restaurant next to the paper where we would sometimes eat dinner? (In case you're interested: Clarence Young, and Paoletti's.) I was about to send him the e-mail when I decided to do something first. I took some of the phrases from his e-mail to me and ran them through a search engine. Yep. They were part of a scam. People around the country had been receiving them; always, the e-mails had been asking for money to be sent. But how could this be? This was not some e-mail from an address I'd never heard of, saying that a bank in Nigeria had $100 million waiting for me; this was from Kaye Kessler, from his regular e-mail address. Wasn't it? I called his house in Colorado. The phone was busy. For hours. After about four hours, it finally rang through, and he picked up. He was home in Colorado. He had never left. He was all right. Here is what had happened: . Someone had electronically broken into his computer and stolen his e-mail password. The person had then reset the password; Kessler could no longer access his own e-mail account. The person who had stolen the password had gone through Kessler's e-mail address book and started sending out the heartrending requests for money. The only way Kessler knew about it was that some of the recipients had thought to call him. That's why his phone had been busy all afternoon. His friends had read him the letter that had gone out using his name. ""To me, it didn't sound like me,"" Kessler said. ""That line about 'I'm writing this with tears in my eyes' -- I don't tear up very easily."" He was doing his best to get in touch with his e-mail provider. Imagine how he was feeling: Someone was now, in effect, him. The person had access of all his saved e-mails, both ones he had received and ones he had sent. He was trying to remember if he had put credit card or banking information in any of the e-mails. It turns out (and some of you may already know this) that he is hardly the only victim of this scheme, both through e-mails and through social networking sites. Law enforcement officials are well aware of it; after speaking with Kessler, I checked with FBI headquarters in Washington. I wasn't one sentence into reading the Kessler e-mail to Special Agent Jason Pack before he knew exactly what it was. ""This is a new twist that gives these scams more credibility,"" Pack said. ""The way it works is that these guys remotely install malware in your computers; you're almost never aware they have done it."" One way the malware is installed, he said, is when you click on a seemingly innocuous link. Pack said that the malware lets the criminals track your keystrokes from their own computers. That's how they learn your password. Then, he said, they reset it. You can't log on to your own e-mail account anymore. They control it. They go through your address book and write to everyone you know. The people who receive the e-mails think they're from you, that you're in trouble and that you're turning to them for money. Because it's from your e-mail address, their impulse is to help you out by sending it. That's part of the scam, Pack said; the thieves set up a way to have the money wired to them. ""The best advice is not to wire money to anyone until you're absolutely sure,"" Pack said. ""Even if a friend is stuck overseas, there are other ways to reach you than sending an e-mail saying you should wire money. Even if a friend's cell phone has been stolen, there are ways to call you."" The problem, he said, is that friends want to help friends who are in need, and the thieves know it. If the friends write back asking ""Is this really you?"" the thieves, who control your account, send them a note assuring them that yes, the e-mail is legitimate, and say to please hurry up and send the money. Because it's from the familiar e-mail account, and the second note, like the first, is signed with the familiar signature, the friends believe it. The older e-mail scams -- the ones from odd addresses, saying that there are millions of dollars waiting for you, if you will just get in touch with this person you have never met who wants to make you wealthy -- were more analogous to unsophisticated con games. This newer one, though, is like breaking and entering, like home invasion; we increasingly live on our computers, and this scheme allows the criminals to come inside. ""I'm still trying to get back into my account,"" Kessler said the next day when I called him again. The most puzzling part of it, he said -- and the part that should be a concern to the rest of us -- is: . ""I have absolutely no idea how they did it. They were out there writing to everyone I know, saying they were me, and I don't know how they got into my computer in the first place."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene gets an urgent e-mail from an old friend writing, ""With tears in my eyes ... ""

"(CNN) -- The list of relatives Widline Germain has not heard from since Haiti's earthquake seems like a town population in itself. ""When you count our extended family -- the dozens of cousins and aunts and uncles -- there's several hundred of us in Haiti, and we don't know where most of them are,"" she said from her home in Binghamton, New York. On January 11, the day before the magnitude-7.0 earthquake hit, the 25-year-old who recently graduated from SUNY Cortland returned to New York from an extended New Year's holiday in Haiti. Drawing attention to a photo of the Haitian presidential palace lit up with Christmas lights, a tree decorated on its grounds, she said, ""It's like I'm stuck in a horrible dream. The bed I was sleeping in the day before the earthquake is dust."" On Thursday, Germain went through the names of relatives -- she says she has about 400 in Haiti -- whom she and her parents are searching for and whom they know are gone. Elise and Benson Germain and their son Junior Germain, missing. Marie Nerla Nicolas and Wilkense Nicolas, missing. ""I lost a cousin on my father's side.

"(CNN)  -- The race for line honors in the annual Sydney-Hobart yacht race is developing into a thrilling battle between three giant maxi yachts. Neville Crichton's Alfa Romeo was leading after the fleet emerged from the first night, but less than five nautical miles separated the New Zealand 100-footer from British entry ICAP Leopard, skippered by Mike Slade, and four-time line honors winner Wild Oats X1, with Australian Mark Richards at the helm. Light winds have ruled out a realistic chance of any of the contenders breaking the race record set by Wild Oats in 2005 of one day, 18 hours and 40 minutes, but the three-way tactical battle is the closest for several years. The official race Web site www.rolexsydneyhobart.com reported that the three leaders were traveling at just over 11 knots with an east-south east wind as they headed to the finish in the Tasmanian capital. 100 yachts started the 628-nautical mile ""Bluewater Classic"" from Sydney Harbor on Boxing Day and it made for the usual impressive spectacle. Four retirements had taken place by daylight, with Alan Brierty's Limit, representing the organizing club, the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia, going out due to rigging problems. Limit was one of the favorites for overall victory on handicap. The annual race was first held in 1945 and has been hit by severe weather conditions in previous years. In 1998, six competitors died and several boats were lost during a fierce storm on the first night. Two years ago the fleet was also hit by similar conditions and eight yachtsman had to abandon a sinking craft. The forecasted light winds are expected to favor the bigger yachts who can use their giant spinnakers to good effect as they head for Constitution Harbor in Hobart.","Three giant yachts are battling it out for line honors in Sydney-Hobart classic .

"(CNN) -- The South Korean military suspended its search for missing sailors Wednesday because of high winds spawned by stormy weather, the Yonhap News Agency reported. Searchers have been looking for 46 missing sailors from the 1,200-ton ship Cheonan, a naval ship that sank Friday in the Yellow Sea near the maritime border of North and South Korea. Fifty-eight crew members were rescued, and the intense search led to the death of a military diver and the hospitalization of two others. Diver dies in rescue effort near sunken ship . Yonhap reported that divers have injected ""air through a crack in the stem of the 88-meter-long corvette, hopeful that the latter section of the ship, about 45 meters underwater, is holding crew members alive."" But high winds and strong currents have been working against the rescue effort. ""We are temporarily suspending operations. We cannot expect to get near the ship in this condition,"" defense ministry spokesman Won Tae-jae told reporters. Military officials say an explosion tore a hole in the rear of the ship, but the cause of the blast is not known. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has called for a thorough investigation into the cause of the explosion, and the country's defense minister, Kim Tae-young, has raised the possibility that one of the many North Korean sea mines placed during the 1950-53 Korean War could have triggered the blast. He said the military was ""trying its best"" to find survivors and that the cause of the incident will be made public ""at the soonest possible time."" Rescuers find rear section of ship where sailors could be trapped . The navy plans to salvage the vessel, which was carrying missiles and torpedoes, to determine what caused the incident, Yonhap reported. Kim said work to hoist the ship above water could start next week and he said the government is mulling the formation of a fact-finding group to look into the incident. ""We will explain anything to answer questions and address rumors concerning the incident,"" Kim said. ""We have nothing to hide and no reason to hide. So many lives are involved in this case."" Monday evening was the end of a 69-hour window during which rescuers believed the sailors could survive. Divers have knocked on the hulls of different parts of the ship with hammers, but raised no response. Baengyeong Island, the Seoul-administered island near the scene of the accident, is a flash point maritime border area between the Koreas. Given Baengyeong Island's proximity to North Korea, North Korean involvement had been feared, but South Korean officials have continued to play down that scenario. North Korea's official media has yet to mention the incident, according to Yonhap, but accused the United States and South Korea of conducting a maritime drill for the purpose of invading North Korea.","High winds caused by stormy weather delay search for missing South Korean sailors .

"(CNN) -- Protests over media freedom continued in Venezuela Tuesday, a day after two student protesters were killed in separate clashes. Student leaders opposed to cable operators' decision to drop five television channels, including an opposition station, for failure to follow broadcast laws pleaded for an end to the violence at a demonstration in front of the state-run broadcaster. Also Tuesday, the Interior Ministry designated four investigators to look into the shooting deaths of the two students in the western state of Merida. The protests stem from the suspension of cable station Radio Caracas Television (RCTV) and five other stations over the weekend. The stations were pulled from the air because they did not broadcast a speech by President Hugo Chavez, as required by national broadcast laws. Protesters say that the suspension of RCTV, known for its anti-Chavez slant, was provoked by the Chavez government. The Chavez government had already pushed RCTV off of public airwaves in 2007 for similar violations. Then, as now, his opponents saw politics behind the move. The street protests this week produced confrontations with police and Chavez supporters, but have been more widespread. Photos from a weekend national baseball series showed many fans in the crowd wearing red bandanas over their mouths in protest. According to the preliminary investigation, a 16-year-old student was killed during an altercation in Merida Monday night, the state-run Bolivarian News Agency reported. The teen was identified as Yosinio Carrillo Torres. In a second incident in Merida, just before midnight, another youth, Marcos Rosales Suarez, was shot when a group of unidentified gunmen fired into a crowd of protesters. ""We applied the law,"" Chavez said in a speech over the weekend. ""If they don't follow it, they won't be allowed back on the air."" Many press freedom organizations, including the Committee to Protect Journalists, have urged Chavez to allow the stations back on the air right away. ""Pulling a television station from cable and satellite distribution because it chooses not to carry every word uttered by a politician would be laughable if this weren't Venezuela,"" Carlos Lauria, CPJ's senior program coordinator for the Americas, said in a statement. ""The action against RCTV is a disturbing sign of the growing censorship imposed by President Hugo Chavez. The authorities must restore all stations to subscription TV immediately."" The Venezuelan embassy in the United States released a statement challenging the way the RCTV incident was being portrayed, citing ""distortions in U.S. press coverage."" ""Once again an administrative sanction against media outlets that have failed to comply with broadcast laws are painted as measures against the political views expressed in their programming with the goal of attacking the democratic legitimacy of the Venezuelan government,"" the statement said. The cable stations were aware of the laws and chose not to follow them, the Venezuelan government said. ""This is not a discriminatory nor arbitrary measure,"" the statement said. In other developments in Venezuela, the president of state-owned Banco de Venezuela, Eugenio Vazquez Orellana, announced his resignation Tuesday. The resignation follows two other high-level resignations from Chavez's upper ranks. Over the weekend, Venezuela's vice president and defense minister Ramon Carrizalez, and minister for the environment Yuviri Ortega, also resigned.","Protests over media freedom continue in Venezuela a day after two protesters killed .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal must get past big-serving home hope Andy Roddick to have a shot at his first title in 11 months at the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami. The Spanish fourth seed crushed No. 8 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France 6-3 6-2 on Wednesday night to move into the semifinals of the ATP Tour event, which has already seen top-ranked Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray fall by the wayside. Sixth seed Roddick is hoping to repeat his 2004 victory, with the American in similarly dominant form as he dispatched Nadal's 33rd-seeded compatriot Nicolas Almagro 6-3 6-3. Nadal, twice a losing finalist in the southern American city, also reached the last four at Indian Wells two weeks ago on his return from a knee injury. ""When you play against Andy, it always is a big challenge,"" he told the ATP Tour Web site. ""His serve, and he's a very good competitor. He's a winner. Gonna be a very tough match, no? I think I have to play my best tennis to try to win."" Roddick, who has not dropped a set so far, will take on a player who will return to No. 3 in the world rankings next week following defending champion Murray's second-round exit. He reached the final at Indian Wells before losing to Nadal's conqueror Ivan Ljubicic, and was also a semifinalist in Miami in 2008. ""Sometimes when you're not playing well, everything feels a little bit forced. When you play a lot of matches and play a high level, it feels like everything kind of slows down a little bit,"" he told the ATP site. ""Muscle memory takes over a little bit more, and things kind of just happen. So I think I'm at that stage right now. ""Unfortunately with tennis you have to start every day and it's a new one. You're playing well, but you still have to go out and do it every day."" In Thursday's quarterfinals, fifth seed Robin Soderling of Sweden takes on No. 13 Mikhail Youzhny of Russia. Czech 16th seed Tomas Berdych, who knocked out Federer on Wednesday, will play Spanish No. 10 Fernando Verdasco. Meanwhile, Justine Henin will take on fellow Belgian Kim Clijsters in a battle of the former number ones in the semifinals of the women's event in Miami. Henin came from behind to oust second seed Caroline Wozniacki, beating the young Dane 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 6-4. ""I was in a lot of trouble in the first set. It wasn't easy for me to find a good balance of aggression and patience,"" Henin, who was given a wildcard entry, told the WTA Tour Web site. ""It was the kind of match I really needed. Even though I was a bit tired in the end, I was able to win. In terms of my fighting spirit, I proved I can still do it. That was important for me."" Clijsters, the 14th seed, defeated No. 9 Samantha Stosur of Australia 6-3 7-5 as she broke to love in the 11th game and then served out for victory. ""Kim and I grew up together, arrived on the tour at the same time, played well at the same time, retired at the same time, and now we came back at the same time. It's amazing,"" Clijsters said. ""We have never stopped respecting each other. Never, ever, ever. Even if people talk about it, we never had any problems, Kim and I."" Henin has a 12-11 advantage in matches between the two, and the winner of Thursday night's match will take on either American third seed Venus Williams or France's No. 13 Marion Bartoli.","Rafael Nadal faces Andy Roddick in semifinals of Sony Ericsson Open in Miami .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Taking risks in life with her career, and less so at the buffet table, have served Mireille Guiliano and her readers well. The longtime Veuve Clicquot champagne house executive has a wisdom about women, French and otherwise, that's made her one others turn to for advice. The former CEO and best-selling author of ""French Women Don't Get Fat"" and ""French Women for All Seasons"" is now toasting her latest book, ""Women, Work & the Art of Savoir Faire: Business Sense & Sensibility."" Inspired by the young women who've approached her for guidance, Guiliano, who splits her time between New York and Paris, set out to impart what she's learned through her career. ""We have to help each other and help especially the young generation progress and not make the same mistakes we did,"" she said. ""These very difficult times, with the recession and all of that, are actually a positive for women because it gives us a chance to make a difference and show that we are becoming the majority, and we should be treated as such."" CNN sat down recently with Guiliano to discuss the word that hurts the careers of women most, the lessons her mother taught her and any last-minute tips she has to prevent holiday-food overindulgence. Here are excerpts from that interview: . CNN: What exactly is this art of savoir faire you speak of? Guiliano: Savoir faire is a complex set, a mix I should say, of competence, experience and knowing somehow instinctively how to make a decision in a given situation. [It's] creating your own luck and your own opportunities and then making the most of them. CNN: What are the pitfalls you've seen women fall into most often and how do you think they can be avoided? Guiliano: The word that I found comes back over and over again in women's lives when it pertains to their professions is the word fear. They're afraid to make a move. They're afraid to take a job in another state or another city or another country. They're afraid to go for an interview. They're afraid to take a promotion because they might not be up to the job. It comes from our culture, of course, the low self-esteem and low confidence we have, and we have to change that. CNN: How did you not fall into that trap? Guiliano: I used my mother's management principle, which was ironic because my mother didn't go to school and wasn't a businesswoman. But she told me to not be afraid to take risks and to ask myself , ""What is the worst thing that can happen?"" ... When you have that in mind, it gives you a special strength to go ahead, be bold and take the chances. CNN: When you talk about what ""our culture"" has taught women, do you see a difference between American women and French women? And as a Frenchwoman who's lived and worked in New York, what have those differences meant to you? Guiliano: Being and working in America, it's very important to work hard, work smart and work in a certain way. France and Europe has, with the tradition and culture, it's slow-moving and it's not always good. So you have to find a balance between the two. I know that I could have never accomplished what I have if I had stayed in France. CNN: Why do you say that? Guiliano: Because the opportunities were not there. Because it's much more of a man's world. In France, it's still very difficult for women to move ahead and to get into the boardroom or [serve as] CEO and all of that. That has to change. CNN: But what about the need for more balance in American women's lives? Guiliano: Balance -- that's what it's about. At the end of the day, each of us is responsible for our own balance. It starts with the physical because when you are healthy physically, of course, you have more energy, you are more bubbly, you are more productive, you're a happier person. And I believe it's contagious. Your spouse will notice it, your colleagues will notice it, and it will have a tremendous positive effect on the way you work, the way you think and the way you do everything. CNN: Do you have tips on how to achieve this? Guiliano: Find times to relax, to pursue your hobbies, your moments because this is very important. It's unfortunate that sometimes our companies, our bosses don't understand that we need that time. Actually it makes us better workers. We shouldn't feel guilty going for a walk at lunch, as opposed to eating at our desks. Each of us has different ways. For you, it might be five minutes, three times a day, of deep breathing. And for me it might be 20 minutes of yoga in the morning. Or for someone else it might be listening to music or going for a walk. Whatever it is, you need that. CNN: You've also, since your first book, emphasized the importance of eating well. We are in the midst of the most gluttonous season, and though it might be a little late to apply your advice this year around, do you have any last-minute tips for how we can approach holiday parties? Guiliano: You have to apply a few commonsense tricks. At most of those parties, the food is not that great to start with, so don't go hungry and starving. Have two tablespoons of a yogurt or a sliver of cheese or a few nuts or a hard-boiled egg or an apple before you go, so you're not starving, and then try not to be too close to the food. Or look at all the food and pick two or three things you like and just have small portions, small bites. ... People in America, in the Anglo-Saxon world, tend to say ""no bread."" You can have a little bit of everything. It's all about moderation and balance.","Mireille Guiliano, best-selling author, promotes latest book about work life .
Women mentoring other women is key to growth, as is finding balance, Guiliano says .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- In the middle of the street lies a young man who appears to be dead, a pool of blood beneath his head. A large concrete block is next to his shoulder, with shattered pieces of it around him. Blood trickles down the road. Witnesses say he was a thief trying to steal people's money Friday amid the chaos from last week's earthquake. ""This is robbery. He went to rob the people. He went to steal money -- American dollars,"" said a man at the scene who identified himself as Frederic Mano, a Haitian sportswriter. ""The people kill him with the blocks, because the people are angry. They are not hungry, they are angry,"" Mano told CNN's Lisa Desjardins. Gruesome photos from the scene show the man facing up, with his arms out to the side. He is wearing socks but no shoes. A second concrete block is a few feet away from him. Mano said the young man was one of several thousand prisoners who escaped after the earthquake struck. He did not deserve to be killed, Mano says, ""but anyway, he's dead. That is destiny."" Other witnesses gave a similar account. They said they believed the man was a thief and might have been a prisoner who escaped. In Haiti at this time, there is no immediate way to confirm the man's identity. CNN learned of the situation when a Haitian approached a CNN crew. ""Do you want to see an example of citizen justice?"" the man asked. He said a man had been stoned to death by an angry mob. By the time CNN arrived on the scene, the crowd had mostly dispersed. Some people stood on the side, looking at the young man in the middle of John Brown Avenue, which is usually one of the busiest streets in the capital city. There are no operating shops on the street. But there are many vendors selling items from tables or carts. The incident took place near the Champs de Mars, the capital's central plaza that has turned into something of a tent city. It was just a few minutes' walk from CNN's bureau. As the body lay still, some vehicles drove by on each side. CNN's Alec Miran contributed to this report.","Apparently by a mob, man killed near Champs de Mars, the capital's central plaza .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- An investigation commissioned by the city of New York found private gun vendors selling weapons to buyers who admitted not being able to pass background checks, breaking federal law, a report released Wednesday says. It is illegal for unlicensed sellers to sell a gun if there is reason to think the buyer would fail a background check. The sales were made at seven gun shows in Ohio, Tennessee and Nevada, the report says. Hired investigators with hidden cameras were able to purchase guns from private sellers after announcing to the vendors they could not pass a background check, it says. Nineteen of the 30 private sellers the undercover investigators dealt with failed the integrity test, according to the report. The law does not require private unlicensed sellers at gun shows to do background checks on their customers. However, it is a federal felony for unlicensed sellers to sell a gun if they have a reason to believe the buyer would fail a background check. There were no arrests and no lawsuit were filed. ""Closing the gun show loophole has nothing to do with the Second Amendment,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a news conference Wednesday. ""It is basic law enforcement, plain and simple."" He said he does not want to shut down gun shows but to change the law. He cited a 2000 study from the then-Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms saying 30 percent of guns involved in federal illegal gun trafficking investigations are connected in some way to gun shows. The figure is disputed by gun proponents. ""We believe anyone who breaks the law should be arrested, prosecuted and punished,"" the National Rifle Association said in a statement supplied to CNN. ""Instead of working with law enforcement to bring those who may have broken the law to justice, Mayor Bloomberg chose to use this information for a press conference. Bloomberg's priorities are clearly media first, justice later."" But Bloomberg has support from some in Washington, including Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey. ""This investigation reveals how easy it is for criminals and even terrorists to purchase firearms at gun shows and is further proof that we must close the gun show loophole,"" Lautenberg said in a written statement.","Sales made at gun shows in Ohio, Tennessee, Nevada, report says .

"(CNN) -- Some silver screen couples were just meant to end up together: Bogey and Bacall, Harry and Sally, Saturday matinees and ... a cup of low-fat yogurt? If Sony executives get their way, U.S. moviegoers will have the option of healthier snacks with their flicks -- and they won't even have to smuggle them in. In a recent speech at ShoWest -- the country's largest tradeshow for the movie theater industry -- Sony Pictures Entertainment Chief Executive Michael Lynton called upon concessionaires to supplement classic, high-calorie soda, candy and popcorn options with more healthy fare like fruit, granola, yogurt and vegetables with dip. It's ""the right thing to do for our industry, for audiences and for our country,"" said Lynton . Lynton's colleague, Sony's Executive Vice President for Global Communications Jim Kennedy, attempted to combat the causes of child obesity in his previous post with the Clinton Foundation. With this new intiative, he revisits that effort, telling CNN that Sony is asking theaters to accommodate the 60 percent of parents who feel that their overall moviegoing experience would be improved if there were healthier options available at the concession stand. The poll, conducted by Nielsen, also revealed that two-thirds of all moviegoers and three-quarters of parents would be more likely to buy sensible snacks from concession stands (Kennedy says that savvy moviegoers are already sneaking in raisins and granola bars) if they were available for purchase. So what does this means for lovers of king-sized Sno-Caps (400 calories and 11 grams of saturated fat in a 3.1-ounce bag) and fishbowl-sized sodas (400 calories and 26 teaspoons of sugar in a 44-ounce medium iced soda at Regal, or a large at AMC or Cinemark theaters) -- as well as the theaters thatsell popcorn for a 900 percent markup? Kennedy, himself a fan of a popcorn and M&Ms combo (""I go back and forth between the sweet and the salt -- though I wish the M&Ms came in smaller bags."") says neither set will suffer. ""We're not asking theaters to stop selling sodas, and we know most moviegoers are unlikely to change their habits. It just makes sense to offer more choices."" ""It's a new source of income for theaters. They've already innovated by adding digital technology and more comfortable seats. This is consistent with that level of innovation,"" he said. Representatives for The National Association of Theatre Owners and several major chains were unavailable for comment, but according to a SmartMoney.com interview with Warren Miller, senior equity analyst for stock tracking service Morningstar, of every dollar spent at the concession stand, 85 cents is profit. A CNN Money feature from earlier this year finds that a medium bag of popcorn at most chains costs 60 cents, but retails for $6. Theater owners may be slow to invest in fare with a flatter return rate. And just how unhealthy is that much demonized ""buttery"" popcorn topping? According to a December 2009 dispatch from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, one tablespoon of the non-hydrogenated soybean oil used by many chains adds an extra 130 calories, while the same amount of real butter topping pours on 9 grams of saturated fat -- or half a day's limit. The corn itself packs a serious caloric pop. According to that same study, a medium (20 cup) bucket at a Regal theater weighs in at 1,200 calories, with 60 grams of saturated fat and 980 milligrams of sodium, and Cinemark's medium size (a mere 14 cups) serves up 760 calories, 3 grams of saturated fat and 1,240 milligrams of sodium. To put that in perspective, recommended daily intake for an average adult is 2000 calories, 20 grams of saturated fat and 1,500 milligrams of sodium. While, according to Jim Kennedy, the average American visits their local theater four times a year and this might not make a major nutritional dent, many families with children attend nearly once a week. But why are modern day moviegoers in the habit of sitting back and massively snacking in the dark, anyhow? Kennedy says it would probably take a sociologist to figure that out.","Sony movie execs want theater concessionaires to offer fruit, granola, yogurt .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama arrived in Afghanistan on Saturday, met with American forces and, according to a U.S. official, is expected to meet Sunday with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Sen. Barack Obama attends a meeting in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, on Saturday. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee was visiting the Central Asian nation before he embarks on a tour of the Middle East and Europe, a trip aimed at boosting his foreign policy credentials. The trip, which comes four months ahead of the presidential election, marks Obama's first visit to Afghanistan. The trip has been shrouded in secrecy for security reasons, a standard precaution for most U.S. officials in conflict zones. On Saturday, the senator from Illinois traveled to eastern Afghanistan to visit Americans forces under NATO's Regional Command East. Obama is accompanied by Sen. Charles Hagel, R-Nebraska, and Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island. The senators met service members at Jalalabad airfield in Nangarhar province. The governor of Nangarhar province, Gul Agha Shirzai -- formerly the governor of Kandahar province -- also met the senators at the air base. Shirzai and Obama embraced briefly at the end of the meeting.  Watch Obama's visit to Jalalabad » . Upon arrival at Bagram Air Base, the senators were briefed by Maj. Gen. Jeffrey J. Schloesser, commanding general of the Regional Command East. Ahead of the trip to Afghanistan, the senators stopped in Kuwait to visit U.S. troops, Obama campaign spokesman Robert Gibbs said. They left Washington on Thursday. In Kuwait, the senators visited Camp Arifjan for about two hours to meet with U.S. Army Central leadership, take a brief tour of the base and talk with soldiers, U.S. military spokesman Lt. Col. Bill Nutter said. They met in a gymnasium with about 1,000 military members, who cheered jubliantly at their arrival. ""America is unified in being so proud of the extraordinary, brilliant, dedicated professional service that is provided by all members of our armed services,"" he told the military personnel there. Later, Obama shot baskets with some soldiers, drawing cheers with each basket he made.  Watch Obama meet troops and play some hoops » . Soldiers were able to meet the senator on the basketball court later. After, Obama said, ""I am just very proud of the extraordinary work that the troops are doing here in Kuwait; you're providing all the logistical support that's needed for folks in the battlefield and without you this effort would not be successful."" Hagel agreed, saying, ""We're here first to thank the troops."" After the events at the the gymnasium, they met with Lt. Gen. Jim Lovelace, the U.S. Army Central Commander, and senior leadership who gave them an overview of the command, Nutter said. Obama spoke briefly to a pool reporter about his trip just before leaving Washington. ""I'm looking forward to seeing what the situation on the ground is,"" Obama said. ""I want to, obviously, talk to the commanders and get a sense, both in Afghanistan and in Baghdad of, you know, what the most, their biggest concerns are. And I want to thank our troops for the heroic work that they've been doing."" Asked whether he would have tough talk for the leaders of Afghanistan and Iraq, Obama said he was ""more interested in listening than doing a lot of talking."" ""I think it is very important to recognize that I'm going over there as a U.S. senator. We have one president at a time, so it's the president's job to deliver those messages,"" Obama said.  Watch Obama's foreign policy adviser discuss overseas trip » . The fight in Afghanistan has become a more pressing issue on the political radar. Three times as many coalition soldiers and other military personnel have died this month in Afghanistan, compared with Iraq. July's death toll for coalition troops in Afghanistan reached 22 Saturday, after the Friday death of a Canadian soldier was announced. The fight in Afghanistan has become a more pressing issue on the political radar. Three times as many coalition soldiers and other military personnel have died in July in Afghanistan than in Iraq. On Sunday, nine U.S. soldiers were killed in a fight with about 200 Taliban militants in eastern Afghanistan. It was the deadliest attack on U.S. troops in Afghanistan in three years. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Wednesday that U.S. officials are looking for ways to send more troops to Afghanistan, amid the resurgence of violence nearly seven years after the ousting of the Taliban government. Gates said the hope is to send additional forces ""sooner rather than later."" He said the Pentagon is ""working very hard to see if there are opportunities to send additional forces sooner rather than later."" That probably means further reductions in troop levels in Iraq this year to free up forces for Afghanistan.  Watch officials discuss need for more troops in Afghanistan » .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Scores of bodies were found in a mass grave outside the capital city of Port-au-Prince on Friday, a sign of Haitians' desperation three days after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake devastated the impoverished nation. At least 100 bodies were discovered by a CNN crew in one open pit outside Port-au-Prince, with several other pits half-filled or completely covered over with earth, presumably full. The bodies were brought to the site by dump trucks, still accompanied by the remnants of what loved ones used to move them -- pieces of plywood, makeshift shrouds and in one case, an old refrigerator. Elsewhere, bodies were being shoved into old crypts in the city's existing cemeteries. Haiti's Minister of Civil Protection said Friday that the government estimates more than 50,000 people were killed, with the number possibly closer to 100,000. There is not yet an official count of the dead from the quake. Despite the death and destruction, hundreds of people, mostly women, took to the streets in an area of the capital on Friday, singing and chanting as they marched down the street -- a sign of resilience amid huge mounds of rubble. It is not the first time such a display has been observed. Singing and clapping has been heard well into the night in a large square that thousands of people have made home after the earthquake, a CNN crew reported. Meanwhile, a crucial 72-hour window elapsed Friday afternoon -- the time to free those who still may be alive trapped under the remains of buildings. An 18-month-old baby was pulled from the rubble Friday, seemingly unharmed. Get the latest developments in Haiti . Still, those rescued weren't out of danger as hospitals lacked proper supplies to treat some of them. An 11-year-old girl rescued Thursday -- an effort CNN captured on camera throughout the day -- died later that night from her injuries after a first-aid station said it couldn't treat her severe leg wound, her family said. Aid workers continued to trickle into the country Friday, trying to provide water and food to survivors in the capital, which still was being rocked by aftershocks Friday. The quake toppled many of Port-au-Prince's buildings, and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon estimated Friday that it left as many as ""50 percent of buildings in the worst-hit areas damaged or destroyed."" Many of the capital's 3 million people are without access to food, water, shelter and electricity, he said, and crews are working ""to save as many lives as possible."" Haitian President Rene Preval identified three priorities in the recovery effort -- get the government back up and running, clear the roads and sanitize the city of the scores of corpses scattered about its streets, he told U.N. television Friday . There were small signs of progress in food and water distribution by Friday afternoon. A few fire trucks and tankers were seen distributing water. A U.N. distribution center also was set up -- guarded by Bolivian U.N. peacekeeping troops -- where some 10,000 plates of cooked chicken and rice were handed out to a patient line of survivors. Elsewhere, a U.N. food convoy was rushed by dozens of hungry people who clamored to reach the handouts of nutritional biscuits and water-purification tablets. Impact Your World . Ban announced Friday that he will travel to Haiti on Sunday. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also announced Friday that she will visit the quake-battered capital on Saturday, the first major U.S. official to do so. President Obama spoke for about a half-hour with Preval on Friday, pledging the ""full support of the American people,"" including long-term help. The relief effort has been challenged by the destruction and the need for more supplies, the U.N. secretary-general said, citing blocked roads and limited capacity at the capital's one-runway airport. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered a ground stop on all U.S. flights into Haiti Friday because of a lack of ramp space. Haiti aid efforts hampered in critical hours . But, Ban said, aid flights are arriving, and food and medical supplies are beginning to be distributed in Port-au-Prince. ""Although it is inevitably slower and more difficult than any of us would wish, we are mobilizing all resources as fast as we possibly can,"" Ban said Friday, announcing an appeal for $550 million. The United Nations announced Friday that at least 37 of its personnel had died -- 36 with the U.N. mission and one with the World Food Programme. More than 300 are still unaccounted for. U.N. entities in Haiti employ more than 12,000 people. Preval said that he has been touched by the friendship of the American people. He expressed his condolences for the loss of American citizens in Haiti. The State Department has identified at least six U.S. deaths so far and a spokesman said Friday that toll ""will go up."" Despite relative calm, CNN reporters witnessed some sporadic looting and violence Thursday afternoon. Watch how texting is helping to raise money for Haiti . ""If help doesn't come quickly, it probably will (get worse),"" Agnes Pierre-Louis, manager of her family-owned hotel, the Le Plaza in downtown Port-au-Prince.

Ken Keen, deputy commander of the U.S. Southern Command, said forces have not ""seen a great deal of insecurity.""

"(CNN) -- Rescuers in northern California on Thursday found the body of Thomas Bennett, a climber who became trapped on Mount Shasta after falling ill. A seven-member rescue team flew in by helicopter and found the hiker, who had taken shelter Sunday in a snow cave, the Siskiyou County Sheriff's Office said. According to local reports, Bennett and a climbing partner trekked to the summit of the mountain, and on their way down, Bennett became sick and unresponsive. His partner, Mark Thomas, dug a snow cave for Bennett and hiked down, looking for help. Poor visibility and weather dashed attempts to fly in the rescue team Wednesday, the sheriff's office said. On Thursday, the team went up in a Chinook helicopter and was off-loaded near Mount Shasta's summit. They found an avalanche marker that Thomas had left at the snow cave, and the rescuers dug and found that Bennett had died. Bennett's family was notified, and his body was flown off the mountain, the sheriff's office said. An autopsy to determine the exact cause of death was scheduled.","Thomas Bennett had taken ill Sunday after trekking to the summit of the mountain .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama made a previously unannounced visit Thursday to the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, which is dealing with widespread flooding in the region. Obama made the stop after a speech on health care reform in Portland, Maine, and before two fundraising appearances in Boston. At the emergency agency's facility, Obama met with Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, a fellow Democrat and political ally, as well as local officials and workers combating flooding from recent storms. He spoke with workers coordinating the response to the flooding, saying at one point: ""Sounds like at least with some sunshine and sandbags, we can hope for the best."" Family needs boat to get to front door . Later, he began his remarks at the fundraising events by thanking the government workers involved in the flood relief effort. ""It is worth reminding people at a time when folks who work in government don't get enough credit (that) when times are tough, when trouble arises, there are all kinds of civil servants out there who work 24/7,"" Obama said. Patrick has declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard. The worst flooding has occurred in neighboring Rhode Island, where more than 10,000 people were without power and officials said long-term recovery could take months. See first-hand stories from the flood zone . A rainstorm soaked Northeastern states Tuesday, worsening the effects of a major storm that struck two weeks ago. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will visit Rhode Island on Friday to inspect flood damage and meet with state and local leaders to discuss response and recovery efforts. In Connecticut, Gov. Jodi Rell said a state of emergency put in place for the earlier storm remains in effect.

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- An American jailer was the target in the shooting deaths of three people with ties to the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez, Mexican officials said. The jailer, Arthur Redelfs, and his wife, Lesley Ann Enriquez, were killed in a drive-by shooting in Juarez earlier this month. Enriquez was an employee of the U.S. Consulate in that city. Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, 37, the husband of a Mexican employee of the consulate, was also killed at around the same time as Redelfs and Enriquez. A suspect arrested in the case gave new details on the high-profile killings, Mexican federal authorities said in a statement late Tuesday. Ricardo Valles de la Rosa, a member of the Aztecas gang, was arrested Friday based on military intelligence, the statement said. According to federal officials, de la Rosa told interrogators that he was a lookout for the operation that killed the two Americans. He said he got to know many leaders of the Aztecas, a street gang affiliated with the Juarez cartel, while imprisoned in El Paso County, Texas. Although he was born in Juarez, de la Rosa lived in El Paso for 30 years. One of the Azteca leaders called and ordered him to find where consulate employees were having a children's party and to follow the white sport utility vehicle belonging to Redelfs, a jail guard in El Paso, authorities said. The call came days in advance of the killings, the statement said. De la Rosa followed Redelfs' vehicle down a Juarez avenue, until being told to fall back because the shooters had the vehicle in their sights, the statement said. A few moments later, de la Rosa heard shooting. According to federal authorities, de la Rosa drove by the scene and saw that in addition to Redelfs, his wife, who was four months pregnant, was also dead. An infant in the back seat was uninjured. De la Rosa also admitted to involvement in four other homicides involving members or rival gangs, authorities said. No additional arrests have been made in the case. De la Rosa remains imprisoned pending the outcome of the investigation. Ceniceros' wife was not traveling with him, but two of their children in the car were wounded. His white SUV looked very similar to the one Redelfs drove.","Arthur Redelfs and wife, Lesley Ann Enriquez, killed in a drive-by shooting in Juarez .

"(CNN) -- Deaths from pregnancy and childbirth in the United States have doubled in the past 20 years, a development that a human rights group called ""scandalous and disgraceful"" Friday. In addition, the rights group said, about 1.7 million women a year, one-third of pregnant women in the United States, suffer from pregnancy-related complications. Most of the deaths and complications occur among minorities and women living in poverty, it noted. Amnesty International issued a report Friday that calls on President Obama to take action. ""This country's extraordinary record of medical advancement makes its haphazard approach to maternal care all the more scandalous and disgraceful,"" said Larry Cox, executive director of Amnesty International USA. ""Good maternal care should not be considered a luxury available only to those who can access the best hospitals and the best doctors. Women should not die in the richest country on earth from preventable complications and emergencies,"" Cox said in a news release. The report, ""Deadly Delivery: The Maternal Health Care Crisis in the USA,"" notes that the lifetime risk of maternal deaths is greater in the United States than in 40 other countries, including virtually all industrialized nations. The report also noted that severe pregnancy-related complications that nearly cause death -- known as ""near misses"" -- have increased by 25 percent since 1998. Up to 40 percent of near misses are considered preventable with better quality of care, according to a 2007 study in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Minorities, women living in poverty, Native Americans, immigrants and those who speak little or no English are particularly affected, Amnesty International said. ""The thing that really struck us was that these problems hit women of color, low-income, particularly hard,"" said Nan Strauss, researcher and co-author of the Amnesty report. ""But every woman who is going through pregnancy in this country is at risk."" Figures compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, show that black women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy and childbirth than their white counterparts. White women have a mortality rate of 9.5 per 100,000 pregnancies, the CDC said. For African-American women, that rate is 32.7 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies. ""This has been known for a while and no one has a good handle on it,"" said Dr. Elliot Main, chairman and chief of obstetrics at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. ""This is a national disgrace and a call to action. Both numbers are a call to action -- maternal mortality and racial disparity."" The CDC analysis shows that deaths during pregnancy and childbirth have doubled for all U.S. women in the past 20 years. In 1987, there were 6.6 deaths for every 100,000 pregnancies. The number of deaths had climbed to 13.3 per 100,000 in 2006, the last year for which figures were available. A report called ""Healthy People 2010"" by the Department of Health and Human Services says that number should be around four deaths for each 100,000 pregnancies. Statistics for other highly industrialized countries show that the U.S. goal of four deaths for every 100,000 pregnancies is attainable. Great Britain, for example, has fewer than four deaths for each 100,000 pregnancies, Main said. ""Women's health is at risk,"" said Strauss. ""We spend the most, and yet women are more likely to die than in 40 other countries. And that disconnect is what makes it such a problem."" Amnesty International points out that nearly 13 million U.S. women of reproductive age (15 to 44 years old), or one in five, do not have health insurance. Minorities account for 32 percent of all women in the United States but 51 percent of uninsured women, the rights group said. Furthermore, Amnesty International said, one in four women do not receive adequate prenatal care, starting in the first trimester. The number rises to about one in three for African-American and Native American women, the human rights group said. Amnesty International also cited what it called ""burdensome bureaucratic procedures in Medicaid enrollment [that] substantially delay access to vital prenatal care for pregnant women seeking government-funded care."" In addition, the group said, a shortage of health care professionals poses a serious obstacle to timely and adequate care, especially in rural areas and inner cities. In 2008, 64 million people were living in ""shortage areas"" for primary care, Amnesty International said. ""Obstacles to care are widespread, even though the USA spends more on health care than any other country and more on pregnancy and childbirth-related hospital costs, $86 billion, than any other type of hospital care,"" the rights group said. In its call for Obama to take action, Amnesty International said a health care reform proposal before Congress does not address the issue. ""Reform is primarily focused on health care coverage and reducing health care costs, and even optimistic estimates predict that any proposal on the table will still leave millions without access to affordable care,"" said Rachel Ward, one of the authors of the ""Deadly Delivery"" report. ""Mothers die not because the United States can't provide good care, but because it lacks the political will to make sure good care is available to all women,"" said Cox, Amnesty International USA's executive director. Medical professionals and researchers note that although the percentage of maternal deaths is increasing, the overall number still remains low. ""They are low in absolute number sense,"" said Main in San Francisco. ""These are rare events. They serve as a canary in the mine shaft -- tell us that we need to look more carefully at the system of maternity care. Overall, childbirth is very safe."" More of an alarm is not sounded, analysts said, because most practitioners don't see many -- if any -- deaths each year. There is now approximately one death for every 6,000 to 10,000 births, Main said. A typical hospital has about 1,500 births a year, so any hospital can go years without a maternal death, he said. ""It's still, thank heavens, quite rare,"" said Debra Bingham, executive director of California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative. But that doesn't mean there's not a problem, she said. ""When you see trends worsen in such a short period of time, it requires thoughtful examination,"" said Bingham. ""And you can't just dismiss that."" Rivka Gordon, director of strategic initiatives at the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, also believes something should be done. ""It's unacceptable in a resource-rich country like the U.S. that we are seeing maternal- and pregnancy-related deaths trending upward,"" she said. ""We have to look very, very carefully at this.""

"(CNN)  -- Police say it now appears that a southern California family missing since early February voluntarily left for Mexico. But the apparent inactivity of bank cards, credit cards and cellphones since they vanished continues to baffle police and trouble family members. ""I've been in this business for over 35 years but never seen anything like this,"" Lt. Dennis Brugos of the San Diego Sheriff's Department told CNN. ""This whole thing doesn't add up,"" Michael McStay, the brother of Joseph McStay, said in a phone interview. ""If they left, I don't need to know why. The bottom line is, I need to make sure they are OK."" Information gathered on the home computer of Joseph and Summer McStay indicates the couple was making travel inquires about Mexico on the Internet a week before they were reported missing, Brugos said. ""It had to do with travel in Mexico with children and whether you needed to have passports for children,"" Brugos said. ""It looks as if there were some planning."" The McStays and their children, Gianni, 4, and Joseph, 3, have not been seen or heard from since February 4. The McStays' two dogs were found unattended, without food or water, in the San Diego-area home, investigators said. McStay's brother, who initially feared the family might have been kidnapped, still believes they are in danger. ""They can't fend for themselves,"" he said. ""If something did happen in Mexico, I would not be able to live with myself."" A sport utility vehicle belonging to the McStays was found abandoned on February 8 two blocks from the San Ysidro border checkpoint into Mexico, authorities said. Surveillance video taken that evening appears to show the family ""casually"" walking into Mexico, sheriff's investigators said. Brugos believes the four individuals seen on the security footage bear a strong resemblance to the missing family, including the hats the children wore and the woman's boots and coat. The sheriff's office met Tuesday with the department's liaison detectives in Mexico, he added. ""There is nothing to suggest any criminal involvement in their disappearance, but we would like to find the family,"" Brugos said. Michael McStay, who said he will be handing out fliers at the San Ysirdo checkpoint and canvassing the stores, is desperate for any information. ""Who knows what happens once you leave U.S. soil?"" he said. ""We've all seen the news about what goes on down there. Even if they left voluntarily, were they going down for a weekend and never made it back? What would compel someone to go? I have no idea. If they left it would have had to be something heavy. ""It just doesn't make sense."" Joseph McStay is 5 feet, 9 inches tall and weighs 175 pounds. He has brown hair and brown eyes. Summer McStay, also known as Lisa Aranda-Martelli, is 5 feet, 5 inches tall and 115 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes. Anyone with information on the whereabouts of the McStay family is urged to contact Sgt. Dave Martinez of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department at 858-565-5200. Anonymous calls can be made to 888-580-8477.

"London, England (CNN)  -- A Canadian graduate student has found the only known printed copy of Haiti's Declaration of Independence, tucked away in Britain's National Archives, researchers said. Duke University student Julia Gaffield found the eight-page pamphlet, dated January 1, 1804, while researching Haiti's early independence, Duke said in a statement Thursday. The discovery sheds light on the early history of Haiti and the relations it had with its Caribbean neighbors at the time, Gaffield and Duke Professor Deborah Jenson said. Gaffield is researching early 19th-century Haiti for her doctoral dissertation in history, Duke said. She did research in France, Haiti and Jamaica, where she saw a handwritten copy of the declaration in the papers of Jamaica's governor at the time, George Nugent. It indicated there was a printed version somewhere, but it wasn't enclosed. In late January, Gaffield went to London for research at the National Archives, where she found the printed declaration. ""I wasn't specifically looking for it, but I had an eye out for it because I knew it was missing,"" Gaffield said. ""We figured there was an original somewhere, but didn't know if it still existed."" The declaration had not been misplaced and had been in the archives for a long time, Gaffield said. The period had simply not been studied in detail, and Gaffield said she figures people who saw the document before probably didn't realize what they had. Gaffield said she was thrilled by the discovery, but had to wait until the end of the day to notify her advisers at Duke, in North Carolina. ""The archives are not the place to make a big scene,"" she said. Haiti's declaration is only the second of its kind in the world, the first being the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson and others, Duke said. The pamphlet, written in French, has three distinct parts, the National Archives said. The first two pages are titled ""Liberte ou La Mort,"" which translates to ""Freedom or Death,"" in which the generals of the Haitian army sign their names to an oath swearing to renounce forever the French yoke or die rather than live under its domination. Next, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the general-in-chief, addresses the citizens of Haiti in an impassioned defense of independence and the destiny of the nation. On the final page, Haitian army generals proclaim Dessalines governor-general for life and swear to obey without question laws issued under his authority. ""To bring this document to light in Haiti's darkest hour may be seen as a symbol of renewal and rejuvenation, helping Haiti rebuild its national spirit following the recent earthquake,"" said Ian Wilson, president of the International Council on Archives. ""Julia's achievement in recognizing the significance of this printed document deserves high recognition."" Oliver Morley, the acting chief executive of the National Archives, said they were pleased to play a role in the discovery. ""It's incredible that the long search for this important document should finally end at the National Archives,"" Morley said. ""This declaration sent to the British government by Haiti's first independent leader is of great historical importance to both Haiti and the British people, and provides unique insight into the first successful slave rebellion of modern times."" Jenson, a professor of French studies at Duke who has researched the U.S. publication of Haiti's independence documents, said the discovery also shows Haiti had a fully functional printing apparatus at every moment of the new nation's independence. Researchers had looked for the printed declaration before, without success, said Laurent Dubois, a Duke professor of French studies and history and one of Gaffield's advisers. In 1952, Haiti asked intellectual Edmond Mangones to find an original or printed copy so it could be displayed for the nation's 150th anniversary, Dubois said. Mangones searched in many archives in Haiti and elsewhere before writing with exasperation that all his searching had been ""in vain,"" Dubois said. ""It is really beyond belief,"" Mangones said at the time, ""that not even a copy of the original printed version has been found in France, or in England, or in the United States."" Gaffield's discovery, Dubois said, ""has finally changed that."" Documents from Haiti's early history have not been well preserved and are scattered in various places, said Dubois, who is working with other historians to rehabilitate Haiti's archives after the January 12 earthquake. Dubois and Gaffield consulted Patrick Tardieu, a noted Haitian archivist at Brown University, to confirm the document's authenticity. ""I was so happy to find out it was true,"" Tardieu said. ""It is an important document, and its discovery is important news for Haiti's scholarly community and more broadly for the people of Haiti."" Gaffield said she hopes the discovery will remind historians, Haitians and the world about the early history of the only country in the Western Hemisphere where slaves successfully revolted to gain national independence. ""The Haitian Revolution was of immense consequence to Jamaica and other colonies in the Caribbean, as well as to the United States,"" Gaffield said. ""This find is further evidence that there was contact and negotiations going on between them. Haiti was not isolated after independence and it played a complicated role in a world based on colonialism and slavery.""","Student Julia Gaffield found document in Britain's National Archives .

"(CNN) -- The father of a Marine whose funeral was picketed by the Westboro Baptist Church says an order to pay the protesters' legal costs in a civil claim is nothing less than a ""slap in the face."" ""By the court making this decision, they're not only telling me that they're taking their side, but I have to pay them money to do this to more soldiers and their families,"" said Albert Snyder, whose son, Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder, was killed in action in Iraq in 2006. Members of the fundamentalist church based in Topeka, Kansas, appeared outside Snyder's funeral in 2006 in Westminster, Maryland, carrying signs reading ""You're going to hell,"" ""God hates you"" and ""Thank God for dead soldiers."" Among the teachings of the church, which was founded in 1955 by pastor Fred Phelps, is the belief that God is punishing the United States for ""the sin of homosexuality"" through events such as soldiers' deaths. Margie Phelps, the daughter of Fred Phelps and the attorney representing the church in its appeals, also said the money that the church receives from Snyder will be used to finance demonstrations. But she also said that the order was a consequence of his decision to sue the church over the demonstration. ""Mr. Snyder and his attorneys have engaged the legal system; there are some rules to that legal engagement,"" said Phelps, a member of Westboro who says she has participated in more than 150 protests of military funerals. ""They wanted to shut down the picketing so now they're going to finance it,"" she said. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday ordered that Snyder pay more than $16,000 in costs requested by Westboro for copies of motions, briefs and appendices, according to court documents. In a motion filed in October, Snyder's lawyer, who is representing him for free, asked the court to dismiss the bill of costs, or, alternatively, reduce the 50-cent fee per page or charge Snyder only for copies that were necessary to make their arguments on appeal. ""We objected based upon ability to pay and the fairness of the situation,"" Sean Summers said. The mostly pro-forma ruling is the latest chapter in an ongoing legal saga that pits privacy rights of grieving families against the free speech rights of demonstrators, however disturbing and provocative their message. Snyder's family sued the church and went to trial in 2007 alleging privacy invasion, intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy. A jury awarded the family $2.9 million in compensatory damages plus $8 million in punitive damages, which were reduced to $5 million. Westboro in 2008 appealed the case to the 4th District, which reversed the judgments a year later, siding with the church's claims that its First Amendment rights had been violated. ""The protest was confined to a public area under supervision and regulation of local law enforcement and did not disrupt the church service,"" the circuit court opinion said. ""Although reasonable people may disagree about the appropriateness of the Phelps' protest, this conduct simply does not satisfy the heavy burden required for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress under Maryland law."" The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case to address issues of laws designed to protect the ""sanctity and dignity of memorial and funeral services"" as well as the privacy of family and friends of the deceased. The justices will be asked to address how far states and private entities such as cemeteries and churches can go to justify picket-free zones and the use of ""floating buffers"" to silence or restrict speech or movements of demonstrators exercising their constitutional rights in a funeral setting. Both Phelps and Snyder's attorney said they were surprised that the 4th District chose to weigh in on the issue of legal costs when they could have waited until after the Supreme Court hearing. Phelps believes the ruling bodes well for her side. ""It is a good harbinger of the fact that the Supreme Court will remind this nation that you don't have mob rule. The fact that so many people hate these words does not mean you can silence or penalize them. That's supposed to be the great liberty that we congratulate ourselves on protecting in this nation. We strut all around the world forcing people to give all the liberties we supposedly have,"" she said. Phelps anticipated that a Supreme Court ruling in the church's favor would be unpopular, but she said Westboro's members viewed the potential outcome in Biblical terms. ""When the Supreme Court unanimously upholds the 4th Circuit, it's going to put this country in a rage, and we will be expelled,"" she said. ""But whenever it was time for an epic event in the Bible, the thing that happened right before is the prophets were removed from the land, and that's what's going to happen to us. ... We're going to sprint to the end of this race."" Snyder claims he is unable to pay any legal costs in the case and is attempting to raise funds on his son's site, http://www.matthewsnyder.org/. He is equally optimistic that he will prevail before the Supreme Court. ""The American people keep my spirits lifted a lot and give me hope. I think most of the country is on my side on this issue,"" he said. ""Too many people have died to protect our rights and freedoms to have them degraded and spit upon like this church does.""

"(CNN) -- He's the new Billy Mays. But Anthony Sullivan doesn't shout, and he didn't exactly jump at the chance to take up the mantle of the famous TV pitchman. Nine months after the ubiquitous king of direct-response TV commercials was found dead in his Florida home at age 50, Mighty Brands has announced that Sullivan will take Mays' place as product spokesman. When Mighty Brands initially approached him with the idea, Sullivan, 41, was hesitant at first. ""They came to me and said, 'You guys were great friends' -- so it was tough."" After Mays' family signed on to the idea, ""it came down to a question of, if I didn't do it, who else was going to do it?"" For those who haven't watched any TV in the past decade, the phrase ""Hi, Billy Mays here for Oxi Clean!"" made him a household name. Mays was the ""bearded, lovable rogue,"" said Sullivan. Mays built a trademark with his shouting style and blue shirt and khaki pants. Sullivan was the mastermind behind those ads, acting as director and producer after competing against Mays for years in the cutthroat world of TV pitchmen. To his credit, Sullivan -- like Mays -- has sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of products -- many of them you've likely seen on TV. But before Sullivan moved countless Stick Up Bulbs, Smart Choppers, One Sweeps and Swivel Sweepers -- his first TV sales pitch almost happened by mistake. In 1993, Sullivan stopped by the cable shopping channel HSN to sell a product called the SmartMop. At first, while chatting informally with a show host about the mops, Sullivan was unaware that the robotic cameras were trained on him. ""Are we on?"" he asked, already realizing the answer to his question. ""I just sort of froze for half a second, and I thought sh--, I just gotta pitch."" Nine minutes later, the phone lines exploded. After 22 minutes, Sullivan had sold 5,000 SmartMops. Not bad for his first time at bat. Eventually, Mays also joined HSN and the two men ""lit up that network"" for the next six years, said Sullivan. Different styles . The two pitchmen wield very different styles. As Sullivan describes it, Mays' secret weapon was himself and his bearded pitchman character to grab viewers' attention. Sullivan, on the other hand, mesmerizes viewers with his southwestern English accent. He describes his style as honing in on viewers and focusing on the benefits of the product. Before earning U.S. citizenship, a younger Sullivan cut his teeth in the English street markets of London, drawn to the fast-talking Artful Dodgers who were as much entertainers as they were hucksters and pitchers. ""I was always amazed."" The London pitchmen -- following a centuries-old tradition in places like Petticoat Lane, Portobello Road and Blackbushe Market -- knew they'd won over a crowd when they'd see a husband nudge a wife acknowledging they'd been entertained. ""They'd say, 'You know, we watched this guy pitch his heart out and even though we really don't need what he's selling, he made us laugh.' They'd give you a 10-pound tip and take whatever it was we were selling. And I really enjoyed that part of the business."" Sullivan says street pitching has become a virtual lost art now because of eBay and the Internet. ""It was just poetic, these pitches,"" recalled Sullivan, quoting some of the riffs that still echo across the years. 'Ladies and gentlemen, here's where we sort the needy from the greedy, the spiers from the buyers, the ones that trust me from the ones that don't.' It was just this poetry -- if you will. That's where poetry meets sales."" In the world of TV pitches, poetry meets sales with phrases like, ""For zest, it's the best!"" and ""That's cash in the trash!"" As Sullivan says, the best pitchers demonstrate their products -- and the bigger the demonstration, the better. He's been set on fire and shared a kitchen with a grizzly bear. ""Some pretty crazy stuff."" This month Sullivan spent a day being dunked in the Florida intercoastal waterway. Sullivan went parasailing in a suit wrapped in a product called Mighty Thirsty, plunging into the water to demonstrate its absorbency. ""It was a strange moment, but only Billy could have got me there."" Because of his street market background -- or perhaps in spite of it -- Sullivan admits that some think his sales approach is more sophisticated than Mays' boisterous, bellowing banter. ""I think we're both relentless."" Mays died shortly after he and Sullivan wrapped the first season of Discovery Channel's reality based TV series PitchMen. According to a Hillsborough County, Florida, autopsy report issued in August, Mays died from a heart attack -- with cocaine listed as a contributing factor. Choosing to move forward after Mays' death, Sullivan and Discovery are producing a second season of PitchMen without casting a replacement for Mays. The refreshed program will focus more on inventors who pitch their products to be accepted for a Sullivan TV ad campaign. ""I think Billy would have slapped me on the side of the head if I didn't continue with it,"" said Sullivan. 'Life's a pitch and then you buy it' Mays lives on in thousands of YouTube videos, where he's often heard saying, ""Life's a pitch and then you buy it."" Everyone is always selling or buying something, whether they realize it or not, said Sullivan. ""When your child's applying for college -- it's no different from pitching. You're pitching yourself, your services, your family. You're selling your house, you're buying a house. Everyone is involved in the buying or selling process. Even if you're buying -- you're being sold."" How does Sullivan make the sale? ""I think you have to be passionate. You have to be sincere. You have to really believe in what you sell. You have to do it with a smile. I often think that if you can make someone laugh while you're selling -- and disarm them with a little bit of humor -- it goes such a long way."" But that's not all, as the pitchmen often say. There's more to this story. Lately, Mays' 23-year-old son, Billy Mays III, has been working at Sullivan's production company. Right now, the 23-year-old musician isn't interested in following his father's path as a pitchman. ""He has his father's soul, but he's his own man in his own way,"" said Sullivan. Even as Sullivan hawks Mays' former brands, the Mays family will continue to get a cut of the proceeds from sales. ""Every time I say, 'Hi, Anthony Sullivan here,' I always think it should be 'Hi, Billy Mays here,' the pitchman confides.""But the bottom line is, he's not here. So I'm honored to be carrying on his legacy a little bit.""","TV pitchman Anthony Sullivan replaces the late Billy Mays as product spokesman .

"(CNN) -- Chechen rebel leader Dokku Umarov claimed that he personally gave orders to attack the Moscow subway this week, according to a Chechen rebel Web site. Kavkaz Center, a Web site that regularly carries messages from the rebels, released a video in which Umarov said he was behind the Monday attacks. The attacks were revenge for what Umarov called a ""massacre conducted by the Russian occupants against the poorest residents of Chechnya and Ingushetia,"" the Web site says. According to the site, the video was taped the same day as the attacks. The incident Umarov referred to is a February special operation by Russian forces, after which there were accusations of Russians killing innocent civilians. In the video, Umarov said the victims were simply gathering garlic to make a living. According to Russian officials, at least four civilians were killed during the special operation near the Ingushetian village of Arshty on February 11. After investigating the incident, the officials admitted that it was ""the season to collect wild garlic"" and civilians may have been doing just that despite requests for ""evacuation"" from the area. The president of Ingushetia, Yunus-Bek Evkurov expressed condolences to relatives of the deceased and provided material support in the amount of 50 thousand rubles (about $1,700) for each family. The president noted that during the raid 18 militants were also killed. The attacks in Moscow, in which two female suicide bombers killed at least 39 people and wounded more than 60 others, were legitimate retribution for what happened in Chechnya, Umarov said in the video. He also promised ""new acts of vengeance"" in Russia. Russians will no longer be able to simply observe the battles in the Caucasus, Umarov said. ""Therefore, the war will come to your streets, and you will feel it for yourselves and with your own lives,"" he said in the video. Monday's blasts tore through the Lubyanka and Park Kultury stations in central Moscow -- the female bombers detonating their explosives about 40 minutes apart, starting just before 8 a.m. (12 a.m. ET). On Tuesday, Russian police released photographs of the two women suspected of carrying out the attacks. Special services were also seeking three suspected accomplices of the bombers, Russian state TV reported, citing Moscow police spokesman Viktor Biryukov. They were hunting for a 30-year-old man from the Northern Caucasus who was seen on security cameras wearing dark clothes and a black baseball cap, and two women, aged 22 and 45, both ethnic Slavs, who allegedly assisted the man, state TV reported. ""Our preliminary assessment is that this act of terror was committed by a terrorist group from the North Caucasus region,"" said Alexander Bortnikov of the Federal Security Service, in reference to the investigation at one of the blast sites. The current round of the Russia-Chechnya conflict dates back nearly 20 years, with Chechens having laid claim to land in the Caucasus Mountains region. Thousands have been killed and 500,000 Chechen people have been displaced by the fighting. Chechnya is located in the North Caucasus region of Russia between the Black and Caspian seas.","Chechen rebel leader claims he ordered attack on Moscow subway .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The FBI did not participate in harsh interrogations of suspected terrorists detained in Guantanamo Bay, Afghanistan or Iraq, said a Justice Department investigation released Tuesday. An April 2007 photo shows a room at Guantanamo Bay that had been used for interrogations. The investigation also concluded that the bureau generally reported potentially illegal actions by the CIA and Defense Department. In ""only a few instances"" did FBI agents use techniques that were not approved by FBI policies, according to the report by Inspector General Glenn Fine. Fine criticized the FBI for being slow in developing and distributing its interrogation policy to its interrogators. Though the the FBI decided to avoid harsh techniques in August 2002, the decision was not put in writing until 2004, when the bureau also put in writing that the harsh techniques used by other agencies should be reported to FBI superiors. The 2002 decision by FBI Director Robert Mueller was that the bureau would adhere to restrictions used in interrogations of detainees within the United States. Those techniques prohibit coercion, abuse or threats. The policy is based on the belief that building a rapport with prisoners is the best way to gain intelligence, according to Tuesday's report. The FBI issued a statement saying it is ""gratified"" by the report's findings, and Mueller promised that the bureau will continue to use ""rapport-building techniques in interviews"" of detainees. The inspector general's investigators interviewed almost all of the more than 1,000 FBI employees who were deployed to one or more military zones between 2001 and 2004, the report said. The vast majority of the agents adhered to FBI policies and separated themselves from other agencies' interrogators who were using techniques that the FBI didn't approve of, the report said. The report listed ""a few incidents"" that ""clearly would not be permissible for FBI agents to use in the United States,"" including isolating a prisoner from human contact and participating in an interrogation in which detainees were ""given a 'drink of water' in a forceful and inappropriate manner."" It also listed incidents that were not ""clear violations of FBI policy"" but which should have raised questions. Some agents participated in a program of subjecting detainees to frequent cell relocations, the report said. In another case, two agents joined in an interview in which a detainee's hands and feet were ""short-chained"" close together for several hours, during which time the prisoner urinated on himself. FBI agents reported that non-FBI interrogators engaged in sleep deprivation or sleep disruption techniques, which include using bright lights, loud music and extreme temperatures ""to keep detainees awake or otherwise wear down their resistance."" No FBI agents witnessed the abuses at Abu Ghraib, the U.S. Army-operated Baghdad correctional facility where some prisoners were physically and sexually abused, sparking outrage when photos of the abuse became public. However, the report said, an FBI agent said he witnessed a naked Abu Ghraib prisoner forced to roll between rows of cells. He did not report the incident because he didn't know whether it was an acceptable technique. The report also said FBI personnel did not witness the controversial waterboarding technique, which the CIA has confirmed was used on three prisoners. The FBI protested when it witnessed techniques used by the military and the CIA in questioning top terror suspects Abu Zubayda and Yousef al-Qarani, according to the report. In one instance, an agent objected to using a snarling dog to interrogate al-Qarani. Despite some criticism, the inspector general offered the FBI modest praise at the conclusion of his three-year investigation. ""We believe that while the FBI could have provided clearer guidance earlier, and while the FBI could have pressed harder for resolution of concerns about detainee treatment by other agencies, the FBI should be credited for its conduct and professionalism in detainee interrogations in the military zones in Guantanamo Bay, Afghanistan and Iraq, and in generally avoiding participation in detainee abuse,"" the report concluded. The inspector general's investigation did not quiet the FBI's chief critics. The American Civil Liberties Union said FBI leaders failed to uphold their obligation to ""bring an end to the abuse and application of illegal interrogation methods."" Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, chairman of a subcommittee that oversees the FBI, criticized then-Attorney General John Ashcroft and his deputy, Larry Thompson. Nadler said FBI agents' objections to certain interrogation methods ""fell on deaf ears."" ""The admirable actions taken by those brave FBI agents willing to speak out were undermined by those who led them,"" he said.","Justice Department investigation finds FBI generally acted responsibly .

Investigators find ""only a few instances"" of unapproved techniques by FBI .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- What started as a college a cappella pastime became a ticket to the big time for 10 Indiana University graduates. Straight No Chaser broke up years ago, but success on YouTube brought the band back together. Last year a member of the disbanded group -- called Straight No Chaser -- posted a video of a quirky 1998 performance of ""The 12 Days of Christmas"" on YouTube. It got more than 8 million hits. And one of the people watching was Craig Kallman, chairman and CEO of Atlantic Records. Kallman summoned a couple of the troupe members to Los Angeles, where he offered them a record deal. Straight up. The boys (now men, of course) got back together and within 10 months -- and almost 10 years after graduation -- had a debut album neatly tied with a bow. And you thought your college reunion was exciting.  Watch Straight No Chaser blend their voices » . ""Holiday Spirits"" mostly features festive covers such as ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" and ""Silent Night,"" all sung in the a cappella tradition but with creative and entertaining tweaks. (They do a stirring Christmas-infused rendition of Toto's ""Africa."") Members of Straight No Chaser sang for CNN in New York recently, talked about their surprising career turn and where it leaves their day jobs. CNN: What is it like then to actually become a YouTube sensation? Randy Stine: Well, [Jerome] got recognized on the street in Hong Kong. Jerome Collins: A person walked up to me and said, ""Hey, I know this may be out of line, but you look like this guy on this video I just saw."" I called [Randy] and I was like, ""We officially made it. We're being recognized in Hong Kong by some random person on the street."" So it was kind of cool, and that's when I knew that [it] was on a bigger scale than we thought. CNN: What went through your mind when you got the call from Atlantic Records? Stine: I was half believing it was a prank. I got the call from Craig, and while I'm talking to him the first time, I'm on the computer Googling his name to read his bio. It was just kind of a dream phone call. And I kept thinking, ""Is this really happening?"" It was pretty amazing. CNN: You all have day jobs, don't you? Stine: Yeah. I was actually in Chicago doing IT sales, wishing I was still in music. We're all spread across the country. We've got guys in Chicago, Vegas, Atlanta, here in New York. Jerome was actually in Hong Kong when all this started, and he moved back from Hong Kong to be a part of this. CNN: What were you doing in Hong Kong? Collins: I was doing a festival of ""The Lion King,"" and I was Simba. We have one guy selling medical devices, another guy a reporter for ABC, one guy working at a bank, another guy a teacher. ... You name it, we have it. CNN: And how do you arrange rehearsing or performances if you are scattered throughout the country? Stine: That's probably one of the big challenges. We all have to fly in from whatever city we're in to New York, to Chicago, L.A., wherever we have to meet up to rehearse or record. But when we get together it's like no time has passed. CNN: Are you going to keep your day jobs? Collins: There's no chance that I'm going to be keeping my day job. I obviously gave it up to try and do this so I know for a fact that I'm not going to be going back. I hope they didn't hear that. This is it. This is what I dreamed to do as a kid. This is what I want my day job to be. Stine: I quit my job in July. I had to get enough time off to record but couldn't do it. I have one shot at this. I know there are tons of other musicians out there who would cut off a limb to have this opportunity so I couldn't pass it up. Collins: We're going to force the other guys to make sure they quit their jobs. With the scheduling and the touring some of them may not have a job to go back to. So that's what we're hoping may happen. CNN: That's what you're hoping? You're hoping that they will get fired? That's nice! Stine: Yeah, we'll make the phone calls on their behalf. Like, ""he's not coming into work today"" [Stine and Collins laugh.] . CNN: Now that you have your debut album in the can, are you thinking ahead to other projects? Collins: Well, that's the whole point. We hope that that momentum -- not only with YouTube, but with our album -- keeps going so we can get right back in the studio and come out with some fresh new music that's not holiday. We don't want to pigeonhole ourselves. We do all genres, all types of music. CNN: Part of your appeal seems to be that you don't really take yourselves too seriously, do you? You have a lot of fun with it. Collins: It's really fun singing with your best friends onstage. We have fun. Outside of this business, we are still friends; we all go do things together; we all still hang out. We still fight like brothers. So essentially ... I hope that never changes because that's what made us who we are today. CNN: What about your personalities ... have you all changed a little since you were at school together? Stine: I think all of us are pretty much the same, just maybe more opinionated. Collins: Some of us have wives. That's the only thing that's changed. CNN: Why are you called Straight No Chaser? Stine: We basically came up with the name from Thelonious Monk, his jazz album and song. And we just thought it really tied in well to our mentality of voices, no instruments. And of course it ties in to college and visiting the bars late at night.","Straight No Chaser formed at Indiana University in 1990s .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- A Spanish fishing boat repelled an attack by suspected pirates Sunday morning in the Indian Ocean off the African coast, Spain's ministry of defense said. The Spanish Ortube Berria fishing vessel was in waters southwest of the Seychelles when pirates aboard two skiffs opened fire on the ship with light arms and a grenade shot from a launcher, according to a defense ministry news release. The Seychelles are a group of islands located north of Madagascar and southeast of Somalia, whose coastal waters have become known for piracy. The attack happened at about 5:40 a.m., the ministry said. A private security company aboard the fishing vessel returned fire and thwarted the attack, the statement said. No one was injured, and the ship did not suffer any material damage. Following the attack, the Ortube Berria was sailing southward away from the area, the defense ministry said. Pirates have captured more than 50 ships this year off Somalia and are currently holding 11, according to information from Spanish Defense Minister Carme Chacon. Earlier this month, the crew of another Spanish fishing boat, the Alakrana, was released by Somali pirates after 47 days in captivity. The Alakrana was hijacked off the coast of Somalia. On Sunday, the commander of a European Union anti-piracy operation, deployed a Portuguese frigate based in the area toward the site of the attack, Spanish authorities said. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","Spanish fishing boat repels attack by suspected pirates in Indian Ocean off African coast .

"(The Frisky) -- I'm sitting alone in my apartment on a rainy night. I'm restless, mildly bored, and, yes, I'll admit it, but please don't tell anyone ... lonely. It's days like this that I'm sure that there's no more love in store for me -- all of the epically momentous possibilities must have already passed me by. Somehow I blinked and missed them. It's in moments like this that I allow myself the small indulgence of thinking about Sebastian. Our story had all of the makings of a great love story. Once upon a time we met one evening in a dark, crowded party. He told me I was beautiful. I was young enough for him to appear larger than life. We kissed on the sidewalk in the rain. I fell hard for him -- hard like scrape-me-off-the-floor-with-a-spatula hard. But we were wrong for each other in every way. We were young, immature, and troubled. It ended tragically -- Sebastian stood me up on a cold, snowy New Year's Eve and the two of us never spoke again. I went on with my life. I wonder what Sebastian is doing right now. I wonder if I will ever love anyone that way again -- with an open heart. I decide to cruise the internet for inspiration -- narrowly avoiding the temptation to do a Google search of Sebastian's name. The intention of my search? To remind myself that love really exists. A tall, existential order for sure, yet a valid one. I practice it often. On the street, on the subway. Every time I encounter a seemingly happy couple I say to myself, ""See you bitter old hag, people fall in love all the time."" I find the kind of cinematic headline I'm looking for: ""Gulf War Pen Pals Get Married After Facebook Encounter 19 Years Later."" Touché. As a teenager, Jamie Benefit decided to reach out to the troops during the Gulf War. She addressed a letter of support and encouragement to ""Any Soldier."" Jamie's anonymous letter found its way into the hands of 19-year-old soldier Jeremy Clayton. Jamie and Jeremy continued to write each other for the duration of the war, to exchange stories and keep their minds off of the scary worlds around them. After the war ended, the two lost touch. Jamie wrapped up her letters in a patriotic ribbon, put them away in a safe place, and moved on with her life. The Frisky: I was the other woman -- should I tell? Nineteen years later, Jamie got curious one day (maybe she was sitting alone in her apartment on a rainy evening?) and looked for Jeremy on Facebook and sent a simple message to a man with his name, asking, ""Were You In Desert Storm?"" That was all Jeremy needed in order to know that he had to see Jamie again. The two met up in person a few months later. When Jeremy finally saw Jamie he says of the moment, ""It took my breath, I was actually shaking and I'm a pretty strong man. I just said to myself, 'You have to do whatever you can to make sure you spend the rest of your life with this woman.'"" A few months later they were married. The Frisky: How to handle an overly dependent BFF . Wow. Just like that huh? War. Letters. Great distances. Great danger. Years apart. Reunion. Facebook. Marriage. I'm sure someone in Hollywood will be calling any minute to option the rights to the film. Maybe they'll call it ""Love in a Time of Bush."" I should feel inspired that love happens -- exponentially and effortlessly -- yet I feel nothing but skepticism. Does this actually happen in real life? Like, real real life? The Frisky: Need to say goodbye to single life before I can find love? Like Jamie and Jeremy, Sebastian and I lost touch after that fateful New Year's Eve. When he sent me a message on Facebook 10 years later, I was unable to breathe. It said simply, ""I hope you're still silly."" When we met in person for coffee, I was so dizzy that I had to sit with my head between my legs while he sat silently across from me. His hand shook slightly as he grabbed mine and said, ""I'm sorry, I've been waiting 10 years to say that to you."" Momentarily I was so giddy that I almost let myself get carried away. I looked at Sebastian for the first time in the bright, clear morning light and saw him exactly as he was. It happened so quickly that if I had blinked I would have missed it. He was just an older, more mature, version of the awful of the guy who broke my heart 10 years ago. There was no proposal. Just an awkward meeting of two grownups realizing that they were no longer young and silly.

"(CNN) -- Sam Hamilton, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, died Saturday, authorities announced. Hamilton, 54, died after suffering chest pains, a symptom reflective of an underlying heart condition, the Summit County, Colorado, coroner said. Hamilton was on a mountain at the Keystone Ski Resort in Keystone, Colorado, when he complained of the pains. Hamilton had served the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for more than 30 years. ""Sam was a friend, a visionary, and a professional whose years of service and passionate dedication to his work have left an indelible mark on the lands and wildlife we cherish,"" Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said in a written statement. ""His forward-thinking approach to conservation - including his view that we must think beyond boundaries at the landscape-scale- will continue to shape our nation's stewardship for years to come."" Hamilton took over the leadership of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in September. He was previously the regional director of the 10-state Southeast region for the agency. He was charged with a $484 million budget and oversight over more than 350 threatened and endangered species and 128 national wildlife refuges, according to the agency's Web site. While regional director, he also supported the creation of a carbon sequestration program that helped restore about 80,000 acres of wildlife habitat. His colleague, Thomas Strickland, assistant secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, praised Hamilton's more than 30 years of service to the agency. ""Sam brought more than just a wealth of experience to the job, he brought courage and outstanding leadership,"" Strickland said in a statement. ""The Department of the Interior will miss him greatly."" Hamilton first became involved with the agency when he was 15 years old, as a member of the Youth Conservation Corps in Mississippi with the Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge, according to the agency's Web site. He is survived by his wife Becky; sons Sam Jr. and Clay, as well as his grandson, Davis.","Hamilton had served the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for more than 30 years .

"London, England (CNN) -- I didn't need to read the findings of a recent Australian research study to know that most women who live with their mates have more body fat than those who don't. For 10 years, researchers studied nearly 6,500 women, age 18 to 23, and found, according to one of the study's authors, Dr. Wendy J. Brown, that ""Women with no partner and no baby averaged 11 pounds over 10 years. With a partner and no baby they gained about 15 pounds, and if they had a partner and a baby they gained 20 pounds."" (The findings appear in the February issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.) Researchers can speculate on the reasons for this, but it's not news to me. Of the thousands of women I've met who are desperately seeking to reshape their bodies, almost all are living with -- or just moved away from -- a partner. While I have heard many voices, their story is the same: They lust, then love. With lust comes starvation; with love, over-consumption and under-exercise. Their love transforms from the physical to the emotional, and this usually happens after they decide to live together. But once they lift their heads above the fog of love, they look down to find that their butts are sagging, bellies are bulging and thighs have taken on interesting new shapes! Come to think of it, many of the men who knock on my door looking for their abdominal muscles also deteriorated soon after moving in with their mates. Think about your man. Does he have the same waistline measurement as when you first signed the lease or mortgage papers? Probably not. In fact, it probably got even worse for both of you after your first child, didn't it? (The new Australian research references an earlier study that showed an increase in obesity in men once they'd had children.) Like the smokers I know, the overwhelming majority of whom hate to smoke, many women develop unhealthy patterns (like snacking on junk food at home) that lead to unhealthy bodies, which lead to a seriously unhealthy lack of self-esteem. We become ""less desirable,"" a phrase I hear far too often. Once we arrive at this place, the frantic search begins. Many of us will do anything to recover what was once our youthful body. Sadly, many waste time and money on fad diets, pills and potions. They end up doing the yo-yo thing, torturing their bodies through obsessive experimentation with an endless list of exercise programs, almost all of which fail them, because the will to really change behavior is not yet there. So, what can we do? First, we must think about the quality and standards of our everyday behavior more than the end result. If we can just focus on gradual improvement of our diet and our exercise programs, we will likely regain our healthier, slimmer form. But more important, we will also build our self-respect. So, taking intelligent steps (i.e., coming up with a rational workout plan or shopping for fresher and healthier foods and eating them, not impulse snacks), carrying the steps out consistently -- more frequently and for a longer duration -- will have a huge net benefit on our bottoms and our bottom line: love. Next, we should include our mates in our process. In my experience, for example, couples who work out together have greater success in achieving their health and weight loss goals. They also seem to get along much better and stay together longer. Transform your personal physical development time into ""date time,"" doing something as simple as taking regular after-dinner walks together. Finally, cut back, but don't cut out the fun stuff. When we are consistent with our diet and exercise programs, there is no need for maniacal starvation. We don't need to sit at the dinner table with a radish on our plate, while our children and mates enjoy full meals. A healthy diet should not be some kind of intruder in our relationships, it should be a natural part of our lives. Besides, fun foods are what make our love lives more interesting and memorable. So eat! But only if you do the work on the other side of those calories. Having a healthy, fit and feminine physique and a deeply loving emotional relationship are not mutually exclusive. You can have both; and it can be done in a fun and positive way. For those of you about to move in, heed this advice: Start your program now, before your belly and your mate's interest start to sag! I promise: if you don't quit, you'll have a body that won't quit! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tracy Anderson.","Trainer Tracy Anderson not surprised study says women with partners gain weight .

"London, England (CNN) -- A British man who allegedly sold fake bomb detectors to Iraq and Afghanistan has been arrested on suspicion of fraud, police said. The British government has also imposed an export ban on the device, known as the ADE651, effective Monday. The handheld device is commonly used at checkpoints in Iraq and Afghanistan to detect explosives. The 53-year-old unidentified suspect, who was arrested Friday, is accused of knowingly selling a product that didn't work, police said. Tests show that the ADE651, and similar devices, were not suitable for bomb detection, a spokesman for Britain's Department of Business, Innovation and Skills said in a statement. ""As non-military technology, it does not need an export license, and we would not normally need to monitor its sale and use abroad. However, it is clearly of concern that it is being used as bomb detection equipment,"" the spokesman said. The spokesman said the export ban only applied to Iraq and Afghanistan because its legal powers to control the sale of the product were ""based on the risk that [the device] could cause harm to U.K. and other friendly forces.""","British man arrested on suspicion of fraud concerning fake bomb detectors .

"SANTA BARBARA, California (CNN) -- Barbara Harvey climbs into the back of her small Honda sport utility vehicle and snuggles with her two golden retrievers, her head nestled on a pillow propped against the driver's seat. Californian Barbara Harvey says she is forced to sleep in her car with her dogs after losing her job earlier this year. A former loan processor, the 67-year-old mother of three grown children said she never thought she'd spend her golden years sleeping in her car in a parking lot. ""This is my bed, my dogs,"" she said. ""This is my life in this car right now."" Harvey was forced into homelessness this year after being laid off. She said that three-quarters of her income went to paying rent in Santa Barbara, where the median house in the scenic oceanfront city costs more than $1 million. She lost her condo two months ago and had little savings as backup. ""It went to hell in a handbasket,"" she said. ""I didn't think this would happen to me. It's just something that I don't think that people think is going to happen to them, is what it amounts to. It happens very quickly, too."" Harvey now works part time for $8 an hour, and she draws Social Security to help make ends meet. But she still cannot afford an apartment, and so every night she pulls into a gated parking lot to sleep in her car, along with other women who find themselves in a similar predicament.  Watch women who live in their cars » . There are 12 parking lots across Santa Barbara that have been set up to accommodate the growing middle-class homelessness. These lots are believed to be part of the first program of its kind in the United States, according to organizers. The lots open at 7 p.m. and close at 7 a.m. and are run by New Beginnings Counseling Center, a homeless outreach organization. It is illegal for people in California to sleep in their cars on streets. New Beginnings worked with the city to allow the parking lots as a safe place for the homeless to sleep in their vehicles without being harassed by people on the streets or ticketed by police. Harvey stays at the city's only parking lot for women. ""This is very safe, and that's why I feel very comfortable,"" she said. Nancy Kapp, the New Beginnings parking lot coordinator, said the group began seeing a need for the lots in recent months as California's foreclosure crisis hit the city hard. She said a growing number of senior citizens, women and lower- and middle-class families live on the streets.  See how foreclosure filings are up 75 percent » . ""You look around today, and there are so many,"" said Kapp, who was homeless with her young daughter two decades ago. ""I see women sleeping on benches. It's heartbreaking."" She added, ""The way the economy is going, it's just amazing the people that are becoming homeless. It's hit the middle class."" She and others with New Beginnings walk the streets looking for people and families sleeping in their cars. The workers inform them about the parking lot program. New Beginnings screens people to make sure they won't cause trouble. No alcohol or drugs are allowed in the parking lots. ""What we are trying to do is we pull bad apples out, and we put good apples in the parking lots and really help people out,"" said Shaw Tolley, another coordinator with New Beginnings. Most of the time, the lots are transition points. New Beginnings works with each person to try to find a more permanent housing solution. ""It saddens me when they live in their vehicles,"" Tolley said. ""It is not the most ideal situation for senior citizens and families, but it is reality."" He added, ""We need to engage this problem. This is reality."" John Quigley, an economics professor at the University of California-Berkeley, said the California housing crisis has left many middle-class families temporarily homeless or forced them to go to food banks to feed their families. ""Part of the reason why it's so painful in Santa Barbara is, there's so little in the way of alternative housing,"" Quigley said. ""If there were alternative low and moderate housing and rental accommodations that were reasonably close by, you can imagine it wouldn't have this desperate look to it as people living in their cars."" At the only lot for women in Santa Barbara, it's a tough existence. There are no showers or running water. On the night CNN visited, a half-dozen women were in the parking lot before nightfall. Linn Labou, 54, lives in her car with four cats. She used to be in the National Guard and is on a waiting list for government housing, but the wait is a year long. ""I went looking for family, but I couldn't get them to help me,"" she said. As for Harvey, she begins each day by walking her two dogs before going to her part-time job. She leaves the dogs in her car with its windows cracked while she works. It's another chapter in her life that she's certain she'll get through. Her 19-year-old daughter moved in with friends to avoid being homeless. Her other children live overseas, and she didn't want to tell them about her living status. Even if her children offered to help, she said, she wouldn't accept it. ""They know me well enough to know that I will get through this."" ""My daughter especially is very unhappy. Sometimes she'll cry, and she'll call and say, 'Mom, I just can't stand it that you are living in a car,' "" Harvey said. ""I'll say, 'You know what? This is OK for right now, because I'm safe, I'm healthy, the dogs are doing OK, and I have a job, and things will get better.' "" CNN's Gregg Canes and Traci Tamura contributed to this report.","Mother of three grown children says, ""This is my life in this car right now""

"(CNN) -- Segway scooter inventor Dean Kamen freely admits it: He often suffers sleepless nights wrestling over whether to quit a project that's not panning out. Knowing when to quit a fruitless project is difficult, says the father of the Segway, Dean Kamen, left. ""You end up lying there saying, 'I'm not stopping. It would be an act of shallow cowardice. Or you decide to quit and you say, 'This is one of those ideas that just isn't going to work,' "" said Kamen, speaking by phone from his home office in Manchester, New Hampshire. When to quit -- said Kamen, also the inventor of health care technologies and the Slingshot water purifier -- is ""the toughest question there is"" for any entrepreneur who survives on creativity and instinct. ""It's not nearly as glamorous as people think to keep working on something and to keep hitting roadblocks and to keep going,"" he said. Stubborn, delusionally optimistic, creative, fearless, flexible and focused are some of the ways psychologists and business people describe the personality of an entrepreneur. Surprisingly, another word is ignorant.  Quiz: Do you have the right stuff for entrepreneurship? » . ""You need to be in denial or in ignorance about the huge challenges you face,"" laughs Guy Kawasaki, a former Apple executive and entrepreneur who's starting the self-described ""magazine rack"" alltop.com. ""You have to believe that it wouldn't be hard for you to succeed."" Research by Harvard Business School psychology professor emeritus Abraham Zaleznik has unveiled a darker side to the entrepreneur's psyche. ""Entrepreneurs tend to have a singular weakness that allows them to do things without checking their conscience,"" Zaleznik said. ""Juvenile delinquents act and then try to sort things out afterward. I think entrepreneurs have this tendency."" Another academic researcher on the topic, professor Kelly Shaver of the College of William & Mary, told Forbes magazine in 2002 that successful entrepreneurs ""really don't care as much"" about what other people think. ""They're just happy to go ahead and do what they're doing."" In a recession that has forced employers to eliminate 2.6 million jobs in 2008, people who might otherwise start a business at a time of their own choosing find themselves being pushed into entrepreneurship. ""More people often become self-employed in tough times like this,"" said John Challenger, CEO of a top employment firm for executives and middle managers. Between 5 percent and 7 percent of clients at Challenger, Gray & Christmas are choosing to start their own businesses, he said. Workers are more open to starting a small business in the dot-com era, Challenger said. ""I think we're in a more entrepreneurial period than we were in the '80s and '90s,"" he said. Recessions can be ""crucibles"" for at-home start-ups. ""Some of the best new businesses start in recessions because what they have really makes a difference if the market is interested in it,"" Challenger said. ""There's not a lot of easy money to go around, and they have to fight their way forward."" Great entrepreneurs, said Kawasaki, do more than just fight hard to win their market share. They have vision. They ask what he calls the ""fundamental question"": Wouldn't it be neat if ... ? Kawasaki said Apple would have failed without the unique contributions of its co-founder, Steve Jobs. ""He asked the question, 'Wouldn't it be neat if people could carry all their music with them wherever they went?' "" Result: the iPod. Psychologist Lynn Friedman, whose clients often include entrepreneurs, said many of them are ""tuned into consumer needs."" They tend to grow up in nurturing families and learned to value the concept of trying new things. Jobs described fond memories of his California childhood during an 1995 interview with the Smithsonian Institution, saying his father ""spent a lot of time with me . . . teaching me how to build things, how to take things apart, put things back together."" But obviously, Kawasaki said, everybody's not always right about the ""wouldn't it be neat"" question. He cited Webvan, the online grocery store that served as many as 10 U.S. cities before going bankrupt in 2001. ""Somebody asked the question, 'Wouldn't it be neat if I could buy lettuce online and they'll deliver lettuce to my house?' "" Webvan failed with sales of $178.5 million in 2000 partly because it was buried in $525.4 million in expenses, according to a 2001 CNNMoney.com article. ""They went about it in a grand way,"" Kawasaki said. ""Sometimes it helps to start small."" Webvan entrepreneur Louis Borders, who stepped down as CEO in 1999, told the San Francisco Chronicle four years later, ""I get the strategy set, the operation running, the team in place. That's my role as an entrepreneur."" According to Friedman, entrepreneurs ""live in the world of action,"" and they ""often need help with slowing down and thinking several steps ahead."" Kamen, who works hard to inspire future innovators with his FIRST program to promote high school math and science, said every entrepreneurial innovator he's ever seen shares a few characteristics. ""It's not that they're brilliant or well-educated,"" Kamen said. ""They work all the time. They don't let failure demoralize or destroy them. They pick themselves up and keep going and eventually, every once in a while, one of your ideas actually breaks through and works, and it makes all that stuff seem worthwhile.""","An entrepreneur's personality can influence a business .

"(CNN) -- Mount Redoubt, the Alaskan volcano expected to erupt at any time, is getting a bit more edgy. Dark areas show a mudflow from the peak of Mount Redoubt earlier this week. The Alaska Volcano Observatory said in a statement Friday ""volcanic tremor"" has increased in ""amplitude."" The activity on the 10,197-foot peak is ""more energetic than that of the previous several days. However, it is still less vigorous than that observed last weekend,"" the observatory said. Peter Cervelli, a research geophysicist with the observatory, told CNN that ""every indication is that we're heading toward an eruption."" Cervelli said scientists don't know exactly when it will happen, but if it does happen, it could be days or weeks -- or even hours. ""I would not be surprised to see it erupt at anytime,"" Cervelli said. ""We're going to know it when we see it.""  Learn more about Redoubt and its history » . Scientists raised the alert status Sunday to a ""watch"" level, the second-highest, based on seismic activity detected January 23. The peak is about 100 miles southwest of Anchorage, the state's most populous city. Mount Redoubt last erupted nearly 20 years ago, in December 1989, and that eruption lasted until April 1990. Geologists think there could be an eruption ""similar to or smaller than the one that occurred in 1989-90."" PopSci.com: Predicting eruptions . That eruption spread ash in Kenai and Anchorage, where it disrupted air traffic operations. Cervelli said the ash plumes caused engine failure on a jet. The 1989-90 eruption also spurred volcanic mudflows, or lahars, that flowed east down the Drift River. The ash fall was seen as far away as Fairbanks and the Yukon Territory border.

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Serena Williams' preparations for her Australian Open title defense suffered a late blip when she was beaten in the final of the Sydney International by Elena Dementieva on Friday. The American, who had struggled past unseeded Frenchwoman Aravane Rezai in three sets in the semifinals when she appeared to injure her left leg, lost 6-3 6-2 to suffer her fifth defeat in her last eight clashes with the Russian. ""I was struggling a little bit, but she definitely deserves all the credit,"" Williams told reporters. ""It's definitely not ligament problems. It's just a little pain but the strapping usually helps the pain go away."" Dementieva, who beat world No. 2 Dinara Safina in the quarterfinals, successfully defended her title in the final event before the first Grand Slam tournament of this decade starts on Monday. ""It's great to play against the best players in the world, especially going into a Grand Slam. It was a great experience and it'll help me next week at the Australian Open,"" she told the WTA Tour's official Web site . Dementieva went into the match against Williams having been handed a potential second-round clash with former world No. 1 Justine Henin, who pulled out of the Sydney event as a precaution after suffering a leg injury in her comeback tournament in Brisbane. Seven-time Grand Slam winner Henin, handed a wildcard after a 20-month retirement, will start against unseeded fellow Belgian Kirsten Flipkens on Monday while fifth seed Dementieva plays fellow Russian Vera Dushevina . Both have avoided the Williams sisters, who are in the top half of the draw with Serena opening against Poland's Urszula Radwanska on Tuesday and sixth seed Venus taking on Czech Lucie Safarova. Four-time winner Serena could face seventh seed Victoria Azarenka in the last eight, with a possible semifinal against her older sibling looming. Last year's losing finalist Safina opens against world No. 44 Magdalena Rybarikova of Slovakia, and could face fellow Russian Maria Sharapova in the fourth round. Sharapova, the 2008 champion but seeded 14th after struggling with shoulder problems last year, begins with a glamour clash against compatriot and fellow pin-up girl Maria Kirilenko. U.S. Open champion Kim Clijsters could face fellow comeback queen Henin in the quarterfinals, having been seeded 15th and facing a qualifier first up. But to set up a rematch of the recent final in Brisbane, which she won, Clijsters is likely to have to overcome third seed Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round. The Russian, who has never got past the last eight in Melbourne, takes on unseeded compatriot Anastasia Rodionova in her first match.

"Editor's note: Clark Howard, the Atlanta, Georgia-based host of a nationally syndicated radio show, hosts a television show designed to help viewers save more, spend less and avoid getting ripped off during these tough economic times. The show airs at noon and 4 p.m. ET Saturdays and Sundays on HLN. Clark Howard says, ""The only smart move is to pay your debt down or pay it off entirely."" ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- I've been getting many calls from listeners who are outraged or perplexed by the actions of their credit card issuer. The issuing banks are raising interest rates by 20 percent or more -- even if the individual has good credit, has never been late on a payment or hasn't even had any change in their credit standing. This is happening across all income levels. It's even affecting successful business owners and moderate to wealthy individuals. Fortune magazine recently spotlighted one small business owner who had a card that went from nearly 8 percent to 26 percent, even though nothing changed with his finances or payment history. Bank of America, Citibank and Capital One are among the big issuers arbitrarily jacking up rates in the face of what they often cite as a ""continually changing business environment."" In fact, the Federal Reserve reports 37 percent of banks have increased their interest rates. The reality is that the banks are fearful of the high rate of credit card default, and they know they've got you if you're among the 70 percent of Americans who carry a month-to-month balance. The good news here is that there are new rules coming that will stop the banks from retroactively raising the rate on existing balances you already carry. The banks will still, however, be able to raise the rates if you stop paying as well as on all future purchases. But what stinks is that these rules won't go into effect until July 2010. That gives the banks plenty of time to lobby members of Congress and get this pending legislation overturned. For right now, the problem with banks jacking up the rates is that they're making it tougher for someone who might have been able to pay at 5 percent but could never pay at 30 percent, for example. So they're setting you up for failure, and they're shooting themselves in the foot at the same time. The only smart move is to pay your debt down or pay it off entirely. And don't assume you're a sitting duck if your credit standing is decent. You can always shop around for a card that has a lower rate. Try looking at Web sites such as CardWeb.com or CardTrak.com to find the best rates. I also have a special warning for you if you're buried in debt and thinking about using one of those debt-negotiation firms that advertise all over the Internet and late-night TV. Do not believe these people about their ability to negotiate with your credit card company and reduce your outstanding balance by 50 percent or more. These con artists get you to pay them money as a retainer and then tell you to stop making all payments while they negotiate on your behalf. But they're rip-off artists through and through. Many banks won't even take a phone call from these people anymore because they're on to their game. That leaves you scammed out of your retainer fee while your bills continue to pile up. There is a better way to address your debt. Try calling your credit card company and telling them you're in over your head. You may get blown off, or they may work with you. If you do get the cold shoulder, go to NFCC.org -- the National Foundation for Credit Counseling -- and find a local affiliate who can help you come up with a debt-conquering plan for free or very low cost. You didn't get into credit card debt overnight, and you won't get out of it overnight; the recovery is going to be a slow step-by-step process.","Clark Howard: Banks raising interest rates on credit cards by 20 percent or more .

"(CNN) -- A Dutch man once considered a suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway has told a television station he dumped her body in a swamp, Aruba's chief prosecutor told CNN. However, Joran van der Sloot's claims to Dutch station RTL-5 are ""unbelievable,"" prosecutor Peter Blanken said. RTL-5 said Tuesday it had ""acquired exclusive material containing a statement by Joran van der Sloot"" regarding Holloway's disappearance. ""This material was first offered to us in 2009,"" Remko van Westerloo, the station's director of programming, said in a statement. ""Obviously, our initial response was skeptical,"" van Westerloo said. ""However, we did feel that this interview required thorough research. We've spoken to a variety of experts and several critics. These findings resulted in a TV special which will air this Sunday. It's up to the viewers to form their own opinions on the matter."" The statement did not divulge the contents of van der Sloot's interview. However, Blanken told CNN on Tuesday that van der Sloot says in the interview that he dumped Holloway's body ""in a swamp on the north end of the island."" ""He was very unspecific,"" Blanken said. Blanken said RTL contacted him about the interview last summer, and the station showed the interview to him to get his reaction. He said his office and Aruban police investigated. ""We tried to verify it,"" Blanken said. ""It couldn't be true. We talked with several witnesses and reviewed several facts. The story is unbelievable and not true, in my opinion."" He said his office told van der Sloot ""we'd like him to come in and speak with us about it. He failed to respond."" Asked why van der Sloot gave the interview, Blanken said, ""You should ask him. Maybe he wanted to be on camera or make some money."" Holloway was 18 when last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. She was visiting Aruba with about 100 classmates celebrating their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. Holloway failed to show up for her flight home the following day, and her packed bags were found in her hotel room. Van der Sloot and the Kalpoes were arrested and released in 2005 in connection with the case. In 2007, they were arrested a second time after Aruba's then-chief prosecutor, Hans Mos, said he had received new evidence in the case. Van der Sloot, who was attending college in the Netherlands, was brought back to Aruba. But judges ruled the new evidence -- which included an Internet chat the same day Holloway disappeared with one of the three youths saying she was dead -- was not enough to keep them jailed. In 2008, prosecutors sought unsuccessfully to arrest van der Sloot a third time after a videotape surfaced on Dutch television. In it, van der Sloot tells a man he considered to be his friend that he had sex with Holloway on the beach after leaving the nightclub, then she ""started shaking"" and lost consciousness. He said he panicked when he could not resuscitate her and called a friend who had a boat. The two put Holloway's body in the boat, he said, and then he went home. The friend told him the next day that he had carried the body out and dumped it in the ocean. ""I didn't lose a minute of sleep over it,"" van der Sloot said on the tape. Holloway's mother, Beth Twitty, told ABC at the time that the video showed van der Sloot was ""not innocent."" But an Aruba court ruled there was not enough evidence to re-arrest him. Aruban prosecutors said authorities had met with van der Sloot in the Netherlands, but in a two-hour interview he denied any role in Holloway's disappearance. Van der Sloot acknowledged to a Dutch television program he made the comments, but said he was lying. ""That is what he wanted to hear, so I told him what he wanted to hear,"" he said. ""When [van der Sloot] really wants to tell the truth, [we hope] he will,"" said Blanken, who took over as chief prosecutor in September. ""He didn't tell the truth [this time]."" CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Ex-suspect tells TV station he dumped Alabama teen's body in swamp, Aruba prosecutor says .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Sala saunters in the red soil, her wrinkled skin glistening in the sun as she tries to keep up with the rest of the herd. It is hard to believe the 6-week-old, dwarfed by her human keeper, will grow up to be one of nature's biggest beasts. Until then, she lives at a Nairobi orphanage that takes in baby elephants struggling to survive. There, she walks around in the lush wilderness with her peers, drinks soy milk and waves her trunk playfully as her keeper applies sunscreen on her delicate skin. A red garment tied around her back keeps it safe from the sun's glare. Sala is one of scores of animals orphaned by drought, poaching and shrinking habitats, which have decimated wildlife across Kenya. The baby elephant was found wandering, alone and confused, after her mother died of starvation, her caretaker said. Conservation groups such as the David Sheldrick Foundation, where Sala is, have seen an influx of wildlife. The foundation takes in orphaned elephants and rhinos from across the country, a popular tourist destination because of its animals. ""You know if a human child came in need of care, you wouldn't put a bullet in or turn it away,"" said Daphne Sheldrick of the foundation. ""Elephants are the same. ... Whatever comes in, we have to make space."" The facility has more than 20 elephants in Nairobi and more at another center in Tsavo National Park, where they are also rehabilitated. Kenya depends on tourism as a main source of income. Sala taps into that to help earn the $900 monthly cost for her upkeep. She slushes and slides in a mud bath for throngs of tourists and uses her trunk to nudge the only other person she dwarfs -- a squirming toddler. Sala and the other animals will be released back into the wilderness when they are old enough, which takes years. Long after they are gone, their caretakers will still worry about the fragile animals they help nurture. ""After working with these elephants, it's no longer just a job,"" said Edwin Lusichi, the chief keeper. ""It is from inside your heart, the love that you have for these animals.""","Conservation groups have seen an influx of wildlife .

"(CNN) -- Tokyo has a dynamic and varied nightlife, although, as with the city's restaurants, many of the best bars are tucked away off the beaten track. Tokyo has a buzzing clubbing scene. The ultra-stylish New York Bar is among the best rooftop bars in the world. Located on the 52nd floor of the Park Hyatt hotel (3-7-1-2 Nishi Shinjuku) it offers spectacular views of the glowing, futuristic cityscape that is Tokyo after dark. There's fantastic food and live jazz, and as an added bonus, you may recognize it as the bar where Bill Murray first meets Scarlett Johansson in ""Lost in Translation."" At Henry Good Seven it's the stunning interior that will catch your eye. At once kitsch, cozy and classy, it's a truly unique space by Tokyo design gurus Wonderwall. You'll find it tucked away on the seventh floor of the Shin-Marunouchi Building (1-5-1 Marunouchi) right across the street from Tokyo Station. If you manage to locate it, you'll discover that Kita Aoyama Salon (Yamahazi Building, B1F, 2-7-18 Kita Aoyama, Minato-ku) is one of the city's coolest bars. Take the metro to Gaienmae, leave by exit 2 and turn right. An unmarked metal door will lead you to a barely-lit basement bar artfully kitted out in dark wood and antique furniture. It's open until 5 a.m. and manages to feel laid back and indulgent at the same time. Well worth seeking out. Perennially popular with foreigners is the Roppongi area. Full of bars and restaurants, it's always lively -- and a bit tacky. Propaganda (Yua Roppongi Building 2F 3-14-9 Roppongi, Minato-ku) is an unfussy, affable shot bar with a good-value happy hour. A world away from garish Roppongi is the Golden Gai area of Shinjuku. A ghetto of dark alleyways crammed with tiny ramshackle bars, Golden Gai evokes a bygone bohemian Tokyo of the 1960s. Some establishments aren't keen on foreign customers but La Jetee (1-1-8 Kabukicho, Shinjuku-ku) is a friendly little drinking den that's sure to offer a warm welcome. A new arrival on the clubbing scene is the intimate Le Baron de Paris (Aoyama Center Building, Minami-Aoyama Minatu-ku), the Tokyo outpost of the Parisian night club. Designed in part by Marc Newson, it attracts a trendy and glamorous international crowd. More established, and much less intimate, is Tokyo's finest superclub, Womb (2-16 Maruyama-cho, Shibuya-ku). More like the interior of a spaceship than a nightclub, Womb has dazzling lighting and attracts top international House and Techno DJs.

"Washington (CNN) -- The FBI attained ""actionable intelligence"" from bombing suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab in the first hours after his arrest on Christmas Day, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday. ""AbdulMutallab spent a number of hours with FBI investigators in which we gleaned useable, actionable intelligence,"" Gibbs told reporters. According to authorities, Nigerian-born AbdulMutallab tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as a flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, made its final approach to Detroit, Michigan, December 25. The device failed to fully detonate, instead setting off a fire at the man's seat. Gibbs declined to elaborate on the nature of the intelligence. AbdulMutallab, 23, has been tied to the Yemen-based group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In a statement to reporters after meeting with his national security team, President Obama said U.S. officials had enough information in their possession before the failed bombing attack to have prevented the suspect from getting on the plane, but had been unable to ""connect the dots."" Obama said he could accept the imperfect nature of intelligence work, ""but it is increasingly clear that intelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged,"" he said, adding: ""That's not acceptable, and I will not tolerate it."" ""Time and again we've learned that quickly piecing together information and taking swift action is critical to staying one step ahead of a nimble adversary,"" Obama said. ""So we have to do better, and we will do better, and we have to do it quickly. American lives are on the line."" In one step, senior State Department officials told CNN on Tuesday that new criteria for information collected on possible terrorists would make it easier to ban them from U.S.-bound flights. Speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the material, the officials said the United States has lowered the threshold for information considered important enough to put suspicious individuals on a no-fly list or revoke their visas. If the new criteria had been in place before Christmas, AbdulMutallab would have been added to the no-fly list, the officials said. AbdulMutallab is being held at the Federal Correctional Institution in Milan, Michigan, where he's still being treated for the burn injuries he received in the failed bombing. He faces charges of attempting to destroy an aircraft, and will face his first court hearings Friday. The suspect apparently arrived in Amsterdam already carrying the explosives he planned to use, Dutch prosecutors said Tuesday. ""The suspect traveled through Ghana before he arrived via Lagos [Nigeria] at Schiphol,"" prosecutors said, referring to the airport where AbdulMutallab boarded the flight to Detroit. ""So far, it seems he already had the explosives with him before he landed at Schiphol."" Also Tuesday, British officials announced that London's Heathrow Airport will introduce more body scanners within weeks, and that all British airports must have equipment to detect explosives by the end of the year. British Home Secretary Alan Johnson said the British government had no evidence AbdulMutallab had been planning an attack. Johnson added that British authorities were directing airports to carry out more random searches of passengers because metal detectors cannot spot explosives without metal parts. Last week, Obama blamed human error and security lapses for the failure by officials to act on information that AbdulMutallab was a possible terrorist threat. He had a valid multiple-entry U.S. visa. His father, a leading banker in Nigeria, had warned U.S. authorities before the attack that his son might be involved with Islamic extremists, but the information failed to prompt a response such as canceling the visa. Tuesday's White House meetings were held just hours after the United States reopened its embassy in Yemen. It's believed that AbdulMutallab may have received training in Yemen from the group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The United States' decision to close the embassy came after intelligence suggested that four al Qaeda operatives could have been planning an attack on the compound, a senior administration official said Monday. A statement posted on the Embassy's Web site said ""successful counter-terrorism operations"" conducted by Yemeni security forces Monday north of the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, addressed ""a specific area of concern and have contributed to the Embassy's decision to resume operations."" Yemen's state-run news agency, SABA, reported Monday that two al Qaeda suspects were killed and two others were injured in clashes with a Yemeni anti-terrorism unit. CNN's Dan Lothian and Suzanne Malveaux in Washington, Per Nyberg in London, England, and Christian Purefoy in Lagos, Nigeria, contributed to this report.","White House press secretary: Suspect gave FBI ""actionable intelligence""

"(OPRAH.com) -- Shelly and her husband, Daren Forney, were the happily married parents of three beautiful girls, 13-year-old Jessica, 9-year-old Erica and 4-year-old Valerie. ""Erica is my little sunshine because she lit up the house,"" Shelly says. ""She was making us laugh before she was a year old."" Two days before Thanksgiving in 2008 , Shelly came back from a doctor's appointment to find emergency crews on her street. ""There were all these people and a child lying on the ground,"" she says. ""I had no idea it was my daughter."" Daren says Erica was riding her bike home from school. ""Erica was just around the corner from our house,"" he says. ""She was 30 seconds from being home safely."" Erica had been hit head-on by a 5,000-pound SUV. Police say that the driver had recently finished a phone call at the time of the accident. ""The driver said: 'I'm so sorry. I didn't see her,'"" Shelly says. ""I felt badly for the driver because I thought: 'Oh, she's unconscious. She's going to be okay.' ... And they started cutting my daughter's clothes off and it was hitting me this is very, very, very serious."" Watch mom remember her daughter, the fatal day . Erica was rushed to the local children's hospital, then airlifted to another facility. ""The neurosurgeon made it very clear she was going to die,"" Shelly says. ""I spent the night with her that night. I held her. Cried. I kissed her. I sang to her. I just needed to have time with my girl."" The driver of the SUV, Michelle Smith, pleaded guilty last year to careless driving resulting in death and was sentenced to two years probation, a $300 fine and 150 hours of community service, according to the Denver Post. Her sentence also required her to write a letter of apology to the Forney family and have the letter published in newspapers. Since Erica's death, Shelly and Daren have been working to change the laws in Colorado. ""I don't want any other parent to have to go through this, or a husband to lose his wife,"" she says. ""We have been trying so hard to get this law changed, and we're going to continue until it happens."" In the meantime, Shelly and Daren say every single person who gets behind the wheel can make a difference. ""Get off the phone. Save a life. Don't talk and drive,"" she says. ""You've got precious cargo in that car. Your life. Your children's life. They are not worth a phone call, a text, an e-mail. It's not worth it."" Nearly 500,000 people are injured and 6,000 are killed each year because drivers are talking, texting and e-mailing behind the wheel, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. ""It is my prayer that this show, this day will be a seminal day in your life,"" Oprah Winfrey said on her show Tuesday. ""Let it be the end, the end of you using a cell phone or sending a text message when you are behind the wheel of a moving vehicle. And until we as a nation decide we're going to change that, those numbers are only going to go up."" Oprah.com: Take Oprah's no phone zone pledge . Most European countries ban the use of handheld cell phones while driving, but not all U.S. states have laws restricting texting and driving. So far, 19 states and the District of Columbia have banned texting while driving. In seven states and the District of Columbia, drivers can only use their cell phones if they are hands-free. Of the states with these laws, Utah's laws are among the strictest, due to one distracted driver and two grieving families. Oprah.com: Why multitaskers should beware . September 22, 2006, began like any other day for Jackie Furfaro. She kissed her husband, Jim, goodbye as he left to pick up his colleague, Keith O'Dell, for work. A few hours later, Jackie arrived at work, where police were waiting for her. They told her Jim had been in an accident. ""I saw Jim's license in the hands of one of the police officers, and I realized that he was dead,"" she says. ""They told me that a 19-year-old who was driving a white Tahoe had crossed the center line and clipped my husband,"" she says. ""He ended up in the oncoming traffic line and was broadsided by the vehicle behind the 19-year-old, and he was killed instantly, along with Keith."" An investigator at the crash site suspected texting was involved when he saw the 19-year-old, Reggie Shaw, texting on the way to a mandatory drug and alcohol screening. No drugs or alcohol were found in his system, but cell phone records confirmed Reggie had been texting from the time he got into his car up until the moment of the crash. Reggie was sentenced to 30 days in jail, community service and to honor a unique request from Jackie -- to watch a video of her husband's funeral. ""I just wanted him to know who he killed,"" she says. ""That was a way for him to get to know one of the men."" Before the accident, Reggie says he texted ""pretty close to 100 percent of the time"" while driving. ""I just never thought about it,"" he says. ""Growing up, going to high school, going to driver's ed, it was never taught to me how dangerous it was."" Reggie says he's haunted by what he's done. ""This affects my life every day. It's something that I can never really forgive myself for. It was a poor choice that I made,"" he says. ""I have trouble sleeping at night. You drive down the road, you see accidents on the side of the road, and instantly that's the first thing that I think of. It's hard every day. It never gets easier."" When asked whether the jail time he served was enough, Reggie says he doesn't know. ""I think about those 30 days in jail and what I went through and how hard that was for me -- and I think about the two lives that are lost,"" he says. ""I don't know if it was enough."" Still, Reggie says it's important for him to share his story with others. In fall 2008, Reggie spoke at a national summit in Washington, D.C., about the dangers of distracted driving. He also speaks at high schools to give students the warning he never received. ""A lot of them think along the lines like I thought: 'I can do this. I'm safe,'"" he says. ""I explain to them: 'It's not safe. Absolutely not. Look what it's done to me. Look what it's done to these two families. You don't want to put anyone through that. It's not worth it.'""

"(CNN)  -- A pilot's sleep disorder and a string of early mornings helped cause the crew of a commuter jet to fall asleep during a flight over Hawaii in 2008, federal investigators reported Monday. The pilot and co-pilot of a Go! Airlines jet failed to respond to calls from air traffic controllers for 18 minutes during the February 2008 flight from Honolulu to Hilo and awoke to find they had overshot their destination by about 30 miles, the National Transportation Safety Board reported. The plane landed safely once the pilots awoke and resumed contact with controllers. The 53-year-old pilot was later diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, which can cause daytime sleepiness. ""This condition likely caused him to experience chronic daytime fatigue and contributed to his falling asleep during the incident flight,"" according to the NTSB's report on the probable cause of the incident. ""In addition, the day of the incident was the third consecutive day that both pilots started duty at 0540 (5:40 a.m.),"" the report continued. ""This likely caused the pilots to receive less daily sleep than is needed to sustain optimal alertness and resulted in an accumulation of sleep debt and increased levels of daytime fatigue."" Go! is a subsidiary of Phoenix, Arizona-based Mesa Air Group. The company had no immediate response to the findings. The Hawaii incident and a 2007 runway landing accident in Michigan that investigators blamed on pilot fatigue prompted a call by federal safety experts to scale back the maximum workday allowed for airline pilots and implement other ""fatigue management"" programs.","The crew of a commuter jet fell asleep during a flight over Hawaii in 2008 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A new national poll suggests a majority of Americans oppose legalizing same-sex marriages, but the survey indicates a vast generational divide on the issue. The recent poll shows that those who have a gay friend or relative are more likely to support gay marriage. Fifty-four percent of people questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll released Monday say marriages between gay or lesbian couples should not be recognized as valid, with 44 percent suggesting they should be considered legal. But among those 18 to 34 years old, 58 percent said same-sex marriages should be legal. That number drops to 42 percent among respondents aged 35 to 49, and to 41 percent for those aged 50 to 64. Only 24 percent of Americans 65 and older support recognizing same-sex marriages, according to the poll. While a majority of those polled oppose legalizing gay marriage, six of ten said states that do not recognize gay marriages should allow civil unions. When it comes to supporting civil unions, the poll indicates a similar generational shift. Three states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut and Iowa -- currently allow same-sex marriages. A law passed by Vermont legislators that makes gay and lesbian marriages legal takes affect in September. New Hampshire lawmakers are close to passing a similar bill. ""It's not surprising that three Northeastern states are the first to take this step,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland, referring to Massachusetts, Connecticut and Vermont. ""A majority of people who live in the Northeast say they approve of same-sex marriage. Solid majorities in the South, Midwest and West all oppose gay marriage."" Forty-nine percent of those questioned say they have a family member or close friend who is gay. That's up eight points from 1998 and 17 points from 1992. Fifty-eight percent of those aged 18 to 34 say they have a family member or close friend who's gay. That drops to just one in three of people 65 or older. ""People who say they have a gay friend or relative support same-sex marriage,"" Holland notes. ""Most of those who say they don't know anyone who is gay, oppose gay marriage."" The poll's release comes just three days after Supreme Court Justice David Souter announced he would step down from the high court after this year's session ends in late June. Any Supreme Court nomination battle between conservatives and progressives will most likely include hot-button social issues, like gay marriage. ""Republicans don't have the votes to defeat President Obama's choice for the Supreme Court. They have to get some Democrats to join them, possibly on a hot-button social issue,"" says Bill Schneider, CNN senior political analyst. The poll indicates that close to 40 percent of Democrats oppose legalizing gay marriage. But Schneider says there's a risk for conservatives if they make same-sex marriage an issue in the fight over a Supreme Court nomination. ""Young voters strongly favor marriage equality. They're the future of American politics,"" says Schneider. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted April 23-26, with 2,019 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points .","Fifty-eight percent of 18 to 34 years olds said same-sex marriages should be legal .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) --  The beating of 12-year-old boy by a group of classmates at a Southern California middle school may be linked to a Facebook posting encouraging kids to target redheads, authorities say. The redheaded boy was beaten up by a group of seventh and eighth graders at A.E. Wright Middle School in Calabasas in two separate incidents Friday, according to a statement released Sunday by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. A Facebook page stating that Friday was ""Kick a Ginger Day,"" referring to redheads and possibly inspired by an episode of the ""South Park"" series, may have sparked the injuries at the middle school, authorities said. The boy's injuries were not serious, and no one has been arrested, authorities said Sunday.","12-year-old boy beaten by classmates in two separate incidents on Friday .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Jennifer Thomas was looking at life with renewed energy: She had just survived a serious operation, and she was at a crossroads in her career. After 20 years as a producer in the stressful business of TV news, the challenge wasn't there for her anymore. For eight weeks, as she recovered from the removal of a large noncancerous tumor from her uterus, Thomas thought about her next steps. ""I told myself I was going to work to do the things that I enjoy, things that are related to the news,"" she said. Thomas had recently conducted news production workshops for kids, so she already knew that she ""loved people and talking to people about the news. That made me start thinking that if I could do it all the time and get paid for it, I'd really enjoy it."" Within a year, Thomas had left her job at CNN's HLN network to start a Georgia-based media consulting business with clients such as singer/actress Jennifer Holliday, former Bell Biv DeVoe singer Ron DeVoe, actor Boris Kodjoe, actress Nicole Ari Parker and former supermodel Beverly Johnson. During her journey, Thomas learned that working for yourself often requires scary first steps, generous friends and mentors, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. She's the first to say that her story is not typical in any way, as she seemed to meet good luck at every turn. After her surgery, Thomas, who also had worked at CNN and NBC, began saving money and planning her business. As if on cue, HLN offered her a buyout to leave the company as part of a downsizing. ""It was my light bulb 'a-ha' moment,"" Thomas said. ""I was excited because in the back of my mind, it was what I had been praying for."" An opportunity to write a blog for a popular local women's magazine got her some local attention. A journalist friend e-mailed Thomas, saying that he had connected with Johnson and suggesting that they meet. ""She called out of the blue,"" Thomas said. "" 'Hi, Jennifer! It's Beverly -- the model!' I was shocked."" Johnson needed no introduction. Thomas was very familiar with the first African-American model to win a cover on American Vogue magazine. In that year, 1974, Thomas said Johnson's beauty and status spoke volumes to her as a role model. ""When she called, I was like, 'shut up!' We were all like, 'no way!' I didn't think anything would come from it, but eventually, she said she would love to be my client."" Thomas made short work of helping Johnson successfully pitch her women's health campaign to CNN, NBC and ABC. ""It was huge for me,"" Thomas said. ""It showed me that the skills I may have taken for granted were very valuable to others. Here I was doing what just came natural to me -- working with the media -- and I'm helping an iconic figure. It gave me such a feeling of gratification, and it gave me so much more confidence."" But snagging Johnson as her first client wasn't easy. She had to start with smaller steps -- and the first step was a doozy: dealing with the fear. ""For me, it was fear of failure,"" she said. ""Anyone who has worked with me knows I am driven to succeed, and failure is not an option."" ""But I'm a woman of faith,"" said Thomas, a preacher's daughter with strong ties to her church. ""Friends told me that 'faith will give you the wings to fly when you jump off that cliff.' "" One way new consultants can boost their confidence is by compiling a list of experience and skills they've gained during the past five years -- including successful projects, implementations and innovations. Experts recommend referring to that list whenever confidence dips. Thomas said she chose an area of consulting that was based on what she enjoys. ""Ask yourself, 'What would I do if I had to work for free?' "" she says. Another tip: Find a mentor. ""Identify someone who's successful and ask for practical advice,"" she says. ""I found my mentor at my church."" Set aside time and money for a vacation, and guard it like gold, Thomas advises. Also, she says, determine how much income you need to stay afloat each month, and focus on that target like a laser. To be safe, experts advise aspiring consultants to start small, as a side business, while continuing to work elsewhere full time. But during a recession, keeping a full-time job and easing into consulting work isn't always possible. Unemployment has prompted many experienced professionals to launch consultant operations simply to survive. ""With the way the market has gone recently, there's no shortage of people who are now saying that they're consultants -- and many of them are not qualified to be consultants,"" said Les Rubenovitch, president of Toronto-based Winning Edge Consultants Inc. ""Working for a company as an employee is very different from working for a company as a consultant. The credibility factor is critical if someone is going to engage you."" Those looking to quickly build credibility or credentials to accompany work experience may consider offering to do speaking engagements at a local college or university. Thomas showed her initiative by teaching herself to organize and lead an online seminar -- a Webinar -- aimed at showing doctors how to better communicate on TV. Financial planning is key to the success of a new consultant operation, according to experts. Thomas set aside savings to live on during the initial phase of her business. It took well into her first year for her business income to fully support her, Thomas says. That's better than most new consultant businesses, experts say. It's not unusual for new consultant businesses to take three years to make a profit. Thomas says she's still not making as much money as she did in TV news, but she expects to reach that mark this year. She works about the same number of hours now as she did as a journalist -- about 40 per week, if not more. ""The big difference is, the hours aren't straight through -- they vary."" That's not to say that Thomas hasn't made mistakes. ""Don't assume that things will come right away,"" she advises. ""Realize that the opportunities that come to you may not be in the form of money -- but they're still valuable."" Also worth keeping in mind: Don't overwork yourself. ""I'm still learning this,"" Thomas said. ""I jumped in with both feet in the fire. Don't burn yourself out."" If she were launching her business all over again, she says, she would build more ""me"" time into her schedule. ""I may take a day at the beginning of the week where I don't take clients and do paperwork -- or I just get a massage."" What's the best thing about being your own boss? Thomas laughs sheepishly. ""I can sleep in if I want to -- and schedule an appointment for lunch instead of early morning.""","Journalist leaves TV to launch consulting business .

"(CNN) -- Ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya will be granted safe passage to the Dominican Republic as a guest, resolving a diplomatic impasse that kept him trapped in Honduras, Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez said Wednesday. Zelaya, who has been staying at the Brazilian embassy in Honduras, would leave for the Dominican Republic on Tuesday, Fernandez said. The deal was reached with Honduran President-elect Porfirio ""Pepe"" Lobo, with the defeated presidential candidates in last November's election signing the accord as witnesses. Lobo takes office next week. Granting Zelaya safe conduct out of Honduras, where he is wanted on charges of abuse of power, is the first step toward re-engaging Honduras with the international community that repudiated the coup, Lobo said at a news conference Thursday. Despite polls showing that amnesty for Zelaya remains unpopular, Lobo said that having an ex-president locked up inside an embassy is not the kind of image that will move the country forward. The agreement will allow Zelaya, his family, and members of his inner circle to leave for the Dominican Republic as guests, rather than under political asylum, a fine point that derailed previous efforts at negotiating his exit. ""This is an exit with dignity,"" Fernandez said, adding that Zelaya has indicated that his final destination likely will be Mexico. Zelaya was ousted in a June 28 coup. After spending months in exile, Zelaya sneaked back into Honduras in September, and has not left the Brazilian embassy. His return was an effort to restart talks to negotiate his return as president. That never happened. An agreement was eventually signed, but its implementation has been half-hearted, and Zelaya later called the deal dead. A previous effort for Zelaya's exit, a petition from Mexico last month, was rejected by the de facto government of Roberto Micheletti because it did not give Zelaya the status of having been granted political asylum.","Jose Manuel Zelaya has been at the Brazilian embassy in Honduras .

"Washington (CNN) -- Three U.S. Navy SEALs face criminal charges after the alleged mastermind of one of the most notorious crimes against Americans in Iraq accused them of punching him after his capture, the military said Wednesday. Ahmed Hashim Abed -- thought to be behind the slayings and mutilation of four U.S. contractors in Falluja in 2004 and captured in summer -- made the accusations against the three servicemen, said Lt. Col. Holly Silkman, a spokeswoman for U.S. Central Command. A civilian lawyer for one of three SEALs said his client and the other SEALs declined a nonjudicial resolution to the case, a step sometimes called a ""captain's mast."" The servicemen say they did not harm the detainee in any way and they want their names cleared in a court-martial so they can continue their careers in the Navy, said the attorney, Neil Puckett. Because the charges against Petty Officer 2nd Class Matthew McCabe, Petty Officer Jonathan Keefe and Petty Officer Julio Heurtas are the military equivalent of misdemeanors, they will go before a special court-martial, which is for less serious offenses than those heard in a general court-martial. If found guilty, they could be sentenced to a maximum of a year in a military prison, demotion to the lowest Navy rank, a cut in pay and a bad conduct discharge. But if found innocent of all charges, they would be able to continue their careers with no record of the case in their personnel files. The three SEALs are with their unit in Norfolk, Virginia. They will make an initial appearance before a military judge on December 7. The court-martial is scheduled to begin in January. The attorney said he expects the SEALs will not waive their constitutional right to confront the accuser in court, which could cause a logistical challenge. Abed is believed to be in a U.S. military detention center overseas, and it is unclear if the military would want him brought to the United States for the court-martial. The four contractors, one of whom was a former Navy SEAL, were working for the Blackwater company when they were attacked in Falluja in 2004. After they were killed with hand grenades and rifles, their bodies were set on fire and dragged through the streets. The bodies of two of them were hung from a bridge in Falluja, an image that was broadcast around the world. Four days after the attack, the U.S. Marines launched a major offensive inside Falluja, in part to help find the killers.","Ahmed Hashim Abed is accused of planning the '04 slayings and mutilations of 4 U.S. contractors .

"Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- Heavily populated parts of Chile still were without water service and electricity Sunday night because of Saturday's 8.8-magnitude earthquake, and reports of looting raised fears about security in some areas. The nation's hardest-hit major city, Concepcion, declared an overnight curfew. The death count from the earthquake doubled on Sunday from a day earlier, to 708 deaths. Calling Saturday morning's quake an ""unthinkable disaster,"" Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said a state of catastrophe in the hardest-hit regions would continue, allowing for the restoration of order and speedy distribution of aid. Looting broke out in parts of the country, including in Concepcion in central coastal Chile, about 70 miles (112 kilometers) from the earthquake's epicenter. Desperate residents scrounged for water and supplies inside empty and damaged supermarkets. On Sunday morning, authorities used tear gas and water cannons to disperse looters in some areas. The quake struck before dawn Saturday, toppling thousands of houses and dealing a serious blow to one of Latin America's most stable economies. The Chilean Red Cross reported that about 500,000 homes had considerable damage as a result of the quake. Did you feel the quake? Share photos, videos, info with CNN . Chilean President-elect Sebastian Piñera, scheduled to take office in March, warned Sunday that looting could grow worse with nightfall. He called for more government help in restoring order. ""Tonight we will experience a very, very difficult situation with public order, particularly in the area of Concepcion,"" Piñera told Radio Bio Bio. Concepcion, the capital of the Bio Bio region, didn't have enough police to control all those seeking food and supplies from stores. Some became desperate as supermarkets closed and gasoline was unavailable, CNN Chile reported. On Sunday afternoon, people were seen entering a mill looking for ingredients for bread. In the evening, a CNN team passed a dozen gas stations that were being looted, with people siphoning gas. Military officers were guarding a few gas stations, but few other signs of a government response could be seen. Looting was being done not just by desperate residents, but by others who were merely opportunistic, said Concepcion mayor Van Rysselberghe. ""They are robbing everything,"" she said, asking for a stronger military response to restore calm. In addition to food, gas and emergency supplies, looters were targeting appliance and electronics stores, Van Rysselberghe said. Watch chaotic scene in damaged supermarket . Some small business owners resorted to protecting their shops with rifles and shotguns, said Rysselberghe, who also considered the current police force inadequate. Concepcion is under curfew from 9 p.m. Sunday to 6 a.m. Monday because of the looting. The city government is distributing water from the central plaza. Concepcion and its adjacent sister city of Talcahuano, Chile, have a population of 840,000. Video from Concepcion showed collapsed walls of buildings exposing twisted rebar. Whole sides of buildings were sheared off, and at least two structures were on fire. Chile's Office of Emergency Management launched a C130 helicopter Sunday with a contingent of 40 specialized firefighters and 10 search dogs for the rescue effort in Concepcion. People in their homes lacked electricity. Hundreds faced sleeping in tents on Sunday night. Bachelet said her government reached an agreement with the country's major supermarkets that would allow them to give away basic foodstuffs to those affected by the quake. The armed forces were available to help with security and the distribution of food, she said. In Concepcion on Sunday, a long line of people waited for foodstuffs as military personnel stood watch. ""I have nothing,"" one woman told CNN Chile. ""I have no bread. I am a widow. I am 81 years old."" Of the 708 reported dead as of Sunday afternoon, 541 had died in Chile's Maule region, and 64 in the Bio Bio region, both in south-central Chile. ""I am certain that these are numbers that will continue to grow,"" Bachelet said. Bachelet said Saturday that some 2 million people had been affected in one way or another, but she did not elaborate. More than 90 aftershocks had been recorded, ranging from 4.9 to 6.9 in magnitude. A 6.2-magnitude aftershock was recorded near the earthquake's epicenter on Sunday. Chile has received many offers of international aid and will accept the help that it needs, Bachelet said. The U.S. military and the U.S. Agency for International Development were working to provide satellite phones, the State Department said Sunday. ""The Chilean government has not yet accepted additional offers of assistance, pending the completion of an assessment of specific needs,"" State Department spokeswoman Megan Mattson said, noting the airport in Santiago, Chile, was closed to foreign aid. ""As soon as the Chilean government establishes additional needs, the United States stands ready to assist in disaster response efforts,"" she said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will be traveling to Santiago on Tuesday on a previously scheduled trip through Latin America. She had originally been scheduled to arrive Monday. Bachelet said she hoped that the airport in Santiago, the capital, would reopen soon to private, public and commercial air traffic. The country's Department of Emergency Management said Sunday that repairs at the airport would take 48 hours. The airline LAN Chile said that three flights left from Peru to Chile on Sunday, one of them landing in Santiago. These flights were not commercial, but were transporting Chileans stranded in Peru back to their country, LAN Chile spokesman Roberto Davila told CNN en Español. Piñera sought to rally spirits in nationally televised remarks Sunday night, announcing a reconstruction plan called ""Up With Chile."" ""We will raise Chile,"" he said. ""It's not going to be a short task, it's not going to be easy. It will require a lot of effort, a lot of resources, and a lot of time."" Saturday's quake was 700 to 800 times stronger than the 7.0-magnitude quake that struck Haiti in January, which left about 212,000 people dead and more than 1 million homeless. Chile's quake also occurred at a greater depth -- 21.7 miles -- than the 8.1-mile depth of the Haiti quake, which contributed to much of the damage there. Coastal Chile has a history of deadly earthquakes, with 13 temblors of magnitude 7.0 or higher since 1973, the U.S. Geological Survey said. As a result, experts said that newer buildings are constructed to help withstand the shocks.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- When baseball slugger Mark McGwire admitted he had used steroids in his record-breaking 1998 season, he recalled refusing to talk about the subject in his 2005 testimony to Congress. ""After all this time, I want to come clean,"" McGwire announced. ""I was not in a position to do that five years ago in my congressional testimony, but now I feel an obligation to discuss this and to answer questions about it. I'll do that, and then I just want to help my team."" McGwire's admission come as the House Judiciary Committee has been investigating the problem of brain injuries to football players, following heated discussions October 28, when the committee aggressively questioned NFL officials to figure out why the league had done so little to curb this well-known problem. Any government inquiry of this kind draws the familiar charge that politicians should stay out of the business of sports -- even though the NFL and NCAA have in fact responded to congressional pressure by instituting rules to protect players from brain damage. Still, Texas Rep. Lamar Smith said, we ""should also avoid the temptation to legislate in this area. Football -- like soccer, rugby and even basketball and baseball -- involves contact that can produce injuries. We cannot legislate the elimination of injuries from the games without eliminating the games themselves."" This is a familiar refrain. Back in 2005, when several committees investigated the use of steroids in baseball, numerous sports officials warned this was not an issue with which Congress should concern itself. Yet insisting on a firewall between sports and politics ignores the long-standing relationship between these two parts of American society. At the state and local level, sports teams depend on government assistance. There have been a large number of public subsidies, ranging from appropriations for stadium construction to the placement of public transportation near stadiums to tax breaks which the sports industry has depended on for growth. At the federal level, sports owners have also benefited from government. In 1922, the Supreme Court exempted baseball from the antitrust laws. As a result of this, baseball owners were allowed to maintain their monopoly, stifling efforts to launch other leagues and using the exemption to collude on limiting the salaries of players. Some legislators introduced bills trying to overturn the decision, but Congress never passed them. When the Senate held hearings about the exemption in 1958, a number of famous players, including Mickey Mantle and Jackie Robinson, showed up to speak about how the ""reserve clause"" undermined the rights of players. Congress refused to take any action. Free agency did not start until the 1980s. It was only in 1998 that Congress finally passed legislation declaring that some rules, such as restrictions on the movement of players from one team to another, were subject to antitrust laws. Football has a political history of its own. According to the sports historian Richard Davies, the National Football League started a team in New Orleans in 1966, right after Rep. Hale Boggs and Sen. Russell Long of Louisiana helped push through legislation that exempted the NFL from antitrust laws so that there could be a merger with the successful American Football League. When New York Rep. Emanuel Celler insisted on long hearings to decide whether this was permissible, Sen. Long, desperate for a team, short-circuited the legislative process by having the Senate pass a bill by acclamation and attaching it to important anti-inflation tax legislation. The House, under pressure, agreed to the bill at the last minute. ""We couldn't have merged if Congress hadn't passed the law,"" said NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle. ""And without a merger, we couldn't have had a Super Bowl. If we'd tried to do it on our own, the antitrust people would have challenged us sooner than later."" There is also a long history of congressional investigations into sports. In 1960, the Senate conducted hearings about the influence of organized crime in professional boxing. Americans were shocked when former middleweight champion Jake LaMotta admitted that he had thrown a fight against Billy Fox in November 1947. Members of the mafia threatened to kill LaMotta, but he testified anyway. During similar hearings in 1961, the boxer Rocky Marciano told legislators that ""it seems absolutely essential that a federal czar be named to head the professional sport of boxing."" Many years later, in 2007, Congress looked into the pension and disability plans of the NFL after complaints by injured players that they were being denied coverage. Congress has been willing to legislate. On October 9, 1996, President Clinton signed the Professional Boxing Safety Act into law, which defined minimum health and safety standards for the sport. The legislation aimed to strengthen the patchwork regulations used by states to monitor the sport. But investigations usually don't produce legislation. In 2005, Congress failed to pass the Clean Sports Act or the Drug Free Sports Act in response to revelations of drug use. Even so, investigations do help raise public awareness about problems and create public pressure on the industry to reform. ""When there is not any regulation,"" said former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield, ""it can cause someone to lose their dream, their hopes...."" While some issues, such as the recent investigation into the college bowl system, are easy fodder for ridicule, others, such as brain damage to NFL players, show where the government has a legitimate role. After all, sports is big business, and the playing field is a workplace where regulations are needed. Unfortunately, the sports leagues themselves have not taken an aggressive approach to dealing with this problem. In the same way that baseball owners understood that steroids produced more crowd-pleasing home runs, football owners know that the kind of hard-hitting football that creates injuries often brings crowds to their feet. The government must help guide the industry toward better practices. There is a precedent for investigation. And sports has depended too much on government to now claim to be a free agent. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: McGwire steroids case reminds why congressional inquiry can be useful .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria's ailing president has broken two months of silence to assure his countrymen that contrary to speculation he is alive and intending to return to power soon. President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua this week gave his first media interview since being admitted to a hospital in Saudi Arabia in late November where he is being treated for acute pericarditis, an inflammation of tissue around the heart. His absence has created a power vacuum in Africa's most populous country, as Yar'Adua has not formally handed his presidential duties to Vice-president Goodluck Jonathan. In a phone interview with the BBC from his hospital bed Tuesday, President Yar'Adua said he was recovering from his treatment. ""At the moment I'm undergoing treatment. I'm getting better from the treatment. I hope that very soon there will be tremendous progress to allow me to get back home,"" he said. ""As soon as my doctors discharge me I'll return to Nigeria to resume my duties,"" he added. Yar'Adua's interview coincided with demonstrations in the nation's capital, Abuja, where protesters demanded a constitutional order on his absence and ""evidence about his true state of health,"" Voice of Nigeria reported. The Nigerian Senate is seeking also information on the president's whereabouts and health. It passed a resolution Tuesday asking Nigeria's ""secretary to the government of the federation"" to brief it on Yar'Adua's status, Voice of Nigeria reported. The Senate had earlier considered sending a delegation to Saudi Arabia. ""In arriving at its decision, the Senate expressed concern that there had been no formal communication to the National Assembly"" -- as required by the nation's constitution -- ""(to) empower the vice president to act and perform the functions of the president,"" Voice of Nigeria reported. Some senators also pushed for an amendment to a law stating that a presidential letter to the National Assembly about an absence is optional, the news organization reported. Foreign Minister Ojo Maduekwe told CNN he has not spoken to Yar'Adua since he left for Saudi Arabia. But he also said he has no need to talk to the president while he is recovering. Yar'Adua's illness was diagnosed in November after he complained of chest pain following prayers at a mosque in Abuja. He was taken to King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Jeddah, where he had his last checkup in August, his doctor said. He said at the time he did not intend to resign while in Saudi Arabia. In addition to internal discord over its missing president, the oil-rich nation has faced some international heat after one of its citizens allegedly attempted to blow up a U.S.-bound flight on Christmas Day. Nigeria was then cited as a country from which enhanced security measures would be enforced for passengers on U.S.-bound flights. A senior U.S. administration official said Nigeria fell into the U.S. Transportation Security Administration category of ""state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest."" Another notable worry for the government is its handling of militants who have wrestled with the government over oil. On Tuesday, police announced that four Shell contractors had been abducted. Hundreds others have been kidnapped over recent years. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","Nigeria's president says in a phone interview that he is alive and recovering from treatment .

"(CNN) -- Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo lifted martial law in the country's south, which she declared after the massacre of 57 people last month, Philippine news outlets reported Saturday. The order lifting martial law was due to be effective at 9 p.m. (8 a.m. ET) Saturday, the Philippines News Agency (PNA) and CNN affiliate ABS-CBN said. Military troops will remain in Maguindanao province to keep the peace despite the move, said Victor Ibrado, chief of staff of the Philippine armed forces, PNA said. Arroyo imposed martial law December 4 but lifted it Saturday after deciding it had achieved its objectives, Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita said, according to PNA. Local government was now back in power and the justice system was functioning again, he said. Authorities have said the November 23 massacre in Maguindanao province was a politically motivated attempt to keep an opponent of the politically powerful Ampatuan family from running for governor. Thirty journalists were among those killed. The martial law allowed arrests without warrants, and at least six members of the Ampatuan family -- including a local mayor -- were arrested, according to ABS-CBN. Authorities raided a warehouse and ranch belonging to the family last weekend and confiscated firearms, ammunition and vehicles, Maj. Randolph Cabangbang, deputy of operations for the eastern Mindanao command, told CNN. Ermita said Saturday that three charges of multiple murders were filed in court, and that 24 people were charged with rebellion. The Philippine National Police has referred nearly 900 other cases to the Department of Justice, he said. Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the Philippines. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media. The victims included the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation.","Reports: Order lifting martial law was due to be effective at 9 p.m. (8 a.m. ET) Saturday .

"Dubai, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Australia warned Israel Thursday of a possible diplomatic rift if Israel condoned the use of fraudulent Australian passports in the killing of a Hamas leader. Israel's ambassador was given the warning after it was learned that three Australian passports were used by members of an alleged assassination crew connected to the recent slaying of a Hamas leader in a Dubai hotel room, Australia's Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said Thursday. ""I made it crystal clear to the ambassador that if the results of that investigation cause us to come to the conclusion that the abuse of Australian passports was in any way sponsored or condoned by Israeli officials, then Australia would not regard that as the act of a friend, ""Smith said Thursday. "" We would not regard that as the act of a friend."" The stern statement from Smith is part of the growing international diplomatic tiff stemming from the January 20 killing of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founding member of Hamas' military wing. Al-Mabhouh was found dead in his hotel room January 20. Police believe he was killed the night before and suspect the Mossad, the secretive Israeli foreign intelligence unit, was behind his slaying. A total of 26 suspects have been identified by Dubai police. The suspects are believed to have acquired faulty passports to arrive in Dubai for the killing and then fled to other far-flung locations, police said. The 26 named suspects do not include two Palestinians previously arrested in Jordan and returned to the UAE. Twelve of the suspects used British passports, police said. Six suspects used Irish passports and four suspects used French passports. Along with the three suspects who used Australian passports, another suspect used a German passport . The European Union this week condemned the use of false EU passports in connection with the al-Mabhouh slaying. Authorities have not said how he died, al-Mabhouh's family was told there were signs of electric shocks on his legs, behind his ears, on his genitals and over his heart. Blood on a pillow led police to believe he was suffocated, the family was told. The killers left some of al-Mabhouh's medicine next to his bed in an apparent effort to suggest his death was not suspicious, police said. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has said only ""media reports"" link Israel to al-Mabhouh's death. CNN's Roya Shadravan contributed to this report.","Australian passports used by members of alleged assassination crew .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. military is gearing up for a possible influx of Haitians fleeing their earthquake-stricken country at an Army facility not widely known for its humanitarian missions: Guantanamo Bay. Soldiers at the base have set up tents, beds and toilets, awaiting possible orders from the secretary of defense to proceed, according to Maj. Diana Haynie, a spokeswoman for Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay. ""There's no indication of any mass migration from Haiti,"" Haynie stressed. ""We have not been told to conduct migrant operations."" But the base is getting ready ""as a prudent measure,"" Haynie said, since ""it takes some time to set things up."" Guantanamo Bay is about 200 miles from Haiti. Currently, military personnel at the base are helping the earthquake relief effort by shipping bottled water and food from its warehouse. In addition, Gen. Douglas Fraser, commander of U.S. Southern Command, said the Navy has set up a ""logistics field,"" an area to support bigger ships in the region. The military can now use that as a ""lily pad"" to fly supplies from ships docked at Guantanamo over to Haiti, he said. ""Guantanamo Bay proves its value as a strategic hub for the movement of supplies and personnel to the affected areas in Haiti,"" Haynie said. As part of the precautionary measures to prepare for possible refugees, the Army has erected 100 tents, each holding 10 beds, according to Haynie. Toilet facilities are nearby. If needed, hundreds more tents are stored in Guantanamo Bay and can be erected, she said. The refugees would be put on the leeward side of the island, more than 2 miles from some 200 detainees being held on the other side, Haynie said. The refugees would not mix with the detainees. Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay is responsible for planning for any kind of Caribbean mass immigration, according to Haynie.

"KRASNOYARSK, Russia (CNN)  -- ""It kept you alive,"" a tearful Dwight Griffith told his adopted son as the two looked at an infant incubator during a tour of the Russian hospital where he was born. Alex Griffith, 16, raised more than $60,000 for a new playground at the Russian hospital where he was born. More than a decade after L.S. Berzon City Clinical Hospital No. 20 cared for him, 16-year-old Alex Griffith wanted to show his gratitude. ""Russia is part of me and this hospital is part of me. They gave me life, so I [wanted] to give back to them, to give them a fun place to play,"" said Alex, who lives in Forest Hill, Maryland. As part of a Boy Scout project, Alex donated hundreds of hours and raised tens of thousands of dollars to build a new playground for the hospital. Alex -- originally named Sergey -- was abandoned by his parents shortly after he was born at the hospital in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk. He weighed less than 2 pounds and doctors said he had a mild case of cerebral palsy. His condition improved slightly over the next 11 months, when Dwight and Jenny Griffith adopted him. ""The first time we saw Alex, he had rickets and he was malnourished,"" remembered Dwight Griffith. ""At first Alex did not smile and hardly moved.""  Watch Alex visit the hospital for the first time in 15 years » . Alex grew healthier throughout his childhood and became active in the Boy Scouts. In 2007, he set out to build a new playground at Hospital 20 as his service project to become an Eagle Scout, the highest earned rank of the Boy Scouts of America. But the teenager had his work cut out for him. In photos his parents took when they traveled to Russia to adopt him, Alex saw that the existing playground had a single rusty swing with a rotten wooden seat and a sandbox that he described as ""a mud pit because of all the rain."" ""I was just like, 'Wow, that's a lot different,' "" he said. Alex devoted 2 ½ years to his Krasnoyarsk Playground Project. In addition to recruiting more than 500 volunteers in five countries, he raised more than $60,000 by soliciting help from local Rotary Clubs and joining forces with other Boy Scouts for candy sales, car washes and barbeque fundraisers. Alex oversaw every aspect of production, from designing and purchasing the playground to shipping equipment overseas. The project is a hit. Young patients and their families now have at their disposal swings, a rock wall, a climbing bridge and 5-foot tall zip slides. The playground is painted red, white and blue and the entrance has two totem poles: a bear for Russia and an eagle for America.  Watch children enjoy the state-of-the-art playground » . Alex and a small group of volunteers traveled to Hospital 20 in early August to set up the playground. A dedication ceremony was held there on August 12 -- Alex's birthday. ""It makes me feel awesome opening the playground on my 16th birthday,"" he said. ""It's just made me really happy just being here."" The people of Krasnoyarsk have embraced the teenager, especially the children. ""I like this playground, because when you slide on it all the sadness goes away,"" said 11-year-old Sonja Sultanova. ""I think that Alex is a noble person."" Alex no longer shows signs of cerebral palsy, but he does have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, impulsivity and a frail frame. His parents believe some of his conditions relate to his time in the hospital, due to a small staff with a lack of resources to provide enough care for the babies. Still, he and his parents are thankful he is doing as well as he is, having grown into a typical suburban teenager alongside his four adopted siblings. He enjoys riding his dirt bike and playing video games. Alex anticipates finding out if he becomes an Eagle Scout within the next couple months, but he is already satisfied with the outcome. ""This project has been a lot of fun and other kids who have been adopted are contacting me asking for advice,"" he said. ""I am going to do whatever I can to help them."" Want to get involved?

"London, England (CNN) -- A British auction house plans to sell off newly discovered sketches done by Adolf Hitler when he was a struggling student trying desperately to get into art school. The 12 charcoal and crayon sketches cover ""typical student subjects"" and don't display a great deal of promise, Mullock's Auctioneers said. They include two drawings of an elderly woman thought to be Hitler's mother, as well as studies of objects, landscapes, models, and even a Roman senator. All are signed and some even have Hitler's Vienna address, Mullock's said. The sale also includes the original portfolio in which Hitler kept the sketches, which is signed and has his address, Mullock's said. ""They look quite typical of an aspiring student hoping to get into art school -- tentative and not very certain about his perspective when he's using pencil and pen, making basic errors by getting the top and the bottom of a candlestick wrong in relation to each other, and so on,"" said Michael Liversidge, emeritus dean of arts at Bristol University in England. Letter by Hitler to Britain sells at auction . The sketches lack technical skill but are ""not so bad that one can't imagine him learning. ""But there's not latent genius here, and not much beyond a moderate school grade,"" Liversidge said. ""Probably if the artist was at school today you wouldn't encourage him to keep the subject up."" The sketches have been owned by a professional artist who had them for years in his own collection and for his own interest, said Richard Westwood-Brookes, the historical documents expert at Mullock's. The artist brought the works to Mullock's attention. Mullock's plans to auction the sketches April 15 in Ludlow, England, about 125 miles northwest of London. They're expected to bring between £4,000 and £6,000 (about $6,100 and $9,100) each, the auction house said. The drawings all date from around 1908 and 1909, when Hitler was a ""penniless dropout"" trying to get accepted into the prestigious Vienna Academy of Fine Arts to train as a professional artist, Mullock's said. The school rejected him twice, so Hitler hung around the city, trying to make a living producing watercolors to sell to tourists, Mullock's said. The rejection by the academy may have had huge implications for Hitler later in life, Westwood-Brookes said. ""Many believe that it was this rejection that turned his mind and unleashed the monster within him, which was to bring forth so much evil on the world,"" he said. ""... In a sense, therefore, the academic decision of the art establishment in Vienna can go down as one of the most monumental decisions in all of history."" Nevertheless, Westwood-Brookes said, ""On the evidence of these sketches, you can see why the Vienna Academy turned him away.""","The 12 sketches date from when Adolf Hitler was trying to get into art school .

"(CNN)  -- Mirror, mirror on the wall -- tell me my body faults, one and all. That's what a lot of women ask their mirrors to tell them, at least until they get a boyfriend or a husband they can torture with the dreaded question, ""Does this dress (or blouse, pair of pants, skirt, etc.) make me look fat?"" But even when women get the answer to that no-win question, what can they do? How do you disguise those thunder-thighs or flappy arms or muffin-top middles? You might want to choose between high-fat and no-fat clothes. That's right -- no-fat clothes. They're the outfits that can take 10 pounds off your problem area, according to Charla Krupp, who wrote ""How to Never Look Fat Again."" Her mantra is: ""It's not you, it's your clothes."" ""All women know the language of food,"" says Krupp, so she describes how to look your best in food terms. But not the old-fashioned terms of body shapes being either apple or pear, because women's ""body issues can range from a wide face all the way down to cankles."" It's not just a matter of vanity; the author cites research finding that fat can keep people from getting hired. The ingredients to her ""never looking fat system"" are: fabric, fit, styles and colors. High-fat clothes come in shiny metallic or sequin outfits in bright or neon colors that either fit too loose or too tight. Low-fat clothes come in darker hues of silk or cotton or wool gabardine and fit perfectly. ""I didn't want to sugar-coat anything,"" says Krupp. She doesn't. She gives information not even your most blunt best friend would tell you about what will make you look your best or your worst. There also is a Don't You Dare section in every chapter. Krupp goes so far as to tell how the part in your hair or your eyewear choice can help you see a beautiful woman or Humpty-Dumpty in the mirror. But there is hope. She says even women size 16 or 18 can look their best if they make the right choices. Those begin with what's under the outfits. ""You need good supportive shapewear. It will slim you down,"" she says, adding a good one will have a high waist, right under the bra band, and will go down to whatever your problem area is. To smooth out the dreaded back fat that can ruin your appearance, she suggests wearing a control camisole over your bra to ""compress and flatten"" the roll that could follow you everywhere. She also advises to not fall head over heels in love with a trend that is bad for you. ""I do see a lot of women walking around and I wonder, how did she go out of the house in the morning looking at that?"" says Krupp. ""They fall in love with a fashion trend even if it doesn't work for them. ... 'I know this is going to make me look fat, but I don't care.' "" Krupp says the wrong trend can be brutal for a woman. ""Transparency is big now, but if you have fat, you don't want the world to see that -- you want to cover it up."" She says the celebrities that always look good in their clothes are Sandra Bullock and Demi Moore. But she notes that even if you're rich and famous and in great shape, you don't always make the best choices, even if you have a paid stylist to help. She noted two such fashion mistakes from the recent Academy Awards. Jennifer Lopez's gown with a big bustle and train was a bad, or ""high-fat,"" choice for a woman with a wide backside. And she said Charlize Theron's Dior Haute Couture dress of amethyst and lilac with rosettes on her bust was just a ""really bad choice."" ""They really should sue their stylists for malpractice,"" says Krupp. Or they could trade the stylist for Krupp's book. Charla Krupp is married to Richard Zoglin, assistant managing editor of TIME, which, like CNN, is a division of Time Warner.","Charla Krupp's newest book explains ""How to Never Look Fat Again""

"(CNN) -- A Lebanese man charged with sorcery and sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia is scheduled to be beheaded on Friday, the man's lawyer said Wednesday. May El Khansa, the attorney for Ali Hussain Sibat, told CNN that she and Sibat's family were informed about the upcoming execution. She said she heard from a source in Saudi Arabia with knowledge of the case and the proceedings that Saudi authorities ""will carry out the execution."" The Saudi Ministry of Justice could not immediately be reached for comment on the matter. El Khansa said she has appealed to Lebanon's prime minister, Saad Hariri, and president, Michel Suleiman, to stop the execution. Amnesty International, the human rights group, has called on Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to block it as well. TV presenter gets death sentence for 'sorcery' Sibat is the former host of a popular call-in show that aired on Beirut-based satellite TV channel ""Sheherazade."" According to his lawyer, Sibat would predict the future on his show and give out advice to his audience. El Khansa told CNN her client was arrested by Saudi Arabia's religious police (known as the Mutawa'een) and charged with sorcery while visiting the country in May 2008. Sibat was in Saudi Arabia to perform the Islamic religious pilgrimage known as Umra. Sibat was then put on trial, and in November 2009, a court in the Saudi city of Medina found him guilty and sentenced him to death. According to El Khansa, Sibat appealed the verdict. The case was taken up by the Court of Appeal in the Saudi city of Mecca on the grounds that the initial verdict was ""premature."" El Khansa tells CNN that the Mecca appeals court then sent the case back to the original court for reconsideration, stipulating that all charges made against Sibat needed to be verified and that he should be given a chance to repent. On March 10, judges in Medina upheld their initial verdict, meaning Sibat is once again sentenced to be executed. ""The Medina court refused the sentence of the appeals court,"" said El Khansa, adding her client will appeal the verdict once more.","Ali Hussain Sibat faces execution by beheading on Friday .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- A winter storm named ""Xynthia"" battered the western coast of Europe Sunday, its high winds downing trees and power lines and leaving as many as 55 people dead, authorities said. Hardest hit was France, where at least 45 people were killed, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon announced. The extra-tropical cyclone whipped the country's coastal regions and moved inland, bringing sometimes heavy flooding with it. Are you affected by the storm? Share images and information with CNN iReport. ""It's a national catastrophe,"" Fillon said in a brief news conference following an emergency meeting on the situation. ""Many people drowned, surprised by the rapid rise of the water. ""Now the priority is to bring all the people left homeless and still threatened by the rising waters to safety,"" the prime minister explained. ""All services are mobilized to reach that goal as soon as possible."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy will visit the department of Charente-Maritime Monday, Fillon said. Charente-Maritime and Vendee, on the French coast west of Paris, had severe flooding when the strong winds whipped up the water at high tide. ""At 3 o'clock in the morning, we heard the toilets backing up. We got up to look and then we saw 80 cm (about 31 inches) of water in the garage,"" a resident of Aiguillon-Sur-Mer, in the department of Vendee, told CNN affiliate BFM-TV. ""It was rushing in, it broke down the walls around the garden and the gate."" Hundreds of people had to be rescued from their rooftops overnight. ""The water was up to the gutters,"" said one woman, who spent the night on the roof with her children. Residents of the village of Aytre, in Charente-Maritime, saw a wave of water measuring 1 meter high (about 1 yard) come into the center of town. One couple told BFM-TV their children were airlifted and they were taken out by boat. ""It rose very high, very high, we were very scared,"" another man told the station. ""It was unreal,"" Aytre Mayor Suzanne Tallard told BFM-TV. At least 1 million households were without power Sunday afternoon, Bernard Lassus of Electricite de France said in an interview on BFM-TV. French Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux told BFM-TV that 350 soldiers and 3,250 firefighters have been mobilized. About 10 helicopters are being used to airlift people, he said, and draining operations were underway. The high winds -- at times spiking to 200 km/h (124 mph) -- reached inland as far as Paris, where as many as 100 flights were canceled at the Paris-Charles de Gaulle International Airport, BFM reported. Gusts up to 175 km/h (108 mph) were measured at the top of the Eiffel Tower Saturday, reported CNN International Meteorologist Eboni Deon. The hurricane-strength winds stretched from Portugal northeast to the Netherlands. The system was moving toward the Baltic Sea, Deon said, and a second front was moving into the region of Portugal and Spain later in the day. In Spain, three people were killed in the first band of the storm, Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Sunday. Two children died in a car accident and another person was killed in northwestern Spain, the minister said in a news conference on CNN sister station CNN+. At least 17 provinces were on high alert due to the strong winds, CNN+ reported, and some flights and train services were canceled. A 10-year-old child was killed by a falling tree in the high winds in Portugal, Patricia Gaspar, National Operations Assistant with the Portuguese National Authority for Civil Protection, confirmed to CNN. There are also some power outages in the country, Gaspar said. Some residents have reported roofs blown off and smaller houses collapsing, she added. Four people were killed in Germany as a result of the storm, officials said -- all four when they or their cars were struck by falling trees. One of them, a 69-year-old man, was a hiker in a group of about 20, police said, but the others were evacuated to safety. A man was also killed by a falling tree in Belgium, Peter Mertens, a spokesman for Belgium's Interior Ministry, confirmed to CNN. Eastern Belgium has seen the worst of the storm, Mertens said. ""They've had problems with fallen trees, roofs blown off and electricity cables not working. But it seems the worst part has passed now,"" he added. The storm also reached England, where one woman was reported dead when the vehicle she was driving became submerged and washed down a swollen creek in the northeastern part of the country. The body of the 53-year-old woman was recovered downstream, North Yorkshire Police said in a recorded phone message to the media.

"(CNN) -- Togo, who pulled out of the Africa Cup of Nations soccer competition after a terrorist attack on their team bus, have been suspended from taking part in the next two competitions. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) also announced on Saturday that the team would be fined $50,000. Why Togo ban rubs salt into open wounds . Three people were killed in the attack, which took place while Togo travelled to the team hotel two days before their opening match earlier this month. Communications chief Stanislas Ocloo and assistant coach Abalo Amnalete were shot dead and goalkeeper, Kodjovi Obilale, was among the injured. Togo, captained by Manchester City star Emmanuel Adebayor, wanted to continue despite the attack but quit on their national government's orders. The attack raised fears about security for the World Cup, which takes place in South Africa later this year.

"(CNN) -- A Buffalo, New York-area man accused of beheading his estranged wife made his first appearance in court Wednesday to face murder charges, according to the district attorney. Muzzammil Hassan has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of his wife, Aasiya Zubair Hassan. Muzzammil Hassan, 44, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of his 37-year-old wife, Aasiya Zubair Hassan, days after she filed for divorce and was granted a restraining order against him. In court Wednesday, Hassan waived his right to a felony hearing, according to Erie County District Attorney Frank Sedita III. The case will go before a grand jury in the next 45 days. In the meantime, Hassan will be jailed without bond. If convicted, he faces a sentence of 15 years to life, WKBW reported, citing prosecutors. Muzzammil Hassan went to the police station in the Buffalo suburb of Orchard Park on Thursday and told officers that his wife was dead, authorities have said. He also led them to her body at the offices of Bridges TV. The couple began the network in 2004 to counter negative Muslim stereotypes; Muzzammil Hassan is its chief executive officer, and Aasiya Hassan was general manager. Aasiya Hassan filed for divorce February 6, police said, and Muzzammil Hassan was served with divorce papers at the station.

"(CNN)  -- A federal court jury in Florida convicted seven people of participating in a global child pornography trafficking enterprise, according to the Department of Justice. Jurors convicted the seven Wednesday of multiple counts of child exploitation, pornography and obstruction of justice. Members of the organization used Internet news groups to swap and share ""illegal images and videos depicting prepubescent children, including toddlers, engaged in various sexual and sadistic acts,"" prosecutors said. An indictment filed in the case detailed interactions between group members as they swapped and commented on images. ""My thanks to you and all the others that together make this the greatest group of pedos to ever gather in one place,"" Freeman wrote in response to one posting, according to the indictment. And a posting from Castleman, cited in the indictment, read, ""Thanks to all for the wonderful material that has been posted."" An Australian constable who infiltrated the group in August 2006 was among 50 witnesses testifying at trial. He told the jury that the group traded more than 400,000 images and videos of child sexual abuse before being dismantled by law enforcement, according to the Justice Department statement. Each defendant faces a sentence of 20 years to life in prison, fines and the possibility of supervised release for the rest of their lives, authorities said. The seven will be sentenced April 14. During the six-day trial, evidence showed the seven participated in what prosecutors called a ""well-organized criminal enterprise whose purpose was to proliferate child sex abuse images to its membership during a two-year period."" ""This was a wide-scale, high-volume, international trafficking enterprise that used sophisticated computer encryption technology and file-sharing techniques,"" Matthew Friedrich, acting assistant attorney general, said in the statement. The seven defendants were James Freeman of Santa Rosa Beach, Florida; Gary Lakey of Anderson, Indiana; Marvin Lambert of Indianapolis, Indiana; Neville McGarity of Medina, Texas; Warren Mumpower of Spokane, Washington; Daniel Castleman of Lubbock, Texas; and Ronald White of Burlington, North Carolina, according to the Department of Justice. The charges included engaging in a child exploitation enterprise; conspiracy to advertise, transport, ship, receive and possess child pornography; advertising child pornography, transporting child pornography, receiving child pornography and obstruction of justice, prosecutors said.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Paint markings found on pieces of two planes that collided over suburban Los Angeles indicate the nose of one aircraft slammed into the middle fuselage of the other, according to a federal investigator. Investigators on Monday walk past the tail section of a plane lying in a car dealership. Five people died in the accident in Corona, California, including a man on the ground who was killed when one plane's engine crashed through the roof of a car dealership where he worked, said National Transportation Safety Board investigator Wayne Pollack. The NTSB, assisted by FBI evidence experts, completed the cleanup of wreckage and body parts that were spread over a commercial area of car dealerships, restaurants and other businesses near the Riverside Freeway Monday afternoon. Investigators don't yet know if both single-engine planes were approaching the nearby Corona airport for landing, but it was apparently a Sunday afternoon pleasure flight for each. The two men in the Cessna 150 were ejected after the plane was struck broadside by the Cessna 172, Pollack said. The bodies of the two men flying in the Cessna 172 were found inside the plane after it crashed to the ground, he said. The FBI helped the NTSB mark where each piece was found, although the investigation does not involve any criminal aspect, Pollack said. The wreckage was being trucked to Palmdale, California, Monday evening. Aviation experts there will examine it for more clues about what caused the collision, he said. There were two licensed pilots on board the Cessna 150, which was rented from a local flight school, Pollack said. One of the two people on board the other plane -- a Cessna 172 -- was licensed to fly, he said. The victims from one plane were identified as Scott Lawrence, 55, and Paul Carlson, 73, both from Cerritos, California. The dead from the other aircraft were Brandon Johnson, 24, from Costa Mesa, California. and Anthony Guzman, 20, from Hesperia, Calif., according to the Riverside County Coroner's Office. The car dealership employee who died was Earl Smiddy, 58, from Moreno Valley, California, the coroner said. Weather is not believed to have been a factor since it was clear and winds were calm at the time, Pollack said. Corona is about 40 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.

"Braddock, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- In 2001, I came to Braddock, the poorest town in Western Pennsylvania, to serve the community's severely disenfranchised young people by starting an employment and GED program. Their lives were the embodiment of what happened to Braddock and this region: chaos through abandonment. However, tough times and severe hardship are nothing new. It's been this way for decades. Once one of the most important steel manufacturing centers in the world, Braddock -- what's left of it -- solemnly affirms one of the great economic maxims of our society: socialism for the rich, and capitalism for the poor. Since the massive banking bailout of 2008, I have often wondered what Braddock would be today, if 35 years ago, the U.S. government also channeled hundreds of billions of dollars (and trillions in guarantees) to save the steel industry, the hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs it produced and the families it sustained. Instead, places like Braddock were allowed to descend into decades of disorder, poverty and desertion. Braddock went from a prosperous community of 20,000 residents, to a shattered town of fewer than 3,000 today. Braddock looks every bit the deserted battlefield it truly is: 90 percent of our town's people, buildings, businesses, and homes are gone and what remains, bears witness to the torment. In 2005, those same young people I was privileged to work for helped elect me mayor. Senseless homicides long lost their ability to shock, so I began to tattoo the dates of the killings on my arm as a living document of our collective loss. Upon taking office, we set out to help reinvent Braddock through diverse solutions ranging from effective policing and the arts, to urban agriculture and youth employment. Today, buildings have been saved and repurposed. We farm for organic produce from formerly overgrown land, and can offer full summer employment for our youth. Perhaps most importantly, no dates have been added to my forearm in over 20 months. However, at the start of my second term as mayor, we have decades of work ahead and we'll never come close to replacing what's been taken. As the saying goes, we're not looking for a handout, but a hand up and the chance to ameliorate three decades of socioeconomic unraveling. Towards those ends, the stimulus, known as American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, has been a true fiscal balm, especially since our community's hospital, and largest employer, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center announced it would be shutting Braddock Hospital later this month, taking jobs along with our residents' access to health care. CNN iReport: Share your thoughts on the State of the Union . Braddock received $250,000 in stimulus funding for the EPA compliance upgrade of our sewer system and $30,000 that enabled us to hire an additional 30 young people this past summer who would have otherwise been unemployed. Without question, these stimulus funds were a needed infusion of resources. However, I believe the greatest promise of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 remains untapped and now represents an unprecedented opportunity for growth and renewal. In Braddock and in the surrounding areas, we have an abundance of quality, shovel-ready projects that range in complexity and scope from small-scale urban farming, and retrofitting a now-vacant 300,000 square foot hospital, to a $300 million-dollar repurposing of a former steel mill site into a green enterprise zone of economic redevelopment. Investments like these will not only help reinvent communities like Braddock, but will also foster a boom in job creation and long-term growth. These and similar projects across the country represent but a tiny fraction of the resources spent to save feckless bankers and Wall Street from their own unchecked greed and hubris. Perhaps equally important, I believe this kind of investment will help restore a sense of social justice that is completely absent in today's public debates. Consider the absurd juxtaposition of rescued banking executives defending multi-million-dollar bonuses, to our community at over 30 percent unemployment, widespread abandonment, and pervasive poverty while losing the area's only hospital and access to medical care. The explanation of this circumstance is as simple as the contrast is stark: one got capitalism and the other, socialism. Basic fairness and equity demand that the color of your collar should not dictate if you receive a bail-out or get bailed on. For Americans living in places like Braddock, I believe the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is perhaps the last, best chance to help overcome the injustice and harm that the decades steeped in a laissez-faire orthodoxy have wrought. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Fetterman.","For decades, Braddock, Pennsylvania, has been in decline as it lost jobs and people .

The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Several events converged recently that conspired to take me back to the summer of 2006, the summer I snuck into Iraq. The first event was the Iraqi elections. The second was the Oscars. The third was a concert at a little bar tucked into a hip corner of the hippest neighborhood in the world -- Williamsburg, Brooklyn. These events all brought me a little closer to that time, a little closer to recalling the way things were back then. And I realized how much I had forgotten. The summer/ fall of 2006 had a name -- at least it did in Iraq. It was called the Battle for Baghdad. It was one of the most bloody periods of the war. The moment just before the Surge where hundreds of people -- hundreds of Iraqis -- were dying every day. I say we snuck into the country because we did. We had been trying to obtain permission to get into the country legally, but it was proving very difficult. We heard through a friend that you could fly into Erbil through Germany. So we did. Without any papers we bought one-way tickets in cash from Erbil to Baghdad. To me it was a really bad sign: who was in charge of the (expletive) show down there? There was a real feeling of desperation in the air when my friend Suroosh and I landed at the Baghdad International Airport. Someone in Iraq even told us that there was a rumor floating around that the U.S. forces were seriously considering building a moat around the city. Once inside, we aligned to our mission: to find and interview the only heavy metal band in the country, Acrassicauda. It wasn't easy, but we found the guys -- Faisal and Firas -- and spent a week interviewing them in locations that would keep them safe from accusations of collaboration with the enemy. We met two of the nicest, warmest, funniest dudes, and through them our perspective on this war, and all war, was fundamentally changed. For the first time, I saw the war through the eyes of the oppressed, and saw it for what it was: (expletive) stupid. It was a stupid, stupid war. And the old men that conducted it, on both sides, were essentially the same ugly evil idiots; the same ideologues that championed their own particular visions of a new world order under the banner of their chosen gods -- money, freedom, oil, Allah -- take your pick. See the rest of Heavy Metal in Baghdad at VBS.TV . The recent elections saw a flare in the random violence that characterized the hottest periods of the war and reminded me that the desire to kill is still very much alive in Iraq. That the cost of life is still very low. The recent Oscars proved to me how myopic we still are about that war, about our role in it. (Kathryn) Bigelow's champions film of champions (""The Hurt Locker"") shows the Americans as the heroes, addicted to comradeship and the thrill of battle, and the Iraqis as the faceless aggressors resorting to cheap tactics and foul play. A rather disgusting narrative point of view, especially unnerving when you consider how determined Bigelow et screaming actors al were to create an apolitical discursive cocoon around their film. It's as though they were being willfully, culturally stupid, which is strange from a director that is considered, buy most accounts, to be an intelligent filmmaker. Last night, I made my way to a little event at a little bar in Brooklyn. Almost four years since my trip to Iraq, and those awesome dudes -- Faisal, Firas, Marwan and Tony -- now live in New York. They made it out of Iraq, out of exile in Syria, out of the limbo of their refugee existences in Turkey, and they made it to the stage. Last night Acrassicauda rocked out. They are alive and well, and growing their hair long in peace. As they played I couldn't help thinking that behind these four guys stands an entire generation of young Iraqis who had their lives torn apart for a truly stupid war that was built on lies and sustained by our inability to empathize. The first decade of the century was a shame. I just hope we learn something from it.","VBS.TV crew travels to Iraq to find and interview the only heavy metal band in the country .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- In most high schools in America, they teach Shakespeare. But at Central Falls High School in Rhode Island, they're acting out a Shakespearean drama. Only instead of the famous line from Henry VI -- let's kill all the lawyers -- what we have is: ""Let's fire all the teachers."" That's exactly what Central Falls School District Superintendent Frances Gallo did in February. In a move that was bold but also justified, Gallo fired 77 teachers at Central Falls High School in Rhode Island, along with the school's principal, three assistant principals and other administrators. In all, the district said, 93 people were let go in the purge. The school board later stood by Gallo and approved the action. The mass firings, which take effect at the end of this school year, came after the district failed to reach an agreement with the local teachers' union on a plan that would have required teachers to spend more time with students to improve test scores -- with only a small increase in pay. Consistent with federal guidelines designed to improve the educational system, Gallo asked teachers to work a longer school day of seven hours and tutor students weekly for one hour outside school time. She proposed teachers have lunch with students often, meet for 90 minutes every week to discuss education and set aside two weeks during summer break for paid professional development. Think of it as asking teachers to go back and fix what they didn't do right the first time. Central Falls High School is one of the lowest-performing schools in Rhode Island. It operates in a community where the median income is $22,000, according to census statistics. Of the school's 800 students, 65 percent are Latino and most of them consider English a second language. Half the student body is failing every subject, with 55 percent meeting requirements in reading and only 7 percent in math. ""No thanks,"" said the teachers. ""You're fired,"" said Gallo. Upon hearing this story, my first thought was how do we get this woman out of Rhode Island -- and down to Washington to clean house by demanding results from the politicians? Apologists for the public schools and other defenders of the status quo will hear those statistics, and say: ""Well, how do you expect educators to reach and teach a population like that?"" Easy. I expect teachers to do it by putting aside the excuses, setting higher expectations, adhering to better standards, giving into common sense reforms and doing their jobs in a school that serves a vulnerable population that is especially in need of a quality education -- but also, and here's the good news, in many cases, extra motivated to get one. Forget that poor-kids-can't-learn nonsense. It wasn't true 100 years ago and it's not true now. Besides, there is no ideal student population. Whenever I write in support of education reform -- whether proposed by Democrats or Republicans -- or, for that matter, whenever I challenge teachers in any way, I get an earful from angry and defensive educators who demand to know if I have ever been in the classroom. I interpret their comments to mean that if have never been a teacher, I ought to just pipe down and keep paying my taxes so they can grow their salaries at a respectful rate. I will keep paying my taxes, but I will not pipe down. Not that I think it matters, but, in fact, I have been in the classroom. I taught for nearly five years at the K-12 level in Central California. I've taught the kids of poor farm workers, but I've also taught the kids of doctors and lawyers. Now guess which group was more respectful of authority and eager to learn, and which was more likely to think of itself as entitled and privileged? In teachers' lounges, I've heard teachers complain about kids who are poor and disadvantaged. But I've also heard other teachers complain about those who are spoiled and overly advantaged. Why? Because that's what teachers do. They complain. They can't help it. It's in their professional DNA. Everything is always someone else's fault. They never want to accept responsibility for kids who drop out of school but they're the first in line to claim credit for the kids who wind up in the Ivy League. One minute, they're arguing that the parents have all the power over how a child performs. The next, they're denying those same parents the right to have more options and a greater say in their kids' education through charter schools and voucher programs. The contradictions are astounding. And now thanks to the Obama administration, whose approach to education reform is, interestingly enough, an exact replica of that of the Bush administration, teachers and teachers' unions have even more to complain about. The American Federation of Teachers, one of the nation's largest teachers' unions, even complained about President Obama after the chief executive referenced the Rhode Island firings and praised the school district for taking the action. ""Our kids get only one chance at an education and we need to get it right,"" Obama said in a speech this week to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. This, AFT president Randi Weingarten insisted, was nothing more than an attempt by Obama to ""score political points by scapegoating teachers."" So, teachers' unions, how's that hope and change working out for you? It seems to be working pretty well for the country, since Obama is obviously serious about education reform. Back in Rhode Island, Gallo said this week that she is willing to negotiate now that the local teachers' union has agreed to support the changes she proposed. You don't say? The firings worked. Score one for accountability and common sense. Now, Madame Superintendent, about that trip to Washington...

"(CNN) -- Authorities have officially dropped all charges against an American who tried to snatch back his children from his ex-wife in Japan, the Fukuoka prosecutor's office said Thursday. Charges had been technically ""on hold"" since Christopher Savoie was released from jail in October, though legal experts had said the move essentially meant the charges had already been dropped. The prosecutor's office said at the time that Savoie was released after he promised not to take his children back to the United States ""in this manner."" It was not clear whether he had a chance to see his children after his release. Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, allegedly abducted his children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his ex-wife walked them to school on September 28 in Yanagawa. With the children, Savoie headed for the nearest U.S. consulate in Fukuoka to try to obtain passports for them. Screaming at guards to let him in the compound, Savoie was steps from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when he was arrested. Savoie and his first wife, Noriko Savoie, were married for 14 years before a bitter divorce in January. The couple had lived in Japan, but moved to the United States before the divorce. Noriko Savoie received custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States. Christopher Savoie had visitation rights. On the day that the children were to start school in August, Savoie learned that his ex-wife had fled with them to Japan. Savoie later filed for and received full custody of the children, and police in Franklin, Tennessee, issued an arrest warrant for his ex-wife. But Japan is not a party to the 1980 Hague convention on international child abduction -- though the government has expressed interest in reconsidering -- so the warrant was not recognized by Tokyo. Japanese law follows a tradition of sole-custody divorces. When a couple splits, one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children. Complicating the matter is the fact that the couple is still considered married in Japan, because they never divorced there, police said. The children also hold Japanese passports, Japanese authorities have said. Foreign parents have had little luck in regaining custody, the U.S. State Department said. Savoie's current wife, Amy, said in October that her family has been ripped apart. ""Isaac and Rebecca had a very, very happy situation here in Tennessee,"" she said. ""They have people who love them here."" She said she did not think the parties could work out an agreeable arrangement regarding the children. ""There are two parents who love these children and one of them has just been -- just cast aside.""

"(CNN) -- Missing Florida pilot Robert Wiles, who was believed kidnapped and held for ransom 21 months ago, now is believed to be dead, and a former co-worker is in custody, accused of his death, the FBI said Friday. Authorities arrested Stobert ""Tobie"" Holt Jr., 42, Friday in Orlando, Florida, after he arrived from Colombia, where he was on a business trip, according to Tampa-based FBI spokesman David Couvertier. Holt faces state charges of first degree murder, kidnapping, extortion, and intent to inflict death or serious bodily harm, the spokesman said. The arrest was made by police from Lakeland, Florida, the Polk County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, who were accompanied by FBI agents, he said. Though authorities now believe Wiles was killed, they don't know where his body is, he said. The arrest was uneventful, Couvertier said: ""Holt was advised of his rights and said nothing."" A four-count grand jury indictment was unsealed Friday in Polk County, where Wiles, then 26, ran a branch of his family's international aircraft maintenance business, National Flight Service, at Lakeland Linder Regional Airport. The FBI said Holt worked for Wiles at the time he disappeared. He was among several employees who told investigators they last saw Wiles on April 1, 2008, at the office and had no clue what happened to him. The FBI won't reveal the suspected motive or why agents believe it was Holt who left a uniquely signed ransom note demanding money two days after Wiles disappeared. At the time, agents said Wiles' father tried to comply with the demand to get back his son, but heard nothing. Holt is described as an employee who, at least at one time, had a supervisory role at the company. Authorities say he now works as a contract employee doing similar flight maintenance work at Patrick Air Force base near Cape Canaveral in Florida. Wiles was single. When he vanished without a trace, fellow employees said they were stunned. ""All that he ever worked on was customer relations. Making things better for the company,"" co-worker Jerry Grief said at the time. ""Make the customer happy and make them come back."" The FBI said it traveled to six countries and three states tracing Wiles' trips and interviewing business associates. Without disclosing details, agents said the investigation led them back to Holt and his whereabouts the day Wiles disappeared. Several agencies, including the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Polk County Sheriff's Department joined the investigation. The case will be prosecuted by state authorities in Polk County. Wiles' parents, who live in Ohio, had offered a $250,000 reward for their son's safe return. They are said to be in seclusion after being notified about Holt's arrest. When CNN interviewed them last year, Wiles' mother, Pamela, said, ""We're willing to work with them and do anything to get him back. We just want Robert back. And they can just go and live their life, and we just want him back."" The FBI will not reveal what makes agents believe Wiles is dead. ""Our investigation and evidence obtained to date indicate he's dead, "" Couvertier said.

"(CNN) -- If one California lawmaker has his way, his cash-strapped state may have an arresting real estate listing on the market: San Quentin State Prison. San Quentin prison houses more than 5,300 inmates, including Scott Peterson. State Sen. Jeff Denham is proposing selling the 432-acre prison, which offers a breathtaking view of San Francisco Bay, to garner money for California. ""Our inmates just don't need an ocean view. Let's level it off,"" said Denham, a Republican. ""Let's rebuild something for the community there and reap the benefit for the state by having that money come in,"" he added. Denham estimates that the property could sell for as much as $2 billion, even amid a down market. On Tuesday, lawmakers put the proposal to sell the prison in a ""holding pattern,"" said Jann Taber, a spokeswoman for Denham.  Watch CNN's Dan Simon report from San Quentin » . State Sen. Mark Leno, who chairs the state's public safety committee, said the committee was holding the proposal under a policy that allowed lawmakers and residents to give further thought to legislation that could exacerbate overcrowding in California's prisons. Taber said it could be brought up again this year or next. The prison houses more than 5,300 inmates, including Scott Peterson, according to the department of corrections. However, even with the waterfront property, putting the prison on the market may be a hard sell, especially if a new prison had to be built. ""This is a really good facility,"" Bob Sleppy of the California Department of Corrections said. ""It's existing; it's operating; it's well-operated over the years by custody staff. It serves an immediate need."" He said that building another facility to house the inmates might be troublesome. ""Communities seldom welcome a new prison,"" he said, adding that constructing a prison to replace San Quentin could cost $2 billion, the very price tag Denham suggested. The idea of selling San Quentin, which opened its doors in 1852, has been raised before, but it never received much support because of California's chronic problem of overcrowded prisons. California is near 200 percent capacity in its prisons, and selling San Quentin could make the problem worse, said Leno, a Democrat. He said there were no precise numbers available showing the value of San Quentin's property or what it would cost to build a prison to replace it. ""Again, we have no actual numbers right now,"" he said, adding, ""I would guess, at best, it would come out a wash."" Real estate consultant Stephen Roulac said San Quentin's land could be used for condominiums, parks or community-type buildings. ""We would love to see a performing arts center prospectively here, possibly a museum, possibly a tie-in with a university,"" he said. Lawmakers have approved $356 million to build a death row facility to replace the existing one at San Quentin, and some say that is another reason to consider selling the prison. ""Does it make sense anymore in the year 2009 to continue to invest in expanding this prison facility on the most prime piece of real estate in Northern California, or should we finally start to think about some non-correctional uses for this unique property?"" asked state Assembly member Jared Huffman, a Democrat. Denham has tried twice to pass legislation to sell San Quentin. His efforts in 2007 and in 2005 never made it out of committee, his office said.","432-acre waterfront property could sell for $2 billion, Sen. Jeff Denham says .

"(CNN) -- Moldova's president Wednesday accused Romania of involvement in a huge anti-communist protest, much of it coordinated on Facebook and Twitter, which saw government buildings ransacked and police arrest scores of demonstrators. Protests over Moldova's election have gathered pace, fueled by Facebook and Twitter. Vladimir Voronin described riots in the Moldovan capital Chisinau against his ruling Communist party's victory in Sunday elections as ""very serious"" and pledged to take action in response. ""Romania is involved in everything that has happened,"" he said, according to the RIA-Novosti news agency. ""Patience also has its limits."" An estimated 10,000 mainly students gathered Tuesday to protest what they say was a rigged election. Many in the crowd were summoned using social networking tools, particularly Twitter. IReport: Send your photos and emails. Protesters threw bricks at riot police who responded with batons and water cannon. Outnumbered, police retreated, leaving rioters to enter the parliament building and presidential offices where they smashed windows and started fires.  See images of the chaos » . Demonstrators claim Voronin's ruling Communist Party manipulated Sunday's election results to make it appear that it had won 50 percent of the vote, a majority that would allow the party to and amend the Constitution to allow Voronin to rule for a third term. Although election observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe found the voting largely free, many in the former Soviet state disagreed. ""There were too many frauds,"" said Alina Radu, director of the weekly newspaper Ziarul de Garda. Her newspaper's Web site asked readers Wednesday morning to send in instances of voter abuse. ""In just half an hour, we had tens and hundreds of cases,"" Radu said. Voronin said he was expelling the Romanian ambassador to Moldova and imposing visa restrictions on Romanians in response to the violence, RIA-Novosti said. The agency reported that Romania has denied involvement and was threatening retaliatory measures. Analysts saw Tuesday's demonstrations as a student-led action that ""caught the opposition political leaders by surprise."" ""Because I think that after talking to the Western observers, they didn't expect they would get any support for protests,"" said Tammy Lynch, senior fellow at Boston University's Institute for the Study of Conflict, Ideology and Policy. ""It seemed to be undirected,"" Lynch said. ""A lot of students felt angry they were being ignored and took out their anger on buildings."" Moldova's ties with Romania have become increasingly strained under Voronin, who has steered his country diplomatically closer to Russia since taking power in 2005. The president has repeatedly accused Romania of wanting to absorb his country. -- CNN's Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report .","Up to 10,000 gathered Tuesday in Moldova's capital Chisinau .

"(CNN) -- Jewish organizations called for a Romanian official to resign and face a criminal investigation after he wore a Nazi uniform during a fashion show over the weekend. Radu Mazare, the mayor of the town of Constanta, wore a Nazi uniform during a fashion show over the weekend. Radu Mazare, the mayor of the town of Constanta, and his 15-year-old son ""entered the stage marching the clearly identifiable Nazi 'goose step,'"" the Center for Monitoring and Combating anti-Semitism in Romania said in a letter to the country's prosecutor general. The organization's director, Marco Katz, said Mazare had broken Romanian law and encouraged his son to do the same, ""educating him to treat the law with contempt."" Katz said Mazare was sending a message ""that to wear Nazi uniforms and to march the Nazi steps is legal and 'in vogue' in Romania."" He urged the authorities and the head of Mazare's Social Democrat party to show that message ""will be strongly countermanded."" Mazare, 41, said he had not noticed the Nazi swastika symbol on the uniform before he wore it, according to the Romanian Times newspaper. ""I checked it before I put it on but the swastika was very small and I didn't see it,"" he said. ""I really liked the look of the uniform after seeing it in the Tom Cruise film 'Valkyrie.' I bought it from a costume hire shop in Germany."" A top Nazi hunter said Mazare should quit. ""The proper thing for you to do is to admit your mistake, apologize for it and resign your position,"" Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem wrote to Mazare. Zuroff sent CNN a copy of the letter. He said it was no defense that the uniform was that of the Wehrmacht -- the army -- rather than the SS, the elite Nazi guard which took the lead in killing Jews during the Holocaust. ""The Wehrmacht played an active role in the mass murder of European Jewry and many other innocent victims. By dressing in a Wehrmacht uniform, you are expressing totally unwarranted support and nostalgia for an army which committed the most terrible war crimes and acts of genocide,"" the letter said. ""It would hard to adequately describe the depth of the pain that your appearance caused, not only to Jews and other victims of Nazism, but to any person of moral integrity who knows the history of World War II,"" Zuroff wrote. Zuroff told CNN he did not expect Mazare to resign, or even to respond to the letter. But he said he hoped the mayor might act on Zuroff's suggestion that Mazare create a Romanian-language edition of an acclaimed exhibition on the crimes of the Wehrmacht. The Nazi uniform incident, which took place Sunday, was the first time Zuroff heard of Mazare, he said. ""He has a history of being outrageous, but his antics have never included something that I would deal with,"" Zuroff said. ""He's a real character, apparently. He's also very popular, which makes this much more difficult."" CNN attempts to contact Mazare were unsuccessful. Romania was a Nazi ally from 1940 to 1944, under the leadership of a right-wing military government led by General Ion Antonescu. At least 270,000 Romanian Jews were killed or died from mistreatment during the Holocaust, according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia. The 1930 Romanian census recorded 728,115 people who identified themselves as Jewish, comprising approximately 4 percent of the population, the reference work says. Antonescu was deposed in 1944 and Romania switched sides in World War II.","Jewish organizations call for a Romanian official to resign .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Social networking, Martin Scorsese and cinema classics on demand: this is the enticing mix on offer at new movie Web site The Auteurs. The Auteurs mastermind Efe Cakarel (center) at Cannes with Celluloid Dreams' Hengameh Panahi (left) and Martin Scorsese. The self-styled ""online cinematheque"" allows users to watch art house films from directors like Michael Winterbottom, Francois Ozon and Walter Salles, while Facebook-style profile pages and discussion forums encourage movie debate. With their innovative approach, The Auteurs hope to introduce art house cinema to a whole new audience. Recently, The Auteurs announced a prestigious partnership with another more widely known auteur: Scorsese. The site is collaborating with Scorsese's World Cinema Foundation (WCF) -- an organization dedicated to restoring lost cinema classics from around the world -- to exhibit the refurbished masterpieces online. The first four rescued works from Scorsese's project are currently available to watch for free on The Auteurs Web site. Among them are Korean domestic thriller ""The Housemaid"" (1960) and ""Transes"" (1973), a documentary about pioneering Moroccan band Nass El Ghiwan, famously described by Scorsese as ""the Rolling Stones of North Africa."" Watch a clip from ""The Housemaid"" Watch a clip from ""Transes"" ""It is really exciting and important to have Scorsese preserving the films he is preserving,"" said one of the masterminds behind The Auteurs, Eduardo Costantini, over the phone from New York. ""As he said, it's not only important to preserve, but to show -- and he chose The Auteurs because of our look and feel and our philosophy and concept. We are really proud."" The basic ambition behind The Auteurs is to make high quality cinema accessible to a young, global audience by making it available on demand cheaply. ""If you are not in LA, London, New York, San Francisco, Tokyo, Paris, or Berlin, forget it,"" Efe Cakarel told CNN over the phone from Palo Alto, California. ""Many of these films you cannot get even on DVD if you are living in Warsaw, in Istanbul, in Seoul or Buenos Aires."" The Auteurs is Cakarel's brainchild: an ambitious former Goldman Sachs banker with a head for technology, he came up with the idea back in 2007 in Tokyo when, with some spare time on his hands, he tried to watch Wong Kar-wai's ""In the Mood for Love"" on the Internet. ""It was very simple. I went online and I did not find a place that I could use,"" he says. He started writing his business plan there and then. Cakarel says he knew that if he was going to succeed in his quest to bring quality cinema to the global village he would have to enlist some of the industry's top brass. Enter Argentine millionaire, Eduardo Costantini of Costa Films, the company behind 2007 Berlinale winner ""Elite Troop,"" and Hengameh Panahi of Paris-based distributor Celluloid Dreams which represents films like Jacques Audiard's ""A Prophet,"" which won the Grand Prize at Cannes Film Festival this year. Costantini and Panahi have instilled the site with their film knowledge, and paved the way for the site's other major collaboration with masters of the vintage re-release, the Criterion Collection. Each month, the Criterion Collection curates a free online film festival making available classic films from its large library on The Auteurs. This month, users can watch Michelangelo Antonioni's 1960 classic ""L'Avventura"" or ""Harakiri"" (1962) by Japanese master Masaki Kobayashi. Of course, all this begs the question: is there really a big appetite for auteur-driven feature films outside the lofty but limited cinephile circles -- especially at a time when studio-driven blockbuster fodder like ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" and ""Angels & Demons"" dominate at the box office? ""I want to create an entirely new audience for these films,"" says Cakarel. ""Because the only thing people in much of the world are exposed to is ""Spiderman 3"" or ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" in their local multiplex."" The Auteurs is one of a number of Web sites, like jaman.com, making previously hard-to-find films available on the Internet since the YouTube revolution paved the way for new ways of consuming video on the Web. The Auteurs' particular niche is auteur-driven cinema combined with social networking: ""Putting the films online is only part of it. The moment you put the film in the existing conversation between people that know each other, then you create a platform for discovery. According to Cakarel, what sets the site apart from the others is quality: each film is individually encoded (compared to most sites, which batch encode films) for the Web which he says gives a higher quality of sound and vision than anywhere else on the Web. ""Being the best in the world has a huge premium and I know that we can be the best in the world,"" said Cakarel. The site is cleanly designed, easy to navigate and you can pay to watch films like 1998 Dogme 95 classic ""Festen"" by Danish director Thomas Vinterberg and ""The Corporation,"" (2003) an unsettling examination of the pre-eminence of big business. Currently there are 200 films available to watch, some free, but mostly for around $5. Costantini says he hopes to increase the number of films to 1,000. Despite the unabashedly highbrow aims of the site, both Cakarel and Costantini realize they will need to include more commercial fare if they want to increase membership of the site which currently stands at around 80,000. ""It is important we start getting some major films,"" said Costantini. ""Not only treasures that Scorsese restores but also some films that are more commercial."" Cakarel says he would love to host quality studio films like the Coen's ""No Country for Old Men,"" Oscar-winner ""There Will be Blood,"" and Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds."" But there are limits: ""I will never put a mainstream film that is purely for entertainment; that has no soul on the site. ""You will never see 'Knocked Up' or 'Spiderman 3.'""","Scorsese collaborates with Web site The Auteurs to put restored films online free .

"(CNN) -- Pope John Paul II used to beat himself with a belt and sleep on a bare floor to bring himself closer to Christ, a book published Wednesday says. The late pope had a particular belt for self-flagellation and brought it with him to his summer residence, according to the book, ""Why he is a Saint: The True story of John Paul II."" ""As some members of his own entourage were able to hear with their own ears, both in Poland and in the Vatican, Karol Wojtyla flagellated himself,"" the book says, using the name the pope was given at birth. ""In the closet, among the cloaks, a particular pant-belt hung from a hook, which he utilized as a whip and one which he always had brought to Castel Gandolfo,"" the book says. The book was written by a Vatican insider, Slawomir Oder, with Italian journalist Saverio Gaeta of the Catholic weekly Christian Family. Oder is head of the Vatican committee investigating whether John Paul II should be declared a saint. John Paul died in 2005. The evil albino monk in Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" may be the best-known example of self-flagellation these days, but the practice is not unusual in Catholicism -- or nearly as extreme as it is shown in the movie. ""When members or former members [of Opus Dei] see the monk go at it in the movie, they just burst out laughing, it's so nutty,"" said the Rev. Michael Barrett, a priest of the Catholic Opus Dei sect. In actual Catholic self-flagellation, ""there is no blood, no injury, nothing to harm a person's health, nothing traumatic. If it caused any harm, the Church would not allow it,"" he wrote on Opus Dei's Web site when the movie came out in 2006. ""This voluntarily accepted discomfort is a way of joining oneself to Jesus Christ and the sufferings he voluntarily accepted in order to redeem us from sin. 'The Da Vinci Code's' masochist monk, who loves pain for its own sake, has nothing to do with real Christian mortification,"" Barrett said. Mother Teresa is among famous Catholics who self-flagellated in some way, Barrett said. Catholics are not alone in choosing to inflict pain on themselves for religion reasons. Some Shiite Muslims lash themselves until they bleed when marking the mourning period of Ashura, while fasting is practiced by people in several religions, including Jews on Yom Kippur, the day of atonement. David Gibson, a journalist who worked for Vatican Radio when John Paul II was pope, pointed out that the pontiff wrote an apostolic letter -- essentially a papal position paper -- on suffering in 1984. ""Christ did not conceal from his listeners the need for suffering. He said very clearly: 'If any man would come after me ... let him take up his cross daily,' "" the pope wrote, quoting the Gospel of Luke. Jesus, the pope wrote, ""suffered in place of man and for man. Every man has his own share in the Redemption. Each one is also called to share in that suffering through which the Redemption was accomplished. ""In bringing about the Redemption through suffering, Christ has also raised human suffering to the level of the Redemption. Thus each man, in his suffering, can also become a sharer in the redemptive suffering of Christ,"" says the letter, Salvifici Doloris, On the Christian Meaning of Human Suffering. ""John Paul was a product of a very Old World Polish Catholicism,"" said Gibson, who now writes on religion for Politics Daily. ""He was a very disciplined man and a very rigorous man in his personal spirituality,"" he said. The authors of the new book clearly approve of any whipping the pope did of himself, he added. ""Even though it's going to weird people out, it's obviously seen by his postulators as a sign of his holiness,"" he said, using the technical term for the person who investigates a person's qualifications for sainthood. He said the idea is not as bizarre as it might sound to contemporary ears. ""The idea of fasting, renouncing something, giving up your Starbucks latte so you can send money to Haiti -- you can't simply look down your nose at it without rejecting a lot of other ideas about self-sacrifice,"" he said. The authors of the book based it on interviews with 114 ""witnesses"" and access to unedited documents in the Vatican's archives, according to the publisher, Rizzoli. The book is available only in Italian, but the publisher is having it translated into Polish and other languages.","""Why he is a Saint: The True story of John Paul II"" also says he slept on a bare floor .

"Solana Beach, California (CNN) -- I dont tlk on th fone. txt im fb me. I tried to reach my teenage daughter the other day. I left a voice mail, sent an e-mail message and finally texted her and told her to check both and call me back. Seconds later, she texted back one letter: ""K."" She is 19 and has been sending and receiving upwards of 3,000 texts per month. One month, she hit 7,500! She is not unusual at all. According to Nielsen Mobile, in the first quarter of 2009, the average U.S. teen made and received an average of 191 phone calls and sent and received 2,899 text messages per month. By the third quarter, the number of texts had jumped to a whopping 3,146 messages per month, which equals more than 10 texts per every waking non-school hour. (At the beginning of 2007, those numbers were 255 phone calls and 435 text messages.) Preteens sent and received 1,146 texts per month. My daughter doesn't answer her phone because to her, it is no longer a phone. We are in the midst of four distinct generations of Americans: Baby Boomers (born 1946-64), Generation X (1965-79), Net Generation (1980-89) and the new iGeneration (born in the 1990s and beyond and given the ""i"" designation to represent media such as iPods and the Wii but also to reflect the ""individualized"" nature of their media). Until recently, ""communicate"" meant to talk face-to-face or on the phone. But both the Net Generation and the iGeneration have turned the concept of communication upside down. The old ways are, well, old. It is now all about texting, IMing, Facebooking, Skype-ing -- pretty much anything but talking live or on the phone. I know that this is alarming to many, but quite honestly, people must recognize that this is the way it is now and is going to be -- at least until the next new form of e-communication bursts into our world. If you have a teenager (or even a preteen), for example, you must learn how to text, or you two will never ""connect."" To this generation, it is all about connection, but those connections are, for the most part, electronic. It is important to note that although experts agree about the two older generations, not everyone agrees on ""defining"" the last two generations. They are called Generation Y and Millennials by some and, as far as their demarcation dates, well, that is open to fierce discussion. From my research with 3,000 Americans, the final two generations are defined not by a letter or by their birth year but by their use of technology and media, their need and ability to multitask, their rapid acceptance of anything new and their view of the meaning of technology. All of which lead to differences in personal and work values and often to disharmony in the family, school and the workplace. In my research, we query people about daily media activities as well as those they choose during free time. We find striking generational differences. Older teens and Net Geners spend more than 20 hours per day using media. This is accomplished not by not sleeping but with considerable multitasking, which peaks at seven simultaneous activities for older teens. Setting aside music (with its omnipresent ear buds), preferred media choices differ dramatically across generations: For children, it's television; for tweens, it's video games; for teens, it's texting and social networking; and for Net Geners and Gen Xers, it's being online. And for Boomers, it's, of course, back to television. The roots of these differences lie in the origin and pace of technological change, particularly among the most recent generations. Net Geners were early adopters of the Internet, which they came to view as a valuable tool. iGeners, however, are different. They know no other world than that of the Web, texting and social networking. They were online when they could sit up and sent an e-mail to Grandma; they made MySpace a household name by their early teens. They live in their own bedroom ""TechnoCocoons,"" where new technologies appear and penetrate society in months rather than years. Although the telephone took 20 years to reach 50 million users, the Web took four years, iPods three and MySpace two, and YouTube hit 50 million users in one year. The iGeneration is driving these consumer trends. Individuals in this group watch more than 100 YouTube videos a month, download apps, MySpace and Facebook (now verbs), and text the night away. They don't see technology as a tool. For them, it is just life. These generational differences have tremendous ramifications for the family, education and the workplace. Parents are upset that their children multitask and yet are perplexed that they can balance all their technology and do well in school. Teachers struggle to reconcile their need to have students read books, do worksheets and pay attention in class (unitasking) while students want multitasking technologies. Bosses want meetings (more unitasking), goals and progress reports, while their Gen X and Net Gen employees want to do it their way through multitasking and flex time. These differences permeate every system and cause parents, teachers and bosses to tear their hair out. Yet those pesky multitasking kids are the smartest generation ever, with high professional aspirations. Some may call them narcissistic, but they are really a highly social generation (albeit with much of the socializing done online); they value family, revere friendship (some ""virtual""), consume massive quantities of information (again, much of it online) and are the most ""communicating"" generation yet. But to us ""old fogies,"" it seems like they are just chatting aimlessly, sending brief tweets with funny acronyms that make no sense (could you decipher the text message at the beginning of this article?). They text while they walk (sometimes into trees) and keep their cell phones on vibrate while they sleep. No one really has a choice but to accept their world and learn to adapt. The Net Geners and iGeners will soon be the country's parents, teachers, bosses and political leaders, and their techie style will become the norm. We may not like it, but we have to admit that they are happy, successful and engaged with all their media and technology. I may have to text my daughter to get her attention, but I am also bewildered and awed by her mastery of anything new and amazed at how she can balance her media and college and maintain an A average at Yale. It is their world. Watch out for the young ones who are already surfing the Net at 2.

"(CNN) -- Venezuela expelled Israel's ambassador to the country Tuesday and accused Israel of attempting to carry out ""genocide"" against the Palestinian people. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez called the Israeli army ""cowards."" ""In this tragic and indignant hour, the people of Venezuela manifest their unconditional solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people, share in the sadness that overcomes thousands of families through the loss of their loved ones, and extends to them a hand by affirming that the government of Venezuela will not rest until it sees those responsible for these criminal atrocities severely punished,"" the Venezuelan foreign minister said in a statement read by an anchor on state television. The statement added that the government ""condemns strongly the flagrant violations of international law"" by Israel and ""denounces their planned utilization of state terrorism."" ""For the above-mentioned reasons, the government of Venezuela has decided to expel the ambassador of Israel and some of the personnel of the Israeli Embassy in Venezuela,"" it added. In a news conference broadcast by state-run Venezuelan television, President Hugo Chavez blasted the Israeli military. ""They are cowards,"" he said. ""It's as though a boxing professional were to come here and challenge you to box. Well, how courageous! How courageous is the Israeli army!"" It said that Chavez ""makes a fraternal call to the Jewish people throughout the world to oppose these criminal policies of the state of Israel that recall the worst pages of the history of the 20th century. ""With the genocide of the Palestinian people, the state of Israel will never be able to offer its people the perspective of a peace that is both necessary and long-lasting."" Mark Regev, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, was unswayed. ""I haven't heard the details yet, but you know the regime in Venezuela has been one of the few countries in the world that gives automatic support to the Iranian extremists, and it doesn't surprise me that they have affinity with groups like Hamas and Hezbollah,"" he told CNN. He predicted that other countries would not follow suit, even in the Middle East. ""I think, even in the Muslim and Arab countries, there is a fair amount of understanding for what Israel has had to do here,"" he said.","Expulsion is in protest of Israeli strike against Palestinians, minister says .

"(CNN) -- Investigators continued their search Tuesday for a 7-year-old girl who was reported missing after her mother was found dead in Oklahoma. ""We've got to find that little girl,"" Special Agent Ray Homer of the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said. ""We're doing what we can."" The girl -- Aja Daniell Johnson -- was reported missing from Geronimo, Oklahoma, late Sunday, the bureau said. Her 37-year-old mother, Tonya Hobbs, was found dead inside a parked RV. They also are trying to find the dead woman's estranged husband, Lester William Hobbs, 46, the bureau has said. Lester Hobbs and Aja are presumed to be in Hobbs' car -- a white 1992 Toyota Paseo with Oklahoma tag No. 577-BPW, police said. Police were looking for Hobbs and Aja in Oklahoma and Texas. Authorities were working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children on Tuesday to set up a toll-free phone line and put Aja's photo on a Web site of missing children, Homer said. They have had no communication with Lester Hobbs or anyone else that would indicate Aja's location, he said. Tonya Hobbs and her daughter visited Lester Hobbs at his sister's home, the bureau said. Lester Hobbs is not Aja's biological father, police said. Texas authorities also issued an Amber Alert, Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Lisa Block said. Authorities believe Hobbs has connections to Rockport, Texas, and the alert was issued preemptively, she said. Tonya Hobbs and her daughter were last seen Saturday night. Authorities did not say how Hobbs died, but the bureau said investigators believe someone killed her. The RV belonged to Lester Hobbs and was parked at his relatives' home, Richard Goss, agent in charge of the bureau's Lawton, Oklahoma, office, told reporters. Hobbs' relatives became suspicious Sunday after they did not see Tonya Hobbs or Aja. One of them pried open the RV door and discovered Tonya Hobbs' body, he said. Lester Hobbs and Aja were gone, Goss said. The Hobbses were separated, but apparently Tonya Hobbs was visiting Lester Hobbs in an attempt to reconcile, Goss said. The couple had been together for about five years. The Comanche County, Oklahoma, Sheriff's Office said Aja has a medical condition that requires medication. ""Our main concern at this time is to find the little girl,"" Comanche County Sheriff Kenny Stradley told reporters. ""We know that she does need some medication,"" and authorities were checking leads regarding that, he said. He did not specify Aja's medical condition. Goss said Lester Hobbs has an extensive criminal history, but did not elaborate. The sheriff's office said he had prior felony convictions. Lester Hobbs was supposed to appear in court in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, on a DUI charge, Goss said, and did not appear, so a warrant has been issued for him. Aja's biological father was awarded emergency custody of her in November, according to Oklahoma County District Court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KWTV of Oklahoma City. At a hearing, Tonya Hobbs -- identified as Tonya Dunkin in the documents -- and the girl's father, John Johnson, agreed that she would have supervised visitation with Aja and keep the girl away from Lester Hobbs, the documents said. Aja is 4 feet tall and weighs 59 pounds, Goss said. She has brown eyes, and her hair is brown with the ends dyed black. Lester Hobbs is about 6-foot-1 and 190 pounds, with hazel eyes and brown hair, according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. The agency released a picture of him and said he has a mustache but no longer has a goatee. Geronimo is about 12 miles south of Lawton, Oklahoma, in the south-central part of the state.","Girl's mother was found dead inside parked RV; estranged husband sought for questioning .

"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- More than 50 Haitian children -- rescued from an orphanage damaged by last week's earthquake --arrived Tuesday in Pennsylvania, most of them headed eventually to adoptive homes. Gov. Edward Rendell, who traveled to Haiti to accompany the orphans back to his state, said the 53 children from the Bresma Orphanage in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince were flown to Florida on an Air Force C-17 transport plane. The group was then transferred to another plane to fly to Pittsburgh International Airport, he said at a news conference at the airport. Another child is to arrive in Pittsburgh late Tuesday or Wednesday, Rendell said. Ali McMutrie, a Pittsburgh-area woman who ran the orphanage with her sister, Jamie, said her sister will accompany the 54th orphan. ""The children are incredible. They're doing so great. I was more upset at the airplane ride than any of them,"" said McMutrie, who also was at the briefing. Most of the children's adoption cases were at the end of the bureaucratic process before the 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck. Search for loved ones, see who's found . According to Rendell, adoption cases are under way for 47 of the children. Of these, 40 will be U.S. adoptions, four children will go to Spain and three to Canada. Adoptive parents will be sought for the remaining seven children. The orphans almost stayed in Haiti. Rep. Jason Altmire, D-Pennsylvania, who was traveling with the group, said it had been understood that all the children were cleared to leave. However, 14 of them had no papers because they were destroyed in the quake, and the U.S. Embassy said they couldn't leave the country, Altmire said. ""We were frantically calling the State Department, the White House and everyone else"" to get the clearance, he said. In addition, the McMutrie sisters, who live in Altmire's congressional district, refused to allow just a portion of the children to leave, Altmire said. ""So now, everything is up in the air. You're just arguing about paperwork,"" the congressman said. Finally, with intervention from several agencies and the White House, the embassy approved humanitarian waivers, or paroles, for the 14 children. ""All of a sudden, after four or five hours of struggle, we got the go that all 54 orphans could come to the U.S.,"" Rendell said. By then, the plane that was to take everyone to the United States had left. The military and embassy arranged for them to fly in a military cargo plane. Altmire said that despite their trauma, the children adjusted well to the flight. ""They were polite and either slept or were quiet or just played among themselves,"" he said. ""We are all grateful the kids are here and safe, but this was a very unusual situation,"" an Obama administration official, who did not want to be identified, told CNN. ""We will continue to grant, in special cases, humanitarian parole for orphans and medical evacuees, but our position is clear that people from Haiti attempting to enter the country illegally will be repatriated."" The children were taken by bus to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Allegheny County spokesman Kevin Evanto told CNN that the children will be placed in foster homes until details of their adoptions are finalized. On Monday, the U.S. government said it had eased the requirements for orphaned children from Haiti to enter the United States on a temporary basis. In a separate statement, the State Department said Monday it is working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Haitian government to process nearly 300 cases of Americans who are waiting to adopt Haitian children. Of those, 200 cases are being accelerated. At least 24 of those children have left Haiti and have joined their adoptive families since the embassy expedited processing for immigrant visas, said Michele Bond, deputy assistant secretary for American citizen services. Janet Napolitano, secretary of homeland security, can allow otherwise inadmissible people into the country for urgent humanitarian reasons or other emergencies. Before the earthquake, Haiti was home to about 380,000 orphans, according to the most recent data from the United Nations Children's Fund. Rendell's plane flew into Haiti on Monday with a shipment of medical aid and several doctors. It arrived after aid organizations had complained that their planes bound for Port-au-Prince had been delayed. The agency Doctors Without Borders says several of its flights were delayed or diverted for long spells, including a plane carrying supplies for an inflatable hospital. That plane could not land in Port-au-Prince on Saturday and instead was rerouted to the neighboring Dominican Republic, it said. Another medical supply flight was diverted to the Dominican Republic on Sunday, causing a 24-hour delay in delivering aid that had to be transported by truck as a result, the group said. U.S. officials have attributed the delays to a crowded apron at Port-au-Prince's small airport, but say traffic conditions have considerably improved. The airport handled 180 flights Monday, none of which were delayed, Lt. Gen. P. K. Keen told CNN. One Doctors Without Borders flight was unable to land over the weekend, he said, because another aircraft's departure was delayed. Instead of circling and burning fuel, the plane landed in the Dominican Republic, he said. ""And clearly, we wanted that field hospital on the tarmac,"" Keen said. ""But beyond landing them on the main runway and shutting down the entire airport for a couple of hours, there weren't many options because of the design of the airfield."" Keen added that planes turned back ""a number of times"" and ""quite a bit"" in the first few days after the quake. While the field manages more than 100 flights a day now, before the quake, it handled slightly more than a dozen a day, he said. CNN's Gary Tuchman, Adam Levine and Mary Snow contributed to this report.","53 children from Haiti orphanage flown to Pittsburgh; another child will arrive later .
