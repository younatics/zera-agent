"Manchester City continue to look in to the viability of signing Lionel Messi. Last week Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho said the Blues could not sign the Argentine because of the Financial Fair Play restraints. A £200m transfer fee plus a gross package nearing £500,000 a week is obviously a massive obstacle. But City’s money men are still looking into how a deal could be calibrated, especially in the knowledge that tax implications could yet force Messi to leave Spain. Manchester City are still interested in a deal to sign four-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi (second left) Roberto Martinez is the next Premier League manager who faces the axe. In a shock development it is understood Martinez is suddenly under immense pressure at Everton in the wake of Neil Warnock’s dismissal at Crystal Palace. The 66-year-old Yorkshireman became the first Premier League managerial casualty of the season on Saturday. The man who is being lined to replace Martinez as new Goodison Park boss is former England manager Steve McClaren, currently in charge at Derby. Roberto Martinez is under mounting pressure at Goodison Park after the Boxing Day defeat by Stoke City . Referee Lee Mason books Everton and Scotland forward Steven Naismith during the 1-0 defeat . At the start of the season Martinez seemed fireproof. Such was the Spaniard’s reputation that he was spoken of as potential successor to Arsene Wenger at Arsenal or even a future England manager. But Everton have underperformed this season and Grapevine sources tell us that Martinez’s job is now on the line. Derby manager Steve McClaren (right) could be the man to replace Martinez should he be sacked . Tony Popovic has emerged as a leading candidate to become the new Crystal Palace manager after the dismissal of Neil Warnock. Popovic is a former Palace player and currently boss of Western Sydney Wanderers in his native Australia. As soon as Warnock was dismissed the names of Tim Sherwood, Chris Hughton were bandied about. So to Paul Clement (ex-Chelsea coach now at Real Madrid) and strangely Dutchman Dick Advocaat. But Popovic could prove to be a shock appointment. Former Crystal Palace defender and assistant manager Tony Popovic watches his Western Sydney Wanderers side in the FIFA Club World Cup in Morocco last week . Marco Reus to Real Madrid stories are now in over drive. This column revealed that Borussia Dortmund’s Reus will be Madrid’s 'Galactico' signing next summer a month ago. But that does not necessarily mean Gareth Bale will leave Madrid for Manchester United at the end of the season because of Reus’s arrival as has been predicted in some quarters. Yes, United want Bale. They are prepared to pay a £120million transfer fee and give the player at least £350,000 a week wages. But we are told ideally Bale wants to negotiate a new contract and stay in Spain. Dortmund and Germany winger Marco Reus celebrates scoring against Bayern Munich back in November . I am hearing: Such is the vanity of top flight footballers that at Chelsea’s Cobham training ground there is now a 'resident' teeth-whitening dentist. I am also hearing: If West Ham and Sam Allardyce part company at the end of the season then Gus Poyet is a leading candidate to replace him. I bet: West Ham are 25-1 with Corals to beat Arsenal on Sunday. That’s got to be worth the cost of a skinny latte for the potential return of a bulls eye. BTW: I’m still baffled why the Premier League felt it appropriate to stage a minute's applause ahead of Boxing Day matches in memory of the so called Truce Match which allegedly happened at the first Christmas of the World War I. Can anyone actually provide proof such a game occurred? Actually, I understand it could have been there were several impromptu 'kickabouts' on several fronts from Belgium to Greece. West Ham players line up for a minute's applause ahead of their Boxing Day defeat at Chelsea . But in essence it’s one of the myths that have run out of control. Moreover why does the corporate football machine of the Premier League think they can 'own' this story in a manner where it seems they say: 'we unite the world'. It is estimated around 15million people died as a consequence of the 1914-18 conflict. I can’t see any reason to clap about that. Certainly not for reflected glory. I-Say: It had been the longest time from the start of a Premier League season for a manager to be sacked since 1996, when Roy McFarland was ousted by Bolton. But on Saturday the seal was finally broken as Neil Warnock was shown the door by Crystal Palace. Now Warnock is not everyone’s cup of tea. Indeed I know of some people in the game who would happily punch him on the nose. Crystal Palace sacked manager Neil Warnock (centre) after the 3-1 Boxing Day defeat by Southampton . But to be axed so soon after being appointed at the start of the season after Tony Pulis parted company with the club having 'fallen out' with supremo Steve Parish before a ball had been kicked? Seems rash. Yes, Parish will point to the fact that last season getting rid of Ian Holloway and appointing Pulis in the autumn saved the club’s Premier League bacon. He might be proved correct again. On the other hand, if the now parted Warnock was such a mistake one has to wonder at the rationale of recruitment at Palace. Palace co-chairman Steve Parish (right) has seen two managers come and go since August . But of course the trend in the modern game is for boardroom chiefs to sack the manager the moment the natives get restless on the basis of acting before the natives turn on, well, them. Looking back the often maligned Martin Edwards arguably did the best bit of service for Manchester United from Busby to Best et al when he stood by Alex Ferguson when it seemed after nearly FOUR years - not six months - the wheels appeared to be falling off. And the rest, as they say... If Warnock is the wrong man now then he was the wrong man in August. Parish has done a good job in helping turn Palace around. But if he is not careful he will put the club back into a tail-spin again.","Manchester City still exploring possibility of signing Lionel Messi .

"There are some things that AP McCoy will not miss when he brings his astonishing racing career to an end this spring. Like having his doctor on speed dial. Like being on first-name terms with hospital staff in pretty much every racing town in the country. Like clocking up more miles on the motorway than Eddie Stobart. And Norbert Dentressangle. Like going out for a meal in the evening and gulping down a spoonful of guilt with every mouthful. Tony McCoy riding   to win The Agetur UK Novices' Limited Handicap Chase at Newbury  on Friday . McCoy admitted: 'I won’t ever be able to enjoy anything like I have been able to enjoy riding' McCoy on his way to winning The Physicool 'National Hunt' Novices' Hurdle Race at Newbury on Friday . McCoy speaks about his retirement during a press conference prior to the Cheltenham Festival meeting . Mr Mole gave soon to retire 19-time champion McCoy his 200th winner of the season at Newbury . McCoy on his way to winning the Cheltenham Gold Cup Steeplechase race at Cheltenham Racecourse in 2012 . McCoy celebrates wining the Cheltenham Gold up in 2012 on Synchronised at Cheltenham . So, sure, when it is all over, the greatest jump jockey there has ever been may indulge himself a little. He’s thinking of heading over to Mayweather-Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2. In fact, he’s planning two trips to Vegas in two months. The Hangover Part IV may be in the pipeline at this rate. Except, of course, McCoy’s teetotal. Next year, he wants to go to the US Masters. He’d like to play a bit more golf and watch a bit more of Arsenal. But here’s the rub. Retiring from a sport that demands so much of him physically and mentally might sound like a release. But when McCoy talks about it, he makes it sound like a long fall from light into darkness. ‘I won’t ever be able to enjoy anything like I have been able to enjoy riding,’ the 40-year-old said in Lambourn on Friday. There, in the little racing town nestled amid the rolling beauty of the Berkshire Downs, McCoy gave a press conference to talk about the approach of the Cheltenham Festival. The press release had pointed out it would be AP’s ‘last’ Cheltenham. That’s the way it is for the man who has dominated his sport for 20 years: every day for McCoy is a ‘last’ something now. The last time he’ll ride at Towcester, or Sedgefield, or Market Rasen, or Worcester. The last time he’ll beat Richard Johnson into second place in the Jockeys’ Championship. The last time he’ll ride up the hill to the finish at Cheltenham, the last chances he’ll get to add to the record 30 winners he has ridden there. He took a bit of joshing in Lambourn from the compere, Luke Harvey, about how he might end his last Cheltenham without a winner. McCoy is all smiles as he lifts the Cheltenham Gold cup after riding Synchronised to glory in 2012 . McCoy celebrates with JP Mcmanus (left) and Princess Ann following his triumph . McCoy, who will retire this season, poses with trainer Jonjo O'Neill at Cheltenham racecourse in October 2013 . McCoy and JP McManus celebrates as Carlingford Lough wins the Galway Plate at Galway Racecourse . ‘However I do this year, it’s going to be better than next year,’ McCoy said, deadpan. It feels like McCoy is in mourning already. The best part of his life is over. That’s how he sees it. It’s downhill at a canter from here. ‘No thrill,’ he said. ‘No adrenaline rush. There are going to be a lot of things missing in my life.’ This is not an unfamiliar scenario. He knows that and so do we. When the lights go down, sport’s greatest players often find real life a difficult anticlimax. It happens to fighters most often, although maybe that is just because their reluctance to leave the stage can be so desperately damaging. Muhammad Ali is the most obvious example. Evander Holyfield is not far behind. ‘So gimme a stage, where this bull here can rage,’ Robert de Niro’s Jake LaMotta says as he reads his doggerel in Raging Bull. That’s what happens to sportsmen. They fear the loss of the rage, the thrill of the fight. It happens even to those who appeared to dance through their careers with great nonchalance. I spoke to Robbie Fowler, one of football’s most iconoclastic characters, a few years ago when he had just come off the pitch in Brisbane after he had played in front of a sparse crowd at an A-League game. His career was nearing its end but Fowler was eking everything he could from its embers. It was as if he suddenly realised what it had all meant to him. ‘I wish I was Peter Pan and I could play for ever,’ said Fowler. ‘It’s the only thing I have ever done. It’s the only thing I ever want to do.’ McCoy will be hoping Carlingford Lough (pictured) will give him a winner in the Gold Cup at Cheltenham . McCoy will partner Grand National favourite Shutthefrontdoor at Aintree on April 11 . McCoy enters the parade ring aboard Carlingford Lough after winning the Hennessy Gold Cup Leopardstown . All his nonchalance was gone. McCoy has never been nonchalant. He has been far from nonchalant. But that isn’t making the spectre of retirement any easier. His lament for a part of his life that is soon to be lost sounds achingly familiar. ‘The hardest thing is that I’m still enjoying it,’ said McCoy. ‘I still really, really enjoy riding. That is the toughest thing. ‘What I would love to be able to do is retire tomorrow and come back as someone else and carry on as normal. Because I think, mentally and physically, I could. I do think I could perform OK. ‘I’m not retiring because I don’t think I could compete any more. I don’t think I’m any worse than I was or that I’m frightened of the younger lads coming through. Those are not the reasons. ‘I often think I am not sure why I’m retiring. I think every morning when I wake up “I don’t know why I’m retiring”, but I know it’s the right thing to do. I don’t mean this in an arrogant way but I don’t just want to be a normal jockey. I often think that if I was to carry on and ride three or four days a week and ride in the big races I could carry on riding for another five years. But that’s not me. I am an all-in person. That’s just the way I am.’ McCoy is already thinking of what might have been had he not taken the decision to dismount one final time. He is confident he would have been crowned Champion Jockey for the 21st season in succession next year. He said he could ride another 700 winners, thus reaching 5,000 in total. ‘With no problem,’ he said. But there is something apt about McCoy doing it this way. He has lived with pain through much of his career. Now there is more. ‘I always had it in my mind that this is the way I wanted it to be,’ he said. ‘I’m not saying that I wanted to suffer but I wanted to retire when I was still enjoying it and it was still going to be a very difficult decision.’ McCoy falls from Butler's Cabin as they come over Becher's Brook during the  Grand National in 2008 .

McCoy tucks into a dish which has been specially created by food scientist Dr Rachel Edwards-Stuart, who spent three years creating innovative flavour and texture experiences for TV chef Heston Blumenthal . He mentioned Sir Alex Ferguson and Joe Calzaghe as men who went out at the top, men he wants to emulate. There was no chance of him changing his mind. ‘That isn’t going to happen,’ said McCoy. ‘That’s just not me. I am a very stubborn human being.’ There is, though, one possible hitch emerging in his post-racing plans. Like other Arsenal fans, he watched the team’s capitulation to Monaco on Wednesday night with dismay. ‘Thank God I didn’t get to the Emirates,’ he said. ‘I was actually racing in Bangor but I saw some of it on the TV. I was thinking, “I’m not the only one who should be retiring”.’ I have always admired Kevin Kilbane and now I admire him even more. Kilbane has a 10-year-old daughter, Elsie, who has Down’s Syndrome, and last week he complained to the FA about West Ham fans singing a song that compared Spurs striker Harry Kane with a ‘****’. He was deluged with abuse but he did the right thing. Some things are worth standing up for. Kevin Kilbane complained to the FA about West Ham fans chanting about Tottenham striker Harry Kane . Europe’s clubs pay the price for opening Pandora’s box .

"Souleymane S said that this was not the first time he had been abused because of the colour of his skin. Souleymane S, who stood on that Paris Metro platform facing down the morons and the bullies and their atavism and their hate. Souleymane S, who stood with his hands by his sides, implacable and angry, defiant and unbowed, facing down the Chelsea mob on the train. ‘You know, I live with racism,’ Souleymane S told Le Parisien. ‘I was not really surprised by what happened to me, even if it was a first in the subway.’ Souleymane S attempts to board the Metro carriage but is refused entry by racist Chelsea fans . Paul Nolan's footage went on to show passengers in the carriage following the disgraceful incident . He had never met the Chelsea fans before but Souleymane S recognised the ugly faces that stared out from that carriage at Richelieu-Drouot station on Tuesday evening. He lives in a capital whose racial tensions were captured so starkly by the film La Haine 20 years ago, a capital which is newly familiar with heinous hate crimes. Souleymane S knew those faces and, sadly, so did we. Because racism, sometimes cunningly concealed, sometimes bold as brass, still haunts English football. Many are in denial about that. Many still seek to portray it as a fantasy perpetuated by the politically correct. Others blame the media for highlighting a problem that they say does not exist. Most, including football’s governing bodies, don’t want to confront it. Not really. They say they do but when it comes to hard choices, they back off. They would prefer to talk about initiatives, T-shirts, TV adverts and catchy slogans. They deal in lip service. I have had first-hand experience of that so I know how it goes. I know how difficult it can get when you seek to highlight even relatively trivial incidents. Two years ago, England played a World Cup qualifier in San Marino and a few groups of fans sang a song about burning the Ferdinand brothers, Rio and Anton, on a bonfire. The song was sung against the backdrop of the racial abuse case that pitted the Ferdinands against former England captain John Terry. It was laden with meaning. I heard it, some of my Press colleagues heard it and some England fans among the vast majority who weren’t singing it, heard it, too. I wrote about it. Others mentioned it. The FA responded by launching a half-hearted inquiry. They did not want their reputation sullied or a fine to be levied. They said they couldn’t find any evidence the song had been sung. I asked why witness accounts did not constitute evidence. They did not reply. They threw those of us who heard the chants under the bus. Daniel Sturridge scores during England's 8-0 win in San Marino where racist chants were clearly audible . In a way, that is why what happened in Paris on Tuesday feels, amid the disgust and shame, like an important step forward. It wasn’t a surprise to most observers of the English game. It wasn’t anything new. Except for one thing. Except that what happened to Souleymane S is there on video and with audio. Paul Nolan, who shot the footage, performed a great service to English football. The plausible deniability that football exercised time after time, including in San Marino, is gone. This time, there is no denying it. This time, there is no sanitising it. This time, there is no hiding from it. Admitting that race is a real problem in English football again, admitting we have not made as much progress as we thought we had, is a critical first step. Oh, we’ve made some advances, for sure. Fans do not throw bananas as they used to when Bradford City’s Ces Podd ran past in the Seventies. But racial prejudice is on the rise in our society. Somehow, we have reached a point where our Jewish community is, once more, scared for its safety. Xenophobia, in different forms, seems to be multiplying. Look at what happens when articulate men such as Jason Roberts or Stan Collymore speak out about race on Twitter: they are doused with foul abuse. It is time for football to start taking some bold steps. It is not enough to keep playing safe and hoping the problem goes away. The trailblazing Ces Podd (right) runs to training with Bradford manager Bryan Edwards . Stan Collymore (left) and Jason Roberts are routinely abused on Twitter when they speak out about race . This should not be about isolating Chelsea who are in many ways a model of multi-culturalism, owned by a Russian Jew who appointed a Portuguese as manager and a Nigerian as technical director and whose employees have overseen a progressive Asian Star initiative. Chelsea have acted swiftly and strongly. They have been unequivocal in their condemnation of what happened. Jose Mourinho said he was ‘ashamed’. But this is not just about Chelsea. This has to go further than merely punishing the scum who repelled Souleymane S from that train and chanted how proud they were to be racist. Prison sentences, banning orders; that’s easy. That just scratches the surface. These people are produced by our society, not by our football. There is no quick fix. But there are ways forward; ways that will take courage and perseverance and brave leadership. It’s about time, for instance, that the Football League stood up and led the way by introducing a version of the NFL’s Rooney Rule for the lower leagues. There is no point involving the Premier League yet. Most aspiring black coaches don’t have enough experience to manage in the top flight because they have been denied opportunities lower down the pyramid. Jose Mourinho (left) was visibly angered when addressing the racist behaviour on the Paris Metro . Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich was said to be 'disgusted' by the incident in the French capital . The idea that getting a job in English football is a meritocracy, and that would-be managers are not discriminated against because of their ethnicity, is a joke. More and more people accept it is a joke. More and more people acknowledge it is a stain on our game that there are only four black managers in our league (four more than there were at the start of the season). It is time for the FA and the Football League to accept that the balance needs to be redressed; that black aspiring managers should at least be given the chance to put their case when a managerial vacancy arises. They have delayed long enough. They must take steps to fix it and, in the process, send out a message to morons like the men on the Metro that we value diversity and the rule of talent in our game. Enough of saying there is no problem. There is a problem. Enough of laissez-faire. Enough of thinking that English football will heal itself. It won’t. It needs help. When new QPR boss Chris Ramsey, the only black manager in the Premier League, spoke on Thursday, he was asked if he had suffered racism in his career. ‘A lot,’ he said. He didn’t elaborate but my guess is that part of what he was referring to were the job applications that went unanswered, the coaching qualifications that went unheeded. Chris Ramsey, pictured during QPR's defeat at Hull, says he has suffered 'a lot' of racism in his career . Huddersfield manager Chris Powell is one of four black managers plying their trade in England . Former Chelsea striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has led Burton Albion to the top of League Two . Former England international Keith Curle is in charge at Carlisle, who are fourth from bottom in League Two . ‘Racism is not something that gets eradicated,’ said Ramsey. ‘It gets shuffled about and hidden in places you wouldn’t believe.’ When Souleymane S tried to get on that train, he did not give up. He was repelled and tried again. He kept pushing back. English football needs to follow his example. It’s time to push back. It’s time to stop pretending everything is OK. Penalty decisions are not always clear-cut. What was Wayne Rooney supposed to do at Deepdale on Monday night when the Preston North End goalkeeper, Thorsten Stuckmann, came hurtling out of his goal, launched himself at the ball and missed? Was he supposed to take the hit and risk serious injury? Was he supposed to hurdle the keeper, do everything he could to stay on his feet and accept that the scoring opportunity that should have been his was gone? Thorsten Stuckmann dives in at Wayne Rooney's feet before the Man United striker took evasive action . Rooney touched the ball past the Preston keeper with referee Phil Dowd awarding a penalty to United . Or, having taken evasive action and stumbled when he landed, was he entitled to go down? Surely a forward should not be penalised because of a keeper’s rash challenge? Rooney did nothing wrong. If the keeper throws himself at the ball and misses, impeding an attacker in the process, he has to take the consequences. It is interesting that Britain’s Olympic 400m champion Christine Ohuruogu still feels entitled to criticise IAAF president Lamine Diack for suggesting there is a crisis in the sport, because of allegations made about officials covering up doping in Russia. Ohuruogu  should have taken a minute, remembered that she once missed three drug tests in succession and accepted that, when it comes to doping matters, her voice carries very, very little authority. Christine Ohuruogu, who won Olympic gold in 2008, once missed three drugs tests in succession .","Racism, sometimes cunningly concealed, sometimes bold as brass, still haunts English football .

"Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu is trailing her Republican challenger by a giant 16-point margin in a runoff for one of Louisiana's two U.S. Senate seats, according to poll results obtained by MailOnline. The survey, commissioned by GOP Rep. Bill Cassidy's campaign, was leaked to media in order to fire a shot over the senator's bow and send a signal to energy lobbyists that her ship is taking on water. It suggests that Democrats' worst fears have been realized even though Landrieu edged Casssidy by 1 percentage point on Election Day. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE FULL POLL . GOP Rep. Bill Cassidy's campaign commissions polls daily, and the latest results show him in a commanding position over Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu . Cassidy, a medical doctor, finished a close second on Election Day but appears to have a clear advantage going into the Dec. 6 runoff; Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says if he wins he'll get a seat on the Energy Committee – undercutting Mary Landrieu's strength in an oil-and-gas-heavy state . A second Republican candidate, Rob Maness, won 14 per cent of the vote on Nov. 4, enough to deny them both the 50-percent showing required to avoid a December 6 runoff. Now Maness has endorsed Cassidy, helping him erase his 1-point deficit with Landrieu and adding far more. Cassidy is 'trying to shut K Street down for Mary' by selectively releasing the polling data, a source close to his campaign in Louisiana told MailOnline. 'The energy folks, the lobbyists, keep trying to say she has a chance to win. That's why it was leaked.' Landrieu has lined up for what Republican Capitol Hill aides are calling the 'Hail Mary XL,' a legislative strategy to save her Senate seat by winning a vote to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which would bring 700,000 barrels of oil daily from the Canadian province of Alberta to the Gulf coast. She may get her chance on Tuesday if she can find 14 other Democrats in the lame-duck Senate to join her in backing the project's construction. All 45 Republicans have already signed on. As of Thursday one whip count shared with MailOnline found that she was just two votes short, giving her a 58 of the 60 votes she will need to override Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's objections and force a roll call. Republicans have fired back by making Cassidy the public face of the House bill. And Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentuckian who will be the Senate's majority leader in January, vowed to give him a seat on the Energy Committee if he wins. Landrieu's re-election campaign has rested squarely on the question of whether she has enough clout as the committee's current chairwoman to pump new blood into Louisiana's sprawling energy infrastructure – including the 16 oil refineries operating there. She will lose her chairmanship weeks from now regardless of what happens since Republicans will come back in January with a sizable Senate majority. The GOP campaign source hinted that if Landrieu were to mount a comeback, it would require super PAC funding from the energy industry's deep pockets. A 16-point deficit, he said, might be enough to convince them to hang her out to dry. 'And down here,' the source added, 'we have to convince people that it's not in the bag.' Landrieu now lacks the support of any out-of-state PACs, including the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Since the outcome no longer affects which party will control the Senate – the GOP will have either a four- or five-seat edge – the DSCC is saving its money for another day. Landrieu, the outgoing chair of the Senate Energy Committee, is trying to engineer a last-minute vote on the Keystone XL oil pipeline as a 'Hail Mary' play to save her re-election bid . Landrieu communications director Fabien Levy told MailOnline that the GOP's glasses are rose-colored past the point of credibility. But he wouldn't share any of the Democrat's own internal poll numbers. 'What our numbers show is that Mary Landrieu is in a good position to win big on Dec. 6, just as she's won all of her other close races,' Levy said in a phone interview. He took issue with the automated nature of the Magellan Strategies poll, which asked respondents to answer questions by pushing telephone buttons instead of talking with a pollster. Magellan principal Jon Diez confirmed via email that his firm ran a 'push-button' poll for Cassidy's team. Diez's resulting memo discloses that 1,917 people provided answers, and assigns a 2.2 per cent margin of error to the result. Levy said that in the Landrieu campaign, 'we don't do automated' polls – only more traditional surveys. Diez countered with the email equivalent of a shoulder-shrug. 'As with live surveys, there is no way to guarantee that each respondent is honest in their responses,' he said. Diez also explained that his sample is balanced for race and other demographic features when phone numbers are culled from public voting records. 'Her campaign is running on fumes,' Diez said in an email of Landrieu's re-election efforts. 'She voted 97% of the time with a president and a party who 62% of the voters [in Louisiana] disapprove of. It is what it is.' Levy also objected to a series of set-up questions asked immediately before respondents were asked to choose a future senator. A recorded message asked Louisianans to decide which of four issues should be 'the top priority' for the next Congress. The only issues on the list were repealing Obamacare, protecting the U.S. from terrorists, ramping up border security and 'addressing the illegal immigration problem,' and shrinking the size of government. Cassidy lost on Election Day but looks to be leading in the runoff since the other Republican in the race is supporting him . Reputation on the line: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton posted a disappointing record on Election Day, with losses raining down on six of the nine Senate candidates she stumped for; a Landrieu win could diminish the feeling that her star is on the wane just as the 2016 presidential season gets ready to kick off . Levy called those 'push-poll questions' that might cause Democrats to hang up before the crucial questions were asked. He also noted that the Keystone XL pipeline didn't make the cut. 'He's pretending it's important now, but where has he been on the pipeline?' he asked. One of the run-off contest's most comical features has been the tit-for-tat skirmishes over the number of times Landrieu and Cassidy will debate. 'We challenged him to six debates ... one for every year he wants to serve in the Senate,' Levy said of the Landrieu campaign's symbolic challenge. 'He only agreed to one.' In 2002, the last time Landrieu faced a runoff election, she debated her opponent four times in the weeks following Election Day. On Tuesday in Shreveport, Cassidy turned the Democrats' challenge on its head. 'She wants to have 6 debates, as if 6 has some significance,' he told KTBS-TV3. 'Why not have 97 debates  – one for every percent that she supports Barack Obama? Or 716 for the $716 billion that Obamacare took out of Medicare?' Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Cassidy's campaign operation has several advantages in addition to poll numbers. About 96 per cent of all the TV ads running in all six major media markets there support him.

"Those who claim they are following their diets 'religiously' are not only being figurative about their diligence. Matt Fitzgerald, who describes himself as an endurance sports writer, coach and nutritionist, makes the interesting point in this book that each and every weight-loss fad - the Grapefruit Diet, Slimfast Diet, Scarsdale Diet, Atkins Diet, among many others - embodies core elements of a sacred sect, with followers and disciples, converts and renegades. Slimming World, my own cult of choice, even meets in a church hall - and we, the stout, enjoy the camaraderie, the fellowship, and shout hallelujah when a pound is shed. (Two stone in my case - I'm heading for canonisation.) Olive harvest: But it's a myth the Greek's longevity is all down to the oil according to the book . Diets don't appeal to reason as such - like religion, they operate on the emotions, for which some kind of structure is nevertheless required and is why I call my Slimming World 'Food Optimising' handbook my bible. Fitzgerald says that people fear being on their own, and assume that it is impossible to attain maximum health without joining a diet cult. And in their own turn, religions are keen on gastronomic rules and regulations: there are 613 rules of correct living for Jews in the Torah, for example. Muslims have halal methods of slaughter. Christianity is based around the rituals of dining - suppers, wedding parties, parables about crops and vineyards. One of philosophy's great puzzles is the connection between the soul and the body - fleshly impulses versus spiritual feelings. People want to feel purified, and vegetarians and vegans see the body as in imminent danger of rotting and fermenting from too much protein, which is 'clogging up the vision, clogging up the lymphatic system'. While this very well may be so, I am the son of a Welsh butcher. Vegetarianism holds all the appeal for me of the Moonies. In evolutionary terms, we have not done very well with our diets. Missing out: Some 'diet cults' will only eat raw food . When the apes dropped from the trees, where they'd subsisted on fruit and insects, and began to hunt on the grassy plains, assuming an upright posture and opposable thumbs the better to capture, kill and market (I presume) woolly mammoths, in two shakes of a lamb's tail, complex societies existed and everyone was obese, lolling on sofas all afternoon in front of the telly, guzzling on snacks and crisps from vending machines, cheeseburgers and beer. Though such a scenario is convincing, the cavemen were probably thin because they had to keep running away from sabre tooth tigers. Nevertheless, there are now cults in California that won't eat bread because people didn't 8,000 years ago. They won't cook, because 'cooking destroys vital nutrients in food'. That’s rubbish. Frying aside, cooking increases the amount of energy the body can extract from what it ingests. As Fitzgerald says, 'cooking made us human'. There is a religious sense of asceticism or mortification behind diets - the notion that being lardy involves a sense of sin and shame. We all know people who will never admit to being greedy. Instead they say with a straight face they are big-boned or have a slow metabolism. As Fitzgerald says, if people are blobby, it is because they can't sustain the self-discipline necessary to keep fit in the modern age. 'Just one burger won’t kill me!' is the fatal line of thought - a demonic temptation. If, in the 19th century, no fewer than ten dishes were served at a typical gathering in grand homes, people didn't immediately collapse because they were simply more active - walking or riding, marching and colonising India. Our contemporary equivalents are athletes, who eat eggs and pasta by the bucket, yet remain slender because they swim six hours a day, lift weights, run for miles - 'and if the furnace is hot enough, everything burns'. Whose furnace today is switched on, let alone up high? Were we to go back in time, we'd never adjust to the cuisine, in the same way that Red Indians, Hawaiians and Aborigines are destroyed by any abrupt switch to the modern Western diet. Our ancestors were enterprisingly carnivorous in ways alien to us now. Explorers in the New World dined off badger, beaver, bear, cormorant, otter, porcupine and wolf. Meat was the most concentrated source of energy available - and what a lot of big girl's blouses people are today with their gluten and lactose intolerances, or those maniacs you hear about who rinse cottage cheese to reduce its fat content. Not the enemy: Atkins demonised the potato but it has numerous health benefits . One problem for the early settlers in the American West was they 'survived almost entirely on elk meat. The monotony nearly drove them crazy.' As Jesus said, man cannot live by bread alone - or in my case, stew. Stew was the only thing my mother wished to cook, God bless her. A cauldron bubbled on the stove for decades, into which was tossed any old scrap or gritty carrot. Indeed, when Shakespeare heard about my mother's stew, he wrote Macbeth. But it didn't kill me, did it? It's the modish low-fat, high-carb, or high-fat, low-carb, or liquid diets based on pricey weight-loss supplements that you have to watch. The orthodoxy is always altering. Atkins, for example, demonised the potato as the most calorifically productive crop on earth, with the result there was an 8 per cent drop in demand worldwide, even in Ireland, where it had been a staple. There were notorious famines in 1845 and 1852 when the crop failed and everyone had to emigrate to Boston and drink Guinness instead. Yet, in 2011, a researcher decided to eat nothing but spuds for 60 days straight. He lost 21lb, his cholesterol dropped to healthy levels, and his wife said he stopped snoring. Result: knickers to Atkins. What is gospel one minute is heresy the next. Sugar, creamy milk and red meat are now carcinogenic evils. Coffee, which we were advised to cut down on, is now, according to the Harvard School Of Public Health, an elixir: 'Habitual coffee drinkers were up to 40 per cent less likely to kill themselves.' Bars of chocolate are also back on the menu, as cocoa 'has a favourable effect on blood platelet formation and reduces the risk of heart attacks and strokes'. Does that mean I don't have to feel guilty about Whole Nut? If the voices from the pulpit now agree that a little bit of what you fancy does you good, and that the purpose of a diet is to enable higher energy levels and improved mood states and mental health, then the answer is yes. And as any Holy Fool always knew, plump people are jollier than sour-looking skinny people. But if you don’t really want to be a fat pig, only exercise will stimulate major weight loss - though no blinking way will you find me watching workout videos. The best method of all, of course, is not to eat a thing - hence the religious notion of fasting, which the devout go in for to practise humility and self-control. But it amused me to learn that though for years people thought their splendid olive oil was the reason why Greeks seldom died of heart disease, it has now been worked out their longevity is related to the fact that in the Greek Orthodox Church there are no less than 180 fasting days each year. So extra virgin olive oil, imported by Americans by the gallon, has nothing to do with it. My theory, however, is that Greeks are in tip-top shape because of all that plate smashing.","Matt Fitzgerald makes some interesting points in his book Diet Cults .

"One of Britain’s finest heptathletes is chasing Chorizo — her spirited sausage dog — along Crosby Beach, occasionally pulling him away from an unlikely confrontation with a passing bulldog and feeding him treats he has sniffed out in her handbag. ‘I’m going to get another caramel-coloured one,’ says Katarina Johnson-Thompson. ‘I think I’ll call it Twix.’ She has a keen sense of humour but her breezy manner has been tested to its limits over recent months. A freak foot injury put a premature end to her 2014 season but on a crisp sunny morning on the coast six miles north of Liverpool, Johnson-Thompson is in an optimistic mood. VIDEO Scroll down for Road to Rio: Katarina Johnson-Thompson on returning to action . Katarina Johnson-Thompson, pictured with her dog Chorizo, has returned to training following her injury . Johnson-Thompson goes for a light run on Crosby beach in Liverpool alongside her sausage dog . The 21-year-old admits she broke down in tears after finding out she would miss the Commonwealth Games . But on a crisp sunny morning on the coast six miles north of Liverpool, Johnson-Thompson is in an optimistic mood. It is her first day back at training after three months off. ‘I’ve been counting down to this day,’ she says. ‘I just have to trust I can get back to where I was and be even better on a bigger stage. I am targeting medals at the World Championships next year.’ Despite the injury, which robbed her of the chance to ‘show the world’ what she can do at the Commonwealth Games and European Championships, it was still a breakthrough year. Johnson-Thompson won her first major senior medal in the long jump and set a world leading heptathlon score to win in Gotzis, the biggest event for multi-eventers outside the major championships. ‘If I’d done all that any other year I’d have been delighted,’ she says. There are plenty of people in high places backing her to do big things. Former Olympic champion Jackie Joyner-Kersee believes she can not only win heptathlon Olympic gold in 2016 but also break her own world record. American legend Joyner-Kersee predicted the 21-year-old would surpass her score of 7,291, which has stood since 1988. Sweden’s Karolina Cluft, widely considered one of the best athletes of a generation, and Britain’s golden girl Jessica Ennis-Hill could not come close. Former Olympic champion Jackie Joyner-Kersee has heaped praise on Johnson-Thompson . ‘My mum sent me the link to the online video,’ recalls Johnson-Thompson, ‘I was watching it thinking, “What the hell is she saying I’m going to get a world record for?” It’s crazy to even hear her say my name and such an honour for her to think I’m capable of getting that. I don’t think anyone’s capable of getting that, it’s such an incredible score.’ It was a reminder of her towering potential and a confidence boost after a summer of ‘complete devastation’, trying to avoid watching on TV and following on social media as her team-mates competed at the Commonwealth Games and European Championships. ‘I was ready to go and post a big score,’ she says. ‘The biggest hit is I couldn’t show the world what I can do. My whole family was coming to watch me for the first time. They’d made banners, got accommodation and tickets. ‘On the day I got the scan on my foot — our medical bills are paid for by the National Lottery — I met my coach in the pub and we decided that I couldn’t do the full heptathlon. As I was leaving, this guy came up and said, “I thought I recognised you, you’re going to do Liverpool so proud at the Commonwealth Games, go win gold girl!” Johnson-Thompson poses on Crosby Beach, home of Antony Gormley’s National Lottery funded ‘Another Place’ sculptures . The British heptathlete is focused on preparing for next summer's World Championships in Beijing . ‘I turned to my coach and said, “Maybe I will still do it”. But he said, “You can’t chance it over one tipsy fella in the pub”. It just made me think about all the people I was letting down.’ She wells up at the memory. As her team-mates experienced Britain’s most successful European Championships in Zurich, Johnson-Thompson could not watch on TV. The only positive has been seeing more of her boyfriend Nick Bright, a presenter on BBC Radio 1Xtra. She has been to see him DJ in Cyprus and the pair have just returned from a two-week holiday in Thailand. ‘I used to be an Arctic Monkeys head but he’s got me into hip-hop and urban music. We’ve been doing little day trips to take my mind off things.’ Johnson-Thompson has also been kept busy by moving out of the house she shared with her mother and grandmother and into her own home, which she shares with Chorizo. ‘My nan used to do the cooking and my mum used to just look after me to make life easier for athletics,’ she says. ‘I didn’t realise how many dishes have to be cleaned. It's weird being on my own now but I’ve got my dog and Snapchat.’ Johnson-Thompson (left) is looking forward to competing against fellow heptathlete Jessica Ennis (centre) Johnson-Thompson’s phone lights up every few seconds with new messages from friends. She also shows me an app she uses to keep track of her overall heptathlon score. ‘It acts like a calculator. You put in your personal best for the seven events and it converts the scores. I used to have to use a book to do it, turn all the pages, then write it down and add it up.’ It will come in useful as Johnson-Thompson focuses on her biggest year yet, with next August’s World Championships in Beijing the primary target. By then Ennis-Hill is expected to be back in action after the birth of her first child, Reggie. Johnson-Thompson has often been branded ‘the next Ennis-Hill’ after breaking her British junior heptathlon record, but she does not feel burdened by the comparisons. ‘I don’t think about it,’ she says, ‘Every athlete wants to win gold so it’s not like someone said I’m like Jess so I have to win gold because she did. I want to win a gold medal anyway. It’s definitely good Jess will be back. It’s scary as well because she is an Olympic champion and she can bounce back, as she showed after missing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.’ Two British athletes on the comeback trail and set for an almighty match-up on the world stage. Whatever the outcome, the future looks promising for the heptathlon in Britain. As well as funding the Road to Rio athletes, every week National Lottery players raise more than £33million for arts, heritage, charity, community projects and grassroots sports clubs and facilities.

"A warning for those planning to spend Saturday night on January 31 outside a Barclays Premier League club in the hope of inadvertently getting on SkySports: don’t bother. The window actually closes on Monday February 2 at 11pm, having belatedly opened on January 3, and what do we have to show with it being a week old? Bupkis. Well, that may be a fib. We have Steven Gerrard for one, joining LA Galaxy after May, and Wilfried Bony’s impending £30million deal as another. Yet there remains a few that should be looking for the exit door themselves. West Bromwich Albion’s Saido Berahino, Newcastle United’s Moussa Sissoko and West Ham’s Winston Reid are among those, and here’s why they ought to leave. Saido Berahino, West Bromwich Albion . Interested clubs: Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur . Price: £20m . Super stat: West Brom would be joint-bottom of the Premier League without Berahino's goals . West Brom striker Saido Berahino has been linked with a move away from The Hawthorns . Berahino did not look too pleased at scoring four goals past Gateshead in the FA Cup . 2,723 - percentage increase in wages since 2013 if he accepts £24,000 a week . 4 - points directly earned via his eight Premier League goals . 4 - goals against Gateshead during 7-0 FA Cup win . 187 - minutes-per-goal ratio . 20 - West Brom’s only player to have played in every Premier League game . Four goals against Gateshead and not so much as a smirk. Magic of the FA Cup... Berahino’s dismantling of the Conference club was overshadowed by the 21-year-old’s refusal to celebrate, to smile, to show a smidgen of happiness for doing the job he is paid £12,000 per week to do. Sportsmail’s Ian Ladyman last week coined the phrase ‘to do a Berahino’, which involves scoring, whether during a five-a-side match or on the playground, and sulking. It may catch on at The Hawthorns if the England Under-21 international doesn’t leave. His poker face could be interpreted as a cry for help; a come and get me for potential suitors, those being Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur. But £20m? Was that plucked from thin air by West Brom, or created by agents after their 10 per cent? Neither. New Baggies manager Tony Pulis will be desperate to keep hold of star striker Berahino . Berahino’s significance is outlined by the fact West Brom would be joint-bottom of the Premier League without him; his eight goals, one every 187 minutes on average, have directly contributed four points. He is the only player to have featured in every Premier League game (20) for West Brom, and was named in Roy Hodgson’s England squad for the first time in November, too. Against West Ham on New Year’s Day, before his four goals against Gateshead, he scored the equaliser in a 1-1 draw and held a 100 per cent pass succession. Perhaps the £12,000 is where the problem lies. West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace wants to double it, meaning his wages would have increased by 2,723 per cent since December 2013, when he was on £850 per week. Yet he seems unsatisfied. He’s turned up late for three matches this season, the latest against Manchester City on Boxing Day, and had to pay fines for his tardiness. Time to go, Berahino. Moussa Sissoko, Newcastle United . Interested clubs: Arsenal, Paris Saint-Germain . Price: £20m . Super stat: Sissoko is the Premier League’s fastest player after being clocked at 35.3kph . Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko is the fastest player in the Premier League . 35.3 - Sissoko’s kph clocked speed (the fastest in the Premier League) 101 - dribbles attempted, the seventh most in the Premier League . 22 - chances created for Newcastle with two goals and one assist . 967 - minutes played against PSG in Ligue 1 with Toulouse . The Mike Ashley model. Buy cheap, then sell for profit. It works for Sports Direct, but not for Newcastle United. In Sissoko the owner has another piece of merchandise he can staple a £20m price tag to and put on the shelves for the January sales. Ashley has a knack for selling his most valuable player. Andy Carroll (£35m) being one, Yohan Cabaye (£23m) another, arguably Demba Ba (£7.5m) and Mathieu Debuchy (£10m), too. Right on cue are serious concerns about another MVP being sold. Alan Pardew, in one of his final acts as manager, admitted Newcastle would be ‘vulnerable’ if a big club came knocking. There have been reports Newcastle issued a ‘hands off’ warning to Paris Saint-Germain. In fact the club told them they’d have to pay handsomely. There’s a difference. ‘I have ambition,’ Sissoko previously said. ‘My goal is to play at the best clubs, playing the Champions League, win trophies, but today I am a Magpie and I am very happy.’ That was in December. Come January Newcastle are 10th, out of the FA Cup and Capital One Cup, without a manager, and Chelsea at Stamford Bridge are next. So, what would Sissoko leave behind? The 25-year-old has been named the Premier League’s fastest player after being clocked at 35.3kph against Leicester City, beating Raheem Sterling (35) and Alexis Sanchez (34.6), among others. He has attempted 101 dribbles, placing him seventh in the top 10, two goals, one assist, and has created 22 chances. If Sissoko feels he can bring all this to European football, then that lies away from St James’ Park. The 25-year-old has been linked with a move to Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain . Winston Reid, West Ham . Interested clubs: Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham . Price: £4m . Super stat: Reid has made the third-most clearances in the Premier League (186) West Ham may choose to cash in on Winston Reid or risk losing him for free at the end of the season . 75 - per cent of winning tackles . 186 - clearances (the third-most in the Premier League) 115 - headed clearances . 22 - clean sheets with Reid involved out of 29 . It’s a timing thing. Let Reid leave now, get £4m. Let him leave in the summer, get nothing. His contract expires on June 30 and, because he is stalling negotiations, Reid will be free to go where he pleases in less than six months. If West Ham are to make money, it’s time to sell. They’re looking less likely to steal a Champions League place, having taken one point from nine against West Brom, Arsenal and Chelsea. Next up, Swansea City at the Liberty. Arsene Wenger, so keen on Reid, has sent scouts to every West Ham game since November to watch the New Zealand captain. The 26-year-old wouldn’t dominate headlines, nor break the bank with the £60,000-per-week wages he is supposedly demanding, but can give defensive cover for Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is said to be keen on bringing the New Zealand captain to the Emirates . Sam Allardyce seems resigned to losing him, too. A one-liner or two from Big Sam: . Reid wins 75 per cent of his tackles and has made the third-most clearances in the Premier League (186). Of those, 115 were headed clearances. He has featured in 22 of West Ham’s 29 clean sheets over the past three seasons, is based in London, and has been since 2010. • ‘There is no future for Winston Reid at West Ham at the moment. His contract finishes on June 30. He hasn’t said he’s going to sign or that he’s not going to sign.' • ‘If he is not going to sign a contract [at West Ham], I find it highly unlikely if it is not already verbally done [elsewhere].’ Allardyce could and should cash in for something, rather than lose him for nothing. AS FOR A LOAN DEAL... Joel Campbell, Arsenal . Interested clubs: Real Sociedad, Villarreal . Price: Loan . Super stat: Campbell has made four league appearances for Arsenal, but 85 on loan for others . Arsenal striker Joel Campbell's proposed move to Real Sociedad could benefit all parties . Lorient in 2011. Real Betis in 2012. Olympiacos in 2013. Now Real Sociedad? How often can Wenger promise to make use of Campbell, only to give the 22-year-old a bit-part role to play? David Moyes can remedy that. He wants Sociedad to become the fourth city to welcome Campbell from where he goes wasted. Moyes, after all, can offer time on the pitch; a luxury yet to be afforded in north London, despite Wenger’s assurances. 'I’ve got one or two in mind and maybe some from back home who would like the opportunity to come and play in Spain,’ said Moyes. ‘If there’s one market I know best at the moment then it’s the British market.' Costa Rica international Campbell has failed to hold down a regular first team role at Arsenal . No prizes for who the man that recently thwarted Barcelona was referring to. Campbell, while open to signing a new contract with Arsenal, fancies the move, too. Four Premier League appearances, 39 minutes total, zero goals, zero shots on or off target, two chances created. The love affair at Arsenal continues. And so to the underdog story of the summer. The 2014 World Cup allowed Costa Rica, led by a seemingly unknown forward, to reach their first quarter-final in history. It got Campbell noticed but Wenger has no time for sentimentality. Campbell’s next destination should be Sociedad, where he is likely to get more than a minute or two, here or there, every so often.","West Brom would be joint-bottom if it was not for Saido Berahino's goals .

"'Lucky to be alive': Bono and four friends cheated death when the rear door of the private jet they were in fell off as they flew 8,000ft over the German coast . Bono and four friends cheated death yesterday when a rear door of their private jet fell off mid-flight. The Irish rock star was on board the Learjet 60 D-CGEO making the two-hour afternoon trip from Dublin to Berlin. He was the only member of U2 on the plane, as bandmates Larry Mullen, the Edge and Adam Clayton were due to fly separately late last night. The group were lined up to accept an award at the Bambi International Music awards in Berlin, but Bono flew out early to attend a diplomatic function with the German minister of economic cooperation and development, Gerd Mueller. But when Bono and his crew reached the German coast, flying at about 8,000ft, the tailgate of the plane became detached. A source close to the singer told the Irish Daily Mail: ‘He was extremely lucky, the plane could have gone down. About an hour into the journey they heard a big thud coming from the rear of the plane. ‘They were startled for a bit but they continued on and made the descent into Berlin airport. When they landed they were horrified to learn that the compartment at the rear of the plane had completely detached. ‘The entire door along with Bono and his companions’ luggage had fallen out mid-air. They don’t know if the door and the contents landed over water or land but they were extremely lucky. They were at an altitude where anything could have happened and they are all feeling very lucky to be alive.’ Aviation authorities in Germany have launched an official probe into the incident as it began its descent into Berlin's Schoenefeld Airport. His £50million Learjet 60 was preparing for landing when at 12.27pm on Wednesday an 80 x 100 cm chunk of its door was ripped off. The door was outside the pressurised area of the cabin so there was no loss of pressure and no need to don oxygen masks. It's understood no MAYDAY was sent off as the plane landed minutes later. On Thursday morning officials from the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Investigations Office were with police officers scouring fields around the area of Ostprignitz-Ruppin, some five miles from the airport looking for Bono's luggage and material from the plane which would aid into the probe about how the accident occurred. Airport spokesman Ralf Kunkel said: 'The jet landed safely and, according to our knowledge, there was no danger of a crash.' Bono and the band appeared later on Wednesday night performing for a host of celebrities at the Bambi movie awards in the centre of Berlin. Just an hour after the accident Bono met with Germany's development minister Gerd Mueller at his ministry in the centre of the capital to discuss overseas aid projects. German authorities at the airport confirmed the private jet landed with damage to its tailgate, which they believe happened mid-flight from Dublin to Berlin. 'Big thud': German authorities at the airport confirmed the private jet landed with damage to its tailgate . Bono is due to fly to the US later this week where he will appear with U2 on Jimmy Fallon’s Tonight Show. A spokesman for the band had no comment when contacted last night. The band have been promoting their new album Songs of Innocence, which was controversially added to half a billion Apple iTunes users’ accounts automatically.","Tailgate of Bono's Learjet came off as it flew 8,000ft over the German coast .

"Conservatives in the U.S. Senate got a powerful weapon on Wednesday in the battle over whether they can pull the rug out from under President Barack Obama's plan to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants into American life. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the Republican' top budget hawk, has unveiled a Nov. 21 memo from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) explaining that Congress can legally strip funding from America's immigration enforcement agency – including funds the agency raises on its own through fees it charges Americans and foreigners. That news will put fuel in the tank of right-wingers who want to paint Obama into a corner when the GOP controls both houses of Congress in January. Citing 'Congress's constitutional power over the purse,' the CRS – Capitol Hill's official nonpartisan research arm – instructed Sessions that lawmakers can pick and choose what executive branch agencies can spend money on. 'An agency is not free simply to disregard' those orders, the memo read. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . CLASH: Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions (left) and Republican Rep. Hal Rogers (right) are pushing each other's buttons on de-funding Obama's immigration push, but Sessions got the upper hand on Wednesday . ROADBLOCK: Obama's plan to defer deportation for millions of illegal immigrants has set off an arms race on Capitol Hill between moderates who want to play along and conservatives who want to block him . HONEYMOON OVER? Immigration activists rejoiced at Obama's Nov. 20 announcement, but the president could hit a snag if Congress blocks the funding for him to do what he wants . Some government agencies are funded by congressional 'appropriations' and others are 'self-funded' by fees, but the CRS memo indicates that Congress is in the driver's seat no matter what. That question had been left hanging in an internecine Republican feud that spilled out into news coverage and the blogosphere in the weeks since the midterm elections. Sessions and other Senate conservatives argue in favor of 'de-funding' U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a subagency of the Homeland Security Department, in order to force an Obama administration retreat from what they term an 'amnesty' for more than 5 million people living in the U.S. illegally. Moderates, led by House Appropriations Committee chair Hal Rogers of Kentucky, insist the gesture would be an empty one since the White House could legally thumb its nose at Congress by self-funding the agency. USCIS will print and distribute green cards and work authorization cards for the millions of immigrants likely to benefit from Obama's executive order, announced last week. Those cards and other documents will cost money – arguably bringing in more than the agency needs – even if congressional Republicans try to freeze it out. UNDER CONSTRUCTION: Like the mid-restoration Capitol Dome itself, the shape of the next Congress – including the level of aggressiveness GOP leaders will employ against the White House – is still taking shape . NOT FAR ENOUGH: Obama was heckled in Chicago on Tuesday by Hispanic activists who insisted he hadn't done enough . Rogers cautioned last Thursday, after Obama unveiled his unprecedented immigration plan, that since 'Congress does not appropriate funds for any of [USCIS's] operations ... the Appropriations process cannot be used to ""de-fund"" the agency.' Obama's immigration bureaucracy, he argued, 'has the ability to continue to collect and use fees to continue current operations, and to expand operations as under a new Executive Order, without needing legislative approval.' Rogers, multiple Capitol Hill sources confirmed Wednesday, is focused on passing a so-called 'omnibus' budget bill by December 11 when the current agreement funding the federal government expires – and has ignored pleas from his right to force-feed the White House a series of piecemeal bills instead. While the normal appropriations procedure makes it difficult to seize control of fees that an agency like USCIS might use to plot its own course, a different maneuver – writing a short piece of legislation – would unlock what Congress needs. The Congressional Research Service sided with Sessions. Even if USCIS gets no money from Congress at all, the memo states, 'the funds available to the agency through fee collections would be subject to the same potential restrictions imposed by Congress.' 'Importantly,' CRS adds, 'amounts received as fees by federal agencies must still be appropriated by Congress to that agency in order to be available for obligation or expenditure by the agency.' Confused? A senior aide to a conservative Republican House Appropriations Committee member told MailOnline on Wednesday that 'this analysis means Hal Rogers is way off-base.' 'This is no different from entrance fees charged by the National Parks,' he said. 'Congress can certainly tell the Interior Department what it can and can't do with that money. Park rangers can't just stick their tongue out at us and spend that money doing something Congress forbids, like giving tap-dance lessons to grizzly bears.' 'If we could stop that, we can stop this.' A second House aide said even if moderate Republicans weren't sure they had the authority to stop USCIS from printing green cards with its own money, 'they could just legislate that. It's not hard.' OVER THE EDGE: Obama's move to sidestep Congress with his immigration reform drew laughs from Saturday Night Live, which depicted him pushing a favorite Schoolhouse Rock icon down the Capitol steps . On the senate side, an aide close to the Budget Committee told MailOnline that the CRS report 'should be the end of this technical debate.' 'The report clearly says Congress can use the appropriations process to deny the funds needed to implement the president's illegal amnesty and work authorization program,' the aide said. 'The GOP made a promise to midterm voters to battle this amnesty and secure their livelihoods. This has become yet more imperative following confirmations that legalized populations will draw Social Security and Medicare checks from American families.' Sessions seemed ready to fight all 12 rounds last Thursday. 'The House should send the Senate a government funding bill which ensures no funds can be spent for this unlawful purpose,' he said Nov. 20. On Wednesday his office sent MailOnline a statement insisting that 'the suggestion that the White House can implement any unlawful and unconstitutional act so long as it pays for it with assessed fees is just plain wrong.' 'There is no question that Congress has the power to block this expenditure and no doubt that it can be done,' he said. Even a potential lawsuit, CRS wrote, would likely tilt in favor of lawmakers who want to tie Obama's hands. A court 'could find' that a congressional restriction on Homeland Security spending 'reached activities or agencies that were entirely fee-funded,' according to the report.","Republican civil war broke out after Obama's Nov. 20 'amnesty' speech over whether the GOP can stop the White House from issuing green cards and work permits .
Congress's official fact-checkers now say the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill can legally pull the plug .
At issue is whether immigration authorities can do whatever they want with fees they collect from immigrants, both legal and illegal .

"While people on Earth celebrated Thanksgiving yesterday with turkey, yams and fruit cobbler, astronauts on the ISS tucked into a rather more cosmic version of this festive meal. On the menu for the six crew members were bags of freeze-dried, irradiated and thermostabilised food that resembled their Earthly counterparts. From a bag containing smoked turkey to some questionable-looking cornbread dressing, both the US and Russian segments of the station came together to enjoy the feast in space. Scroll down for video . Nasa in Washington revealed the Thanksgiving meal enjoyed on the ISS. Astronauts ate freeze-dried, irradiated and thermostabilised foods. Pictured here is Nasa astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore with the meal enjoyed by all six of the crew on the ISS . In a video Nasa astronaut Butch Wilmore talked through the food the astronauts would be tucking in to - 260 miles (420km) above Earth. Although they aren't given a day off, Nasa said its crew onboard the station was given an easier day during the holiday. 'The Nasa astronauts on the orbital complex will have a light day on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and will share a meal with the rest of their crewmates,' the agency said. - Irradiated smoked turkey . - Thermostabilised candied yams . - Freeze-dried green beans . - Freeze-dried mushrooms . - Freeze-dried cornbread dressing . - Thermostabilised cherry-blueberry cobbler . While most Americans roasted turkeys and emptied cranberry sauce out of cans, the station crew broke out the scissors to open bags of freeze-dried, irradiated and thermostabilised food. Their menu included traditional holiday fare with a space-food flair - irradiated smoked turkey, thermostabilised candied yams and freeze-dried green beans and mushrooms. The meal also featured Nasa's own freeze-dried cornbread dressing - just add water. Dessert featured thermostabilised cherry-blueberry cobbler. The space station Expedition 42 crew is made up of Commander Barry 'Butch' Wilmore and Flight Engineer Terry Virts of Nasa, Flight Engineers Anton Shkaplerov, Alexander Samokutyaev and Elena Serova of Russia's Roscosmos and Italian Flight Engineer Samantha Cristoforetti of Esa. Station food generally resembles that, for the most part, flown in space since the inception of the Space Shuttle Program some 30 years ago. The astronauts' menu included traditional holiday fare with a space-food flair - irradiated smoked turkey, thermostabilised candied yams and freeze-dried green beans and mushrooms . Astronauts on the ISS often enjoy meals together at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Pictured here are most of the crew of the previous Expedition 41 enjoying a meal with each other . Nasa has been researching and developing ways to extend the shelf-life of food needed for deep space missions, such as those to Mars, and to minimise the volume of packaging. The agency is also using the International Space Station as a laboratory to learn how to grow plants, such as lettuce, in space. Future crew members spending Thanksgiving in space may have one traditional staple: fresh sweet potatoes. The sweet potato may be one of the crops chosen for crews to grow on deep space missions. It provides an important energy source - carbohydrates - as well as beta-carotene, a source of vitamin A. Commander Barry 'Butch' Wilmore of Nasa is seen here explaining the menu, while holding a sachet of irradiated turkey. Although they aren't given a day off, Nasa said its crew onboard the station was given an easier day to celebrate the holiday . Thanksgiving has been a traditional staple of life on the ISS for many years. Here Russian cosmonauts Vladimir Dezhurov (left) and Mikhail Tyurin celebrate Thanksgiving aboard the ISS in 2005 . The sweet potato is able to adapt to a controlled environment with artificial sunlight, and it is highly adaptable to a variety of vine-training architectures. The main shoot tip, or the end of the main vine, is the only really sensitive part. It sends hormones throughout the plant that stimulate root development, which is important since it is the roots that become the sweet potatoes. The side shoots, if picked when young, are tender and can be eaten in salads, improving the plant's usefulness. Scientists believe most food items in the transit food system on future deep space missions will resemble those used on the station. Advanced processing and packaging methods will be needed to provide extended shelf lives and improved nutrition for the longer missions. Stored food and salad crops will be used in the early stages of planetary stays until permanent living bases are constructed. Food on the ISS today, although still not able to match that enjoyed on Earth, has improved greatly from the early days of spaceflight in the 1960s. Where once astronauts were limited to tubes of pasted food, now they at least have foods that you would find back on Earth (shown)","Nasa in Washington revealed the Thanksgiving meal enjoyed on the ISS .

"An American couple cleared Sunday by a Qatari appeals court of wrongdoing in the death of their adopted daughter has been barred from leaving the Middle Eastern country just hours after they were told they were free to go. Matthew and Grace Huang were stopped from exiting the conservative Gulf nation and had their passports confiscated as they tried to pass through airport immigration control in the capital, Doha, said family representative Eric Volz, who is traveling with them. The unexpected delay adds a new twist to a closely watched legal saga that may have stemmed from cultural misunderstandings in the conservative Gulf nation. The Los Angeles couple had been banned from leaving the energy-rich OPEC nation while their case made its way through the courts, but the appeals court ruled Sunday they were free to leave after the presiding judge overturned a child endangerment conviction against them. They were met at the airport by U.S. Ambassador Dana Shell Smith, reflecting the intensity of American government interest in the case. Scroll down for video . Blocked: American couple Grace, right, and Matthew Huang walk to their departure gate with U.S. Ambassador to Qatar, Dana Shell Smith on Sunday. The couple was blocked by immigration officials  from leaving . Couple: A Qatari appeals court overturned a ruling against Grace and Matthew Huang, who had been accused of killing their daughter Gloria. The Huangs are seen here arriving at Hamad International Airport in Doha . Absolved: The Huangs say 8-year-old Gloria died of medical problems complicated by unusual eating habits that included periods of binging and self-starvation. The couple has two other African-born adopted children . Stopped: The couple had been banned from leaving Qatar while their case made its way through the courts, but the appeals court ruled Sunday they were free to leave . The Huangs spent months behind bars before being let out on their own recognizance last November. They were convicted in March of this year of child endangerment and sentenced to three years in prison. They were allowed to remain free pending their appeal. A doctor in Qatar who conducted Gloria's autopsy determined that dehydration and wasting disease were the cause of death. The Huangs have maintained their innocence and say 8-year-old Gloria suffered from medical problems complicated by unusual eating habits that included periods of binging and self-starvation. Prosecutors alleged she died after being denied food and locked in her room. The Huangs have two other African-born adopted children and have been pressing Qatari officials unsuccessfully for permission to leave the country to be with them. 'It has been a long and emotional trial for me and my family, and Grace and I want to go home and be reunited with our sons,' Matthew Huang said shortly after the ruling. 'We have been unable to grieve our daughter.' Matthew Huang had been working in the booming nation as part of infrastructure improvements for Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup. U.S. officials intervened on the couple's behalf by raising the case with Qatari officials on multiple occasions. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki last month urged Qatar to lift the Huangs' travel ban immediately and bring the case to 'an expeditious and just conclusion.' Qatar also hosts an important American military air operations center near Doha that is involved in airstrikes against the Islamic State group. The U.S. ambassador met the Huangs at Qatar's sleek new Hamad International Airport, which opened earlier this year and is the base for fast-growing flag carrier Qatar Airways. 'We are very, very happy to see justice delivered,' Smith told The Associated Press as they entered the airport. Not long afterward, the Huangs were stopped by immigration authorities. Volz said officials informed the couple that a new appeal has been filed in their case and that they were not allowed to leave. 'As you can imagine it's a very scary situation,'Volz said. The U.S. ambassador was on the scene trying to intervene with Qatari authorities, he added. Qatari and U.S. Embassy officials had no immediate comment. Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively rare in Qatar, which has aggressively pursued a higher international profile through sporting events and overseas investments. A report by Qatari police earlier raised questions about why the Huangs, who are of Asian descent, would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits.' It also suggested that the children could have been part of a human trafficking operation or were bought for organ harvesting, according to the family's website. Delayed: A representative for the family said the Huangs' passports were also confiscated on Sunday by Qatari immigration officials . Investigation: A report by Qatari police had earlier raised questions about why the Huangs, who are of Asian descent, would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits' Gloria was severely malnourished when she was younger and would at times refuse to eat for several days before binge eating or getting food from unusual places, such as garbage cans or from strangers, according to a report prepared in the U.S. by Janice Ophoven, a pediatric forensic psychologist who reviewed the case for the family. The report noted that such unhealthy anorexic eating patterns are not uncommon in children adopted from impoverished backgrounds, and was a behavior the girl's parents were trying to manage and correct. The report also noted that Gloria had previously been treated for an intestinal parasite, and said recent blood tests could have indicated she suffered from an underlying bone marrow condition, as well as a vitamin D deficiency. On Sunday the appeals court ruled the couple were not guilty and said they were free to leave Qatar, based on witnesses' accounts that Gloria was 'not neglected in leading a normal life.' In the appeals court hearing, the witnesses had testified that they saw Gloria eating one day before her death, the presiding judge said as he issued the verdict. 'This negates the charge that she was prevented from eating, a charge that the court of first instance used as a base for its initial ruling,' the judge said. The court also cited a statement by Gloria's brother, Immanuel, who testified that the parents had provided food to their children. A forensic pathologist told court last month that Gloria's corpse showed signs that she had not eaten for days. 'I found no signs of food in her stomach and the whole intestine, and I found no other reasons for death,' said the expert Anees Mahmud. But the Huangs have insisted that Gloria died of an eating disorder rooted in a troubled early childhood.

"Charlie Rogers was found bleeding with carved skin by police on July 2 . A Nebraska woman who claimed she was brutally attacked by three men who carved anti-gay slurs into her arms and stomach has been found guilty of making a false report. Charlie Rogers, a former college basketball star and openly gay woman, was found guilty on Monday in Lincoln after entering a plea of no contest, allowing her to not admit guilt but state she wouldn't offer a defense. Her attorney says Rogers maintains her innocence but didn't want a court fight while police have claimed she staged the attack for attention and to spark change. False report: Charlie Rogers, 33, who ranks second in career blocked shots for the University of Nebraska told police the men broke into her Lincoln house on July 22 and attacked her, leaving her face and body bruised, right . With her conviction the 34-year-old faces up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine when sentenced in February. The former University of Nebraska-Lincoln basketball star was charged a month after telling police in July that three masked men broke into her home, assaulted her and carved derogatory words into her body. Just last month Rogers pleaded to the public and news outlets in an online video maintaining her innocence while warning that her attackers are still on the loose. 'The perpetrators of my crime are still out there. They are. It wasn't me,' Rogers said in the 15-minute video. 'I wouldn't say I did it then, and I won't say I did it now. I am innocent.' Rogers told police that three masked men broke into her home, and that one of them pinned her down while another sliced a cross into her chest, cut the front of her thighs and shins and carved derogatory words in her arms and abdomen. Nebraska's Charlie Rogers, guards Creighton's Corey Sweeney during a women's volleyball match in Lincoln, Nebraska. She has been found guilty of making a flase report to police . A neighbor told police that on the night of the alleged attack, Rogers crawled from her home naked, bleeding and screaming for help . She said they then rolled her onto . her stomach and cut her buttocks, the back of her thighs and the back of . her right calf. She also said they tried to burn down her house. Rogers, who ranks second in career-blocked shots for the University of Nebraska's Cornhuskers, crawled from her home naked, bleeding and screaming for help, a neighbor told police. Police arrested her on August 21 for . allegedly staging the attack, and prosecutors charged her with making a . false report to police, a misdemeanor. She pleaded not guilty a month . later. Investigators did not follow up on . leads in the case, Rogers said. They did not interview a woman who had a . key to Rogers' house, didn't check out men taking photographs of her at . a public event and didn't secure the crime scene in the days after the . attack, she said. Instead, Rogers said, authorities have painted her as mentally ill and tried her in the court of public opinion. Police Chief Jim Peschong countered that investigators have worked diligently on the case and brought in an FBI agent to help. Peschong said investigators never . found any evidence to back up Rogers' story. He said there was no sign . of a struggle at Rogers' house and no blood on the bedspread where she . said the men cut her. An FBI forensic pathologist . determined that Rogers made the cuts herself or they were done with her . permission, her arrest warrant says. There was no apparent struggle in the room where Rogers said she was attacked on her bed and the bedspread was described in her arrest warrant as appearing 'neat' and 'evenly placed on the bed'. Police said they interviewed Rogers on four separate occasions and because of inconsistencies in her accounts and forensic DNA evidence, a warrant was issued for her arrest . The alleged attack led to a swift response from Lincoln's Gay Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender community, which rallied that weekend outside the state Capitol . 'There was no apparent blood on the . bedspread; even though Ms Rogers reported she was rolled on to her . stomach after she had been cut on her arms, abdomen, chest and front . legs while being held down,' it said. Forensic tests of Rogers’ bedding at the University of Nebraska Medical Center found no traces of blood. When the FBI sent the pictures of her cuts to experts, they concluded they had been self-inflicted, according to the warrant. 'This opinion is based partially on the fact that the cuts appeared to . be superficial and symmetrical, avoided sensitive areas of the body, . appear that they would have taken considerable time to do and are . accessible to the victim and follow the victim’s frame of reference for . reading and writing.' Dr Michelle Elieff, a forensic pathologist, also noted Rogers had no bruising, even though she alleged the men had beat her up. Police found a pile of clothes, white knit gloves and a red box cutter on the living room floor. Rogers said the gloves did not belong to her, but investigators determined that a lot of the DNA inside them belonged to her. According to NBC, investigators . discovered that the gloves, zip ties, blades and a red utility knife . were purchased five days before the alleged attack at a hardware store . in Lincoln. When a clerk from the store was shown . a photo lineup, they identified Rogers as the person who had bough the . items, the warrant says. Making false statements to a police . officer is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail. News of the alleged attack sparked multiple vigils attended by thousands of gay-rights supporters who donated money in support of  Rogers in cities throughout Nebraska.","Charlie Rogers was found bleeding with carved skin by police on July 2 .

"A woman astounded doctors after she turned up at hospital with a football-sized tumour on her neck which weighed two kilograms. Joyce Haigh, 79, had been living with the tumour - thought to be the largest ever reported in the UK - for an incredible 20 years. Mr Muhamad Quraishi, the ear, nose and throat surgeon who removed the tumour during a five-hour operation at Doncaster Royal Infirmary, said it was the largest growth he'd seen during his 20-year career. Scared: Joyce Haigh, 79, lived with the football-sized tumour for 20 years before it was removed. Surgeons have now confirmed it was the largest lump to have been removed . from a head or neck in the UK . Mrs Haigh, from Thorne, near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, said she hadn't realised the size of the tumour until doctors showed it to her in a mirror. She said: 'I know I should have done something sooner about the tumour, but I wasn't in any pain and, I am ashamed to say, I was afraid to go to the doctors about it. 'Now though, I wouldn't hesitate to see a doctor about anything, and would encourage people who may be experiencing health problems of any kind to get help right away, because the people at the hospital are fantastic. 'My husband George, our nephews and nieces were all worried when the lump started getting bigger. Skill: Ear, nose and throat surgeon Mr Muhamad Quraishi (right), removed Mrs Haigh's tumour during a five-hour operation at Doncaster Royal Infirmary . 'I could cope with it when it was small but over the years it just grew and I suppose in the end I feared the worst.' Then on October 13, Mr Haigh insisted his wife saw a doctor when the growth started to bleed. Mrs Haigh said: 'I saw Mr Quraishi before Christmas, and he was wonderful. He showed me the photos of the side view of the lump which I had not seen before. It was at that point that I realised just how bad it was. 'I was frightened of having the operation, but actually everything was fine. They took two biopsies and although I do need further treatment, I'm just so glad the lump has gone. 'I plan to get back to being normal again, buy some new clothes and enjoy life. She added: 'The operation has given me a new lease of life as I can go out now without worrying about people staring at me. Relief: Mrs Haigh (with husband George) said: 'The operation has given me a new lease of life as I can go out now without worrying about people staring at me' 'The staff at Doncaster Royal Infirmary were marvellous and I can't thank them enough.' Mr Quraishi said: 'In the whole of my 20-year medical career, I can honestly say that I have never seen or treated such a massive tumour. 'The operation itself was quite challenging and I am happy with the outcome and that the operation was a complete success. 'The greatest challenge was to prevent the side of Joyce's face from becoming permanently paralysed, which we successfully prevented. 'I have since found out that Joyce's lump is the largest to have been removed from somebody's head or neck at Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals and the largest ever reported in UK.'","Joyce Haigh, 79, finally had the tumour removed after it started bleeding .

"An international consortium of scientists has published a high resolution draft of the barley genome in a move that may hold the key to better beer. Barley is the second most important crop in UK agriculture and malting barley underpins brewing and pub industries worth some £20billion to the UK economy. The breakthrough is a critical step towards barley varieties able to fight against cereal crop diseases and cope with the demands of climate change, researchers claim. Better beers on the way? Scientists have mapped the genome of barley, a key ingredient in beer . 'This research will streamline efforts to improve barley production through breeding for improved varieties,' said Professor Robbie Waugh, of Scotland's James Hutton Institute, who led the research. 'This could be varieties better able to withstand pests and disease, deal with adverse environmental conditions, or even provide grain better suited for beer and brewing.' World's fourth most important cereal: Barley, a close relative of wheat and rye, was first cultivated 15,000 years ago and is vital to agriculture today . Barley which has been malted is a key ingredient in brewing beer along with hops and yeast. The research, published in the journal . Nature, could also be a boon for the whisky industry while barley is . also a major component of animal feed for meat and dairy industries. Barley is the world's fourth most important cereal crop, behind maize, rice and wheat. First cultivated more than 15,000 years ago, it belongs to the same family as wheat and rye. Together, they provide about 30 per cent of all calories consumed worldwide. Beer is the world's most widely consumed alcoholic beverage and the third-most popular drink overall, after water and tea. Thought by some to be the oldest fermented beverage, beer is produced by the saccharification of starch and fermentation of the resulting sugar. The starch and saccharification enzymes are often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly malted barley and malted wheat. Unmalted maize and rice are widely used adjuncts to lighten the flavour because of their lower cost. The preparation of beer is called brewing.  Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours; and The Hymn to Ninkasi, a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served also as a method of remembering the recipe for beer. With a genome almost twice the size of . that of humans, determining the sequence of barley DNA was a major . challenge, researchers said. They said the crop plant's genome . contains a large proportion of closely related sequences that are . difficult to piece together in a true linear order. However by applying various strategies to circumvent these difficulties Professor Waugh and his team were able to put together a high resolution draft with most of the 32,000 barley genes in linear order. Their research reveals the functional proportions of the barley genome, giving a detailed analysis of where and when genes are switched on in different tissues at different stages of development. This, they hope, will offer researchers a far better understanding of the crop's immune system. 'It will accelerate research in barley, and its close relative, wheat,' Professor Waugh said. 'Armed with this information breeders and scientists will be much better placed to deal with the challenge of effectively addressing the food security agenda under the constraints of a rapidly changing environment.'","Barley is the second most important crop in UK agriculture .

"Madeleine McCann suspect Euclides Monteiro was quizzed about a string of sex assaults linked to her disappearance before he died, his widow revealed last night. Luisa Rodrigues said Portuguese police investigating Madeleine’s abduction questioned the convicted burglar about a spate of sex attacks at Algarve holiday villas in 2008, the year after the three-year-old vanished. She claimed DNA tests had put the recovering heroin addict, a former worker at the Ocean Club holiday complex in Praia da Luz that Madeleine vanished from seven years ago yesterday, in the clear. Euclides Monteiro was quizzed about a string of sex assaults linked to her disappearance before he died, his widow revealed last night . And she said police never asked Monteiro, who died in a 2009 tractor accident, about Madeleine. British police heading a separate investigation  into Madeleine’s disappearance are trying to identify a serial sex attacker who may have struck at least 18 times in Algarve holiday resorts from 2004. Miss Rodrigues, who admitted earlier this year that two female Portuguese detectives had questioned her last October, broke her silence on Portuguese state broadcaster RTP. Insisting that he had gone straight after finishing a five-year prison sentence in 1999, she said: ‘Euclides was summonsed to the police station in Portimao, the same one heading the Madeleine McCann investigation, in 2008. Luisa Rodrigues, the suspect's widow, claimed DNA had cleared the heroin addict . ‘He was told they were looking for a tall black man who had broken into country homes and sexually assaulted children inside. ‘He denied any involvement in the indecent assaults. Police did DNA tests at the time and ruled him out as a suspect and apologised for troubling him. ‘They never mentioned Madeleine McCann. Until the day he died the police never contacted him again.’ Memorial: Seven years after her disappearance, low-key tributes were paid to Madeleine during a service in Rothley, Leicestershire .

"Southampton are planning a £70million spree over the coming days to replace their 'lost boys.' And the Saints will keep tabs on some of the players Manchester United are prepared to let go as they reshape their squad. The south coast club want United’s Mexican striker Javier Hernandez and either Wilfried Zaha or Ashley Young, depending on which winger Louis van Gaal is prepared to sell. Scroll down for video . Wanted: Javier Hernandez (left) is a target for Southampton who have £70million to spend this summer . Target: Wilfried Zaha (right) is also attracting the attention of Southampton this pre-season . But they . will have to act fast if they want to land Zaha the player having agreed . 'terms' with three clubs QPR, West Ham and former club Palace. New . Saints boss Ronald Koeman has also targeted Dutch duo Ron Vlaar of . Aston Villa and Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk, while Celtic goalkeeper Fraser . Forster  is another target. The . problem for Southampton is that other clubs will hike up their transfer . fees knowing the Saints have banked £100m by selling five first-team . players. Manchester United will this week attempt to complete the signing of German defender Mats Hummels. But United will have to up their original offer of £17m to nearly £25m if they are to force German club Borussia Dortmund to sell. The Red Devils also want to force through the capture of Arturo Vidal from Juventus, while the situation regarding PSG striker Edinson Cavani remains in the balance. United have trailed Cavani for a long time, even before Van Gaal arrived, but the Uruguay striker keeps sending out mixed messages about his future. That is perhaps because Chelsea’s interest in the striker re-surfaced last week even though Jose Mourinho has said he has completed transfer business. Manchester bound? Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels could be heading to United for £25m . West Ham may try to lure Peter Crouch to Upton Park from Stoke. With Andy Carroll possibly sidelined for four months, the 33-year-old could be seen as a like-for-like replacement. Ideally the Hammers would want the striker on loan, but Stoke would prefer to sell Crouch for a fee of £1m and clear his £45,000-a-week wages off their books. West Ham, who continued their busy summer of dealings by bringing in Carl Jenkinson from Arsenal on a season-long loan, may consider that as decent business. Arsenal will make one more bid for German midfielder Sami Khedira this week. But the Real Madrid player, who is valued at around £30m, could disappoint Arsene Wenger by opting for a move to Bayern Munich. Should that happen, then Wenger could turn his attention to another German midfielder - Bayer Leverkusen's Lars Bender. Wenger has also insisted he wants to keep Joel Campbell at the club now he is back from his loan spells, but AC Milan have also shown an interest in taking the Costa Rican for a year. London call: Sami Khedira could yet join Arsenal but also has the option of a return to Germany with Bayern . Crystal Palace, who have already completed some astute business this summer, are now on the trail of Swansea’s Jonjo Shelvey. But Shelvey's former club Liverpool are also considering making a move for a Swansea player, striker Wilfried Bony. Liverpool's move comes after their bid to sign Loic Remy from QPR for £8m collapsed. Rangers boss Harry Redknapp, meanwhile, has recommended to the QPR board to offer Remy a new contract and double his wages to around £70,000 a week. But the France striker is reluctant to sign a new deal with Rangers because it would change the release clauses in his contract. However, if no club comes in for Remy before the end of the transfer window - Newcastle have yet to make an expected move - the forward may  renegotiate with the newly-promoted west London side. Redknapp will argue to the club they will be getting a top-class striker who is already on their books for 'free' and that if Remy's goals keep QPR in the Premier League then the increase in wages would easily be covered. On the move? Jonjo Shelvey could leave Swansea and join Tony Pulis at Crystal Palace . Target: Liverpool could move for Wilfried Bony (left) after Loic Remy's failed medical last week . I am hearing . German club Wolfsburg, who were beaten by Everton in their bid to sign Romelu Lukaku, have now turned their attentions to Manchester United's Japanese playmaker Shinji Kagawa. Libero . While many  Premier League clubs have been trotting the globe ahead of the new campaign, Barcelona opted to travel to Burton in the East Midlands and work out at  St George’s Park - the FA's £100m complex - ahead of their pre-season European tour. 'The facilities are amazing, and everybody has been very impressed with the welcome we have received at St George's Park,' Spain forward Pedro said. 'The training is fantastic, the rooms are excellent and the weather is ideal to train in every day. 'Being able to stay here and not going abroad, for example to the States, is better because the team can train better, train twice a day and at the end of the day, that will benefit us physically and tactically.' Pass masters: Barcelona made use of the facilities at St George's Park as past of their pre-season preparation . You couldn’t make it up really. The great Catalan club come to England for the facilities and weather while English clubs go all around the world. But then, as Louis van Gaal has already identified, the pre-season schedules of England's top clubs like Manchester United have more to do with commercial interests than getting the team in the right condition, which is clearly the priority of  Barcelona. That said, after years of planning and over £100m spent in building a training centre to improve the grass roots as well as provide top-class facilities for England teams, St George’s Park would seem to have commercial interests rather high on the agenda. If the place is about improving all levels of the English game, why is it being hired out to foreign teams? At a time when school holidays are on, the management of St George’s Park opted to take a lucrative booking from Barcelona. Close to home: English sides have flown to American while Barcelona were content to stay in Europe . A few weeks back it was Romanian side Steaua Bucharest  who were the 'customers'. Over the last years, many foreign clubs and countries have trained in Burton. No doubt there are some decent coaching courses held, but it seems St George’s Park has become pre-occupied with commercial considerations rather than fulfilling the purpose for which it was built, and replicating French model of Claire Fontaine. Back Heel . It wasn’t so long ago that pre-season was often about players losing excess baggage put on in the summer, but it would seem that Newcastle’s Hatem Ben Arfa has been maintaining the old tradition. Ripped black bin liners under shirts was one method of sweating off the pounds back in the day before special diets, gyms, saunas and ice baths made their way into training grounds. Going down to the coast and running in sand was also a favoured method of restoring muscle strength - indeed, I see Chelsea have installed their own sand running track at Cobham. But this footage  from 1935 shows how West Ham limbered up for that season in a very basic way and also tested a novel ideal to stop conceding goals - by training with THREE keepers. BTW . On the subject of West Ham, how bizarre the position of manager Sam Allardyce has seemingly been stabilised as a consequences of Ravel Morrison being arrested for alleged assault and put in custody on remand. But, even if Allardyce is in charge at the start of the season, he will have 10 games at the most to stay there. This time around, a bad start will spell the sack for Big Sam. I’m sure he is aware of it but whether he changes his game plan to lighten things up at the club remains to be seen. But there will be one of obvious change in the club’s style this season. West Ham have ditched traditional claret and blue shirts for an all claret top. So while for some they have been playing like Bolton under Sam in recent reasons they will look like Burnley. Trouble: Ravel Morrison (left) is in custody after being charged with assaulting two women last weekend . Y-Factor . Why, having explained he didn’t want to upset Chelsea fans by spending a few months on loan at QPR is Frank Lampard poised to warm up for move to the MLS with New York City 'on loan' with their parent club Manchester City ?

"Diego Maradona thinks Steven Gerrard and England's defence should be held responsible for the defeat to Uruguay that crushed their World Cup hopes. The Argentina legend singled out Gerrard for his part in the 2-1 loss, saying the England captain 'could have done better' in both goals that were scored by his Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez. The 1986 World Cup hero thinks the skipper could have tracked Uruguay's Nicolas Lodeiro better for the first goal, before he 'made a mess' by nodding the ball into Suarez's path for the second. VIDEO Scroll down to hear Zlatan Ibrahimovic have his say on England's tough group . Gutted: Steven Gerrard 'must take the blame' along with the English defence, accordng to Diego Maradona . Distraught: England players looked disappointed after the loss to Uruguay all but ensured World Cup elimination . Header: Gerrard was unlucky to nod the ball into Luis Suarez's path for Uruguay's winner . 'For England, who dominated the second half but were let down by the final pass or the final touch, it was the same old story of what could have been,' said Maradona, as reported by the Times of India. 'Gerrard and the English defence must take the blame for both Uruguay goals. When Lodeiro started his run before the first, Gerrard could have done better. 'But Lodeiro passed it perfectly for (Edinson) Cavani, whose sublime cross eluded the central defenders and found an unmarked Suarez waiting joyously inside the box. 'It was Gerrard again who made a mess of a long shot from the Uruguayan goalkeeper after England had equalised. 'The ball went to Suarez, who once again found a lot of room in the penalty area before unleashing a ferocious shot. 'You can't afford that with a striker of his class and England paid the price.' Diego Maradona says 'you can't afford that with a striker of (Suarez's) class and England paid the price' Survived: Uruguay celebrate as they beat England 2-1 to move up Group D . And Maradona thinks the game was won and lost between Suarez and Wayne Rooney. 'Apart from scoring the only English goal, Rooney headed one on to the crossbar and on another occasion, failed to beat the goalkeeper from close-range,' he said. 'It summed up the tale of the two strikers. 'Suarez became a hero by converting two of the chances he got, Rooney capitalised on just one of several he had, and that made the difference in the fate of the teams. 'Uruguay won because they were better in handling their scoring opportunities.' So close: Wayne Rooney's header came within inches of going in, only for the crossbar to deny him .

"Russian television makers have been accused of using an actress to pose as at least five different women opposed to the revolution in Ukraine. The blonde woman was seen on television broadcasts as an aggrieved housewife in Odessa, describing her terror at the 'pro-fascist' politicians who grabbed power in Ukraine during last month's revolution. However, many social network users were quick to notice that the 'housewife' bears an uncanny resemblance to several other women interviewed - prompting accusations that she is an actress hired to sow discord in Ukraine and stoke pro-Moscow groups to incite people against the Kiev authorities. Allegations: Russian television makers have been accused of using this woman, seen here as a housewife in Odessa, to pose as five different people opposed to the revolution in Ukraine . Similarities: Many social network users were quick to notice that the 'housewife' bears an uncanny resemblance to four other women interviewed . It is alleged that the woman, believed to be 40, also appeared as a soldier's mother on the barricades in Kiev, and was seen wrapped in a Russian flag in Kharkov. Ukrainian media outlets, who describe her as a 'well known guest actress', say she has also  appeared in protests in Sevastopol in Crimea and Norocherkassk in Russia. She regularly appeals for Russian . help for pro-Moscow Ukrainians, it has been claimed, and speaks of persecution in her . country, leading to claims she is a warrior in Putin's propaganda army.

Last night, LifeNews website in Russia was alleged to have featured the same woman in a broadcast, where this time she was named as mother-of-three Tatiana Samoilenko. This time she had darker hair, although there was no immediate confirmation of her identity or past history. She told how she had to flee Ukraine with her Russian husband and three young children. However, it is unclear when she actually did so, because if she is indeed the same woman who appeared in previous shows she would have been so busy in recent days being filmed at pro-Russian protests. Ukrainians have accused Russia of paying hired hecklers to stir up dissent or occupy government buildings. Hundreds of 'Putin tourists' are alleged to have flown in since the troubles began in Ukraine. A new guise: Tonight LifeNews website in Russia named her as mother-of-three Tatiana Samoilenko, although this time her hair was darker . 'We are a mixed family, my husband is a citizen of Russia, I am Ukrainian,' she was quoted as saying. 'When those pro-fascist politicians got power, we did not think  for long. We decided to go to Russia. We quickly understood we had no time to waste, or it could get worse.' She told how the family had to leave behind everything - property, good jobs, money on bank accounts, because they were forbidden to take cash out, an allegation Ukrainians say is 'absurd'. She alleged: 'We understood very well that if we leave all we have behind, we would need to start from the very beginning in the new country.

"Leading doctors have claimed NHS patients are being routinely placed on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway by out-of-hours medics who are ‘strangers’ who have never been involved in their care. The claims suggest patients are often left to die on the end-of-life regime, which involves being deprived of drugs, food and water, after doctors make decisions based on ‘bedside evidence’ alone and without fully understanding the patients’ condition or medical history. The Liverpool Care Pathway is designed to ease suffering in the final hours or days of those suffering a terminal illness. Hospitals will no longer be able to reap financial bonuses by putting patients on the Liverpool Care Pathway, a scheme that governs the treatment of the seriously ill. File picture . But the Government is reviewing the procedure after relatives complained their loved ones were placed on it without their knowledge. Now doctors speaking to Channel 4’s Dispatches programme, to be broadcast tomorrow evening, have described the situation as ‘inhumane’. The programme highlights the case of Sammy De Francisci, who was put on the pathway by out-of-hours doctors after suffering a series of strokes and dementia but went on to live for a further 14 months after his own doctor reversed the decision. The Liverpool Care Pathway has been the subject of much debate since it was introduced in the 1990s. More than 130,000 people are put on it each year but it was revealed in December 60,000 patients die on the procedure each year without giving their consent. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has backed the Liverpool Care Pathway as giving terminally ill patients a dignified end . Concerns have been raised that clinical judgments are being skewed by incentives for hospitals to use the pathway. Health trusts are thought to have been rewarded with an extra £30million for putting more patients on the LCP. Critics say it is a self-fulfilling prophecy because there is no scientific method of predicting when death will come. Norman . Lamb, the care services minister, launched a review in November, saying . there had been too many cases of families not being consulted and hospitals will not longer be able to make financial gains from the procedure. But some people say it allows the terminally ill to die with dignity. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said last year the scheme is a 'fantastic step forward' for those who are near death and that it is designed to bring 'hospice-style care' to hospitals.","Claims Liverpool Care Pathway patients left to die based on 'bedside evidence' only .

"A Southern California couple with a shared passion for Disneyland ended 2012 by completing the remarkable achievement of having visited the tourist attraction every single day of last year. Jeff Reitz and Tonya Mickesh both started last year out of work, but with annual passes to their favorite theme park given to them as a present from a friend. The couple, who met in July 2006 and don’t have children, decided to visit Disneyland on a daily basis as a way to pass the time while they searched for work, but even after finding jobs they decided to keep up their daily pilgrimage. Disney nuts! Tonya Mickesh and Jeff Reitz visited Disneyland every day during 2012 after a friend bought them annual passes . During their daily visits Disneyland, Tonya Mickesh (left) and Jeff Reitz (behind her) enjoyed mugging for the on-ride still camera on Space Mountain . ‘It was a way to keep ourselves occupied because we didn’t have jobs,’ Mickesh told the Orange County Register. ‘Originally, we thought we’d get jobs and stop doing it, but we kept it going.’ Most days, the couple had a set routine to their visits. They would arrive early in the morning to beat the crowds and park in the Mickey & Friends car park. Highlights for the couple over the year included spending 24 hours in the park for the 24-hour Leap Day and watching the baby ducks in the park grow up. They also made friendship with the park staff and became known as the ‘everyday Disneyland couple.’ Both Jeff and Tonya are big Disney fans who have been visiting to theme park since they were small children, Jeff was only six months old when his parents first took him. In 2012, Mickesh’s favorite attraction was the Pirates of the Caribbean, while for Reitz it was the Matterhorn. As well as enjoying the rides, the daily trips also provided the couple with plenty of exercise and using a pedometer they worked out that they walked between two and four miles per visit. Remarkable achievement: Tonya Mickesh and Jeff Reitz have been made honorary citizens of Disneyland after visiting every day for an entire year . Jeff Reitz, right, and Tonya Mickesh hold all their parking stubs for visiting Disneyland every day in 2012 . The couple's daily visits including a trip to the park on Christmas Day . As the year progressed the daily visits became harder to fit into their schedules as the couple found work. Mickesh’s job started in late April and entailed working the second shift, so they would go in the mornings. Then Reitz found a job in September, making it difficult to go together. So during the week they would go at separate times, leaving the weekends for joint trips. There were also days when they nearly didn’t make it. One day Reitz got delayed at work and made it to the front gate with only 20 minutes to spare. During his daily visits to Disneyland Jeff made friends with a number of staff who worked at the park . Both Mickesh and Reitz say they thoroughly enjoyed the experience, but they have no plans to keep up their daily visits in 2013 . The couple’s premium passes cost $649 apiece, include parking, which means that the cost per day per person was $1.77 over the 366 days. To celebrate their remarkable achievement, the couple were made honorary citizens of Disneyland by Chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Tom Staggs in a brief ceremony in front of the castle on New Year's Eve. Both Mickesh and Reitz say they thoroughly enjoyed the experience, but they have no plans to keep up their daily visits in 2013.

"Some of the schoolgirls abducted by militant group Boko Haram may never return home, Nigeria's influential former president Olusegun Obasanjo said today. Obasanjo said President Goodluck Jonathan's administration had taken too long to respond to the April mass abduction. The warning from Obasanjo, who stepped down in 2007 and nurtured Jonathan's own rise to power, will dismay parents who have now waited 60 days for any news of their daughters, taken from a school in the village of Chibok in northeast Nigeria. Captured: Boko Haram released this image of around 270 girls who were taken in April . Once Jonathan's mentor and one of his strongest political allies, Obasanjo turned against him last December. ‘I believe that some of them will never return. We will still be hearing about them many years from now,’ Obasanjo told the BBC's Hausa-language radio service on Thursday, in comments echoed in an interview with Nigeria's Premium Times website. Obasanjo's criticisms underline divisions within his and Jonathan's ruling People's Democratic Party, heightened by the failure of the government and army to rescue the girls and by political jostling ahead of presidential elections due in 2015. ‘If you get all of them back, I will consider it a near-miracle... 'Do you think they (Boko Haram) will hold all of them together up till now? Warning: Former president Olusegun Obasanjo said President Goodluck Jonathan's administration had taken too long to respond to the April mass abduction . 'The logistics for them to do that, holding over 200 girls together, is too much,’ Obasanjo said, according to Premium Times. ‘If the administration had acted quickly, we could have rescued them,’ he said. Boko Haram, which wants to set up an Islamist caliphate in Africa's largest economy, has fought back against an army offensive and killed thousands in bomb and gun attacks, striking as far afield as the central city of Jos and the capital Abuja. ‘As these events get reported, it's bringing far more publicity for their (Boko Haram's) cause and it's putting pressure on the Nigerian government,’ Martin Roberts, a senior Africa analyst at research firm IHS, told Reuters. Activists have staged regular street protests demanding that Jonathan step up efforts to free the girls. The president has also faced hostile media coverage and a vociferous global #BringBackOurGirls Twitter campaign. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau appears in a video where he showed some of the hundreds of schoolgirls his terror group abducted nearly two months ago . Jonathan has traded accusations over the failure to crush Boko Haram with the main opposition party, which runs local authorities in the northeastern regions at the heart of the five-year-old revolt. Obasanjo, twice president and a powerful political godfather, has progressively fallen out with Jonathan. In a letter leaked in December, he said any decision by Jonathan to seek a second term in the 2015 poll would be ‘morally flawed’. Jonathan has not confirmed he will run again, but campaign-style posters and banners bearing his image have sprung up around the capital. His assumed ambition to seek re-election is a thorny issue in religiously mixed Nigeria, where alternating the presidency between the majority Christian south and the mostly Muslim north has been considered an unwritten rule. Jonathan, a southern Christian, was vice president and came to power when President Umaru Yar'Adua, a northern Muslim, died in May 2010, three years into his first term. Underlining the growing pressure for more action on Boko Haram, Nigeria's defence ministry said on Thursday it was studying the military tactics used by Sri Lanka to crush the island nation's rebel Tamil Tigers.","Former president says government took too long to respond .

"The severe drought that has gripped the western United States for 14 years is literally changing the landscape. In total the amount of water lost in the current drought - about 63 trillion gallons - is enough to cover the whole area in six inches (15cm) of water. But more alarmingly, scientists have found that the loss of water  is causing the entire western US to rise up like an uncoiled spring. Researchers in San Diego say a 14-year drought is raising the ground. Earth's crust in some locations has lifted by 0.16 inches in just 18 months. These maps of GPS points in the western United States show the changes in the landscape, with blue indicating a drop and yellow-red reflecting a rise. The research was carried out by scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. Since the year 2000, seven western states in the US has seen their driest periods in centuries. These states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming . And scientists in California have warned that the region may be experiencing a century-long 'mega-drought'. The warnings come after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580, and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years. In 2013, California received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850. However droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state. Looking back over several thousand years, droughts have been known to last over a decade, and in some cases they can last a century. And the patterns tend to repeat, meaning another drought of this length will probably happen again in the future. Investigating ground positioning data from GPS stations throughout the west, the researchers Dr Adrian Borsa, Dr Duncan Agnew, and Dr Dan Cayan found that the water shortage is causing an 'uplift' effect, . This was up to 0.5 inches (15mm) in California's mountains and on average 0.15 inches (4mm) across the entire western US. From the GPS data, they estimate the water deficit at nearly 240 gigatons (62 trillion gallons), equivalent to a six-inch (15cm) layer of water spread out over the entire western U.S. Results of the study, which was supported by the US Geological Survey (USGS), appear in the journal Science. Dr Borsa, a Scripps assistant research geophysicist, kept noticing the same pattern over the 2003-2014 period while looking at data, namely that all of the stations moved upwards in the most recent years, coinciding with the timing of the current drought. Dr Agnew, a Scripps Oceanography geophysics professor who specialises in studying earthquakes and their impact on shaping the earth's crust, says the GPS data can only be explained by rapid uplift of the tectonic plate upon which the western US rests. He adds, however, that the uplift has virtually no effect on the San Andreas fault and therefore does not increase the risk of earthquakes. The uplift has been linked to the loss of 63 trillion gallons of water in the drought. Pictured is the Plate Boundary Observatory GPS station P466, located in the Inyo Mountains near Lone Pine, California. Its displacement data was used to determine water changes in the western US . For Dr Cayan, a research meteorologist with Scripps and USGS, the results paint a new picture of the dire hydrological state of the west. 'These results quantify the amount of water mass lost in the past few years,' said Dr Cayan. 'It also represents a powerful new way to track water resources over a very large landscape. 'We can home in on the Sierra Nevada mountains and critical California snowpack. 'These results demonstrate that this technique can be used to study changes in fresh water stocks in other regions around the world, if they have a network of GPS sensors.' When water is lost because of a lack of rain and snow, Earth's crust rises. It typically sags in the winter and spring, weighed down by water, and it rises during the dry season in summer and fall, said Dr Borsa. The authors removed those seasonal factors when analyzing about a decade of data from GPS stations within the National Science Foundation's Plate Boundary Observatory. Last year, an area stretching west of the Rocky Mountains witnessed a 'massive uplift,' Dr Borsa explained. The rise was most striking in the Sierra Nevada mountains and California coastal regions, but it was spread over the entire region, unlike previous years when some pockets have gone up and others went down. 'It's just amazing to us that this covers the entire western United States,' Dr Borsa said. The loss of water since last year is equivalent to the annual loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet, according to the study. The team hopes authorities use the measurements as a tool to measure the impact of drought. On 19 Aug 2014 Lake Mead near Las Vegas, Nevada (shown) dropped to it's lowest water level ever as the 14 year drought continued throughout the US. The drought is clearly visible with the white rock exposed on the side of the mountains in 'Black Canyon' district, seen here .","Researchers in San Diego say a 14-year drought is raising the ground .

"Three Muslim children have been sent to school with 'Halal only' badges taped to their uniforms after one of them was served non-Halal food in the canteen on 'eight or nine occasions'. Khadija Khan, five, has been given non-Halal food by staff at Woodside Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire, numerous times despite her parents writing to the school to express their beliefs. Her mother, Henna Khan, 29, has now decided to take matters into her own hands and said she has taped the stickers to her children's uniforms in 'protest'. Scroll down for video . Henna Khan, 29, has sent her three children (from left: Mohammed Talib, four, Khadija Khan, five, and Tayyeba Khan, three) to school with 'Halal only' badges after her eldest daughter was given non-Halal food several times . Mrs Khan, 29, said she will continue to send her children to school with the badges 'for as long as it takes' The mother (pictured with her children) said her eldest child has been given non-halal food numerous times . She said she will continue to send Khadija and her other children, four-year-old Mohammed Talib and three-year-old Tayyeba, to school with the notices 'for as long as it takes'. She said: 'I really didn't know what to do anymore. 'We have counted this happening on eight or nine occasions. They have only been attending Woodside Academy for over a year and a half now and yet this has happened a good few times. 'My children are not the only pupils who eat halal food, which makes me wonder how many others have been given meals by mistake? What if they had allergies? 'The signs are the only way, other than a packed lunch, that I know my children will not be given non-Halal meals. 'The ""Halal only"" signs on the uniforms are a protest by me and my children, which is what I told the head teacher and that it will continue for as long as it takes.' Mrs Khan said: ''The ""Halal only"" signs on the uniforms are a protest by me and my children' Woodside Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire (pictured), has apologised to the family and said an investigation had been launched to establish why the mistakes with the school dinners had occurred . Mrs Khan and her husband Talib Hussain, 38, said they took action after losing confidence in the school's ability to prevent the dishes being served to their children. They said they wrote to the school and even went in to see staff on a number of occasions last year when Khadija was served non-Halal food for her school dinner. Halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade, while a Muslim butcher recites a religious verse. All blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under Islamic law. Under Islamic law, an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious. In comparison, the non-halal method involves taking animals to an abattoir where they are stunned before being killed. It means the animal is unconscious when it is killed and has an instantaneous death, as opposed to enduring what animal rights activists claim is drawn-out pain and suffering. Once the animal has been killed at the abattoir, it is removed and taken to be hung and butchered. On one occasion, it was her younger brother, Mohammed, who pointed out the mistake and the meal was switched. However, they said the breaking point came last week when the schoolgirl was again given non-halal food. They said their daughter has regularly been offered ham and crackers in the classroom and sent home with a bag of jelly sweets, which contain gelatine that is banned under Halal rules. Both parents said that because their children are so young, they sometimes struggle to differentiate between halal and non-halal food, meaning they have to put their faith in the school to provide the correct option. The school, which is an independently-run academy, is provided the food by Bradford Council, where meals are prepared off-site and separated for different dietary requirements. Staff at the school are informed about which pupils should be given the specially prepared meals. Woodside Academy apologised to the family and said an investigation had been launched to establish why the mistakes have occurred. Mrs Khan said: 'Every time we complained to the school they say they are going to look into why this is happening, yet these mistakes keep happening. 'I asked them does this happen to any of the other children, which they replied no. The concerned mother said her eldest daughter (centre) had been given non-Halal food up to 'nine times' It is against Muslim belief to eat non-Halal meat, which is slaughtered in a different way to Halal (file picture) 'This made me question whether someone is doing this on purpose. It has been quite stressful for us since we have moved to the area and I have even been to see the head teacher in tears. 'We have never had any problems with the school and the kids all do well here. They just need to give the right meals to the right children.' The family also complained to Bradford Council, who sent a letter informing them that staff would be given Halal awareness training. A spokesman for Woodside Academy said they regretted the incident and confirmed they are liaising with the Bradford Council to undertake an investigation into their procedures.","Henna Khan has sent her three children to school with 'Halal only' badges .

"On the run: Hans Mills ditched his son, 10, who is fighting cancer, and a 14-year-old Down Syndrome daughter, to flee Canada .

And so, with extensive work contacts in South East Asia, he sent his former love Donna Mills an email saying he had left the country for good. He wrote on November 2, 2011: 'The result of the legal instrument you recently designed and implemented is there's no possibility of a comfortable life or (secure) retirement for me in Canada at all. 'Therefore I have left the country to seek greener pastures elsewhere, and will never return. Well done Einstein. Good luck and goodbye.' It saw him join the legion of 120,000 parents in Ontario wanted for being in arrears on spousal and child support payments. Speaking to thestar.com from his new Manila home, he said he blamed a 'broken' Family Court system that 'forced him to cut and run'. He said: 'I did a terrible, awful thing, because I had no reasonable option. I miss my children terribly. I abandoned Canada, but not my children. 'My hope is some day I reconcile with my children, but not in Canada, a morally bankrupt state. The Philippines is about as far as I could go.  If I'd a spaceship I’d be much further away.' He said his children were 'innocent bystanders who got caught in the crossfire' and added that it was 'not my intention to hurt them'. He also revealed he would 'never, ever, ever, ever' pay spousal support nor return to Canada. It is a blow for his ex-wife, who has spent eight months trying to get Ontario's Family Responsibility Office to find him. She told thestar.com: 'Financially, emotionally, physically, and spiritually, I am approaching bankruptcy. If I go down, the kids go down, and I can't let that happen.' Abandoned by their father: Donna Mills with three of her children (left to right) Steven, 10, Jackie, 14, and 17-year-old Maggie . The trouble began when the couple split in 2005. After a two-day trial, they agreed Mrs Mills would have sole custody of the children and stay in the $1.2million Lake Ontario house. He would pay child support, and she would pay $175,000 to buy him out of the house, which had a $600,000 mortage on it. She would also receive $2,000 a month in rent from a separate flat. But Donna later said she was 'rushed and . pressured and did not read' before signing, and that she did not . understand she would never receive any future spousal support. Mr . Mills said: 'Donna got the million dollar lakefront mansion and full . custody of the children with child support, but no spousal support, in . exchange for the house. 'Everyone at the time agreed that my spousal support obligation had been met fully.' The . feud grew for several years until a new trial was scheduled for autumn . 2011 after Mr Mills had reportedly tried to take his ex-wife to court . three times. She decided to . use it as an opportunity to ask a court to grant her spousal support. This was granted before the trial when, in June 2011, a judge issued a . temporary order for the payments. Happier times: Hans and Donna Mills with all four of their children before they separated in 2005 . He also awarded her retrospective . payments and court costs. Mr Mills left the country before the trial . could take place. He now lives in Dasmarinas City, 30 miles south of . Manila, with his new wife, former caregiver Rosemarie Espiritu. He . has since said his fleeing was a 'purely tactical response to an . untenable situation' and accused his ex of using their son Steven's . cancer as a 'weapon' against him. He . said that, as far as he knew, the disease was 'in check' and that their . eldest son, who is being treated on a methadone programme, was now an . adult and so not a dependent. And he said that he was not 'in greener pastures' by saying: 'I live in the Philippines for Heaven's sake. 'This . is not a country club. I have to keep a loaded shotgun beside my bed at . night in case of attack, of which there have been several.' Former . teacher Mrs Mills, a Danish immigrant with both a Canadian and European . passport, in the meantime said she cannot work because of her 'onerous' family responsibilities. And . the situation looks unlikely to change as the Philippines is beyond the . reach of Canadian laws, even though he owes $28,000 arrears and his . debt is growing by $3,772 per month.

"This is the horrific moment schoolchildren crowded around to watch as the body of a perfectly healthy giraffe was chopped up before being fed to lions. Despite more than 20,000 people signing an online petition to save two-year-old Marius, staff at Copenhagen Zoo yesterday went ahead and shot the animal with a bolt pistol. Young children stood at arm’s length as his carcass was skinned and dissected before the meat was thrown to the lions. Perfectly healthy: Another Danish zoo may put down one of its giraffes just days after Marius (above) was shot dead and autopsied in the presence of visitors at Copenhagen Zoo . Copenhagen Zoo's giraffe Marius who was put down by the zoo authorities in a controversial action that has drawn widespread condemnation . The Danish zoo said the drastic move was needed to combat inbreeding and insisted the display was educational. But . animal rights campaigners last night condemned the killing of Marius, . saying it exposed the cruel reality of welfare even in Europe’s top . zoos. Marius’s plight had . triggered worldwide outpourings of protest, including an offer to rehome . him in Britain, with many saying they were sickened by a zoo killing a . healthy animal. Copenhagen . Zoo said it was told by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria . (EAZA) that Marius was genetically too similar to the other giraffes in . its breeding programme. Because captive animals are bred from a limited . gene pool, zoos are monitored to prevent inbreeding and ensure the . health of future generations. After . announcing plans to have Marius put down, the zoo received offers of a . new home – including one from Yorkshire Wildlife Park – as well as a . private buyer who offered 500,000 euros (£410,000). A lion feasts on the remains of Marius at Copenhagen Zoo after the mammal was put down earlier in the day . A crown gathers for the public autopsy on Marius's body . Captivated: Children watch as the body of the giraffe is butchered in front of them . But . bosses said the rules of EAZA membership meant animals could not be . transferred to institutions that did not follow its rules on breeding . programmes. The zoo’s scientific director, Bengt Holst, said it was the same as parks culling deer to keep the whole population healthy. He . said: ‘Giraffes today breed very well, and when they do you have to . choose and make sure the ones you keep are the ones with the best genes. The most important factor must be that the animals are healthy . physically and behaviourally and that they have a good life while they . are living, whether this life is long or short.’ Mr . Holst said the zoo didn’t give its eight giraffes contraceptives due to . ‘unwanted side effects on the internal organs’ and in order to allow . animals to display natural parenting behaviour. According to Danish . media, Copenhagen Zoo destroys 20-30 animals a year, including bears, . tigers and zebras. Mr Holst . told the BBC spaces at institutions such as Yorkshire Wildlife Park . should be reserved for ‘genetically more important’ giraffes and that . the campaign to save Marius had gone ‘much too far’. Marius (centre) was shot with a bolt gun and will be chopped up for the other animals' dinner . An 18-month-old giraffe named Marius was put down on this morning at Copenhagen Zoo . The animal was deemed 'surplus' before it was put down by zookeepers in Copenhagen . Animal rights campaigners in Denmark tried to save the healthy young giraffe at Copenhagen Zoo from being destroyed . The zoo is part of a European breeding programme for giraffes and is bound by rules over inbreeding to keep animals healthy . To . supporters’ horror, the zoo yesterday announced Marius had been killed . with a bolt gun instead of a lethal injection, which would have . contaminated the flesh. His carcass was then skinned and chopped up while visitors crowded around and the meat was fed to the lion population. A . spokesman said parents were allowed to decide whether their children . should watch what the zoo regarded as an important display of scientific . knowledge about animals, adding that it would have been ‘foolish’ to . let the meat go to waste. Doncaster-based Yorkshire Wildlife Park, whose . Danish head of ‘hoofstock’ offered to rehome Marius, said it was . ‘saddened’ by the news. ‘We . have a state-of-the-art giraffe house built in 2012 with a bachelor herd . of four male giraffes and the capacity to take an extra male, subject . to the agreement of the European studbook keeper,’ it said. However the park said it received no response by the time it learnt that Marius had been destroyed. Stine . Jensen, of Denmark’s Organisation Against the Suffering of Animals, . said the killing showed Copenhagen Zoo was not ‘the  ethical institution . that it wants to portray itself as being’.","Marius was shot with a bolt gun at Copenhagen Zoo .

"A new biography of Louis van Gaal promises to ‘journey into the sinister recesses’ of the Manchester United manager’s character and, boy, does it do just that. Extracts published on Tuesday detail him treating his second wife Truus in a shocking and humiliating manner brought on by drink, a former player describing the moment Van Gaal shouted at him so fiercely the boss's dentures fell out and how the Dutchman had a string of serious car accidents brought on by the exhaustion of being a full-time PE teacher and a semi-professional footballer. It is the account of his relationship with Truus, who he married in 2008, which are most chilling. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal... master, maverick or madman? Louis van Gaal berated a player to fiercely his dentures came out, a new book on the Dutchman claims . Van Gaal  also treats his second wife Truus 'disgracefully' and humilates her in public, the book claims . ‘The way he treats Truus in company is ungentlemanly and sometimes downright disgraceful,’ claims author Hugo Borst in O, Louis: In Search Of Louis van Gaal, serialised in The Times. ‘In the company of friends and acquaintances, Louis has made comments that in nine out of 10 marriages would have been grounds for divorce. People who have lunched or dined with Louis say alcohol does not have a favourable effect on him. ‘Of course he also has sweet things to say about his wife. ""I have a lovely wife,” he said on German TV, “and the sex is good too.”' Former AZ Alkmaar goalkeeper Khalid Sinouh – Van Gaal was manager of the Dutch side between 2005 and 2009 – reveals that his former boss refused to shake his players’ hand after a match unless they had won and also details an incident when Van Gaal thought his players were not training hard enough.

Medical staff extended visiting hours due to the patient enjoying Van Gaal’s company so much. Three days later the match official passed away. Borst also discovered that Van Gaal invested up to £150,000 with Dirk Scheringa, AZ’s flat broke chairman, in an astonishing display of generosity that some claimed naive in the extreme. Van Gaal’s gritty pursuit of success is exemplified by his 180-mile-a-day drive between his home and Rotterdam, where he was a semi-professional player for Sparta. And the three serious car smashes which resulted. Still not enough sinister recesses for you? How about Van Gaal buying a bigger, better and more expensive villa in Portugal just 100 yards from the one belonging to his sworn enemy Ronald Koeman, now also a manager in England at Southampton. ‘Childish perhaps but, to start with at least, this was something Van Gaal liked to boast about,’ writes Borst.

Louis van Gaal claimed Manchester United’s fighting spirit will take them back into the top four after Robin van Persie’s last minute equaliser against Chelsea at Old Trafford. But the United boss criticised his striker’s ‘stupid’ reaction in ripping off his shirt after scoring the goal, earning him a booking.

Van Persie was booked for taking off his shirt and manager Louis van Gaal called his move 'stupid' Didier Drogba had put Chelsea ahead after 53 minutes, but Jose Mourinho was furious when Branislav Ivanovic was sent off by referee Phil Dowd in added time for a second bookable offence. Van Gaal said: ‘Chelsea tried to kill the game, they made the pitch big and we had to run a lot but we fought till the end. ‘When we scored it was deserved. We created a lot of chances - far more than Chelsea. Van Persie was in the right place to fire home the equiliser for Manchester United in stoppage time .

"A two week Chinese incursion has left India on the verge of crises, it has today been reported. India says Chinese troops set up a camp on its side of the ill-defined frontier in Ladakh region in the middle of April. The platoon of Chinese soldiers slipped across the boundary into India in the middle of the night, according to Indian officials. Activists of India's right-wing Shiv Sena, shout anti-China slogans and burn a Chinese flag during a protest against an alleged Chinese incursion. India says Chinese troops set up a camp on its side of the ill-defined frontier in Ladakh region . The platoon of Chinese soldiers slipped across the boundary into India in the middle of the night, according to Indian officials . They were ferried across the bitterly cold moonscape in Chinese army vehicles, then got out to traverse a dry creek bed with a helicopter hovering overhead for protection. They finally reached their destination and pitched a tent in the barren Depsang Valley in the Ladakh region, a symbolic claim of sovereignty deep inside Indian-held territory. So stealthy was the operation that India did not discover the incursion until a day later, Indian officials said. China denies any incursion, but Indian officials say that for two weeks, the soldiers have refused to move back over the so-called Line of Actual Control that divides Indian-ruled territory from Chinese-run land, leaving the government on the verge of a crisis with its powerful northeastern neighbor. Indian officials fear that if they react with force, the face-off could escalate into a battle with the feared People's Liberation Army. But doing nothing would leave a Chinese outpost deep in territory India has ruled since independence. 'If they have come 19 kilometres into India, it is not a minor LAC violation. It is a deliberate military operation. And even as India protests, more tents have come up,' said Sujit Dutta, a China specialist at the Jamia Milia Islamia university in New Delhi. 'Clearly, the Chinese are testing India to see how far they can go,' he said. That is not China's stated view. Activists of the right-winged student's organization Akhila Bharatiya Vidya Parishad (ABVP) burn an effigy representing China. China denies any incursion, but Indian officials say that for two weeks, the soldiers have refused to move back over the so-called Line of Actual Control . 'China strictly complies with the treaty and documents on maintaining peace and stability in the border region between India and China,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said last week. 'The Chinese patrol troops did not go across the Line of Actual Control, not by even one step,"" she said. Local army commanders from both sides have held three meetings over the crisis, according to Indian officials. India's foreign secretary called in the Chinese ambassador to register a strong protest. Yet the troops did not move, and even pitched a second tent, Indian officials said. The timing of the crisis, weeks before Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is to visit India, has surprised many here. The Chinese leader's decision to make India his first trip abroad since taking office two months ago had been seen as an important gesture toward strengthening ties between rival powers that have longstanding border disputes but also growing trade relations. Manoj Joshi, a defense analyst at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation, said the timing of the incursion raises questions about 'whether there is infighting within the Chinese leadership, or whether someone is trying to upstage Li.' India's External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said Wednesday that while he had no plans to cancel a trip to Beijing next week to prepare for Li's visit, the government could reconsider in the coming week. 'A week is a long time in politics,' he told reporters. Indian politicians accused the scandal-plagued government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of floundering in fear before China. 'China realizes that India has a weak government, and a prime minister who is powerless,' said Yashwant Sinha, a former foreign minister from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. He demanded a stronger response. 'A bully will back off the moment it realizes that it's dealing with a country which will not submit to its will,' Sinha said. Former Defense Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav called the government  'cowardly and incompetent.' He warned that China was trying to annex more territory to add to the spoils it took following its victory over India in a brief 1962 border war. Defense Minister A.K. Antony countered that India is 'united in its commitment to take every possible step to safeguard our interests.' Supporters of the right-wing Shiv Sena party burned effigies of Singh, Antony and other top officials Wednesday, demanding India retaliate by barring Chinese imports. It is claimed Chinese soldiers have pitched in the barren Depsang Valley in the Ladakh region, a symbolic claim of sovereignty deep inside Indian-held territory . China is India's biggest trading partner, with bilateral trade, heavily skewed in China's favor, crossing $75 billion in 2011. Analysts feel linking a troop withdrawal to continued trade could work. 'The Chinese have to learn that such aggression cannot be delinked from trade,' said Dutta. Though the two countries have held 15 rounds of talks, their border disputes remain unresolved. India says China is occupying 38,000 square kilometers (15,000 square miles) in the Aksai Chin plateau in the western Himalayas, while China claims around 90,000 square kilometers (35,000 square miles) in India's northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh. Analysts said they were baffled by Beijing's motives, since its actions could force India to move closer to Beijing's biggest rival, the United States. 'The Chinese for some reason don't seem able to see that,' said Joshi. China's aggressive posture could also force India to accelerate its own military modernization program, analysts said. The stand-off may eventually be resolved diplomatically, 'but what it really shows is the PLA's contempt for our military capability,' former Indian navy chief, Sushil Kumar, wrote in The Indian Express newspaper. It could also push the government to agree to the army's longstanding demand to create its own strike corps on the border. 'By needling the Indians, they are helping us to accelerate our modernization,' Joshi said.","Chinese troops set up camp in Ladakh region in middle of April, it's claimed .

Her lawyers actually called Donald Sterling to the stand first, but he wasn't in the courthouse and was ordered to appear when the nonjury trial resumes in Superior Court on Tuesday afternoon. Earlier, a federal judge rejected a bid by Donald Sterling's lawyers to move the case to federal court. Donald Sterling's attorneys argued that their client was induced to undergo mental examination under false pretenses and that his private, personal medical records were given to his wife's 'handpicked' doctors in violation of federal medical privacy laws. Platzer testified that she wasn't told that her evaluation was in connection with the Clippers sale.

'We've been railroaded as quickly as possible into a trial where we have very little discovery,' he said. 'We have not had adequate time to prepare.' O'Donnell replied that the issue had been disposed of earlier, and the judge denied his motion to delay the case. Ruttenberg threatened to object to every question asked by O'Donnell on the same grounds. The judge said he would note that Donald Sterling's lawyers object to every question. Speaking in a packed courtroom, Ruttenberg said: 'This case reads like a Hollywood soap opera. I've called it ""a tale of two Sterlings.""' Platzer was to undergo cross-examination Tuesday when the trial resumes. NBA owners are scheduled to vote on the sale to Ballmer on July 15. That's also the day his offer is set to expire - and there is no deal without the judge's approval of the sale.

"Researchers claim to have found fresh physical evidence the Moon was created when a body the size of Mars smashed into the early Earth in a cataclysmic collision. Analysis of lunar rocks brought back by the Apollo missions shows they have heavier forms of zinc - a telltale sign of the impact billions of years ago. Without the Moon there may have been no life on Earth because it once orbited much closer to us than it does now causing massive tides to ebb and flow every few hours. Scroll down for video . Researcher say new analysis of lunar rocks prove the Moon was created when a body the size of Mars smashed into the early Earth in a cataclysmic collision. These tides caused dramatic fluctuations in salinity around coastlines which are believed to have driven the evolution of primitive DNA-like biomolecules. Planetary scientist Dr Frederic Moynier says the zinc enrichment probably arose because heavier atoms condensed out of the cloud of vaporized rock quicker than lighter onces. His researchers analysed 20 samples of Moon rocks including ones from the Apollo 11, 12, 15 and 17 missions - all of which went to different locations - and one lunar meteorite. Dr Moynier, of Washington University in St Louis, said: 'What we wanted were the basalts because they’re the ones that came from inside the Moon and would be more representative of the Moon’s composition.' According to the Giant Impact Theory, proposed in its modern form at a . conference in 1975, Earth's moon was created in a apocalyptic collision . between a planetary body called Theia (in Greek mythology the mother of . the moon Selene) and the early Earth. This collision was so powerful it is . hard for mere mortals to imagine, but the asteroid that killed the . dinosaurs is thought to have been the size of Manhattan, whereas Theia . is thought to have been the size of the planet Mars. The smashup released so much energy . it melted and vaporized Theia and much of the proto-Earth's mantle. The . Moon then condensed out of the cloud of rock vapor, some of which also . re-accreted to the Earth. Scientists have been looking for this kind of sorting by mass - called isotopic fractionation - since the Apollo missions first brought Moon rocks to Earth in the 1970s. Compared to terrestrial or Martian rocks the lunar rocks have much lower concentrations of zinc but are enriched in the heavy isotopes of zinc. 'The magnitude of the fractionation we . measured in lunar rocks is 10 times larger than what we see in . terrestrial and Martian rocks,' Moynier says, 'so it's an important . difference.' Earth and Mars have isotopic compositions like those of chondritic meteorites, which are thought to represent the original composition of the cloud of gas and dust from which the solar system formed. The most likely large-scale event is wholesale melting during the formation of the Moon. The zinc isotopic data therefore supports the theory a giant impact gave rise to the Earth-Moon system. Dr Moynier, whose study is published in Nature, said: 'The work also has implications for the origin of the Earth because the origin of the Moon was a big part of the origin of the Earth.' Without the stabilising influence of the Moon the Earth would probably be a very different sort of place. Scientists think the Earth would spin more rapidly, days would be shorter, weather more violent and climate more chaotic and extreme. In fact it might have been such a harsh world it would have been unfit for the evolution of humans. The interior of one of the moon rocks analysed as part of the study . Asked how he felt when he saw the first . results, Moynier says, 'When you find something that is new and that has . important ramifications, you want to be sure you haven't gotten . anything wrong. 'I half expected results like those previously obtained for moderately . volatile elements, so when we got something so different, we reproduced . everything from scratch to make sure there were no mistakes because some . of the procedures in the lab could conceivably fractionate the . isotopes.' The data, published in the Oct. 18, . 2012, issue of Nature, provide the first physical evidence for wholesale . vaporization event since the discovery of volatile depletion in Moon . rocks, Moynier says. A new theory put forward by Harvard scientists in a seperate study suggests the Moon was once part of the Earth that spun off after a giant collision with another body. In a paper published on Wednesday in the journal Science, Sarah Stewart and Matija Ćuk said their theory would explain why the Earth and Moon have similar composition and chemistry. The Earth was spinning much faster at the time the Moon was formed, and a day lasted only two to three hours, they said. With the Earth spinning so quickly, a giant impact could have launched enough of the Earth's material to form a moon, the scientists said. According to the new theory, the Earth later reached its current rate of spinning through gravitational interaction between its orbit around the Sun and the Moon's orbit around Earth. The scientists noted that their proposition differed from the current leading theory, which holds that the Moon was created from material from a giant body that struck the Earth. Stewart is a professor of earth and planetary sciences at Harvard, and Ćuk, an astronomer and an investigator at the SETI Institute, which supports research into the search for extraterrestrial life. The latter was conducting post-doctoral research at Harvard.","Analysis of lunar rocks brought back by .

"David Cameron’s credibility has been ‘blown away’ by his Government’s cosy relationship with Rupert Murdoch, a former Tory Cabinet minister warned yesterday. David Mellor said the Prime Minister had shown poor judgment in appointing Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt to preside over Mr Murdoch’s controversial £8billion bid for BSkyB. He warned it was inevitable that Mr Hunt would have to resign. Warning: Ex Tory Cabinet minister David Mellor (left) has accused David Cameron of showing poor judgment in appointing Jeremy Hunt as Culture Secretary . And he suggested Mr Cameron was also badly damaged by his decision to appoint Mr Hunt despite warnings from Government lawyers that he was biased in favour of Mr Murdoch. As he spoke out, Nick Clegg delivered his own thinly veiled attack on Mr Hunt’s relationship with the Murdoch empire. But the Liberal Democrat leader risked charges of hypocrisy after details emerged of his own friendship with the media mogul’s fixer, Fred Michel. Mr Mellor – himself a former Culture Secretary – said there would be ‘a number of scalps’ as a result of the evidence emerging at the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards. Close ties: Nick Clegg also attacked Cameron over his relationship with the Murdoch empire, but risks charges of hypocrisy after it emerged he had played tennis with News Corp lobbyist Fred Michel (right) on a 'handful of occasions' before becoming Deputy Prime Minister . He added: ‘Jeremy Hunt, and I regret this because I admire him, will probably have to go. But the real scalp is the Prime Minister. He won’t have to resign but his credibility is blown away – he appears to be rather a shallow, callow sort of guy who doesn’t have too many aims and ambitions and who can’t even get basic judgment calls right. ‘Every part of the system failed. Jeremy himself probably should have realised he could not take on that quasi-judicial function. The Prime Minister should not have asked him. ‘When the Prime Minister asks you to do something, you tend to do it. But where was the civil service in all this? They are supposed to be the protectors of the integrity of government.’ Asked why the Prime Minister was continuing to back Mr Hunt, Mr Mellor replied: ‘Because he knows the road leads to him.’ Too friendly: Last week it emerged Mr Hunt had exchanged numerous cosy messages with Mr Michel in which they referred to each other as 'daddy' and 'papa' Mr Clegg also twisted the knife yesterday when he said: ‘It is unhealthy when politicians end up in the pockets of media moguls. When vested interests are allowed to twist politicians around their little fingers things go wrong.’ Last week it emerged that Mr Hunt’s office exchanged hundreds of texts and emails with Mr Michel. Most of the messages involved Mr Hunt’s special adviser Adam Smith, who has since been forced to resign. But they also included numerous cosy messages between Mr Hunt and Mr Michel in which they referred to each other as ‘daddy’ and ‘papa’. The two men’s wives gave birth at the same London hospital in late May 2010. Asked about the tone of the messages, Mr Clegg said a situation had been able to develop ‘in a way that was untransparent, not subject to scrutiny, and you didn’t have basic checks and balances on people in positions of power’. Mr Clegg’s attack came as the Liberal Democrats seek to exploit the Conservatives’ discomfort over their links to News Corporation.But details later emerged of his own friendship with Mr Michel. Lib Dem sources confirmed Mr Clegg played tennis with Mr Michel on a ‘handful of occasions’ before he became Deputy Prime Minister. The two men also had a number of informal conversations at the gates of the primary school in London’s fashionable Putney district where they both send their children. Documents released to the Leveson Inquiry also reveal that a number of senior Lib Dems were in close contact with Mr Michel. Mr Clegg’s press secretary Lena Pietsch even invited him for talks in Downing Street while the BSkyB bid was being considered by Government last year. Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that Mr Clegg is considering sending his eldest son Antonio to a £30,000-a-year private school. Only last week, he hit out at the ‘corrosive’ impact on society of the divide between state and private schools. A spokesman for Mr Clegg said Antonio would not go to secondary school until the autumn of next year and no decision had been taken.",Ex Tory Cabinet minister says PM showed poor judgment in appointing Hunt as Culture Secretary .
"Archaeologists have been left stumped after the remains of a Pacific walrus were found buried among human skeletons in a churchyard near London's St Pancras train station. The nine bones of the four-metre long animal were found inside a coffin with eight other sets of human remains, including three skulls, dating back to around 1822. Researchers from Ramboll Cultural Heritage and Archaeology initially made the discovery . in 2003 but following detailed studies of the bones, as well as . searching through zoological records, the team has not found any conclusive proof as to how the animal arrived in the UK. The Pacific walrus, pictured, is often hunted for its ivory tusks and one theory suggests the St Pancras animal may have been brought to the UK for trade . Archaeologists have been left stumped after the remains of a Pacific walrus was found buried among human skeletons in a churchyard near London's St Pancras train station. The remains of the animal, pictured, were found inside a coffin with eight other sets of human remains, including three skulls, dating back to around 1822 . According to Phil Emery's book St Pancras burial ground: excavations for St Pancras International, the London terminus of High Speed 1, 2002–3, the churchyard was extended several times during the post-medieval period. This created the 'New Burying Ground’ in 1792 and the last burial took place in 1854. Emery's study concentrated on the ‘Third Ground’, where 1383 burials were thought to have taken place. He told the MailOnline that a rise in cholera, typhus and small pox at the time led to the high rate of burials. Analysis included reconstruction of coffin stack sequences within known burial rows, illustrated in 3D. A sample of 715 burials underwent 'full osteological analysis, revealing a heterogeneous population buried during a time of rapid urbanisation and industrialisation.' Well-preserved human bones and coffins were found and many of the coffin plates were inscribed with biographical detail. Refugees from the French Revolution as well as three aristocrats were among the discovery, alongside the remains of a Pacific walrus and a dissected tortoise. They believe all the bones inside the . mysterious coffin may have been used for medical science by one of the . 40 anatomy schools in London open during the 19th Century. The burial ground was discovered during excavations of the station when the Eurostar terminal moved from Waterloo to St Pancras in 2003. The research team was lead by archaeologist Phil Emery and was funded by High Speed 1. The walrus bones, as well as the human remains discovered in the coffin, all showed signs of being cut up and dissected for medical research. Many of the remains showed cuts and scrapes consistent with dissection, which was legalised by the Anatomy Act of 1832, and at least one of the human skulls discovered showed signs of 'cranial autopsy' - drilling into the brain. Emery, along with Alan Pipe from the . Museum of London Archaeology, studied the bones and looked at London . Zoological Society records for any clues as to how the bones arrived on . the site. In their book, St Pancras burial ground: excavations for St Pancras International, the London terminus of High Speed 1, 2002–3, Emery and Pipe said: 'The animal bone consisted of a small, moderately-preserved group of eight bones derived from a walrus of a very large size and robust build. 'The sample includes bones from a lower . fore-limb, a fore-foot, first and second metacarpal, the lower hind . limbs, fibula, calcaneum, astragalus and first cuneiform. These bones . are significantly larger than their reference equivalents held at the . Narual History Museum. 'Microscopic examination revealed that all the St Pancras walrus bones show some degree of surface erosion and butchery marks. Three clear superficial transverse knife cuts were noted.' Mr Emery told MailOnline: 'The way that the walrus bones were found among the skeletal remains suggests they would have been used as a teaching collection from a research institution. These remains are the Pacific walrus' back right leg and ankle. The walrus bones, as well as the human remains discovered in the coffin, all showed signs of being cut up and dissected for medical research including knife cuts . A human skull discovered with the walrus bones, pictured, showed signs of cranial autopsy - drilling into the brain . 'Historical accounts of animal . dissections show that in 1853, Professor Owen from the London Zoological . Society carried out medical research on a walrus.' This could have been the walrus found buried in St Pancras, yet Mr Emery and his team have not been able to categorically confirm this to be the case. He believes the . coffin with the walrus bones dates between 1822 and 1854 because it . was found in a horizontal burial trench. Up until November 1822, burials were carried out on a plot-by-plot basis before the trench method was introduced. Mr Emery added that this was also the . year when the old St Pancras church lost its status and the new St . Pancras church was used in its place - this would have created an . upheaval of bones and burials. Walruses are hunted and killed for . their skin and ivory tusks and the animal found beneath St Pancras . station may have also been brought to the UK for trade. The . remains of the St Pancras walrus are on display at the London . Archaeological Archive and Research Centre in Hackney, East London. All . the human remains have been reburied. Father James Elston is currently seeking funding for repairs to the St Pancras Old Church on the site of the dig. Based on the remains, pictured, the walrus is believed to have been around four metres long. This was quoted by Emery as 'significantly larger than their reference equivalents held at the Natural History Museum.'

"The NSA has the technology to turn your iPhone into an eavesdropping tool, revealed a well-known privacy advocate at a hacker conference in Germany on Monday. Journalist and security expert Jacob Appelbaum used his slot at the event to pull back the curtain on the National Security Agency's arsenal of high-tech spy gear including how it can use radar wave devices to harvest electronic information from computers, even if they aren't online. Appelbaum told hundreds of computer experts gathered at Hamburg's Chaos Communications Conference that his revelations about the NSA's capabilities ‘are even worse than your worst nightmares.’ A backdoor is a hidden remote access from an outside source to the device (stock image pictured) that enables the hacker to have almost full access with little detection . ‘What I am going to show you today is wrist-slittingly depressing,’ he said. Even though in the past six months there have been an unprecedented level of public scrutiny of the NSA and its methods, Appelbaum's claims - supported by what appeared to be internal NSA slideshows - still caused a stir. One of the slides described how the NSA can plant malicious software onto Apple's iPhone, giving American intelligence agents the ability to turn the popular smartphone into a pocket-sized spy. ‘Apple has never worked with the NSA to create a backdoor in any of our products, including iPhone,’ the company said in a statement to AllThingsD. Appelbaum told hundreds of computer experts gathered at Hamburg's Chaos Communications Conference that his revelations about the NSA's capabilities 'are even worse than your worst nightmares' ‘Additionally, we have been unaware of this alleged NSA program targeting our products.’ Another slide showcased a futuristic-sounding device described as a ‘portable continuous wave generator,’ a remote-controlled device which - when paired with tiny electronic implants - can bounce invisible waves of energy off keyboards and monitors to see what is being typed, even if the target device isn't connected to the internet. A third slide showcased a piece of equipment called NIGHTSTAND, which can tamper with wireless internet connections from up to eight miles (13 kilometers) away. An NSA spokeswoman, Vanee Vines, said that she wasn't aware of Appelbaum's presentation, but that in general should would not comment on ‘alleged foreign intelligence activities.’ ‘As we've said before, NSA's focus is on targeting the communications of valid foreign intelligence targets - not on collecting and exploiting a class of communications or services that would sweep up communications that are not of bona fide foreign intelligence interest to the U.S. government.’ The investigation followed earlier reports of the NSA (headquarters pictured) spying on Apple products, which suggested a 'backdoor' in iOS could provide hackers with valuable information. Apple said at the time that it had never worked with the NSA to deliberately weaken its products . The documents included in Appelbaum's presentation were first published by German magazine Der Spiegel on Sunday and revealed details about the undercover work carried out for the NSA by an elite team of hackers known as Tailored Access Operations (TAO). TAO's mission is ‘Getting the ungettable,’ and an unnamed intelligence official had said that TAO had gathered ‘some of the most significant intelligence our country has ever seen.’ When agents with the TAO division want to infiltrate a network or a computer, they turn to their technical experts known as Advanced Network Technology (ANT), which produces tools for penetrating network equipment and monitoring mobile phones and computers. ANT's products have helped TAO agents infiltrate networks and divert or even modify data wherever the NSA's usual methods aren't enough. TAO has a catalog of . high-tech gadgets for hard-to-crack cases, including . computer monitor cables specially modified to record what is being typed . across the screen, USB sticks secretly fitted with radio transmitters . to broadcast stolen data over the airwaves, and fake base stations . intended to intercept mobile phone signals on the go. GSM base stations, for example, make it possible to monitor mobile phones, such as that of German Chancellor Angela Merkel . In the catalog a rigged monitor cable, which allows ‘TAO personnel to see what is displayed on the targeted monitor,’ goes for $30. An ‘active GSM base station’ that makes it possible to mimic the cell phone tower of a target network and thus monitor mobile phones, is available for $40,000. Computer bugging devices disguised as normal USB plugs, capable of sending and receiving data undetected via radio link, are available in packs of 50, for over $1 million. These tools haven't just been used exclusively to track suspected terrorists. GSM base stations, for example, make it possible to monitor mobile phones, such as that belonging to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Radar systems such as the one known as DROPMIRE have also been used to spy on allies, for example EU representatives in Washington. And the hardware 'implants' found in the ANT catalog evidently have been used to tap encrypted faxes. Protestors hold up placards featuring a picture of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and with the world Asylum on it during a march against the spying methods of the US in Hamburg, northern Germany on Sunday . The catalog isn't up to date and many of the software solutions on offer date from 2008. As a result some apply to server systems or mobile phone models that are no longer on the market. A Trojan for gaining total access to iPhones, which was still new at that time, was still in development, though its specifications were still listed in the catalog. One internal NSA document dating from 2004 describes a spyware program called VALIDATOR that it provides 'unique backdoor access to personal computers of targets of national interest, including but not limited to terrorist targets.' The NSA has also targeted products . made by well-known American manufacturers and found ways to break into . professional-grade routers and hardware firewalls, such as those used by . internet and mobile phone operators. ANT offers malware and hardware to take advantages of weaknesses in computers made by some of the world's leading information technology companies, including Cisco Systems, Dell, Juniper, Hewlett-Packard and China's Huawei Technologies . Appelbaum and Der Spiegel have both . played an important role in the disclosures of NSA leaker Edward . Snowden, but neither has clarified whether the most recent set of slides . came from Snowden.

"One of Colonel Gaddafi’s henchmen secretly squirrelled away ‘stolen’ Libyan money by buying a stake in an upmarket British estate agents, it was claimed yesterday. Ali Dabaiba, once a close aide of the toppled tyrant, purchased shares in Chesterton Humberts as revolution engulfed the troubled North African country. Amid the chaos of the Arab Spring, the 68-year-old is accused of shifting some of his family’s vast wealth - thought to run into millions of pounds - into the London property market. Ali Dabaiba, seen at left with his son Osama, ran a Libyan state contracting agency for years but turned against Gadhafi during the revolution that overthrew and killed the ruler. It is claimed he squirrelled away 'stolen' Libyan money by buying a stake in an upmarket British estate agents, it was claimed yesterday . He was described as a ‘co-conspirator’ who invested in the high-class property firm - which has sponsored polo tournaments - in documents sent to the UK’s National Crime Agency, it has been claimed. The Libyan government is trying to claw back billions of pounds wrongly funnelled out of the strife-ridden country by Gaddafi’s former associates as the regime collapsed. The dictator was overthrown and killed in October 2011. Libyan Attorney General Abdulqader Radwan told the Wall Street Journal newspaper, which investigated the wealth transfer, that Mr Dabaiba was among those being investigated on suspicion of embezzlement and abuse of office. A document sent to the UK by investigators working for the Libyans said: ‘The state of Libya believes that the estate agency Chesterton Humberts is part-owned by Ali Ibrahim Dabaiba or his brother or sons.’ In February, General Radwan sent a letter to Scottish authorities asking for help recovering ‘Libyan state assets stolen by Ali Ibrahim Dabaiba and concealed abroad with the help of his family members and others,’ according to the Wall Street Journal. Ali Dabaiba, once a close aide of the toppled tyrant, purchased shares in Chesterton Humberts as revolution engulfed the troubled North African country . After Tony Blair offered the ‘hand of friendship’ to Libya in 2004, the tyrant and his aides looked for investment opportunities overseas, favouring London because of the ease of doing business and tax system. Mr Dadaiba - part of Gaddafi’s inner circle known as ‘Companions of the Leader’ - became involved in Chesterton Humberts through businessman Salah Mussa, whose family fled Libya in 1967 before Gaddafi seized power. In the mid-2000s, Mr Mussa, whose father was communications minister for King Idris, bought two UK property firms for at least £7.2million and merged them to form Chesterton Humberts. After international sanctions were lifted on L ibya in 2008, Mr Mussa - who drove around in a chauffeured black Rolls Royce - looked for business opportunities in his homeland. Meanwhile, Mr Dadaiba was running Libya’s powerful Organization for Development of Administrative Centers, or ODAC, which built and controlled vast infrastructure projects in Libya including airports, conference centres and universities. Auditors who examined the OADC’s books after the regime fell found a string of questionable financial decisions, including kickbacks and loans to Mr Dabaiba’s friends and associates totalling around £24million, it was claimed. Mr Dadaiba - part of Gaddafi's inner circle known as 'Companions of the Leader¿ -became involved in Chesterton Humberts through businessman Salah Mussa, whose family fled Libya in 1967 before Gaddafi seized power . By February 2011, Mr Mussa reached a deal with London representatives of the Dabaiba family to give them a stake in Chesterton Humberts’ holding company Chesterton Global, sources said. It is claimed that at a meeting with a London-based QC working for the Libyan government in a Starbucks coffee shop, former Chesterton Humberts board member Tarek Al-Sayed said he had arranged for a sale of the estate agents’ shares from Mr Mussa to Mr Dabaiba’s family. Chesterton Humberts, which has roots dating back to 1805, helped the Libyan Investment Authority - a sovereign wealth fund set up by Gaddafi to spend the country’s petro-dollars - by 14 Cornhill, a building opposite the Bank of England, in 2008. Mr Dabaiba, who lives in Libya, has not been charged with any crimes. Neither have his family. The National Crime Agency declined to comment. Chesterton Humberts said in a statement: ‘We are aware of the recent article printed by the Wall Street Journal concerning Chesterton Humberts and its links with a prominent Libyan family. ‘We can confirm that we have no existing links or relationships with this family and they are not shareholders of Chesterton Global Ltd, Chesterton Humberts’ holding company. ‘The management and shareholders of Chesterton Humberts are not aware of any UK Government investigation into the ownership of Chesterton Humberts and can confirm that we have not been approached by the Libyan government or any other law-enforcement agency. If contacted, we would of course cooperate fully with their investigations.’ After issuing the statement, Chesterton Humberts did not respond to messages asking to discuss whether Mr Dabaiba had ever held shares in the company.","Ali Dabaiba, former aide of tyrant, purchased shares in Chesterton Humberts .

A 12-year-old girl was sent home from school on a non-uniform day because she had forgotten to pay a £1 donation online the night before. Ternic Aciro arrived at school in Essex where she was told she would either have to spend the entire day in isolation or go home. Brenda Aciro, mother to Ternic, accused the school of bullying her child by putting her at risk of taunts from other children simply because she had forgotten to pay using the cashless online ParentPay system. Sydney Russell School in Dagenham has defended its actions saying the event had been advertised for weeks before and the school's policy on pupils having to work separately or being sent home was clear. Ms Aciro, a nail technician and beauty therapist, said: 'To be told to go into isolation or be sent home because I didn't pay £1 is ridiculous. 'I just completely forgot to pay it. 'It's totally wrong because how can you punish my child in front of her class? 'That is a form of discrimination, of bullying, really.' Most schools hold non-uniform, or mufti, days to raise money for local, national or international charities. But Ms Aciro said the action by the school could put her child at risk of bullying. She added: 'This just gives kids ammunition to bully Ternic and she is really upset. 'They then sent her home without getting directly through to me - my child could have been roaming the streets without me even knowing.'

The heartbeat's beautiful'. 'The brain activity 's good,' she told the Nine Network's A Current Affair, 'in both brains.' The condition, an extreme form of conjoined twins known as craniofacial hyperhidrosis or diprosopus, is so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded. None has survived. Despite the medical unlikelihood of the baby surviving past infancy, the couple has decided to surround her with 'the love' of their large family. The couple, who live on welfare in a public housing block in the Sydney suburb of Tregear, said their strong 'family base'  meant they could protect the child, no matter her deformities. Surrounded by seven children who range in age from teenagers down to the youngest, who is in a high chair, Mr Howie said they had refused to end the pregnancy on 'moral' grounds. 'We thought it was the same as bringing home a child with autism or Down syndrome,' he said, 'I don't really believe in terminating a baby if it's healthy and growing fine.' The Howie family of western Sydney (pictured) plan to embrace the arrival of mother (right) Renee's eighth child, even though the deformities it suffers will make 'schooling, growing up, friends' a challenge . Neighbours of Renee Young and Simon Howie and their seven children who live in this four bedroom public housing property (above) in western Sydney may 'ridicule' the family for keeping their conjoined daughter, but they are determined to protect it with their love . Teenage sisters of the unborn baby, Angel, Jess and Patsy-Anne (above) don't think their mother should have terminated the child who Patsy-Anne said 'might be deformative, but it's still a baby' which they will love . It was early January when the couple made the discovery of their baby's condition during a routine ultrasound which was anything but. During a scheduled appointment, the sonographer told Ms Young 'something was up' and sent her to the couple's GP, who broke the news. The doctor told the couple their baby had 'a conjoinment of the vaults of the skull, which pretty much said there was a conjoined twin,' Mr Howie said. Initially, he was 'shocked, confused, a little bit of everything … I wasn't sure how to take in what he was explaining to me,"" Mr Howie told A Current Affair. Ms Young was too far along in her pregnancy to abort the child. Further tests were made and and a meeting with their obstetrician the couple saw images of their baby's duplication, which occurs only in four per cent of conjoined twins. But the specialist's advice to end the baby's life was met with the couple's firm resolve to 'go through with it'. 'Everything happens for a reason,' Ms Young said. They said they had defied the doctors' urging them not to bring into the world a child that would be regarded as a freak partly because Ms Young had never terminated a pregnancy and because they had a family 'that gives us a lot of support'. 'We've got a really big family, we don't really involve ourselves in the community except for schools where the children are,' Mr Howie said. Maternal foetal specialist Greg Kesby has seen several conjoined twins in his career but none quite like this. Shock and disbelief gave way to acceptance by expectant Renee Young and Simon Howie of Sydney who say 'it will be hard for the community to accept' their next child 'as a normal person' but they felt a moral obligation not to terminate the baby . Renee Young did not know anything was wrong until 15 weeks into her pregnancy when a routine ultrasound (above) showed she was carrying a rare form of conjoined twins called diprosopus, of which only 35 cases have been recorded, and none survived . Conjoining of twins happens between days 13 and 25 of pregnancy when the embryo fails (above) to split into two separate babies and fusion occurs . 'It's probably the rarest of all the conjoined twins, you'd be thinking numbers of one in a million to one in two million for this kind of anomaly,' he said. Dr Kesby said there was a good chance the couple's child would not survive to a live birth but if she did, treatment could prove costly. But the burgeoning family said they would 'cross that bridge as it comes'. 'If we have to go back to work, we will,' said Ms Young who is on a disability pension for her severe rheumatoid arthritis and is looked after by Mr Howie, who draws a carer's pension. The couple's three teenage daughters, Jess, Patsy-Anne and Angel said they did not believe their mother should terminate the pregnancy. 'We'll love it no matter what,' Jess said. 'It might be deformative, but it's still a baby. It's still a human,' said Patsy-Anne. The last known case of diprosopus was the birth of baby girl Lali in 2008 in a remote Indian village. She struggled to feed properly due to her condition and two months to the day she was born, she died. 'If I only get two days with the baby, I only get two days,' Ms Young said. 'That's just the time we actually get to spend with the baby and its brothers and sisters get to meet their little brother or sister.'","Renee and Simon Howie, from Sydney, already have seven children .

"Katie - not her real name - who is pictured, was abused by an older man when she was a teenager and claims social workers knew what was going on . A woman who was abused as a teenager told last night how social workers allowed her to have daily contact with a man ten years older than her who was suspected of grooming dozens of young girls for sex. Katie – not her real name – was one of 54 girls abused by the man she saw as her boyfriend, as well as his friends. She says that despite knowing he had served two stints in jail for violent crime and was part of a circle of men under investigation for sexual exploitation, social workers allowed her to leave her foster home at night to meet him. Katie said she was shocked to hear that, in fact, more than 1,400 girls had been victims of sexual exploitation in Rotherham. Now 29, she is one of 15 girls bringing a civil case against the council and police. She said ‘people at the top’ had covered up what happened to her and the others. Katie added: ‘They knew what he was capable of. They thought he was a pimp and was getting me into drugs. They’re trained to recognise it and they were adults. They’ve got to be stupid not to recognise the signs of abuse. 'I was a child in danger – that should have been recognised. I think it is a massive cover-up. They knew it was happening – there are files showing they knew. 'I think it was all done deliberately. They called me a liar and now all this comes out – it just shows the total lack of respect that council has for victims like me.’ Katie, pictured, had just turned 14 when she met her abuser through friends in 1999. He began contacting her every day and the pair soon started a relationship. Even then the man was 24, married and had already been in prison twice for violent crimes. Katie believes the authorities also suspected that he was part of a small group involved in the grooming and sexual exploitation of more than 40 teenagers in Rotherham. But far from protecting Katie, she says bungling police and social services failed to halt his abuse and actually facilitated it. Her desperate parents did everything they could to stop the relationship with the man, who has never been prosecuted for any sexual abuse against a child. They tried to stop her going out and even cut off the phone lines so he couldn’t call. At one point her parents reported her as missing to the police, knowing she was with him. But instead of arresting him, Katie says police negotiated a deal whereby he handed her over to officers on a petrol forecourt on condition he wouldn’t be arrested. Things took a more sinister turn when, after her 15th birthday, police found her semi-naked, hiding under a bed in a house. Her parents then agreed to have her placed in care in the hope that it would finally break the abuser’s hold over their daughter. But once in social care Katie was allowed to see her ‘boyfriend’ every day, despite the fact that he was increasingly violent and controlling. Large-scale child exploitation in the town has been revealed in a damning report. Pictured: Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council Offices in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Incredibly, Katie says workers at the foster home where she was living sometimes allowed her to go out and see him at night. Katie believed the pair were in ‘a normal relationship’. She began skipping school to see him, and going missing from her home for longer periods. Before she was 16, he had got her pregnant twice. She said: ‘They placed me in care thinking it would keep me away from him but the social workers said I could see him as long as I was home by 10pm and met him at the top of the street. At that time I thought it was a normal boyfriend-girlfriend relationship. ‘My family were on my case, saying he was dangerous and that he was too old for me but I didn’t listen. I was just a typical teenager, I thought my parents wanted to ruin my life.’","Katie - not her real name - abused by a man she thought was her boyfriend .

"More than 20 years ago a Christian farmer had an idea – to create a maze out of trees that would spell the words of Jesus when seen from above. Peter Gunner chose a Bible verse, made a plan, then planted thousands of willows on a seven-acre field with the help of a few volunteers. As they grew he carefully pruned them so their message would be clear. The words, from John 14:6, begin with ‘Jesus’ and read, with strategically-used @ signs: ‘I am the way, the truth and the life.’ Peter Gunner has planted the trees so 'Jesus I am the way the truth and the life' can be seen from above . Sowing the seeds: The father of five planned how he would plant the trees on a computer first . Trees of life: Mr Gunner planted thousands of willows and has been mowing them for decades . The father of five’s dedication went . largely unnoticed – bar a few comments from pilots – until it was . spotted recently on Google maps. Labour of love: The Christian created the design on a computer before marking it out on the ground . Mr Gunner, 63, pictured, who lives . with his wife Faith and their dog Peace near Chiddingly, East Sussex, . said: ‘The idea just came to me one day. 'I am not even sure why I chose that part of the Bible, other than Jesus is saying a lot about himself in that passage. 'In a way the maze is a lot like life, nobody knows what it looks like from above. 'You can wander through life confused when in fact it does make sense from a different perspective.’ He only saw the words from above for . the first time in 2005 when a police officer neighbour gave him a . picture taken from a helicopter. ‘There are a couple of things I would . do differently and some tweaks I would make but overall I am happy with . it,’ Mr Gunner said. He invites friends and people from . the local church to use the maze, and there is a public footpath by the . field so walkers can stumble upon his creation. Mr Gunner added: ‘Every time I see a . plane go over I look at it and say a little prayer. I hope somebody sees . the maze and feels inspired.’ Friends and family use the maze and there is a public path on one side - but only the initiated know its secret .

"A zookeeper was left fighting for his life yesterday after being attacked by a two-ton rhinoceros at one of Britain’s most popular attractions. The man, in his 50s, was gored by the greater one-horned rhino at Whipsnade Zoo, when it suddenly turned on him as he worked in its enclosure. The victim, described as a senior staff member, was left with injuries to his chest, abdomen and pelvis. Scroll down for video . Roaming: Ajang the Rhino, thought to be behind the attack, is pictured in Whipsnade Zoo yesterday . Setting: Whipsnade confirmed that the incident took place in the Asian rhino enclosure, where five one-horned rhinos are kept . It is thought the victim may have been trampled on and gored by the beast’s long bottom teeth, which are commonly used to attack rivals in the wild. Colleagues rushed to his aid and found him ‘immersed in water’ – prompting speculation the animal may have thrown him into a wallowing pool during the attack. Air ambulance paramedics treated him at the scene before taking him to hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery. The man, who has not yet been named, was last night said to be in a ‘stable’ condition. It is believed he was feeding animals inside the Asian rhino enclosure at the zoo, in the Dunstable area of Bedfordshire, when the rhino - believed to be named Ajang - suddenly turned on him. The incident happened just before 8.20am yesterday. The man was taken by ambulance to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in a serious but stable condition. Centre: Whipsnade features a £1million Rhinos of Nepal exhibit with indoor heated pools so that the greater one-horned rhinoceros can wallow in muddy water all year round . Incident: Whipsnade Zoo in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, confirmed that the injured man was one of its keepers . Sally Anderson, 36, who was visiting the zoo yesterday with her two-year-old son Noah, said: ‘It is so shocking. You just never think things like that are going to happen. ‘We were in the rhino enclosure [yesterday] as they are Noah's favourite and they all looked perfectly friendly. It just reminds you what they are capable of - they are wild animals.’ Ajang, a Nepalese grey male rhino, was born in 2010 weighing 13st. The name means ‘enormous’ in Nepalese and the rhino shares the enclosure with three others, including his mother, Behan. The zoo was open as normal yesterday, although a zookeeper admitted it had been a ‘nightmare’ day because the rhino enclosure had been so full. David Field, director at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), which runs the zoo, told reporters that the keeper was now out of surgery and in a stable condition. He said: ‘At approximately 8.15 [yesterday] morning one of our senior keepers was found injured within the Asian rhino enclosure. Procedures were immediately put into place to secure the scene and the emergency services were called. ‘The keeper was treated at the scene by paramedics and was then later taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge for further treatment. An investigation is under way to find out what happened but at this stage there are no further details. ‘I'm pleased to report that he is now out of surgery and doctors have described his condition as stable. ZSL staff and more importantly his family are with him at this time and he is being very well cared for.’ Helping hand: A keeper herding a rhino inside to the Rhinos of Nepal enclosure at the zoo in Bedfordshire . Location: The man, who is in his 50s, was stabilised at the scene at Whipsnade Zoo (pictured) in Bedfordshire . Dave Tamarro, of the East of England Ambulance Service, said: ‘When we arrived it was clear that the patient had received a number of injuries, including injuries to the chest, abdomen and pelvis.' He added: ‘We stabilised the patient whilst the air ambulance was on its way. 'Both trust staff and the Magpas air ambulance crew worked well together to treat the patient, who was then taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital by land ambulance in a serious condition.’ A Magpas air ambulance spokeswoman said the man had been given ‘enhanced pain relief’ at the scene. She said: ‘He was helped out of the water by staff at the zoo. ‘The Magpas team assessed the patient, who suffered serious injuries, and put measures into place to keep him warm as his body temperature had dropped considerably.’ A Bedfordshire Police spokesman said: ‘We were called to Whipsnade Zoo at around 8.25am. Our role was to assist the other emergency services.’ Whipsnade features a £1million Rhinos of Nepal exhibit with indoor heated pools so that the greater one-horned rhinoceros can wallow in muddy water all year round, according to the zoo's website. Opened in 2008, it also has a specially-designed watch tower, modelled on those used by conservationists to spot rhino in the field. A spokesman for Whipsnade confirmed that the incident took place in the Asian rhino enclosure, where five one-horned rhinos are kept. Public attraction: Whipsnade Zoo is located in Bedfordshire, near Luton, Aylesbury and Milton Keynes . Greater one-horned rhinos, also known as Indian rhinos, are described as ‘armour-plated’ giants and are the world's fifth largest land animal. They can be dangerous to humans when startled. Males weigh around 4,600lb (2,100 kg) and females around 3,500lb (1,600 kg). Listed as a vulnerable species, they are mainly found in India's north-eastern state of Assam and the Terai area of Nepal, where they live in the foothills of the Himalayas. Attack: The rhino (file picture at Whipsnade Zoo) left the man with 'injuries to the chest, abdomen and pelvis' There are 2,500 one-horned rhinos left in the wild - an increase from as few as 200 at the beginning of the 20th century. They are good swimmers which spend up to 60 per cent of their day in water and were used by India's Moghul emperors in staged fights with elephants, which they would often win. Poachers kill them for their horns to sell for use in traditional medicines and they are also threatened by grassland destruction, encroaching settlements and farmland in their habitat.","Zoo keeper in his 50s suffered injuries to chest, abdomen and pelvis at zoo .

"Tragic: Father-of-one Justin Feber was drinking a cup of tea when the lightning struck . A father-of-one has been killed after being hit by a bolt of lightning while drinking a cup of tea in a 'freak' one in ten million accident. Bricklayer Justin Feber's distraught colleagues saw a huge flash and a heard an ear-splitting bang, saying a storm seemed to just appear above them near Crewe, Cheshire. The 41-year-old, from Haslingden, Lancashire, was not touching anything metallic and was standing with both feet on the ground when he was hit on Wednesday. As well as his parents Jack and Carol, Mr Feber leaves two brothers, Jason and James, and his six-year-old daughter Libby. Health and safety experts said today five people on average are killed by lightning each year in the UK - making this tragic fatal strike incredibly rare. Colleagues of Mr Feber, known as 'Feebs' to his friends, who were sub-contractors at the site by Chorley based Matthews and Leigh Civil Engineering Ltd, rushed to his aid. But despite further medical attention from paramedics he died a short time later at Leighton Hospital in Crewe. A second man was also taken there suffering shock. Boss Andy Leigh said: 'All staff at Matthews and Leigh have been profoundly upset and shocked by this tragic event and we send our sincere condolences to Justin's family and friends. Efforts: He was taken to Leighton Hospital in Crewe, pictured, but they were unable to save him . 'Justin was well liked, highly professional and held in high regard by all those who worked with him. Our thoughts are with all who knew him at this very sad time.' The Health and Safety Executive, the body responsible for employee safety in the work place said they had been made aware of the incident and that they would not be launching an investigation. A HSE spokesman said: 'This incident is not something the Health and Safety Executive would normally investigate because it was the result of a freak natural occurrence.' A spokesman from Bovis Homes, who run the site, added: 'Everyone at Bovis Homes is deeply saddened by this tragic incident and we extend our sincere sympathies to this man's family and friends. 'Our thoughts are with them and with his colleagues who were with him on site and responded immediately to the incident. They have obviously been deeply affected by this and we will look to support them in any way we can.' Jason Mahrous, neighbour and friend of Mr Feber said: 'Justin was my next door neighbour. 'All I can say is that he was a great man who loved life and loved his daughter Libby very much.' Friend Karen King said: 'Justin was a great person who lived life to the full. He was also a great dad, who loved his daughter. 'I was only dancing with him a month or so a go at a 50th birthday party. 'He was a really popular guy who had loads of friends.' A spokesman from Cheshire Police said: 'At 1.28pm on Wednesday emergency services were called following the report of a man being struck by lightning. 'A 41-year-old man who had been working on a building site was treated by paramedics at the scene. 'Sadly, he died a short time later at Leighton Hospital. A second man suffering from shock was also taken to Leighton. 'Police attended the scene and confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances.' The Cheshire Coroner is expected to open an inquest on Monday.",Colleagues said father-of-one Justin Feber was not touching anything metal when he was hit .

"British aid money given to the Palestinian Authority allows it to make payments to convicted terrorists, it was claimed last night. Taxpayers’ money has been used by the Department for International Development (DfID) to pay out around £80million a year to the Palestinian Authority. The authority, in turn, spends money on convicted terrorists locked up in Israeli prisons. Claims: British aid money given to the Palestinian Authority allows it to make payments to convicted terrorists, it was claimed last night. An Israeli group says some prisoners receive around £2,075 a month (file image) An Israeli group claims the longest serving prisoners receive around £2,075 a month, plus bonuses for their wives and children. Further payments of tens of thousands of pounds can be made when Palestinian prisoners are released from jail. It is claimed up to 5,000 convicts could be in receipt of salaries and bonuses. The suggestion is not that British aid money is directly going to terrorists’ pockets, but that it supports the Palestinian Authority more generally. Speaking out: Sir Gerald Howarth (left) has called for Britain to suspend all aid to the Authority until payments to terrorists cease. Questions about British aid were raised during David Cameron's (right) recent visit to Israel . Tory MP Sir Gerald Howarth has called for Britain to suspend all aid to the Authority until payments to terrorists cease. ‘The Palestinian Authority is putting two fingers up to the British taxpayer,’ he said. ‘It is not the job of the hardworking British taxpayer to fund payments to terrorists.’ But a spokesman for DfID said: ‘UK taxpayer funds do not pay for Palestinian prisoners. The . leader of the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank has branded the . Holocaust ‘the most heinous crime against humanity’ in  modern times. But . Mahmoud Abbas’s comment led Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu to urge . him to end his reconciliation with rival Palestinian group, Hamas. Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, is committed to the destruction of Israel. The group is viewed by the United States, the European Union and Israel as a terrorist organisation. Speaking . on TV show Face the Nation, Mr Netanyahu said: ‘President Abbas, tear . up your pact with Hamas. Recognise the Jewish state. Make peace. I hope . you do that. You can’t have Hamas and peace with Israel.’ British funding to the Palestinian Authority is used for the sole purpose of paying the salaries of civil servants, who are responsible for providing health, education and other essential services, including security. The process is subject to independent audit.’ Questions about British aid money were raised with British diplomats during David Cameron’s recent visit to Israel. Other countries, such as Canada, refuse to make payments to the Palestinian Authority, instead directly funding projects run by aid organisations. The claims were made by the Israeli group Palestinian Media Watch (PMW) which examines statements by the Palestinian Authority from newspapers. The salaries are reserved for those ‘resisting the occupation’ of lands the Palestinians regard as rightly theirs but which are part of the Israeli state. PMW said grants on release can be as much as £50,000. That compares to an average Palestinian wage of about £300 a month. Last year, the Palestinian Authority paid more than £60million to convicted terrorists, of which some £9million was paid as a lump sum when prisoners were released. This release pot is to be increased to £27million. In the four years to 2015 Britain will donate some £343million to the Palestinian Authority, whose £2.5billion budget is 40 per cent international aid. Among those in receipt of money are thought to include Abdullah Barghouti, who is serving multiple life sentences for attacks that killed 67 Israelis in 2001 and 2002, including at least seven children.","Taxpayers' cash used to pay £80million a year to Palestinian Authority .

"A mystery woman found in Ireland dazed and unable to communicate, who was later identified as an Australian with around 40 aliases, is on her way home. Samantha Azzopardi, 25, described as vulnerable, had been in hospital in Dublin since concerns were raised that was she an Eastern European teenager who had been trafficked into the country. But Irish police confirmed tonight that she was on her way back to Australia. A spokesman for the force said this evening: 'In consultation with all of the relevant authorities, An Garda Siochana have facilitated Ms Samantha Azzopardi repatriation with a view to reuniting her with her family and the authorities in Australia.' Identified: Irish police initially feared the . girl was a victim of human trafficking but she is in fact a 25-year-old . Australian woman who has apparent health problems . Earlier today it was announced that Irish police were considering charging Miss Azzopardi with wasting their time after it emerged the worldwide appeal for her identity cost has cost them £200,000. Initially it was feared that she was a teenage victim of human traffickers but since her identity was revealed a more complex picture has emerged about her background. Azzopardi, who it is believed had around 40 aliases, has been in the care of health authorities in Dublin as a psychiatric patient for last few days. But today, the High Court in Dublin heard . psychiatrist Brendan Kelly found she is not suffering from a disorder . classed under the Mental Health Act in Ireland. 'She has a particular condition,' said Tim O'Leary, a lawyer for the Health Service Executive. 'That condition is specified and makes her vulnerable.' Mr . O'Leary said the woman is happy to stay where she is but supports are . in place in adult psychiatric departments, including outside community . placements. The court was told yesterday that Azzopardi may be at risk if she is released from care. Azzopardi had been in Ireland visiting a relative before going missing and being . found on Dublin's O'Connell Street - the Irish capital's main shopping . thoroughfare - in a distressed state on October 10. Currently the huge police investigation into her case has involved 2,000 man hours and 115 separate lines of inquiry, cost Ireland an estimated £200,000. Azzopardi was known to 'easily assume' the persona of an adolescent teenager, so was able to fool police into believing she was just 14 or 15 years old, the Irish Independent reported. Irish police spent £200,000 on a world wide appeal for her identity . It was also claimed that Azzopardi was . convicted in the Brisbane Magistrates Court in 2010 on two charges of . making false representations, one charge of possession of a thing with . intent to forge documents and one charge of contravening directions. She was fined $500, to be paid if she reoffended in the following 12 months. Azzopardi . was convicted the following month of four separate charges relating to . false representations and given the same penalty. It . is understood she was last year convicted interstate for defrauding or . deceiving to obtain welfare payments and sentenced to six months . imprisonment, suspended for 12 months. And in . June last year she pleaded guilty in Perth Magistrates Court to three . counts of opening an account with a cash dealer in a false name, one . count of inducing a person to act and three counts of intent to defraud . by deceit. She was sentenced . on October 2 last year to six months imprisonment, suspended for 12 . months. The revelations come as a complex picture emerges of her. But despite such a track record a . former boss described her as 'a lovely girl who had issues.' Chris . Nunes, the manager of a restaurant in southwest Sydney said she . recognised Samantha Azzopardi's face on the television when Irish police . released pictures of the 25-year-old as part of a global search to . identify her. Ms Nunes said she messaged her sister to say 'Oh my God, it's Sammy'. 'She used to work here for us. I saw (the photo of her) last night and then this morning I heard them say her name and I was like 'oh my god it is her',' Ms Nunes said. Ms Azzopardi, who had relatives living in Sydney, was hired to work in the restaurant two years ago. She worked there for four or five months. 'I knew that she had some issues, that's why we let her go. She was a lovely girl. There was nothing I could say that she was a horrible person or anything, that's why I gave her the opportunity. 'When she left here she said she was going to travel overseas.' Mystery: The girl, named Samantha, was found on O'Connell Street in Dublin (above) on October 10 . Azzopardi's parents have been named as Bruce Azzopardi and Joanne Marie Campbell and she was said to have a brother named Gregory. When her photograph was released . worldwide this week, she was recognised by Joe Brennan who once was in a . relationship with her mother and was living in Clonmel, Tipperary. Mr Brennan contacted police and Azzopardi’s identity was quickly verified with Australian authorities, who stunned Irish police with details of her past. A source close to the investigation told the Irish Independent that she had been 'fretful of any engagement with officialdom' after she was found, adding: 'There is no doubt she has been the victim of some traumatic event of some sort.' Another source told the paper: 'She is very disturbed. 'It would appear there is something very serious going on here.' The investigation was hindered by her apparent refusal to speak to police and the HSE - her only form of communication being to write short notes in English. She also drew pictures of being brought to Ireland on a plane and of her lying on a bed with men, leading police to believe she was forced into prostitution.","Samantha Azzopardi, 25, is being flown home so she can be reunited with her family .

"Suspected Islamist militants have killed at least 15 people in an overnight raid on a Kenyan coastal area. The attack comes just 24 hours after a separate raid in a nearby town left 53 dead. The bodies of 15 people were discovered among the remains of torched houses in Majembeni and neighbouring Poromoko, which are on the Kenyan coast between Mombasa and the Somali border. Scroll down for video . Brutal: Kenyan residents at the scene of one of the bodies of those killed in nearby Mpeketoni on Sunday. Police believe the Poromoko attack was carried out by the same group of Islamist militants . Al-Shabaab militants . claimed responsibility for the overnight attack on their radio station . Andalus, but said they had in fact murdered 20 people. This afternoon, the BBC had been told that 12 women were abducted.This was later proved not to be the case. But . in a surprising turn of events, Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta later . said that despite al-Shabaab's claims, 'domestic political leaders' were . behind the massacres, not Islamic extremists. Captured: Boko Haram released this image of around 270 girls who were taken in April . Majembeni - the area in which the 15 bodies were discovered - is close to the village of Mpeketoni, where 53 people were brutally killed in a raid on Sunday while they watched the World Cup. Local residents said militants also entered a third village, Mapenya, overnight, burning several homes to the ground, according to Kenya's Standard Digital. One witness said armed men went door to door hours before dawn in Majembeni and the neighbouring Poromoko village, ordered people outside and made them recite the Islamic creed. He said he did not see what happened to those that failed the test, but assumed they had been beaten or killed. Police are continuing to search Majembeni and Poromoko for bodies and the death toll is expected to rise over the coming hours. However, in a nationally televised address this afternoon, Kenya's president dismissed widely held belief that Islamist militants were behind the attacks, instead blaming 'domestic political leaders'. His surprising allegations come despite witness testimonies to the contrary, and analysis by terror experts who say the method of killing is very much in the al-Shabaab style. Mr Kenyatta blamed the attacks instead on ethnically-motivated violence inspired by local political leaders who are preaching the idea that some Kenyans are 'less human' than others. Grim task: Family members wait to collect bodies of their relatives at Mpeketoni hospital in Lamu county  following Sunday night's massacre . The back-to-back attacks underscore the weak security around the Lamu area, which lies just south of the Somalia border. Lamu . once attracted swarms of foreign visitors - including a large number of . Britons - but its tourist sector has been suffering in recent years . because of increasing violence. These recent suspected al-Shabaab attacks now threaten to shut that industry down altogether. 'These attacks are unfortunate and . the perpetrators must be held accountable,' Interior Minister Joseph Ole . Lenku this morning told residents in Mpeketoni, where he was jeered by locals. 'This government is full of talk and no action,' said one angry resident, speaking as the minister arrived in the town. 'They keep saying the country is safe, and we keep on suffering in the hands of terrorists.' Cowardly: At least 48 people were killed in the Sunday night raid and two hotels were set on fire before the gunmen fled into surrounding undergrowth . Kenya's president has blamed domestic political leaders for the deadly coastal attacks. In a nationally televised address, Uhuru Kenyatta said that despite claims of responsibility from al-Shabaab, the Islamic extremists were not behind the massacres. Terror experts have also said the method of killing is in the al-Shabaab style, with gunshots to the head or victims having their throats cut. But in a surprising turn of events, Mr Kenyatta said outright that al-Shabaab did not plan and execute what he termed ethnically motivated violence, but rather local political leaders. He said police officials in Mpeketoni had advance intelligence about the attack there on Sunday evening but failed to act on it. He added that some officers have been suspended and will be prosecuted. Mr Kenyatta also said some political leaders are preaching the idea that some Kenyans are less human than others. 'My deputy and I will never go the route of ethnic violence,' he went on to say. Al Shabaab's military operations spokesman, Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, today claimed the group's gunmen killed as many as 20 people in the Majembeni assault, including policemen. 'Our operations in Kenya will continue,' he said. Omar Awadh Salim, a 48-year-old father of two, said masked men in military fatigues broke into his house and other properties in Poromoko just after 1 a.m. this morning. 'They ordered all of us to get out of the house, and then asked us to recite 'shahada'. We all did and they let us back into the house and proceeded to the next,' he told Reuters. Ole Lenku has defended his government's security efforts. But many Kenyans have publicly called for him and other top officials to be fired for security shortcomings including failings during the four-day Westgate siege, where some soldiers involved were found to have looted the mall after 67 people were killed. The Sunday night attack took place in the coastal village of Mpeketoni - 30-miles southwest of Lamu - and left 53 people dead. Witnesses told how about 30 gunmen arrived in the town in minibuses at 8pm yesterday before bursting into residents homes, shooting dead any man they thought was not Muslim. 'They came to our house at around 8pm and asked us in Swahili whether we were Muslims,' said Anne Gathigi. 'My husband told them we were Christians and they shot him in the head and chest.' The assault in Mpeketoni began on Sunday night as residents watched World Cup matches on TV and lasted until early on Monday morning, with little resistance put up by Kenya's security forces.","Suspected Islamist gunmen killed 15 people in Majembeni overnight .

"A grieving daughter has lodged a complaint against a hospital which left her father to die on a 'barbaric' end of life pathway for eight days without her permission. Susan Phillips said her 69-year-old father Robert Goold was left to slowly deteriorate for more than a week on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway. The pensioner, who had dementia, got weaker and weaker as doctors took food, water and oxygen away from him but survived longer than they expected. Robert Goold hours before the fall which led to a fatal hospital stay (left) and (right) on the Liverpool Care Pathway at Addenbrooke's with, it is claimed, no food, water or oxygen . Mrs Phillips  claims that after six days on the pathway a nurse at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, even offered to reverse the programme but it was too late. Mr Goold died the following day at 5.40am, on February 25, without being able to say goodbye to his wife of 51 years because she was too traumatised. Mrs Phillips, 50, claims doctors and nurses could not explain to her why her father had been put on the LCP because nothing had been recorded in his notes. Addenbrooke's said they will investigate the family's claims after an inquest has been held. Devastated Mrs Phillips, who is a nurse, said: 'My dad was so stressed that we were led to believe death was imminent and so we just tried to calm him down. 'You wouldn't treat a dog the way my poor dad was treated. We are all devastated, the best interests of the patient was not starving him to death. Mrs Phillips claims that after six days on the pathway a nurse at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, (pictured) even offered to reverse the programme but it was too late . Robert Goold was in Addenbrooke's for two weeks before he was put on the LCP on February 17 . 'My mum didn't even get to say good, bye to her husband of 51 years because she was too traumatised.' Mr Goold, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, was taken in to Lister Hospital in Stevenage after a fell and was left with a fractured neck, back, skull and cheekbone. The pensioner then suffered a bleed on the brain and was transferred to the neurosciences critical care unit Addenbrooke's Hospital on February 4. He was in Addenbrooke's for two weeks before he was put on the LCP on February 17. His family were told his prognosis was not good and medics wanted to remove his ventilator to see how he responded. In December it was revealed up to 60,000 patients die on the . Liverpool Care Pathway each year without giving their consent. A third of families are also kept in the dark when doctors withdraw lifesaving treatment from loved ones. The pathway involves withdrawal of lifesaving treatment, with the sick sedated and usually denied nutrition and fluids. Death typically takes place within 29 hours. The 60,000 figure comes from a joint study by the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute in Liverpool and the Royal College of Physicians. It found many patients were not consulted despite being conscious when doctors decided on their care. Records . from 178 hospitals also show that thousands of people on the pathway . are left to die in pain because nurses do not do enough to keep them . comfortable while drugs are administered. An estimated 130,000 patients are put on the pathway each year. Concerns have been raised that clinical judgments are being skewed by incentives for hospitals to use the pathway. Health trusts are thought to have been rewarded with an extra £30million for putting more patients on the LCP. Critics say it is a self-fulfilling prophecy because there is no scientific method of predicting when death will come. Norman Lamb, the care services minister, launched a review in November, saying there had been too many cases of families not being consulted. Mrs Phillips said the family believed removing his ventilation would give her father the 'best chance” of survival. But a day later she went to the hospital to find her father flailing about trying to breathe with 'sheer terror in his eyes' and then discovered he had been placed on LCP. Addenbrooke's Chief Executive Keith McNeil said: 'In this case the fact that an issue has been raised will trigger for us a review of the care a patient has had and we will go through each of the issues that have been raised by the family. 'We will see whether in fact appropriate decisions were made, we will also look at whether the communication of the care to the family was appropriate.' The LCP, designed by the Royal Liverpool University Hospital's Marie Curie Hospice, aims to reduce suffering in the last hours and days of a dying person's life. Doctors can withdraw fluids and drugs from patients or be put on continuous sedation if they are deemed close to death. But the plan has been criticised by some experts and presented as a cost-cutting way to bring about the premature deaths of elderly patients. In January parliament was told that a national audit found that one in six of the people placed on the pathway each year have either a primary or secondary diagnosis of Alzheimer's, or another form of dementia. Dr Philip Howard, a consultant gastroenterologist, raised concerns about these patients being put on the LCP as they could not have been meaningfully consulted on whether life-saving treatment should be withdrawn. The inquest into Mr Goold's death was opened and adjourned by Cambridgeshire coroner David Scott Morris.","Susan Phillips said father Robert Goold, 69, was left to slowly deteriorate .

"Thailand's crown prince has revoked the royally-assigned family name of his wife, following the arrest of several of her relatives  in a high profile corruption case. Crown prince Maha Vajiralongkorn is understood to have issued the directive after three people with the royal-appointed surname Akharaphongpreecha were among a group arrested in a crackdown on alleged police corruption. The office of Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, 62, issued a statement on Friday ordering the Interior Ministry to strip the family of Princess Srirasmi, 42, of the royal-appointed surname. Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn issued a directive for his wife and her relatives to be stripped of their royally appointed surname Akharaphongpreecha after her relatives were arrested in a corruption case . Families can be given an honorary name by the Thai monarchy in return for their loyal service. The name was appointed to Princess Srirasmi after the couple married in 2001. The couple have a nine-year-old son. 'Individuals using the royal-appointed last name must change back to their old family name,' the office said in the statement. The investigation has led to a lot of interest in the Thai royal family. However news about the monarchy is heavily filtered by the palace. Under the lese-majeste laws, the world's harshest, anything deemed an insult or a threat to the monarchy is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. A total of 19 people were arrested in the crackdown on corruption, which led to raids that seized tens of millions of dollars in assets. Among those arrested was Police Lieutenant General Pongpat Chayaphan, a former head of Thailand's Central Investigation Bureau. Pongpat and several others were also charged for allegedly citing the monarchy for personal benefit. Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn and Crown Princess Srirasmi of Thailand married in 2001 and have a son . Thailand has increasingly applied its lese-majeste laws since a military coup in May, although it is rare for high-ranking officials to fall afoul of them. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the former army chief who led the coup and was appointed prime minister in August, is a self-proclaimed royalist and has vowed to root out critics of the monarchy. Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn is the first in line to the throne. His father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who is widely revered by Thais, is 86.","Crown prince Maha Vajiralongkorn issued directive to strip wife's surname .

"A former regional Communist Party official implicated in a sex scandal that has transfixed China was sentenced today to 13 years in jail for taking more than 3.1 million yuan ($500,000) in bribes. Lei Zhengfu, a portly, pop-eyed ex-secretary of a region in southwestern China's Chongqing, was caught on video having sex with an 18-year-old mistress, with the clip ricocheting around China's gossip-obsessed Internet when it surfaced last November. The encounter turned out to be a sting operation by a property developer hoping to blackmail Lei, 55, into favorable commercial decisions, Chinese media reported. Shamed: Lei Zhengfu, a former regional Communist Party official, at a court in Chongqing municipality where he was sentenced to 13 years in prison for  taking more than $500,000 in bribes from a property developer . When blackmailed with the sex video, . Lei asked another property developer who had benefited from his . patronage to pay hush money of 3.1million yuan. Lei was fired, then charged last month with corruption, which carries a maximum penalty of death. Lei argued that the money was a loan, but prosecutors said the money - which was not fully repaid - amounted to a bribe. His punishment also includes confiscation of personal assets of 300,000 yuan ($48,000). Lei did not say whether he would appeal the verdict by the city's No. 1 Intermediate Court, according to state media. Stung: A screenshot from the video showing Lei having sex with his mistress which went viral online . Caught out: When blackmailed with the sex video, Lei asked another property developer who had benefited from his patronage to pay hush money of 3.1million yuan ($500,000) Lei's case has riveted the public since video clips went viral of the portly, pop-eyed 55-year-old having sex with an 18-year-old mistress hired by property developers, allegedly in an elaborate extortion scheme. As more lurid details emerged, the scandal has exposed the shady intertwining of sex, money and power. The sex extortion scheme has ensnared at least 20 other party cadres, but Lei appears to have been singled out - partly because he has been especially vulnerable to public derision. Lei's receding hairline, pop eyes, bushy eyebrows and wide jowls provided a caricature for public corruption and moral degradation widely detested by the public. Honeytrap: Prostitute-turned-nurse Zhao Hongxia (pictured) secretly filmed herself having sex with Lei after being hired by a property developer to blackmail him. She was given a two-year suspended jail term . Beijing Institute of Technology law professor Xu Xin said the sentence was more severe than those in earlier corruption cases involving similar amounts of bribes. 'Maybe because of the case's social impact, the court has chosen to be on the harsh end with its sentence,' he said. Prosecutors also said Lei took two other bribes - one of $10,000 and another of 100,000 yuan ($16,000) - in return for favors granted through his government position. But it is Lei's sex scandal and the scheme behind it that have captivated member of the Chinese public, who are disgusted by what they see as the moral degradation of those in power. In a separate case, a district court on Friday afternoon sentenced Xiao Ye, the man convicted of masterminding the extortion scheme, to 10 years in prison. The woman in the sex tape, Zhao Hongxia, was given a two-year sentence that was suspended for two years and could eventually be reduced. The official People's Court Daily said Xiao plans to make an appeal but Zhao does not.","Video of Lei Zhengfu, 55, having sex with 18-year-old went viral on internet .

"Dirty stethoscopes may be helping to spread dangerous bugs around GP surgeries and hospital wards, a study suggests. One of the instruments was found to be more contaminated with bacteria than the palm of a doctor's hand after being used to examine 71 patients. Among the microbes spreading from patients was the potentially deadly superbug MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Dirty stethoscopes may help to spread bugs around GP surgeries and hospital wards, a new study suggests . Dr Didier Pittet, from the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre on Patient Safety at University of Geneva Hospitals in Switzerland, said: 'By considering that stethoscopes are used repeatedly over the course of a day, come directly into contact with patients' skin, and may harbour several thousands of bacteria (including MRSA) collected during a previous physical examination, we consider them as potentially significant vectors of transmission. 'From infection control and patient safety perspectives, the stethoscope should be regarded as an extension of the physician's hands and be disinfected after every patient contact.' Dr Pittet's team conducted a study in which 71 patients were examined by one of three doctors using sterile gloves and a stethoscope. After each examination, the tube and diaphragm of the stethoscope and four regions of the physician's hands were checked for bacteria. The stethoscope's diaphragm, the part of the instrument that is pressed onto a patient's skin, was more heavily contaminated than all regions of the hand except the fingertips. In addition the stethoscope tube was covered in more bugs than the back of the doctor's hand. One of the bugs found on stethoscopes is the potentially deadly superbug MRSA (pictured) The study, published in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings, is the first to make a direct comparison of bacterial contamination of hands and stethoscopes. However, if a report published last month is to be believed, doctors will soon be hanging up their stethoscopes for good. A medical mainstay since 1816, they are being elbowed out of the way by new technologies such as ultrasound which has only been about since the 1950s. Mobile devices are becoming increasingly popular, accurate, smaller to the point of being handheld and cheaper to make. However, Professor Jagat Narula, editor of the journal Global Heart, said: 'At the time of this writing several manufacturers offer handheld ultrasound machines slightly larger than a deck of cards, with technology and screens modelled after modern smartphones.'","Among the microbes found on stethoscopes is the superbug MRSA .

"With gruesome beheadings, mosques being blown up and bloodied corpses strewn across the dusty ground, it has all the hallmarks of the latest Islamic State recruitment video. But this shocking footage has been compiled by the U.S. State Department in a propaganda drive of its own to discourage would-be jihadists from joining the terror group. Its emergence comes as President Barack Obama prepares for a critical speech on Wednesday in which he intends to begin laying out his strategy for defeating the Muslim extremists.

Gruesome: The video compiles shocking images used in the Islamic State's own propaganda footage in recent weeks, including this one of prisoners being killed and crucified . Hard-hitting: The video, which has been viewed more than 500,000 times, was posted on YouTube as part of a campaign called 'Think Again, Turn Away' to dissuade U.S. citizens who may be thinking about joining ISIS . It starts with the phrase: 'Run. Do not walk to ISIS land' before showing a body being thrown off a cliff. Then, using macabre clips posted by IS in its own videos, it proceeds to show executions, crucifixions and suicide bombings - skills it says sympathizers can learn if they join the group. Many of the images are far too graphic to show. It ends with the sarcastic sign off: 'Travel is inexpensive because you won't need a return ticket!' followed by more images of blood-covered bodies slumped on the ground. Shocking: The video also contains security footage of a suicide bomber (top left) blowing up a mosque . The campaign, directed at Muslims in the United States, aims to counter the Islamic State's powerful social media machine which has been used to recruit fighters from across the world . Mocking tone: The video lists so-called 'useful skills' like blowing up mosques which ISIS sympathisers can learn if they join the group . The campaign, directed at Muslims in the United States, aims to counter the Islamic State's powerful social media machine which has been used to recruit fighters from across the world with messages and videos on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Alberto Fernandez, co-ordinator of the State Department's Center for Strategic Counter-terrorism Communications, which runs the program, has called it ‘participating in the marketplace of ideas', according to CNN. The State Department has also set up a series of anti-ISIS accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr as part of a larger social media campaign against the group’s extremism. 'Our mission is to expose the facts about terrorists and their propaganda', the State Department said on the campaign's Facebook page. As . concerns grow over the allure of ISIS to some young men, it’s hoped that . the video will steer them away from travelling overseas. At present, more than 100 U.S. citizens have travelled overseas to join the jihadist group. The video ends with the sarcastic sign off: 'Travel is inexpensive because you won't need a return ticket!' In an escalation of the offensive against IS, President Obama is expected to lay his strategy when he meets with congressional leaders from both parties at the White House tomorrow. He will then deliver a speech on Wednesday on the eve of the 13th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. Lawmakers said in advance that they would like the president to give specifics. The president should target command and control centers and oil refineries controlled by insurgents within Syria, suggested Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who sits on both the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees. Rubio, claiming that Obama has committed 'presidential malpractice in his foreign policy,' said he is eager to hear directly what Obama 'should have said months, weeks ago.' 'First, clearly explain to the American people what our national security interests are in the region' and spell out the risk that Islamic State militants pose 'for us, short-term and long-term, and why they matter,' Rubio told CBS' 'Face the Nation.' 'Clearly, he's put together a coalition of the willing - we have heard that before - to tackle this problem,' said House Intelligence Republican Committee Chairman Mike Rogers told CNN. 'That's good.' Sickening: The US State Department video is intended to shock would-be jihadists from wanting to join IS . The State Department has also set up a series of anti-ISIS accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr as part of a larger social media campaign against the group's extremism . Speaking Monday on MSNBC, Rogers said, 'I think in Congress we need to expose all members to the level of threat that those of us on the national security committees see every day.' He said Washington political leaders should not give the Islamic militants the 'time and space' to grow into a more formidable force, which he said happened with the al-Qaida terrorist network. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on the same CNN program that Obama needs to spell out both the diplomatic and military components of his strategy. 'Time's a-wasting, because we have now said that we're going to go on the offensive. And it's time for America to project power and strength,' Feinstein said. Obama sparked criticism, most of it from Republicans, for his remark last week that 'we don't have a strategy yet' for confronting Islamic extremists gaining both land and followers in the Middle East. His upcoming sessions with lawmakers and the speech to the nation are clearly an attempt to try to show he now has an evolving strategy in place. Summit: . US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel (left) with President Barack Obama and . UK Prime Minister David Cameron at the NATO summit in Wales last week . 'The next phase is now to start going on some offense,' Obama said in an interview with NBC's 'Meet the Press.' 'But . this is not going to be an announcement about U.S. ground troops,' he . added in the session taped Saturday and broadcast Sunday. The operations will be 'similar to the kinds of counterterrorism campaigns' the U.S. has waged in the past, Obama said. 'In Syria, the boots on the ground have to be Syrian.' At the recent NATO summit in Wales, the U.S. and nine allies agreed to take on the militants because of the threat they pose to member countries. In addition to laying claim to territory, the militants have targeted religious and ethnic minority groups and threatened U.S. personnel and interests in the region. At Obama's direction, the U.S. military has conducted more than 130 airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq in the past month. In retaliation, the group recently beheaded two American journalists it had been holding hostage in Syria, where the organisation also operates. But the president has repeated his opposition to sending in U.S. ground troops to engage in direct combat with the militants, who have laid claim to large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. Lawmakers have pressed Obama, so far unsuccessfully, to expand the airstrikes further.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A former federal prosecutor has been forced to resign as chair of an investigation into rape allegations at the University of Virginia after it emerged he was a member of the accused fraternity. Mark Filip was appointed on Thursday night to compile a report on sexual misconduct at the school after a student claimed she was raped by seven men during a party at the Phi Kappa Psi residence in 2012. But just hours into the job, the state's Attorney General Mark Herring learned Filip was a member of the brotherhood's branch while he studied for his bachelor's degree at the University of Illinois in 1988. Forced to resign: Former federal prosecutor Mark Filip stepped down hours after he was appointed to oversee a review into alleged gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity of which he is an alumnus . His appointment was withdrawn with immediate effect as the situation was deemed 'too serious to allow anything to undermine confidence in the objectivity and independence of this review', The Roanoke Times reported. The school commissioned the review into one of University of Virginia's most illustrious fraternities after a current junior told Rolling Stone magazine she was raped by seven members at a party two years ago. In the horrifying account, the student identified as 'Jackie' says she was assaulted by a group of Phi Kappa Psi brothers after accepting an invitation to a 'date night' function at the house. The article goes on to indict the southern school for hushing up victims like Jackie, steering them towards dealing with these cases within the school, in order to protect their reputation. The Charlottesville, Virginia school was also attended by Hannah Graham, the 18-year-old student who was kidnapped on campus last September and found murdered weeks later. While Jackie decided not to press charges when the incident first happened, she has now decided to go public with her story after hearing from two other women who were gang raped at the fraternity, which counts President Woodrow Wilson as one of their distinguished alumni. Fraternity house of horrors: A junior at the University of Virginia, identified as Jackie, claims she was gang-raped by a group of seven men at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity (pictured above) in 2012. She told her painful story to Rolling Stone after hearing two other women had been victimized in similar ways at the house . Tagged: The house was grafitied on Thursday, hours after a Rolling Stone article was published detailing the gang-rape allegations against the fraternity . Still, breaking her silence was hard, and has in some cases been met with opposition by her friends at UVA. 'One of my roommates said, ""Do you want to be responsible for something that's gonna paint UVA in a bad light?""'' Jackie told the magazine. 'But I said, ""UVA has flown under the radar for so long, someone has to say something about it, or else it's gonna be this system that keeps perpetuating!' 'My friend just said, ""You have to remember where your loyalty lies.""' Jackie was just a few weeks into her freshman year at UVA when she met a a junior boy named Drew, through their shifts working as lifeguards at the university pool. When Drew asked her out to dinner and a 'date night' function at his fraternity, Jackie gladly accepted and spent three hours getting ready for the night out on September 28, 2012. Back at the fraternity house after dinner, the two spent some time at the party before Drew asked Jackie if she wanted to go upstairs where it was quieter. But when Drew led her into his bedroom and shut the door, the room was pitch black and she could hear others moving around. That's when the nightmare started. A man tackled her down and onto a glass table which shattered and tore up her back. Others held her down and for the next three hours, she lay helpless as seven men raped her while two others, including her date Drew, watched and gave direction. It was the worst night of Jackie's life, but for the men in the room it was like a sports game. They swigged beers and called each other nicknames like 'Armpit' and 'Blanket'. Jackie identified the last man who assaulted her from her anthropology discussion group, and his friends started taunting him because he couldn't get an erection, asking 'What, she's not hot enough for you?' and 'Don't you want to be a brother?' When Jackie came to at 3am, the room was deserted but the party was still going on downstairs. She fled the house in her bloodied dress, barefoot because she was too afraid to look around for her shoes. She called her three best friends at the time, two guys and a girl, who found her beaten and in shock. While her friends were distraught at her condition, they debated calling the police fearing the impact it would have on Jackie's and their reputation (the two boys  wanted to rush a fraternity). Ignored: Jackie told UVA's Dean Nicole Eramo (left) about the incident in 2012, but the fraternity was never put under investigation for the claims. On Wednesday, UVA President Teresa Sullivan (right) announced that the fraternity is now under investigation following 'new details' revealed in the Rolling Stone article . 'Is that such a good idea. Her reputation will be shot for the next four years,' the girl friend, identified as Cindy, said. 'She's gonna be the girl who cried ""rape,"" and we'll never be allowed into any frat party again.' Jackie didn't get the courage to speak about the rape until the next semester, when she finally opened up to Dean Nicole Eramo, the head of UVA's Sexual Misconduct Board. Dean Eramo told Jackie she could go to the police with her story, or treat the incident in house by either filing a complaint with the school's Sexual Misconduct Board, or sit down for an informal resolution' with her attackers in a meeting mediated by Eramo. Jackie decided on neither option, and despite hearing the terrifying story, Dean Eramo did not open an investigation into the fraternity. Jackie is now coming forward two years later, because she recently discovered that two other women experienced similar assaults at Phi Kappa Psi. The first account came from a woman who graduated in 2013 who said she was raped by a group of men at the house when she was a freshman. The other was a first-year whose friends called Jackie one night when she came back to her apartment wearing no pants, and said she'd been attacked by four men in the Phi Kappa Psi bathroom while another watched. Scandal: The Rolling Stone article goes on to indict the school of repeatedly hushing up sexual assault victims in order to protect their reputation. An aerial view of the campus, designed by Thomas Jefferson, above . Perhaps most startling about the allegations is what Dean Eramo said in a meeting with Jackie last May. Jackie and her friend Alex went to speak with Eramo in her office, and Eramo said that she heard it 'through the grapevine' that 'all the boys involved [in the gang rape] had graduated'. Jackie believes that was false since she saw one of her attackers on a campus riding a bike recently. Alex pointed out: 'Doesn't that mean they're admitting something happened?' After hearing that Rolling Stone was publishing an article on the gang rape, the school has finally opened an investigation on the fraternity. In a statement posted to the school's website on Wednesday, UVA President Teresa A Sullivan says that the school has asked the Charlottesville police to investigate a fraternity based on new details from the article. Phi Kappa Psi is not identified as the fraternity in question in her statement. 'The University takes seriously the issue of sexual misconduct, a significant problem that colleges and universities are grappling with across the nation. Our goal is to provide an environment that is as safe as possible for our students and the entire University community,' President Sullivan writes. A day after the article came out, the fraternity house was graffitied with the words 'Suspend us!' and 'UVA Center for RAPE Studies'. A dangerous place: The school was also the focus of a recent missing persons case involving 18-year-old Hannah Graham (pictured).

Lauren, from Bayou Vista in Texas, said: 'As I was walking on one of the trails at the state park, some movement in the water to my left caught my attention. 'At this moment the adult alligator seemed to be at rest, occasionally moving its head to situate the carcass in its jaws. I took a few pictures, and decided I would leave the alligator to its meal. 'As I started to walk away the alligator moved toward the bank, raised high on its front legs, and began thrashing the juvenile side to side. 'It was apparent that the alligator was trying to rip the juvenile into smaller pieces. I was amazed by the speed and power of the animal, so I pulled my camera back out and started taking photographs. 'I watched this happen over and over again for three hours. The large alligator would rest for fifteen minutes between each thrashing of the carcass. I couldn't take my eyes off of what was happening, and the alligator didn't seem to notice my presence.' Lauren approached a park volunteer to ask them why the alligator had behaved like that. 'The volunteer said that when the water levels drop, the alligators become very territorial.' She added, 'They defend their territories to the death, and alligators are known to be cannibalistic. 'I was surprised by the pictures - I love how they show the incredible strength and speed that alligators possess. Everyone that has seen the pictures has been shocked.

"Disgraced L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling has been spotted enjoying a romantic getaway with not one, but FOUR much younger woman. Sterling, 80, was spotted checking into the JW Marriott resort in Palm Desert, California, on Friday evening with one of his bevy of beauties. Eyewitnesses then reported seeing Sterling at various stages of the weekend with different women – two Asian and two African American – but there was no sign of either estranged wife Shelly Sterling or alleged ex-mistress V Stiviano. Scroll down for video . Disgraced L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling, 80, has been spotted enjoying a romantic getaway with four much younger women at the JW Marriott resort in Palm Desert, California, over the weekend . Instagram user concert_mark posted this photo online of Sterling and one of his female friends relaxing at the pool at the JW Marriott resort in Palm Desert, California, over the weekend . ‘He was with two Asian and two black women, but never all at once. It was two the first day and then two the second day at separate times,’ one hotel guest told RadarOnline. The guest, who insisted on going by his Instagram handle concert_mark posted several photos of Sterling to his account, including one of the millionaire relaxing by the pool with one of his young entourage of girlfriends. Sterling certainly wasn’t shy about being seen around the resort with his new companions and concert_mark said he believed it all for show, as if the octogenarian was trying to prove something in the wake of Stiviano leaking audio of him making racist remarks in April. 'He was obviously trying to be seen, at such a busy place and at the pool on a weekend. He strolled through the property with them a lot on his arm and it seemed like he was trying to prove he’s not a racist,' said concert_mark. On Monday, Sterling was spotted lunching with a female companion at Villa Blanca in Beverly Hills . The octogenarian's hair was dyed to match his black t-shirt . 'He was obviously trying to be seen, at such a busy place and at the pool on a weekend,' said one guest staying at the same hotel as Sterling . 'He was having issues walking and you can tell he's not all there': One guest described Sterling's behavior as 'off' over the weekend . ‘It was real obvious, the way he was laying with them. He was walking around with them and buying them stuff. My wife was very jealous of all the Louis Vuitton’s walking around!' Sterling was also spotted on Monday lunching with a female companion at Villa Blanca in Beverly Hills. In the wake of Sterling's racism scandal and lifetime NBA ban, there have been reports that he is suffering from Alzheimer’s, concert_mark told Radar that something appeared to be ‘off’ with Sterling. ‘He was having issues walking and you can tell he’s not all there,’ he said. ‘And he craps with the door open. I inadvertently followed him to the bathroom and there he was, door wide open. He refused to close it.’ Another guest had spotted Sterling checking in to the hotel on the Friday night. ‘Donald checked in the Marriott on Friday and was with a new much-younger girlfriend,’ the guest told Radar. ‘He didn’t seem to have a care in the world and it looked pretty clear why that chick was with him. They were being really affectionate with each other.’ A guest, who tweets as @cj_danvers, posted several photos on Twitter of the octogenarian hanging out at the hotel’s pool on Saturday.

Earlier this month, Sterling attended the Praises of Zion Missionary Baptist Church in south LA with several African American women in tow . On Thursday, a source close to the disgraced LA Clippers owner revealed that he has hired private investigators to dig up dirt on NBA owners and commissioners. Four investigative firms are said to have been given a six-figure budget and 30 days to look into whether any other owners have made off-color jokes, or racist or sexist remarks. The individual said detectives were looking at the league's finances, allegations of previous discrimination and compensation to commissioner Adam Silver and predecessor David Stern.

"Resplendent in beautifully embroidered dove-grey silk and a striking Phillip Treacey fascinator, the Duchess of Cornwall was every inch the royal bride when she married Prince Charles in 2005. Now the Duchess' stunning Anna Valentine gown is to be the centrepiece of an exhibition opening next month at the V&A. And the Duchess of Cornwall isn't the only aristocratic bride to dust off her nuptial frock for the show. Also included is the flesh-flashing Pam Hogg frock worn by Lady Mary Charteris to her 2012 marriage to Big Pink frontman, Robbie Furze, and a truly spectacular white silk-satin gown with an 18ft train sported by Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, on her big day in 1933. Elegant: The Duchess of Cornwall's dove-grey silk Anna Valentine gown was worn to her 2005 wedding to Prince Charles and is one of the highlights of the exhibition . Ethereal: Pale grey slashed chiffon wedding dress designed by Gareth Pugh and veil by Stephen Jones, worn by Katie Shillingford for her marriage to Alex Dromgoole . Spectacular: The beautiful John Galliano designed dress worn by Gwen Stefani at her 2004 wedding to Gavin Rossdale. His suit, also on show, is Hedi Slimane for Dior . Other highlights include the dip-dyed pink and ivory John Galliano-designed dress worn by Gwen Stefani to her 2004 wedding to Gavin Rossdale and the unusual purple silk frock in which Dita von Teese married shock-rocker Marylin Manson. The gowns will join dresses dating from the 18th and 19th centuries for an exhibition entitled Wedding Dresses 1775 - 2014, which opens on the 3rd May and runs until 15th March next year. Among the most striking is a ravishing silk brocade gown worn by a wealthy . woman named Jane Bailey to her 1780 marriage to James Wickham. Equally . impressive is the lavishly frilled, embroidered and furbelowed dress . sported by New York heiress Cara Leland Huttleston Rogers at her wedding . to Bradford Ferris Duff in 1890. But it's not all pretty dresses with stellar pedigrees. As curator Edwina Ehrman explains, the collection also gives an insight into the changing tastes of British brides over the last 300 years. 'In the 18th century, the most prestigious fabrics for a bride were those woven with expensive gold and silver metal threads,' explains Ehrman. 'This was the choice of most royal brides until Queen Victoria married in white satin in 1840. Changing tastes:  A Parisian design created in 1880 (left) and an elaborate gown designed by Rudolf Ackermann in 1816 (right) Ravishing: . Embroidered silk satin wedding dress designed by Norman Hartnell and . worn by Margaret Whigham for her marriage to Charles Sweeny in 1933 . Pretty: Maud Cecil and Greville Steel leaving church after their 1927 wedding (left) and bride Sara Donaldson-Hudson in a Bellville Sassoon coat at her 1970 wedding . Unusual: . The daring satin and layered tulle wedding gown worn by Lady Mary . Charteris for her wedding to Big Pink frontman, Robbie Furze . 'However wearing white was also a status symbol.  In the past white garments were very difficult to keep clean and white was associated with wealth and leisure.' Although white and similarly pale shades such as ivory and cream remain popular, as the Duchess of Cornwall's dress makes plain, other hues are becoming increasingly fashionable. Some brides, among them Dita von Teese, choose to dispense with lighter hues altogether, while others such as Gwen Stefani and Jessica Biel opt for subtly coloured gowns. 'We’ve got some excellent examples of . coloured wedding dresses in the exhibition,' adds Erhman. 'Among them are a purple dress . made by a lady’s maid in 1899, a floor-length dress made from colourful . upholstery fabric during World War II and Dita von Teese’s incredible . purple taffeta gown designed by Vivienne Westwood for her marriage to . Marylin Manson in 2005.' But while the coloured dresses are gorgeous, what really catches the eye is the social commentary offered by the rest of the collection; reflecting, as they do, the social upheaval and changing tastes that characterised the 20th century. 'The 20th century witnessed rapid social . change and increasing economic, political and sexual freedom for women,' explains Erhman. 'While most women still wanted a degree of formality in their wedding . dress, the traditional codes of dress gradually lost their power. Beautiful: The corded silk dress worn by Cara Leland Huttleston Rogersin 1890 and the silk brocade gown worn by Jane Bailey for her wedding in 1780 . Delicate: . Silk and leather 'tango' shoes bought from Peter Robinson Ltd. of . London, 1914 and worn by Phyllis Blaiberg for her marriage to Bertie . Mayer Stone . Stunning: . The silk-satin Norman Hartnell gown with an 18ft train worn by . Margaret Wigham, later Duchess of Argyll, at her wedding to Robert Sweeny in 1933 . 'In the . 1960s some women celebrated the new freedoms by marrying in . mini-dresses and trouser suits and in the 1990s, the plunging, backless, . strapless wedding dress became accepted even for church weddings. 'The . etiquette of wedding dress for men also relaxed with more men choosing . to wear lounge suits and some buying wedding outfits from shops which . targeted a young and fashion-conscious market.' Modern . dresses included in the exhibition show just how much leeway . contemporary brides have, with everything from dip dye to cutaway . bodices on display. 'I do love the drama of John Galliano’s . 2002 pink and white dress for Gwen Stefani,' adds Erhman. 'It’s incredibly romantic and . slightly shocking: the dress has been designed to make it appear as if . the groom has already tried to start undressing the bride leaving her . dress in disarray. 'It’s also a glorious colour. The hem of the dress . and veil are drenched in pink which gradually fades away into white. I . also love the subtle, sensual elegance of the Ian and Marcel’s pleated . dress and coat, made for an unknown bride in 1989, which the designers . paired with veil decorated with roses drawn in silicone rubber.' From . frilled and furbelowed to silicone and rubber, the dresses on display . at the V&A might not be your average bridal gowns, but they are . certainly fascinating ones.

"A family of thieves targeted a Toy R Us store in South Florida with children playing a role in the brazen theft. A mother, father and their seven kids all descended upon the store in Boca Raton, but it wasn't to pick out holiday gifts, but rather steal from the store. Cameras caught the family of nine, which included kids between the ages of three and 13, making off with a couple of gadgets. Scroll down for video... Dash & grab: A family of thieves targeted a Toys R Us store in South Florida. Parents along with their seven children managed to steal a number of tablets from displays before walking out . Pre-planned: The family knew exactly where they were heading as they made their way over towards the electronics section of the store . Spotted: The family could be seen in the area of the store where the tablets were located . Upon entering the store, the group made their way over towards the electronics section where the tablets were on display. According to investigators, the children appeared in and out of the video as if they were climbing under the cabinets. Store management at the Toys R Us told the police that it appeared the parents had instructed the kids to undo the security devices that were attached to the devices. It appears as though two of the security alarms were removed from the tablets. Stolen: Items were ripped from their attachments on the store's shelves . Brazen: The family spent around 20 minutes in the store before they races out with their hoard of stolen items . Investigators believe the kids succeeded in removing two of the security devices from the tablets. The parents then walked by the shelves and took two of the tablets and the whole family left the store together. 'That's awful, that's awful. They should you know, teach good principles, good manners, how to be polite,' said shopper Lis Santos to CBS 12 News. 'I think that's quite unfortunate, you would be under the impression that a parent would be a good role model for younger children.  Unfortunately those are the things that are going on in society nowadays,' said Josh Borrero, another shopper at the store. The video shows they were in the store for about 20 minutes. The two tablets they took, a Tabeo E2 and a Polaroid 10.1,  were worth over $300 dollars. Authorities ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Palm Beach County Crime Stoppers at 800-458-8477.","Family entered Toys R Us store and headed over to the electronic department .

"The transit officer gravely wounded by the alleged Boston bombers Thursday night is recovering at hospital as the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology mourned the murder of a campus policeman who shot dead trying to stop the suspects. MIT officer Sean Collier, 26, was heralded as a dedicated hero who enjoyed climbing snowy mountains, training young boxers and playing kickball on a team called Kickhopopotamus. Collier had been at MIT for just over a year and impressed students and his colleagues with his contagious enthusiasm, be it offering students rides or volunteering for extra duties, his supervisors said. Officer Sean Collier was shot and killed by the Boston Marathon bombing suspects after responding to a report of a disturbance Thursday night . Donohue was a veteran of the navy and graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 2002 . Early reports indicate Tamerlan Tsarnaev (left) and brother Dzhokhar (right) killed officer Sean Collier in a shooting at MIT before critically injuring officer Richard Donohue in another gunfight . Massachusetts transit officer Richard Donohue, 33, meanwhile, is out of surgery and has been stabilized. A transit agency spokesman says Donohue remains in critical condition Friday at Mount Auburn Hospital. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority spokesman Joe Pesaturo says Donohue is a married father of a 6-month-old child. He has been with the MBTA's police department for three years. 'Facing extraordinary danger, Officer . Donohue never hesitated in fully engaging the terrorists in order to . protect the citizens of the Commonwealth,' Transit Police Chief Paul . MacMillan said in a statement. 'I am extremely proud of him, and cannot . say enough about his heroic actions.' Donohue graduated in the same police academy class as Collier. Collier's work as an officer was praised today. Collier was a country fan who enjoyed camping and telling jokes . Reporters said Collier never even confronted the suspects and was shot while in his squad car . 'Just the other day - and I still have it on my computer - he asked me if I would have a problem if he approached the homeless shelter to see if he could become a member of the board of directors, so that he could work with those people down there and try to mitigate problems before the problems develop,' MIT Police Chief John DiFava said Friday. 'The kid was the real deal,' he added. Investigators say Collier was shot while responding to a report of a disturbance. He was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 'Our only solace is that Sean died bravely doing what he committed his life to - serving and protecting others,' his family said in a statement. Authorities said Collier was shot multiple times . On twitter, friends said all Collier wanted to do was be a police officer . MIT says Collier was a native of Wilmington and a Somerville resident who had worked at MIT since January 2012. Before that, he was a civilian employee of the Somerville Police Department - a force he hoped to join one day as an officer. Collier focused on becoming a police officer after graduating with honors from Salem State University in 2009 with a criminal justice degree. Bob Trane, an alderman in Somerville whose ward includes the home where Collier lived, said the young man contacted him about the process of becoming a police officer. 'He was a young guy with an old soul, mature beyond his years,' Trane said. 'He knew what he wanted in life and he was working toward that goal. ... His whole life was focused on going into law enforcement.' Collier was described as a brave and warm person always ready to help . Collier likely would've joined the police department this June, fulfilling a lifelong dream . Collier helped with Trane's re-election campaign a couple times by holding a campaign sign on street corners. He also got to know Collier when he worked in the Somerville Police Department. 'He was old school - respectful, courteous, dedicated,' Trane said. He was also active. Collier climbed snowy peaks like Mount Washington in New Hampshire with the MIT Outing Club, where members knew him for his enthusiasm and his habit of bringing pepperoni as a trail snack. He helped teach the younger boxers at The Somerville Youth Development & Boxing Club, said trainer Bod Covino. And Collier played in a kickball league on Sunday afternoons with the Kickhopopotamus. 'He participated in our national kickball competition in Las Vegas with his team and was certainly a kickball lover at heart,' Priscilla Vega, a spokeswoman for WAKA Kickball & Social Sports, said in an email . The family did not comment beyond the statement that read in part, 'we are heartbroken by the loss of our wonderful and caring son and brother.' Collier's brother Andrew works for Hendrick Motorsports as a machinist in its engine shop. Somerville Mayor Joseph Curtatone, who called Collier's death 'such a tragic loss,' said he was excited about the chance to soon name Collier a Somerville police officer. He said Collier was looking forward to it too.

"Announcement: Defence Secretary Michael Fallon is sending guns and ammunition to Iraq to forces fighting ISIS . Britain is gifting heavy machine guns and ammunition worth £1.6million to help Kurdish forces fighting ISIS in Iraq. The weapons will arrive tomorrow and will be used to battle the extremist army, which is believed to include hundreds of Britons. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'The Kurdish forces remain significantly less well equipped than Isil (ISIS) and we are responding to help them defend themselves, protect citizens and push back advances.' The announcement follows Prime Minister David Cameron's confirmation yesterday that Britain would be directly supplying the Kurds, who are fighting the extremist group that have seized large swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. Last week at the NATO summit in Wales Mr Cameron and Barack Obama prepared the ground for multi-national air strikes against Islamic State and for sending troops to form a Nato training force in Iraq. In Britain, cross-party support for joining US military action was increasing. There is some speculation it could be weeks away. Mr Fallon said the gifting of the guns was needed as the Kurds are 'significantly less well-equipped' than ISIS . In a written ministerial statement, the Defence Secretary said: 'I am laying a departmental minute today concerning the gifting of military equipment to the Government of Iraq (GoI), including the Kurdish regional government. This is at the request of the GoI. 'The UK is committed to assisting the GoI by: alleviating the humanitarian suffering of those Iraqis targeted by Isil terrorists; promoting an inclusive, sovereign and democratic Iraq that can push back on Isil advances and restore stability and security across the country; and working with the international community to tackle the broader threat that Isil poses to the region and other countries around the world, including the UK. 'The Kurdish forces remain significantly less well-equipped than Isil and we are responding to help them defend themselves, protect citizens and push back Isil advances. Brutal ISIS has captured swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria has declared itself an Islamic 'caliphate' Kurdish fighters have retaken land from the Islamic State but Britain believes they need more guns and ammunition . 'The initial gifting package is scheduled to arrive in Iraq on Wednesday September 10 and will consist of heavy machine guns and ammunition. 'The total cost is approximately £1.6 million plus an estimated £475,000 in transport costs.' The announcement comes as US president Barack Obama prepares to outline his strategy for dealing with IS tomorrow. Mr Cameron has said if Mr Obama announces further military action against the jihadists beyond the air strikes that have taken place and Britain is to join in that action, MPs will have a vote on the decision. But he stressed that the Government could take action without the approval of Parliament in the event of an immediate humanitarian catastrophe or if a British interest needs urgent protection.","The weapons will arrive tomorrow, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon reveals .

"British Olympic hero Mo Farah has revealed how he was quizzed by U.S. border officials on suspicion of being a terrorist. The double gold medal winner, who was awarded a CBE in the New Year's honours list, said he was hauled before guards while entering the country for a holiday this Christmas. The 29-year-old runner told The Sun that border guards questioned him because of his 'Somalia origin'. The athlete even resorted to showing his Olympic medals in an effort to prove who he was. Disbelief: Olympic champion Mo Farah said that he gets detained every time he enters the U.S. because of his 'Somali origin' Proof: Farah said that he was pulled aside by officials while visiting Portland, Oregon, with his family this Christmas. Farah told how he retrieved his gold medals from his luggage to prove who he was . On a previous visit to the country, Farah revealed that he was asked to leave before receiving a letter explaining that he was 'under investigation as a terrorist threat'. Farah moved to the UK with his British-born father aged only eight. He said that he was taken aside by border guards while visiting Portland, Oregon, with his family on a Christmas break. The athlete said: 'I couldn't believe it. Because of my Somali origin I get detained every time I come through U.S. Customs.' Farah said he had to resort to 'getting his medals out' to prove who he was, as he was conveniently carrying them in his luggage. Farah, whose triumphs in the 5,000 metre and 10,000 metre races provided two of the most exciting moments of London 2012, trains in the U.S. Family man: The athlete moved to the UK from Somalia as an eight-year-old with his British-born father . Accusations: Farah said he was previously asked to leave the country while training and later received a letter saying he was 'under investigation as a terror threat' After failing to qualify for the 2008 Olympics he moved his wife Tania and daughter Rihanna to Portland to work with legendary coach Alberto Salazar at Nike's headquarters. But the runner said that he had previously encountered problems with border officials. Assuming that his sponsors Nike had sorted out his residency visa, Farah 'had to leave' America as he was using a tourist visa. He said: 'We flew to Toronto to stay for a few days, then come . back in. 'But when we were there we got a letter telling us we were under . investigation as a terrorist threat and we would have to stay away for another . 90 days.' Distressed because he only had four days' worth of clothes with him, Farah got in touch with Salazar. Farah claimed that his American coach had a 'friend who works for the FBI' who was a 'massive running fan'. According to the athlete, the contact 'got it sorted'.","Olympic star accuses border guards of hauling him in for questioning .

"It has been revealed that the CIA has been tracking money transfers made through wiring services like Western Union, making it the latest way in which the government is secretly collecting data on its citizens. The New York Times reveals that the Central Intelligence Agency has been using a provision under the Patriot Act to justify their collection of Americans transferring money to potential terrorists both inside and outside of the United States. Officials with knowledge of the existing situation say that the laws in place require a connection to a terrorist before being granted permission to see any information about any Americans involved in the transfer. Follow the money: The CIA has been revealed to track wire transfers domestically and internationally when connected to possible terror suspects . They also stipulated that all information gathered under the provision has to be completely destroyed within a certain number of years. This is the latest way in which personal information is being collected by government agencies, as earlier initiatives included CIA programs with wireless carriers like AT&T and the NSA's work that was revealed following the Edward Snowden document leak.  An unidentified intelligence official told The Times that there is at least one other way that the government has been tracking Americans' actions that has yet to be revealed. 'The intelligence community collects bulk data in a number of different ways under multiple authorities,' the source told the paper. All of the officials that spoke to The Times did so under the condition of anonymity, with some refusing to say whether or not the money transfer oversight is in effect, but then giving information about how it would be carried out if it were. CIA spokesman Dean Boyd kept his response vague and did not specifically comment about the reports of money transfer tracking. 'The C.I.A. protects the nation and upholds the privacy rights of Americans by ensuring that its intelligence collection activities are focused on acquiring foreign intelligence and counterintelligence in accordance with U.S. laws,' he said. Another data drive: The CIA (pictured) has been revealed to track wire transfers and cell phone data, and that is in addition to the NSA programs tracking other phone calls and internet searches . This latest revelation comes just one week after The New York Times revealed that the CIA was paying AT&T $10million per year for phone records to assist overseas counter-terrorism investigations. This finding differed from previous records-gathering programs which were pursued under legal threats; the payment shows that the phone company profited by giving the government the information they wanted. Under the AT&T arrangement, the CIA supplies phone numbers of overseas terrorism suspects and AT&T searches its database to provide call records that may help identify foreign associates, the paper said. Most of the call logs provided by AT&T involve foreign-to-foreign calls, the paper said. Paying customers: The CIA pays AT&T $10million to hand over information about potential terrorists, and the financial deal proves that the partnership between the phone company and the agency is not forced . AT&T does not disclose the identity of the Americans calling from the United States, and masks their phone numbers when it produces the records, the paper said, quoting the officials. That does little to block the CIA from finding out the Americans involved, however, as it just means that they have to jump through some bureaucratic hoops first. The CIA is tasked with handling security threats abroad and does not have the rights to obtain certain information about domestic citizens- which is left for the FBI. To get the information that AT&T obstructs, The Times says that the CIA asks the FBI to order an administrative subpoena to AT&T, forcing the company to hand over the personal data of the phone number in question. The FBI then shares that information with the CIA.","New reports reveal the CIA has been storing and collecting information from wire transfer tracking .

"Germany's 7-1 humiliation of hosts Brazil in the semi-finals of the World Cup had statisticians rewriting history practically every time Joachim Low's side touched the ball. Brazil's dreams of winning the tournament in their home country were effectively ended by a first-half masterclass that saw the Germans score five goals in the opening 29minutes - the fastest time it has ever taken a team to reach that figure in World Cup history. But, that wasn't the only record to fall on an astonishing night in Belo Horizonte... VIDEO Scroll down for German fans celebrate their 7-1 victory over hosts Brazil . Seventh heaven: The Germans dished out the heaviest defeat in Brazil's history . Worst loss in Brazil history . The 7-1 scoreline was equal to the worse defeat in the history of Brazilian football. The Selecao were beaten by 6-0 by fellow South Americans Uruguay in 1920 - nearly a century ago. This was also Brazil's heaviest World Cup defeat, the next being their 3-0 loss to France in the 1998 Final. By contrast, Spain only scored eight goals during the entire tournament to win the 2010 World Cup. Most World Cup goals . Germany have now scored 221 World Cup goals, to move one ahead of their hapless opponents as the tournament's highest ever scorers. Germany (10) only had two more shots on target than Brazil (8) in this match. Germany scored two more goals tonight than England have in their past two World Cup campaigns combined. Heaviest World Cup semi-final defeat . No other team has ever scored seven goals in the semi-finals of the World Cup. Germany's six goal victory was the heaviest semi-final defeat in the tournament's history, ahead of West Germany's 6-1 defeat of Austria in 1954 and Uruguay's win by the same scoreline against Yugoslavia in 1930. Germany netted as many goals in this semi-final as they had in their previous six World Cup semi-finals (1982-2010). It is the first time since 1938 that Brazil have lost a World Cup semi-final, they had progressed in their previous six. Most goals conceded by Brazil at World Cup . It was also the first time that Brazil had conceded more than five World Cup goals since 1938, although on that occassion they managed to comeback to beat Poland 6-5 after extra-time. Furthermore, Brazil have not let in seven goals at home... ever! Brazil have conceded eight in a game before during a 8-4 friendly defeat to Yugoslavia on 3 June 1934. Most goals scored against the World Cup host nation . Brazil is the SECOND host team to let in seven goals in a World Cup match, following Switzerland's 5-7 defeat to Austria in 1954. The next highest was Brazil who managed to score five against hosts Sweden in 1958 during a 5-2 victory. Standing alone: Miroslav Klose became the tournament's leading scorer with 16 goals . VIDEO Disbelief in Belo Horizonte after devastating Germany win . All-time record goalscorer at World Cup . Miroslav Klose added salt to Brazilian . wounds by netting his 16th goal at the World Cup finals to move clear of . Ronaldo as the competition's all-time leading scorer. And, Germany have NEVER lost a match where their talisman Klose has scored the first goal. Muller scores Germany's 2,000th goal . Thomas Müller could yet take home the Golden Boot after moving to within a goal of Colombia's James Rodriguez when he scored the opener for his his fifth strike, which also happened to be Germany's 2,000 in history of Die Mannschaft. Müller is the third player (after Cubillas and Klose) in history to score five or more goals in two different World Cups - he has scored 10 goals and provided six assists in just 12 World Cup matches. Fastest brace in World Cup history . Toni Kroos' first-half double, which came in just 69 seconds, was the fastest brace in the history of the competition. Fastest four goals scored in World Cup history . Joachim Low's side scored four goals in the space of six minutes (from 23 to 29). That has never been done in World Cup history. Unhappy ending: Brazil conceded seven goals - five during the first-half - to end their World Cup dream . Brazil's second heaviest defeat was probably the only other match that could compare in the misery stakes, despite it being a friendly, since it came against arch rivals during a 6-1 hammering in 1940. Germany's highest half-time lead . After their opening blitz, Germany achieved their highest half-time lead in a World Cup game. Their previous best was 4-0 against Saudi Arabia at the 2002 tournament, which eventually saw them record their greatest win with an 8-0 victory. Only three teams have previously trailed by five goals at half-time: Zaire (1974), Haiti (1974)... and Brazil (1938). Most goals scored in a World Cup semi-final .

"A man armed with a 6in kitchen knife who was rugby-tackled to the ground by police outside Buckingham Palace after he attempted to see the Queen has painted many pictures of the Royal Family. David Belmar, of Haringey, north London, admitted trespass and possession of a bladed article after he tried to run through the palace’s north centre gate just before 11.30am on Monday, a court heard yesterday. When police searched Belmar after bringing him to the ground, they found the kitchen knife wrapped in a plastic bag in his jacket pocket. The 44-year-old has posted a gallery of paintings, including portraits of the Queen, Kate Middleton, Prince Charles and Princess Anne. Scroll down for video . Portraits of  the Duchess of Cambridge painted by Buckingham Palace intruder David Belmar . Belmar, who said he wanted to talk to the Queen about his benefits, painted her portrait and posted it online . David Belmar painted a series of portraits, including a pencil drawing of himself. He also painted the Mona Lisa and Piccadilly Circus . He has also included portraits of Piccadilly Circus, the Mona Lisa, Jesus Christ and self-portraits in his Facebook gallery, and posted a photograph of himself wearing a -shirt that says 'artist'. His simple paintings and pencil drawings also depict Barack Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger and his mother. The artist wanted to discuss his benefits with the Queen, a court heard. Yesterday, Edward Aydin, prosecuting, told . Westminster Magistrates’ Court in Central London: ‘In police custody, he . said to police “I wanted to see the Queen. I’m not happy about my . benefits”.’ David Belmar painted this picture of Jesus and a picture of himself. He also painted pictures of various celebrities and iconic landmarks . He added that . Belmar, who has mental health issues, has a fixation with the Queen and . received a caution in 1989 for lighting fireworks and throwing them into . the grounds of Buckingham Palace. The . Queen was not in the building at the time of the incident, Buckingham . Palace said. District Judge Quentin Purdy adjourned sentencing so that . pre-sentence reports could be carried out. He remanded Belmar in custody until he is sentenced at Southwark Crown Court at a date to be set. Belmar, . who appeared in court wearing a black jumper with an Umbro logo and . blue jeans, went to the front of Buckingham Palace at 11.29am, Mr Aydin . said. He told the court Mr Belmar was seen to suddenly break into a run. Royal incident: Police outside Buckingham Palace after a 44-year-old tried to get in with a knife . Arrest: The intruder sprinted in via its north gate (pictured guarded by police), which is open for cars, at around 11.30am . ‘He . then turned into the grounds of the palace and jumped over the vehicle . barrier by putting his foot on that barrier,’ said Mr Aydin. ‘Two police . officers, armed, one of them shouted: “Stop!” - he continued to run. ‘As . you can see he’s quite a large man. He was rugby tackled to the ground . because he wouldn’t stop. Police called out on two occasions.’ He . added that other officers rushed to help apprehend Belmar. A number of . children were at the gates of the palace watching while the incident was . unfolding, the court heard. ‘Armed . guards had to stop him,’ said Mr Aydin. ‘He could have been fired upon. Other people could have been hurt. And there was a risk of some form of . disorder there outside the palace.’ Belmar . was under the care of mental health services from 2002 to 2010 and . lives with his father and brother, both of whom sat in the court’s . public gallery for today’s hearing. Relief: Queen Elizabeth II, pictured last week, was not at home when they security alert happened . Mr Aydin said Belmar was a man with a long history of mental illness who is a danger to himself. He . added: ‘His behaviour that morning, yesterday, was unpredictable. He is . a danger to the public, carrying a knife in central London, and he is a . danger to the Queen.’ Robert Katz, defending, denied Belmar has a fixation with the Queen or Buckingham Palace, as it was claimed. He . said his client had been on incapacity benefit for the past 10 years . but that it was stopped after he was assessed in September. Mr Katz said: ‘He became very upset by that decision and he didn’t know how he was going to cope.’ He . added that Belmar did not brandish the knife and was not going to use . it, but that he had ‘wanted to draw publicity to what had happened to . him’. Belmar, who admitted . trespass on a protected site and possession of a bladed or pointed . article, has a number of previous convictions, including for actual . bodily harm and criminal damage. Sky News flies over the scene moments after arrest . Interest: Tourists crowd the area and take photographs where the armed 44-year-old was wrestled to the floor . Mr Aydin told the court that Belmar becomes violent when taking some of his medication for mental health problems. District Judge Purdy said the case was too serious to be dealt with in the magistrates’ court, given his past convictions. Making . his decision to remand Belmar in custody, he accepted he was living in . the community on prescription medication but added: ‘Something has . clearly gone wrong. ‘If it . could go wrong yesterday, being granted bail there is a real risk, until . he is properly assessed and perhaps further medication prescribed. He . is a danger not just to himself but to others.’ Last . month, a separate security incident was sparked at the palace when a . suspected burglar got into the building by scaling a fence. He . was found at around 10.30pm on September 2 in a room that was open to . the public during the day. A second man was arrested outside the palace . on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary. Less . than 48 hours later, amid heightened security, two police officers . confronted the Duke of York in the palace gardens demanding to know who . he was.

"A schoolboy has spent three weeks recreating some of cinema's most unforgettable scenes using hundreds of pieces of LEGO. Morgan Spence, 15, created the two-minute video by crafting the little coloured bricks into clips from dozens of Hollywood classics. Backed by music from the films themselves, the film includes the most iconic scenes from Dirty Dancing and the Sound of Music, as well as instantly-recognisable snippets from films such as Dracula, ET and Pulp Fiction. Scroll down for video . Morgan Spence spent three weeks creating a LEGO film of cinema's most unforgettable scenes, including this scene from Life of Pi . The 15-year-old has created a miniature version of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio standing on the bow of the Titanic for the two-minute video . He also recreated the scene from the Sound Of Music in which Julie Andrews dances and sing on a floral hillside in Austria . Each clip - including this one from The Shining - is backed by famous songs and compositions used in the well-known films . Cinema fans can also see  miniature versions of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio standing on the bow of the Titanic, Audrey Hepburn enjoying a cigarette in Breakfast at Tiffany's and Morgan's favourite recreation, a scene from Singing in the Rain. Morgan, of Kilbarchan, Renfrewshire, made the video for a project by LEGO masterbuilder Warren Elsmore, who has released a book featuring scenes from 60 cult movies, made with LEGO, called Brick Flicks. Masterbuilders are the highly-trained builders who design all of the official LEGO sets. Using characters created by specialist website minifigs.me, Morgan made short videos to match the iconic scenes, keeping as close to the originals as possible. He said: 'He had seen some of my work before and asked if I wanted to create a montage of that. The only thing I had was the characters and none of the backgrounds. 'It was a judgement of what we could do and would be most effective on camera initially. I suppose the trickiest thing was keeping it as accurate as possible and making sure it was instantly recognisable. It was mostly pretty straightforward. It was more the set design and making it look good on camera.' Morgan, from Kilbarchan, Renfrewshire, pictured left with his designs and right at the launch of the LEGO exhibition, made the video as part of a project led by LEGO masterbuilder Warren Elsmore . Morgan's favourite scene - and the first to feature on the film - is from Singing in the Rain. He loves this scene because it is so recognisable, he said . Morgan said: 'I suppose the trickiest thing was keeping it as accurate as possible and making sure it was instantly recognisable'. Pictured: A scene from Pulp Fiction . Honey Ryder, left, and James Bond, right, from the James Bond film Dr No, were recreated for the clip. The figures were created by specialist website minifigs.me . Each scene - lasting just a few seconds at a time - took anywhere from 15 minutes to two hours to film. Pictured: A scene from ET . Other iconic scenes - which Morgan tried to keep as close to the original as possible - include this scene of 'the lift' from Dirty Dancing . LEGO-loving Morgan used his bedroom for his films, having set up a small studio. Pictured: A LEGO scene from Wayne's World . It took Morgan three weeks to put the two-minute video together, which by stop-motion standards is 'a quick turnaround', he said. He added: 'I'm quite proud of the results. My favourite one was Singing in the Rain because it's such an iconic film scene and it's so recognisable.' Each scene - lasting just a few seconds at a time - took between 15 minutes to two hours to film. He created the scenes from his bedroom, where he set up a small studio for the project. He said: 'It does require quite a bit of patience.' Morgan became interested in stop-motion movie-making in 2011, after creating a film for a school project. Pictured: A scene from Laurel and Hardy . The teenager focussed on Hollywood classics and scenes which would be easy  to recognise, including this from Laurel and Hardy . Morgan also put together a scene from Dracula for the film. He said he likes using LEGO because it 'lets the imagination run free' Another scene he created was from The Wizard of Oz, featuring all of the main characters and the famous Yellow Brick Road . Morgan has already achieved fame by creating a music video for superstar DJ Paul Oakenfold . He has his sights set on film-making as a future career, with plans to study the subject once he finishes school. Pictured: Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's . Morgan first became interested in stop-motion film-making in 2011, after creating a film for a Second World War project at school. He said: 'I thought I could maybe do something different. I animated Airfix planes in a Battle of Britain dog fight. It went down well at school so I thought I might as well combine this with my hobby - LEGO. Then I branched into commercial work.' Morgan has already achieved fame having created a music video last year for superstar DJ Paul Oakenfold. The artist asked Morgan to direct the video for his single, Who Do You Love, using LEGO. And, unsurprisingly, Morgan has his sights set on film-making as a future career. He plans to study the subject once he finishes school.

"Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has hit back at Brazil boss Dunga by claiming  Marcelo is the 'best full back in the world'. The 26-year-old was a regular under previous coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, starting six of seven games at the World Cup this summer. But Marcelo has not made a single appearance under Dunga, who blamed his attacking instincts for contributing to their 7-1 humiliation by Germany in the semi-final. Galacticos Isco (left), Marcelo (centre) and Cristiano Ronaldo warm-up  on Thursday . But Ancelotti said: 'Brazil didn't have a good World Cup, but I don't think it was because of Marcelo. The team in general didn't play well. 'Since the World Cup, Marcelo has been the best full-back in the world without a doubt. We are happy if he doesn't join up with his national team and stays here.' Real Madrid face Almeria in La Liga on Friday aiming to extend their record winning run to 20 matches but injuries are beginning to take their toll. Carlo Ancelotti's side will be chasing their 20th successive victory against Almeria on Friday . Ancelotti's side have been in blistering form and a 4-0 victory over Ludogorets in the Champions League on Tuesday set a new Spanish record of 19 wins in all competitions. Injuries are becoming a concern, however, with James Rodriguez going off against Celta Vigo last weekend to join Luka Modric and Sami Khedira in the treatment room. Asier Illarramendi has earned a chance to claim a regular place in the side but the team are looking stretched in midfield with Xabi Alonso having joined Bayern Munich in the last transfer window. Welshman Gareth Bale slaloms his way through Real Madrid training on Thursday afternoon . 'We are waiting to see how well Modric and James recover and then we will take a decision after Christmas,' coach Carlo Ancelotti told a news conference on Thursday. 'Illarramendi has come in and has done well and can play in different positions in the midfield.

"Animals may have been harmed during the filming of this production. The American Humane Association (AHA) is charged with protecting animals during movie shoots, but a staggering new report out claims it puts more effort into covering up animal harm than preventing it. Some of the biggest-name productions in Hollywood have seen animals die on-set or suffer near-death experiences but still received the ubiquitous AHA stamp of approval, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Scroll down for video . 'Damn near drowned': King, the tiger star of 'Life of Pi,' is said to have almost drowned during filming according to an AHA monitor's report . Some of the more egregious incidents include dozens of marine animals washing ashore during the filming of a Pirates Of The Caribbean film, the deaths of 27 animals during the filming of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, and four horses dying during filming for HBO's Luck. Not even the tiger star of Life Of Pi, who almost drowned, was safe from being covered up.The tiger, known in the film as Richard Parker, was tasked with swimming to the side during a scene and became disoriented. A trainer had to lasso him with a rope and pull him to safety. In an email obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, AHA monitor Gina Johnson allegedly wrote to a colleague: ‘I think this goes without saying but DON’T MENTION IT TO ANYONE, ESPECIALLY THE OFFICE! I have downplayed the f*** out of it.’ The award-winning box office smash still received the ‘No Animals Were Harmed’ credit familiar to all moviegoers. Incredible: Four horses died during the filming of HBO's Luck . Four deaths: The four horses passed during the filming of only nine episodes . Several dozen marine animals, including fish and squid, washed ashore during the filming of Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl. They died after uncontrolled explosions were set off in the water for special effects, a rep from the AHA present during filming told The Hollywood Reporter. The AHA declined to comment regarding the allegation. The more than two dozen animals that fell victim to The Hobbit included sheep and goats that died from dehydration, exhaustion or drowning during a filming hiatus. The AHA cobbled together the following certification for the big-budget blockbuster saying it ‘monitored all of the significant animal action. No animals were harmed during such action.’ During the filming of Failure To Launch a squirrel was somehow crushed to death by the film crew. Several dozen dead marine animals washed ashore during the filming of Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl . These allegations are seen as proof that the animal safety watchdog has a relaxed relationship with the film industry. A former LA animal protection officer was quoted as saying: ‘It’s fascinating and ironic: From being the protectors of animals they’ve become complicit to animal cruelty.' The now-retired agent said production staff at one film even once ‘told animal control to f*** themselves’ after agents were sent to investigate the deaths of two horses. Even with the ability to issue citations and arrest production staff for harming animals, the crew of HBO’s horse racing drama Luck escaped unscathed despite four horses dying during production. Lucky to be alive: A monkey perches on Bradley Cooper's shoulder during the filming of Failure To Launch . How did this happen: A squirrel similar to this one was crushed to death by the production crew of Failure To Launch . The AHA half-heartedly admitted that Ms Johnson’s objectivity might have been compromised because of her relationship with a Life Of Pi movie executive. But the former animal control officer said: ‘This is worse than doing nothing. This is like a cop not just ignoring a crime but helping cover it up.’ An unnamed AHA employee agreed, saying ‘the moral compass of the entire place is off the hook’.","The tiger star in Life Of Pi almost drowned to death during filming, it was covered up by an overseer sleeping with a movie exec tied to the film .

"With no more than an electric toothbrush and a dirty wall at his disposal graffiti artist Moose added a stunning new Christmas-themed attraction to London's South Bank. Moose, whose real name is Paul Curtis, used a Philips Sonicare toothbrush to cleverly clean away the dull green gunk on the concrete wall and create a winter landscape with rolling snow-capped hills, trees and a cute cottage at its heart. To say Moose, whose trademark style of work is to clean dirt off surfaces, made the most of the moss would be an understatement. Street artist Moose, aka Paul Curtis, created a winter-themed mural using an electric toothbrush . Moose removes the moss on the footpath wall on London's South Bank to reveal a 'white, fluffy' surface . 'I think it's amazing,' said a passer-by. 'It's really nice to have something that's created so simply with something that's every day. It's a lovely addition to the South Bank.' Moose was impressed with both the tool he'd been challenged to use and its surroundings. He said he was on a mission to brighten up the lives of the workers who were looking 'quite miserable' on their way to work, and was a sparkling success. Rolling snow-capped hills, trees and a cute little cottage make up the Christmas scene created by Moose . One passer-by was delighted with the work, saying it was 'amazing' and 'a lovely addition to the South Bank' Moose hoped his masterpiece would brighten up 'miserable' people walking to work . In a part of London where creativity is embraced and renowned landmarks are found at every turn - including the London Eye, Waterloo Bridge, Royal Festival Hall and the Thames - his handiwork was certainly not  out of place. 'The moss and everything is coming straight off, and leaving a white, fluffy surface,' Moose said during his creative process. 'What a great thing to do with your afternoon, it's quite surreal really. 'It's been great for me. I've really enjoyed doing it. Regardless what [the toothbrush] does for teeth, it's incredible what it's done for the wall.'","Moose, aka Paul Curtis, used a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for artwork .

"Middle-class parents are to be forced to pay hundreds of pounds a year into pensions for their nannies. Tens of thousands of families will see the cost of their childcare rise by as much as £600 a year from 2015, it has emerged. Under the Government scheme, they will also have to fund pension contributions for cleaners, gardeners and home helps whose pay exceeds £9,440 a year. Squeezed middle: The cost of childcare could rise by as much as £600 a year for a family paying for a nanny as they are auto-enrolled in the new scheme . Parent groups say this will add to the burden on the already-squeezed middle, with mothers accusing the Government of treating parents ‘like a profitable business’. There are an estimated 111,484 nannies working in the UK, according to the National Careers Service. And soaring numbers of families employ domestic help, including cleaners and gardeners. More than six million people were employing domestic help in 2011, a rise of a million compared with a decade earlier. Now, under the Government’s auto-enrolment scheme – the biggest shake-up to pensions for a century – every employer will have the responsibility of enrolling their staff into a pension scheme. The rules, which came into force for big businesses last October and are gradually being extended to smaller firms, will see more than 11million workers enrolled into a company pension for the first time, with both employee and employer paying contributions, initially at 1 per cent. Empty pram: Parent groups such as Mumsnet say the enforced pension-enrollment will mean families will not be able to afford childcare . From as early as June 2015 it will be rolled out to those who might not consider themselves employers, such as families who take on help with cleaning, childcare or gardening. They will be legally bound to offer a pension to anyone aged over 22 but below the state pension age who they pay above the tax threshold – currently £9,440 a year. By the time the rules are fully implemented by 2018, contributions will rise to 3 per cent. For someone who employs a full-time nanny earning £25,000 a year, this would push up their childcare bill by £48 a month. Mumsnet . website founder Justine Roberts said childcare issues were an ‘enormous . problem’ and a rise in costs could prevent parents going back to work. ‘The high cost of childcare is one of the most frequent concerns of Mumsnet users,’ she said. Parents have been told by the head of Revenue and Customs to ‘get off their backsides’ and register for tax self-assessment. Lin Homer said hundreds of thousands of people could be caught out by the changes to child benefit. Families receiving the benefit where one person earns £50,000 or more are meant to register by today. Households where one person earns more than £60,000 will have to pay back all their child benefit in income tax if they have not already opted out of receiving it. Mrs Homer told Radio 5 Live: ‘We think there’s about 200,000 people who need to get off their backsides and do something.’ People who do not register could face fines of between 10 per cent and 100 per cent of the child benefit paid. However, it is unlikely that anyone who registers and pays the tax by January 31 will be penalised. ‘HMRC is committed to helping people pay the right amount of tax and urges parents who have been affected by the changes to child benefit to register for self-assessment,’ said Mrs Homer. She advised anyone unsure whether they are affected by the change to go to the HMRC website, adding: ‘We know that lots of people leave it until the last minute.’ Many of those affected had already opted out, she said. Anita Monteith, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, said: ‘This adds considerable complication to the tax system for ordinary people, particularly for those brought into the self-assessment system for the first time.’ TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said some parents who are not affected had still received letters from HMRC telling them to register. ‘The changes to child benefit are a mess,’ she said. ‘The coming requirement to contribute towards pension as well as to cover tax and National Insurance will only make it harder for parents. ‘On Mumsnet people often cite the cost as a barrier to returning to work – for many once you’ve paid tax and contributed to a pension it will simply not be worth it.’ There are also fears that many families will try to duck the extra payments by paying their nannies ‘under the table’ or making them self-employed. Dawn Kirenli, director of the Association of Professional Nannies, said: ‘We are already seeing a growing problem of parents trying to cut costs by paying nannies cash in hand or illegally forcing them to become self-employed. 'It is highly likely we will see those same people trying to get round the pensions changes as well.’ On Mumsnet, mothers attacked the new pension scheme. One wrote: ‘It will tip me over the edge and put one nanny out of work. ‘People will put their nanny on the books for some £500 per month, call her an au pair and then pay the rest in cash. Proper on-the-books nannies will become a privilege of the rich. Treating parents like a profitable business is outrageous.’ Tory MP Mark Field said: ‘£600 may not seem like a lot of money to some people but in hard-pressed families it could well be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. They may be forced to take on full-time childcare themselves.’ Colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has paid into a pension for his family’s nanny for years, said: ‘I imagine very few people are aware of the scheme.’ Some families could be forced to sack their nannies, he said. ‘It is a question of balancing between the need to provide for people in retirement and the need to provide now.’ As well as a financial strain, setting up a pension is likely to prove a time-consuming and laborious process for families with domestic help. First they must register with the Pensions Regulator and find out what date they need to comply with the rules by. Then they must find a scheme, open an account and write to their employee telling them they are going to be signed up. Failure to stick to the rules can result in penalties of up to £50 a day or even prosecution. Families who have employed their nanny prior to April 2012 will have to pay into the pension scheme from as early as June 2015. Those who have enlisted a nanny since then will not have to pay until 2017. Elaine Clarke, of tax consultancy Cheapaccounting, said: ‘I know it really sticks in people’s throats. We’ve got a pensions time-bomb ticking away and somebody has to pay for it.’ 'Automatic enrolment is the biggest change to the pensions system in a century - aimed at addressing a culture of serious under-saving for later life,' Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said. 'Over the next five years more than 1 million employers will provide their staff with the chance to save for their retirement, many for the first time. 'Nannies, as employees, will also be able to benefit from the reforms, and we would encourage families hiring them to look into how to prepare. 'Reliable and affordable childcare is vital for parents who want to stay in or return to work, which is why from 2015 the Government will introduce new tax free childcare which will be worth up to £1,200 per child annually.'","New Government scheme sees employees auto-enrolled on pension .

"Victims of 'revenge porn' - an act of posting sexually explicit images online without a person's permission - are pressing for a new law to make it illegal. Revenge porn is currently legal in every state but California and New Jersey, but an increasing number of states, including Maryland, Wisconsin and New York, are considering whether to make it illegal. Annmarie Chiarini, a single mother from Maryland, became a victim of revenge porn after her long-distance boyfriend was goading her to pose nude. Annmarie Chiarini poses in her home in Towson, Md. Chiarini got behind the cause after an ex-boyfriend took to the Internet to post nude images that she shared with him privately . The pictures would be for his eyes only, Chiarini, 42, recalls him saying, because she was so beautiful and because he missed her so much. He promised, she said, they would be stored on a compact disc and hidden in his drawer. Chiarini believed him — until they broke up and the CD was auctioned on eBay with a link emailed to her friends and family. Copies were later mailed to her son's Catholic school kindergarten teacher and the department head at the college where Chiarini taught English. Should 'revenge porn' be made illegal? Should 'revenge porn' be made illegal? Now share your opinion . The images eventually wound up on a pornographic video-sharing site, earning 4,000 views in less than two weeks. 'I was horrified,' said the single mom living in Towson, Maryland. 'The night he said he was going to do it, I called the police in an absolute panic and tried to explain what was going on. I said, 'He's threatening to put these pictures of me on an eBay auction,' and they (said), 'So?' Usually revenge porn is the result of a person sharing a sexually explicit photo or video with a partner, only to see those images pop up online months or even years later, typically after a bad breakup. Annmarie Chiarini speaks with a reporter after a news conference to announce a bill that would criminalize revenge porn . The images are often tied to the person's name, address and phone number. And in a particularly disturbing twist, some of the sites appear to be running side businesses offering 'reputation protection services': Dump $500 into a PayPal account and maybe they will take down your photo. As an increasing number of states,are considering whether to make it illegal, groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation say they worry such proposals run afoul of the First Amendment. 'We generally don't think that finding more ways to put people in prison for speech is a good thing,' said Adi Kamdar, an activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. 'A lot of times, these laws, if they aren't narrowly focused enough, they can be interpreted too broadly.' Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami who is helping states draft revenge porn laws, counters that sharing a nude picture with another person implies limited consent similar to other business transactions. 'If you give your credit card to a waiter, you aren't giving him permission to buy a yacht,' Franks said. The precise scope of the problem is unclear because many victims never come forward or are frequently turned away by the police. Annmarie Chiarini, from left, University of Maryland law professor Danielle Keats Citron and state Rep. Jon Cardin, D-Baltimore County, are silhouetted during a news conference on revenge porn . Two of the most popular revenge sites have gone dark in recent years amid hacking allegations and a class-action lawsuit. But advocates estimate there are dozens of other sites that continue to post pornographic images without that person's consent. Law enforcement officials have been stumped on how to respond. Website operators aren't liable for content provided by others, unless the images are child pornography. And anti-harassment and cyberstalking laws don't apply unless the ex-partner threatens the victim or attempts repeated contact. Chiarini says she remembers one police officer thumbing through a black book at his desk before finally shrugging his shoulders and telling her no crime had been committed.

Anti-harassment and cyberstalking laws don't apply unless the ex-partner threatens the victim or attempts repeated contact.

Suing for civil damages is another option, but that, means hefty legal bills and the risk of provoking an unstable ex-partner. Copyright protections, too, wouldn't help because she wasn't the one who took the photos. And even if she had, victim advocates say, most revenge sites routinely ignore 'take-down' infringement complaints, knowing that the victims can't go to the expense of pursuing further legal action. Suing for civil damages is another option, but that, too, means hefty legal bills and the risk of provoking an unstable ex-partner. Maryland Delegate Jon Cardin, who is running for the Democratic nomination to become state attorney general, is among the latest of several state legislators to propose a new revenge porn law. His proposal would make it a felony to intentionally distribute sexually explicit digital images of another person without consent, punishable by up to five years in jail and a $25,000 fine. The bill would exclude images deemed to have 'public importance', an exemption carved out in response to critics who say such laws would criminalize journalists who publish explicit photos. The legislation also wouldn't hold liable anyone who links to a revenge posting. Still absent from Cardin's list of vocal supporters is the ACLU. Its California office worked this fall to dilute similar legislation. That bill, signed last month by Gov. Jerry Brown, makes revenge porn a misdemeanor but contains a big loophole: It applies only to images captured by the partner, exempting self-portraits. Lee Rowland, an ACLU staff attorney in New York, says self-portraits create a more complex question on the expectation of privacy because the subject shared the image willingly. 'You, I think, could pretty easily understand how a law like that could in five minutes turn an entire class of high school seniors into felons,' said Rowland. Holly Jacobs, a Florida woman who founded EndRevengePorn.com after her own self-shots wound up online, along with her name, where she worked and details on her Ph.D program, says attempts to exempt 'selfies' from the law shows that most people still 'blame the victim'. She estimates that 80 per cent of the 1,000 victims of revenge porn who have contacted her in the past year took the images themselves. Rowland and Kamdar say they are sympathetic to victims like Jacobs and Chiarini. And there seems to be a question as to how far groups like the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation will go to fight revenge porn legislation; both acknowledged their groups haven't devoted the resources yet to carving out an official position or ensuring its involvement in the drafting of every new state proposal. 'We understand that revenge porn is destructive and that there are real victims from it and that to some extent existing laws either don't exist or aren't being enforced to address that problem,' said Rowland. But she added: 'I don't think we've been convinced that criminal laws, new nonviolent crimes, are necessary or necessarily effective in dealing with revenge porn.' As for Chiarini, she got lucky. Ebay and the video-sharing site that published her photos agreed to take them down immediately. Her son's school didn't kick out the family, although it insisted on keeping the disc of nude photos in a file. And Chiarini never lost her job. Chiarini has since been working with Jacobs' Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, an advocacy group that targets online harassment issues, to raise awareness and help other victims. 'I hit my low, now it's time to fight back,' said Chiarini. 'I don't want to feel that way ever again.'","Revenge porn is legal in every state but California and New Jersey .

"Dwayne Ward is sitting up in hospital after being stabbed 17 times during a holiday to Turkey . The father of a British teenager who was stabbed 17 times while on holiday in Turkey said his son is a 'man-and-a-half'. Dwayne Ward, 17, is recovering in hospital today after a five hour operation and a blood transfusion following the attack, in which he was stripped naked and left for dead. His father Wayne, 52, said his son has sat up in hospital and has refused to be broken by the ordeal. The builder said he was terrified his son would die but said he has shown the 'courage of 10 men'. He told The Sunday Mirror: 'I can't tell you how proud I am of him. You can't imagine what he's endured but it hasn't damaged his spirit. 'It’s me that keeps crying – it’s just so overwhelming what they did to him. ' Mr Ward, who flew out to his son's bedside on Friday, said the teenager has even asked for a McDonald's from hospital. Dwayne, from Middlesbrough, was found with his wrists slashed and his body soaked in blood in a garden in the Tepe district of Marmaris by locals. He had cuts to his throat, chest, groin, legs and back and had been stabbed in the chest, puncturing his lung. He had been enjoying a night out on Tuesday with his brother Darren, 32, at the resort's Bar Street the night before the attack when he bought a drink in exchange for a kiss from a barmaid. Dwayne's father Wayne has flown to his son's bedside and will join the teenager's brother Darren, left, and mother Doris, right . Dwayne's lung was punctured in the attack but his family say he is now stable at Marmaris state hospital (pictured) The brothers became separated and Dwayne said he was hit on the back of the head after leaving the bar but does not remember anything else. Two local men, Attila Dincer, 26, and a man named only as Ismail A, 24, have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and robbery. Dincer was arrested in the early hours of . Thursday morning and shortly after Ismail from Aksaray, was arrested on . a bus in Konya, 354 miles away. About 270 officers have been deployed on the case and they have trawled through footage from 217 CCTV cameras. Darren returned to the hotel alone but CCTV footage later showed Dwayne being . grabbed and bundled down an alley by at least two men in the early hours. Wayne Ward said his son does not remember the attack and hopes the memories do not return. Ismail A, 24, is one of two people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder . Attila Dincer has also been questioned by police in connection with the attack on Tuesday . Dwayne's mother Doris, 51, who had been on the holiday with her two sons, has been by his bedside since Tuesday. She said that when Dwayne regained consciousness he asked her if he was going to die. She told The Sun: 'We hope he never remembers. They left him for dead.' Speaking from the family home on Stockton Road, Middlesbrough, Dwayne's other brother Lewis said: 'It is a hard time for us all. We are just taking things day by day, step by step. He is stable.' Dwayne's uncle, Vincent Ward, said that the teenager had been moved out of intensive care and has been on his feet. Carolyn Ward, Dwayne's aunt, added: 'He is making quite considerable progress considering the level of violence he has suffered. 'The family are devastated and disgusted at what has happened. Dwayne, who was stripped naked and stabbed 17 times, was discovered by local residents in this public garden . 'He is a quiet and gentle lad. He had just started to come out of his shell and find his feet.' Dwayne was described by his brother Lewis as 'football fanatic'. Craig Higgins, manager of Stockton Town Under-18s, Dwayne's former team, said: 'The amount of texts we have had to ask how Dwayne is is staggering. 'This is a measure of the kind of lad he is. Everyone here is devastated. When he was with us he was a quiet and unassuming young man. 'He was a fantastic footballer and an advocate for the club.' Messages of support have also come in from Middlesbrough College where Dwayne is currently studying level two electrical engineering. Ian Smith, director of engineering and computing at the college, said: 'Everyone is hoping Dwayne makes a swift recovery. Our thoughts are with him and his family.' He added Dwayne was a very good student with a 'very good future ahead of him'.","Wayne Ward has flown to Marmaris in Turkey to be by son's bedside .

"Irish police spent £200,000 on a world wide appeal for her identity . An Australian woman who triggered a worldwide police appeal for her identity after she was found wandering the streets of Dublin has a previous conviction for deception in her native country, it was claimed today. Samantha Azzopardi was allegedly given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, last year after she illegally tried to claim social welfare benefit payments, according to the Irish Independent. The 25-year-old, who is believed to have up to 40 aliases, is currently being cared for by health professionals after she was discovered in a distressed state in the Irish capital a month ago. She spoke only broken English after being taken into care and communicated by drawing pictures - some of which led detectives to believe she may have been a sex trafficking victim. This later turned out to be false. At the High Court this afternoon, where it will be decided what steps to take next with Miss Azzopardi's care, it was heard that her 'life could be at risk' if she was released from the supervision of Ireland's Health Services (HSE). Mr Justice George Birmingham discharged the order allowing her to be detained under the Mental Health Act. But he put a stay on the discharge until tomorrow morning so other arrangements could be put in place. She was due to be assessed by a psychiatrist this afternoon, it was reported by the Irish Independent. Miss Azzopardi was originally believed to have been a European sex slave aged 14 to 16 because she spoke only broken English after being found in Dublin a month ago. However, it has now emerged she has family connections in Tipperary, where it is believed she was living with relatives for two months before she was found, and is not a victim of human trafficking. A source close to the investigation told the Irish Independent that she had been 'fretful of any engagement with officialdom' after she was found, adding: 'There is no doubt she has been the victim of some traumatic event of some sort.' Another source told the paper: 'She is very disturbed. 'It would appear there is something very serious going on here.' The investigation was hindered by her apparent refusal to speak to police and the HSE - her only form of communication being to write short notes in English. She also drew pictures of being brought to Ireland on a plane and of her lying on a bed with men, leading police to believe she was forced into prostitution. Identified: Irish police initially feared the girl was a victim of human trafficking but she is in fact a 25-year-old Australian woman who has apparent health problems . It is now thought she may be mentally unwell and had been 'play acting'. Reports in Australia say a member of the woman's family has now made contact with police in Dublin. The . Australian Federal Police are working with their Irish counterparts, . but have not confirmed reports on her identity, DNA tests or aliases. The breakthrough in the case, which . has involved 2,000 man hours and 115 separate lines of inquiry, came . after police released a picture of the woman which prompted a male . acquaintance who knows her family in Australia to come forward. She had refused to be pictured and it is believed the images were taken without her knowledge. A senior source said: 'We do not . believe she is a victim of human trafficking. She is Australian and . appears to be an adult, not a child. She is a vulnerable person and has . health issues.' The man who came forward, who is in . Ireland but not a blood relative of the woman, contacted police . yesterday following the massive public appeal and identified her. Mystery: The girl, named Samantha, was found on O'Connell Street in Dublin (above) on October 10 . After . all efforts to identify the teenager failed, police decided to issue an . international media appeal in a bid to identify her. Last . week, the case went to the High Court as police attempted to obtain . permission to release her photograph in order to try and identify her. After . the release of the pictures, there were hundreds of calls from all over . the world – some coming from frantic parents who believed the girl was . their missing child. As . part of their probe – codenamed Operation Shepherd – 15 possible names . were provided to investigators. But when these were fully checked, they . proved to be incorrect. The . investigation involved door-to-door inquiries, on-street vehicle and . pedestrian checkpoints near where the girl was discovered and CCTV . checks. Social youth workers and homeless services were also contacted. The . investigation team also contacted Interpol, the missing persons bureau, . the forensic science laboratory, the domestic violence and sexual . assault unit and national immigration authorities. Pictures . of the woman were distributed on the internal Garda computer system, . and checks were made at ports, airports and train stations. B&Bs and guesthouses in Dublin city centre were also checked. After . it was discovered that the young woman had braces on her teeth, . paediatric orthodontists around the country were contacted. However, this also proved a dead-end for investigators as no records of her having got the braces were uncovered.","Samantha Azzopardi 'given six-month suspended jail term in Australia'

"Only the brightest study at our elite universities… but if your name is Darcy or Percy, you have a natural advantage. A study showed yesterday that despite the dramatic changes in our lifestyles during the past 800 years, the same names have dominated the student rolls at Oxford and Cambridge over that time. Researchers found that there have been Darcys, Mandevilles, Percys and Montgomerys at the two universities for 27 generations, their prestige unbroken by historic upheavals and technological revolutions. The unchallenged status of great wealth has meant that the same names who were at the top of the social scale in the time of William the Conqueror remain among the elite now, the report said. Oozing class: It's no coincidence that Pride And Prejudice's Mr Darcy, played by Colin Firth, came from landed gentry. According to researchers from the London School of Economics, Darcy is one of many Norman names that continues to command wealth and power . What's in a name? Among the names of power is the surname of footballing brothers Gary, left, and Phil Neville . By contrast there are some family names whose bearers were poor 150 years ago who are still likely to remain outside the ranks of the wealthy. Among the poorer surnames - selected by researchers because they are relatively rare and the family line can more easily be traced - are Boorman, Cholmondley, Defoe, Goodhill, Ledwell, Rowthorn, Sidwells and Tonbridge. The researchers from the London School of Economics, Dr Neil Cummins and Professor Gregory Clark, said the name checks showed that social mobility in England is hardly greater than in medieval times, and that people inherited their social status even more than they inherit their height. The researchers from the London School of Economics used 800 years of history to compile their top and bottom ten, above . Dr Cummins said: ‘Just take the names of the Normans who conquered England nearly 1,000 years ago. Surnames such as Baskerville, Darcy, Mandeville and Montgomery are still over-represented at Oxbridge and also among elite occupations such as medicine, law and politics. ‘What is surprising is that between 1800 and 2011 there have been substantial institutional changes in England but no gain in rates of social mobility for society as a whole.’ The study comes at a time of widespread concern about social mobility as large-scale research suggests that those born to less well-off families have had less chance of success since the 1970s. Much of the blame has been pinned on the education system, with left-wingers attacking universities for failing to admit students from poor backgrounds, while right-wingers say the abolition of the grammar schools cut off the way up for working class children. The LSE research said that the spread of mass education over the past 150 years has done nothing to break the grip of the longstanding elite on positions of power, and that the same families have been on top despite centuries of religious reformation, civil war, industrial revolution, the growth of democracy and education, and the birth of the welfare state. Conventional estimates say it takes three to five generations for a wealthy family to fall to the middle ground and a poor family to rise to the same level. The researchers tested the idea by examining student rolls for Oxford and Cambridge universities going back to 1170, four years after the Norman Conquest. The two institutions were the only universities in England until 1832 and continue to accept only the best-qualified students. 'There has been modest improvement in social mobility rates between the medieval era and the modern world, with that change occurring around 1800,' the researchers said. But they added: 'The remarkable status persistence found using Oxbridge attendance as the status measure is found just as strongly with a more general and democratic measure of status such as asset ownership. 'Over the generations there were substantial increases in the rate of taxation of wealth and income, especially after 1910. Yet this did nothing to increase rates of wealth mobility.'","Prestige of Norman surnames has been unbroken for 27 generations .
Poorer names like Defoe, Ledwell and Rowthorne remained less fortunate .

"A former teacher at the exclusive Miss Porter's School, who is serving an 18-month sentence for sexually assaulting a female student, now faces more jail time for child porn. Married father-of-three Joseph Prem Rajkumar, 44, who taught physics at the Connecticut girls' school, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to one count of child pornography. The charge directly relates to his abuse of a 17-year-old girl at the school after he allegedly coerced her into creating a secret email account in  2011 and then pushed her to expose her breasts to him during video chats. Disgraced: Teacher Joseph Prem Rajkumar, 44, who is currently in state prison serving 18 months for the sexual assault of a student at the exclusive Miss Porter's, is facing more jail time over a child porn charge . A federal investigation discovered that Rajkumar sent and received messages with at least six female students at his school. He even tried to force another girl to have a sexual relationship with him, the Hartford Courant reported. He texted one girl that she 'looked hot' in the pants she was wearing and told another to create an email account, without using her name, to do 'naughty things'. The disgraced teacher is due back in court for sentencing on February 6 where he faces up to 20 years in prison. Rajkumar was sentenced to 18 months in prison and ten years on probation in January 2014 for the attack at the Farmington school. He must register as a sex offender for a decade after prison. Judge Joan Alexander told Rajkumar in January that as part of his probation, he could not teach or be near children under 16. The sentence will keep the sex offender away from his three children aged one, three and eight years old. His wife, Sarah Rajkumar, begged the judge not to register her husband as a sex offender but Judge Alexander said it was required by law. Mrs Rajkumar told the court in January that her husband was an 'exceptionally good man who made a grave error in judgment', adding that he had been overwhelmed by his responsibilities at the school and at home. Privileged: The elite Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut is a private boarding and day school for girls where tuition costs up to $52,000 each year . The victim was not in court for sentencing although her father was present. The judge praised the student for coming forward to report Rajkumar's attacks. Rajkumar who taught physics and coached soccer and track, was employed at the school in August 2009. He was fired on March 4, 2013 and charged on March 25 with two counts of felony second-degree sexual assault and one count of misdemeanor fourth-degree sexual assault. Police said the allegations dated back to 2010. The victim said that Rajkumar started groping her when she was 15 and that they had sex in his classroom closet and sent sexual videos to one another after she turned 17. The allegations came out after the former student, who is now in college, told her boyfriend who went to the police. The former student said that it had started when she was 15 and that Rajkumar would hug her and run his hands down her back when she was stressed about big tests. The girl told police that the situation developed and that she and Rajkumar had sex several times during some weeks. They had sex in a closet in his classroom. Miss Porter's is a girls-only, college preparatory school established in 1843. It is a small, private establishment with 306 girls currently enrolled. There are 52 teachers of which half live on the campus. The school takes pride in a vast array of extracurricular activities including 18 sports teams, dance and theater programs, pottery, painting and textile classes. Tuition for this year costs $52,475 for boarding students and $42,055 for girls who attend day classes. Miss Porter's was founded by education reformer Sarah Porter, who, in contrast to finishing schools of the day, insisted on a rigorous education for young women including chemistry, physiology, botany, geology, and astronomy in addition to the regular subjects of Latin, foreign languages, history and geography. The school is known for its close-knit community. According to the official website: 'Miss Porter's School educates young women to become informed, bold, resourceful and ethical global citizens. 'We expect our graduates to shape a changing world.' Former students include Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis who attended Miss Porter's from 1944 to 1947. Another notable alumna is Gloria Vanderbilt, a member of the legendary American dynasty and mother of CNN's Anderson Cooper. Other former students, who call themselves 'Ancients' include socialite and fashion designer Lilly Pulitzer.","Joseph Prem Rajkumar, 44, is serving 18 months of a suspended ten-year sentence in state prison .

"Scientists believe they have discovered a giant fish that grew up to 52ft long - longer than a double-decker bus. Fossils show the huge plankton-eating creature called Leedsichthys lived 160 million years ago but was wiped out at the same time as the dinosaurs. Researchers from the University of Bristol believe the bony fish could grow to around nine metres in 20 years but after 38 years it would reach 16.5 metres long, outgrowing today's whale sharks. Scientists believe they have discovered a giant fish which could grow up to 52ft long. Fossils show the huge plankton-eating creature called Leedsichthys, artist's impression pictured, lived 160 million years ago, but was wiped out by the same event that killed off dinosaurs . The name Leedsichthys means 'Leeds' fish', after the fossil collector Alfred Nicholson Leeds, who discovered it in 1886 near Peterborough, England. Leedsichthys was a filter-feeder that swam the Mesozoic seas for over . 100 million years, from the middle Jurassic until the end of the . Cretaceous period. The fossils discovered in the 19th Century were believed to be so fragmented that they were difficult to identify. This meant that researchers were unable to determine the fish's lenght. However, by piecing these samples together, the researchers from the University of Bristol have been able to tell how long the creature was by the position of its gills. The species was first discovered in 1886 by Alfred Nicholson Leeds. However, it was difficult to work out the fish's exact length because fossils . were only found in small fragments. The researchers have now been able . to piece samples together to tell how long the creature . was by the position of its gills. The creature is thought to have weighed 21.5 tonnes - the same as two double-decker buses or three African elephants. The fish, which would live for around 40 years, had an enormous mouth which acted as a hoover to suck up thousands of small fish including shrimps and jellyfish. Professor Jeff Liston of the University of Kunming in China and the University of Bristol's School of Earth Sciences said: 'Leedsichthys skeletons preserve poorly, often only as isolated fragments, so previous size estimates were largely historical arm-waving exercises. 'The existence of these large . suspension-feeding fish at this time is highly significant as it would . seem to be clear evidence of a major change in plankton populations in . the oceans of Jurassic Earth. 'This has implications for our . understanding of biological productivity in modern oceans and how that . productivity has changed over time. 'We looked at a wide range of . specimens, not just the bones but also their internal growth structures - . similar to the growth rings in trees - to get some idea about the ages . of these animals as well as their estimated sizes.' Researchers from the University of Bristol found the fish could grow to around nine metres in 20 years, but after 38 years it would reach 16.5 metres long, outgrowing today's whale sharks. The species was first discovered in 1886 by Alfred Nicholson Leeds . 'One of the truly fascinating aspects . of this fish as a suspension feeder is that it seems to have developed . a unique mesh structure on its gills to help it extract plankton as the . seawater passed through its mouth. 'Extremely delicate and rarely-preserved, it resembles the honeycomb pattern in a bee-hive. 'It functioned like a trawler's net . to trap plankton, and obviously was very effective, given the large . sizes this animal achieved. 'This mesh structure is very . different to what we see in today's suspension-feeding fish and whales. It had a unique way of solving a similar problem.' The longest living bony fish is the Oarfish which can . grow up to 17m in length (55ft).","The giant Leedsichthys fish lived 160 million years ago .

"Cars buried under feet of snow, canceled buses and icy sidewalks might be  things of the past in New York City. A report from the New York Panel on Climate Change found that a dramatic shift in temperature will make winters in the city resemble those of Birmingham, Alabama, by 2050. Say goodbye to snow atop the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center. Scroll down for video . Snow long: Climate researchers in New York said that winters in the city will look more like Alabama's by 2050, with a similar warming for summer . With an increase of around five degrees in the average temperature, the number of days where temperatures drop under 32 degrees will go from 72 to a range of 42 to 48. More worryingly, the temperature rise will push the number of days above 90 degrees to a range of 39 to 52 and increase the rate of heat waves. WNYC reports that with the increase in average temperature, the number of heat-related deaths is predicted to rise up to 500 percent if the city doesn't adapt. One brutal heat wave in Chicago in 1995 killed about 750, while a sweltering 2003 in France killed 15,000 people, most of whom were elderly. The transformation of the city to Alabama's milder winter weather will leave New York seeing much less snow but more precipitation. According to the Weather Channel, Alabama's average low currently never goes below freezing, and winter weather is extremely mild, even warm. Blaze: New York could get as hot as Birmingham, Alabama, though that won't stop the harsh winter predicted by Farmer's Almanac . Birmingham has never had a true white Christmas according to the National Weather Service - though in 2010 flurries and some slush fell over the city for a short period of time. Future spikes in temperature are not likely to keep this year from bringing another snowy winter. Farmer's Almanac has predicted that 'winter will bring a frosty bite' for much of the United States, making it possible that 2015 is a repeat of two years ago, when snowstorms pounded the Northeast. The nation has already experienced a snowy autumn, with areas of South Dakota setting a new record for earliest snow, and parts of the Rockies and Great Plains experiencing significant snowfall in September. The almanac's predictions can be dicey at best, and there is nothing suggesting extreme weather, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologist Anthony Artusa told CBS. NOAA's long-term forecast, which gives a three-month outlook, will be delivered later in October.","An increase in the average temperature of about five degrees will also raise how often and how long heat waves are in the city .

"DNA test show the seven-year-old is related to the Roma family after she was put into care on Monday . A blonde girl who was taken away from her Roma parents in Ireland was reunited with them last night after DNA tests proved she is their daughter. The seven-year-old was back with her family two days after ten officers stormed into her home in Dublin and removed her. Police took the drastic step after a member of the public expressed concern that a girl living in the end-of-terrace house bore no physical resemblance to her siblings. The tip-off from a neighbour was prompted by global coverage of the story of little Maria, who was found in Greece last week. Last night the Dublin girl’s 21-year-old sister said the family was ‘very excited to have her back’. At the family home in a south Dublin suburb she said: ‘During this ordeal I always knew that she was my sister and that my parents were her real mother and father. But the police didn’t believe us, so we’ve had to wait for DNA tests to prove it. ‘We haven’t seen her since she was taken on Monday, and the last time we saw her, she was very traumatised. This is the first time she has been without us and it has been very hard on the family. We’re just relieved she’s coming home and we’re going to have a big party to celebrate.’ In a separate incident it emerged yesterday that police removed a blond two-year-old boy from his Roma parents in Athlone, a town in the centre of Ireland, on Tuesday amid similar concerns over his appearance. They were reunited yesterday after the authorities were satisfied he is related to them. Senior detectives and health officials are facing allegations of incompetence and of racial profiling for sanctioning the removal of both children based on flimsy and unsubstantiated evidence. The housing estate where the seven-year-old lives in Tallaght, Dublin . Tallaght Garda station in Dublin where the blonde-haired, blue-eyed seven-year-old girl was taken before she was put into care . The seven-year-old girl’s ordeal . began when a member of the public wrote a message on the Facebook page . of Paul Connolly Investigates, a current affairs Irish TV programme. Police in Greece say they have arrested three Greek Roma people suspected of child abduction. Police say the suspects allegedly tried to register the two-and-a-half month old boy as their own, but raised suspicions because they lacked sufficient documentation. Regional police chief Panagiotis Kordonouris says the 19-year-old woman, her 21-year-old companion and his 51-year-old mother were arrested Wednesday at a Roma settlement outside the island capital of Mytilini. Kordonouris said they told police an unknown Roma woman gave them the baby in Athens. Last week, a Roma couple in the mainland town of Farsala was charged with abducting a girl known as 'Maria' found living with them. The author of the message made . reference to the case of Maria and added: ‘There is also a little girl . living in a Roma house and she is blonde and [has] blue eyes.’ The message then accused the Roma people of stealing children ‘to get child benefits in Europe’. Mr Connolly passed the message to the police. Yesterday the girl’s mother broke down in tears as she revealed her torment for the first time. The 35-year-old mother of six told the Daily Mail: ‘We all feel terrible . about what has happened. How would anybody feel if their child was . taken from them? This is a terrible thing to happen to us.’ Another of the girl’s sisters said: ‘The authorities have treated us very badly. This is racism.’ When asked why her sister had blonde hair and blue eyes, she said: ‘It’s . not usual, but it does happen that some of us will have blue eyes. 'I . used to be blonde when I was small and my mother used to be blonde. We have another child that has blue eyes. If you go to Romania, you will see other Romanians with blue eyes.’ Concern: The Dublin youngster was taken into care after officers called to a house in Tallaght (seen here in a general view)  in the south of the city, yesterday afternoon . A Roma family has described how they were left devastated as their crying toddler was taken from their home by Irish authorities. The blond and blue-eyed two-year-old boy, from Athlone in Ireland, has been reunited with his parents today after being put into State care over concerns about the little boy's appearance. His father said: 'I was upset, I just felt so sad - they took my baby.' Gardai were believed to be acting on concerns about the little boy's appearance, but were satisfied about his identity after carrying out inquiries. The boy spent a night in the care of the Health Service Executive. 'A guard knocked on my door on Tuesday night and told me he wanted to bring my son to the health centre,' the father said. 'I said, ""Why? Not a chance,"" but he said, ""Please, we just need to take a sample, and a swab from you and your partner"".' The father, who moved to Ireland with his extended family from Romania nearly a decade ago, said they had been living in Athlone for five years. He said his son had been born in nearby Ballinasloe. The father said neither he nor his family had heard about a seven-year-old girl who was taken from her home in Tallaght, Dublin because they do not watch Irish TV or listen to the news. The man and his partner stayed with their son while DNA samples were taken from all three at a health centre near their home, but the child was taken away at around 10pm on Tuesday. 'He was crying for his mother and we were both so worried, but they told us he would be safe,' the man said. 'That is all I care about. That he was okay.' The couple, who have another child, said she was confused and cried for her brother. The parents returned to the same health centre this afternoon where they were reunited with their child. The father said he was not angry with gardai - just glad to have his boy back home. The child's grandfather said: 'Imagine someone taking your wallet, or your coat or something like that, you worry about it. But for someone to take away a child, it is very bad.'

"To the wearer, they might be considered a brave, but stylish, garment. To everyone else, they scream awful. The red trouser - traditionally sported by the wealthy at high society events - has now infested the high street, with many a man squeezing themselves into the garment. Stars: Justin Bieber (left) and Star Trek actor Zachary Quinto (right) are among a number of celebrities who have been spotted out and about in red trousers . 'Yuk', 'odd' and 't***' were all words associated with gentlemen who dared to introduce a flash of scarlet into their wardrobe, according to a YouGov survey . And it would appear that although they may be popular with shoppers, they are widely considered a faux pas by the rest of society. A YouGov survey questioned Britons what they thought of men who donned the fiery-coloured trousers and the response showed a firm dislike from much of the population. The study said: 'Almost half of people in Britain (46 per cent) say they don’t like men wearing red trousers, including 24 per cent of the population who 'don’t like at all' red-trousered folk. 'In comparison, just 12 per cent of Britons think well of the gentlemen in red. 'More than four in ten (43 per cent), however, either don't know or don't care about the latest addition to the regular man's wardrobe.'

'Clown' and 'prat' were also used to describe the bold clothing choice, but 'cool' and 'nice' also flashed across people's minds when they spotted the eye-catching clothes, the study found. Should the sartorially-minded man refuse to bow to public pressure, he might want to consider wearing them in particular locations, if he wants to draw compliments and not catty comments. YouGov's study said: 'Although Londoners are just as likely as the nation as a whole to dislike red trousers, a fifth of Londoners (20 per cent) do like them, making people in London twice as red trouser-friendly as people from the Midlands and Wales (10 per cent) or Scotland (9 per cent).","Garment makes people think 'clown' and 'odd' YouGov survey found .

"It is set to be the ultimate mobile phone for the paranoid, able to keep your texts and pictures away from prying eyes. A Swiss firm today revealed plans for the 'world's most secure' mobile phone. Called the Blackphone, it runs a special version of Google's Android software designed to make privacy settings far easier to use. The blackphone will run special 'secure software' and its maker say it will be completely secure . Although the exact specs have not released, the firm says the handset will: . Make and receive secure phone calls . Exchange secure texts . Exchange and store secure files . Have secure video chat; browse privately . Anonymise your activity through a VPN .

"It is said that the course of true love never did run smooth – a problem experienced by many users of the dating app Tinder. It is currently easy to ‘swipe left’ and accidently reject a potential partner, without the ability to search and find them again. But this could be about to change with the roll-out of an ‘undo’ button, which Tinder will use to monetise missed connections by launching a premium paid-for version. Tinder (screenshots pictured) is rolling out an 'undo' button which will let users undo swipes - letting them revisit profiles that they may have accidentally rejected. The function is due to be rolled out in the UK and elsewhere, but will require a premium subscription to Tinder Plus, which could cost up to $20 (£12.50) a month . The current version of the free dating app allows users looking for love to swipe right to ‘like’ someone and left to pass. If both users like each other, they can chat and share photos with each other. Tinder sees more than 850 million swipes and more than 10 million matches made every single day, with 2 billion matches made to date - but so far has not monetised its app. This is set to change, because now the company, which is based in West Hollywood, California, plans on offering a premium subscription called Tinder Plus, which will first roll out in the UK, Brazil and Germany. Tinder has just rolled out a free function called 'Matches' (pictured) which allows users to share swipe-able photos  with all of your matches at once . CEO and President of Tinder, Sean Rad (who will be leaving the firm as CEO) told TechCrunch: ‘The most-requested feature we get is a button to go back and have a second chance with people that users swipe left on.’ A new version of the app will display a big yellow ‘undo’ button on the home screen, which members of Tinder Plus will be able to use, but regular users of the free version of the app will be able to see – in a bid to lure them into paying for the service. The app also plans on launching a button on its home screen called Passport, which will let users search for potential dates in extra locations. Currently, the app automatically searches within a certain distance from a user’s location, whereas Tinder Plus users will be able to toggle between different locations. The new feature could offer restaurant and sightseeing recommendations in a variety of locations. While this feature may well be used by well-travelled bachelors to plan holiday hook-ups, the company hopes it will be useful to people who travel frequently for work and hope to meet the love of their life. Mr Rad said: ‘We often hear that people want to be able to start swiping in a location before they’ve left to go on a trip or vacation…We also hear people saying that they want to get recommendations for places to go and where to eat in a new city and Tinder Plus can do better at that.’ There is no date when Tinder Plus will launch in the UK and the trial will only be available to around 40 per cent of users in the first instance. Tinder says this is because it is testing different prices to see whether 99cents (62p), $4.99 (£3.10), $9.99 (£6.30), or $19.99 (£12.50) will be the best fit for consumers. ‘We want to find that sweet spot that most users can agree on,’ Rad said. Tinder Plus will be the premium version of the free Tinder dating app. It will be rolled out in the UK, Brazil and Germany first on a trial basis. There is no set date for its launch, but in the beginning Tinder will charge differing amounts for the service to find its 'sweet spot'. Prices will range from 99cents (62p and £20 (£12.50), before a global rate is set. Tinder Plus will include an 'undo' button which will let its users undo their swipes - meaning they can revisit profiles they may have been too hasty to dismiss and swipe left. A 'Passport' button will also allow users to search for dates in extra locations. Currently, the app automatically searches within a certain distance from a user’s location, whereas Tinder Plus users will be able to toggle between different locations.","Tinder is set to monetise its app by launching a Tinder Plus subscription .

"Rake-thin: Unrecognisable in flat cap and jeans, rock star David Bowie steps out for lunch in New York . Late morning on a bustling pavement in one of Manhattan’s artier districts this week, a rake-thin man ambled along, a serene presence amid his frenetic surroundings. Wearing a flat cap, wraparound sunglasses, a tatty, grey hooded top and carrying his lunch in a paper bag, he went largely unnoticed by the moneyed shoppers browsing the windows of the art galleries that line the street. It is an anonymity that David Bowie has increasingly come to love. While it is six years since his last public performance, the once prolific star has apparently not written a song since 2003. Even more surprising, perhaps, his wife, Somali-born model Iman, recently let slip that Bowie has quietly dropped his famous adopted stage name in favour of the one he was born with — plain David Jones. Increasingly reclusive and consumed by a fear of flying that was only made worse by the 9/11 attacks on New York, the London-born singer now rarely leaves his adopted home city. His days revolve around the £4 million loft apartment in the trendy SoHo district, with its secure ‘panic room’ where his family can lock themselves should intruders break in. Bowie spends his time painting, drawing and reading, and other than when he’s walking his 11-year-old daughter, Alexandria, to her nearby school, emerges only infrequently. He turned down a plea to appear at the Olympics Closing Ceremony this year, despite his song Heroes becoming the Games’ unofficial anthem. Last month he made a rare public comment via Facebook to deny involvement in a retrospective of his clothes and memorabilia for a major exhibition at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London next spring. Bowie has offered the museum more than 60 iconic stage outfits, but curators of the much-vaunted show admit they have not even met him. Increasingly, he will leave his flat only to search for 20th-century art in local galleries, or browse the shelves of the nearby fashionable bookshop McNally Jackson. Change of style: Bowie, left, wearing a tatty, grey hooded top and wraparound sunglasses in New York last week and, right, as Ziggy Stardust in the Seventies . Low key: Since having surgery in 2004 after collapsing backstage at a gig due to a clogged artery, Bowie has stayed out of the spotlight . Blending in: Bowie was just one of the crowd as he walked unrecognised . No more Ziggy Stardust: Wearing a hooded sweatshirt, jeans, and a grey flat cap with sunglasses, the only hint of his once legendary dress sense was a zebra print scarf tied around his neck . Little wonder his closest associates now openly say Bowie has retired for good from a music world that still fetes him as one of its greatest and most individual talents. When the singer turned 65 in January, fans including Boy George and comedian David Baddiel joined an online forum begging him to make a long-awaited return. So far, the silence from Bowie has been deafening. The blog he once wrote on his personal website has not been updated since 2006.He was notably absent in March when a plaque was erected in London to honour Ziggy Stardust, his one-time musical alter ego. It marked 40 years since Bowie had posed outside 23 Heddon Street in Mayfair for the cover of his seminal concept album, The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars. Rarely seen: Bowie, pictured with a female companion in New York, turned down a plea to appear at the Olympics Closing Ceremony . Bowie turned down an offer to attend the ceremony, and it was left to another of his celebrity fans, Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet, to do the unveiling. Bowie’s biographer Paul Trynka told me: ‘Although my heart tells me David will be back, my head tells me he won’t, and I don’t think we will see him tour again. None of the musicians David worked with have heard from him. He feels he’s made his mark and he’s content with that.’ Others in the know agree. Recently, his long-time tour promoter John Giddings admitted he, too, believes Bowie will not make a return. Instead, Bowie — whose last album, Reality, came out nine years ago — seems to be content to see out his years in self-imposed obscurity. His exile, say those close to him, is to a large extent the result of his heart attack in Germany during his last tour in 2004. As he was rushed to hospital for emergency angioplasty, the tour was cancelled and another, planned for 2007, scrapped. Until his brush with death, Bowie, a long-time heavy smoker, insisted on a full English fry-up every weekend. Now his wife of 20 years, Iman, prepares him a fat-free Sunday brunch of egg-white omelette with shiitake mushrooms and steamed asparagus. And she told followers on Twitter earlier this year that she has replaced his favourite mashed potatoes with healthier — if less appetising — pureed cauliflower with non-fat sour cream. Naturally, he wants to be around to see his daughter, known as Lexi, grow up. Indeed, Iman paints an idyllic picture of their life at home in Manhattan and at their sprawling country estate in the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York. While she cooks, David jams on keyboards and drums with Lexi, helps his daughter with her homework and insists she reads for at least two hours every evening. Of course, a therapist might put Bowie’s all-consuming approach to fatherhood down to the mess he made of parenting his only other child, his son Zowie, from his volatile first marriage to Angie Barnett. Taxi for Bowie! The star hailed a cab to complete his journey . Dressed . down: Bowie kept his head down as he stepped out, wearing a casual . outfit of a hooded sweatshirt, jeans, flat cap and sunglasses . Successful: Bowie with his supermodel wife Iman. She runs a make-up and lifestyle company that turns over more than £15million a year . Angie was often consumed with jealous rages over his infidelities during their ‘open marriage’. They divorced in 1980, with the singer winning custody of Zowie. Single again, Bowie gradually turned into a skeletal junkie existing on a milk and cocaine diet. Increasingly paranoid because of his drug addiction, he began moving around the world — from Japan and Australia to Germany in a bid to escape his demons, often with his son in tow. In the early Eighties, he decamped to a house in Switzerland in an ultimately successful attempt to get clean — and had the number one hit Let’s Dance. But it was only when his hairdresser introduced him to the twice-divorced Iman that he was finally able to settle down. After their first date in Los Angeles, Bowie had her Paris hotel room filled with her favourite gardenias. They married in Switzerland in April 1992, and later moved to New York, from where Iman, now 57, runs a successful make-up and lifestyle company that turns over more than £15million a year. Recently, she said: ‘I am not married to David Bowie — I am married to David Jones. They are two totally different people.’ David Buckley, author of a major Bowie biography, told me: ‘Support from fans for a new tour would be huge, but maybe he feels he’s said it all. He missed out on Zowie’s life and wants to spend as much time as possible with Lexi.’ Bowie, it seems, is happy to spend his Golden Years far from the public gaze he once craved.","Rock star was spotted in a tatty hooded top in New York .

"A Czech killer was allowed to slip into Britain to carry out a series of sex attacks including a knifepoint rape. Until they caught Kajus Scuka, police did not even realise the 48-year-old was in the country. By then he had attacked three women and ambushed and raped a fourth while she was walking her dog. Jailed: Kajus Scuka, 48, who had served 11-and-a-half years of a 13 year sentence in his homeland . Sentencing Scuka to a minimum of 12 years yesterday, Judge Peter Kelson highlighted security flaws that had allowed a dangerous criminal to travel freely across the European Union. Only a week ago, Lady Justice Hallett questioned whether serious offenders were allowed to simply ‘walk into the country’ after Victor Akulic, a 44-year-old child rapist from Lithuania, was convicted of raping a woman in Kent. Judge Kelson said Scuka, who served 11 years for murdering his wife, also had convictions in his homeland for gross indecency, indecent assault and a brutal axe attack on a woman. Judge Peter Kelson told the defendant: 'It seems to me that even with your convictions for murder and assaults you were free to enjoy the same freedom of movement as any other European citizen' ‘It seems to me the case that even with your convictions for murder and assaults you were free to enjoy the same freedom of movement as any other European citizen,’ he added. Scuka arrived unchecked in the UK in 2009 after the biggest single EU expansion in its history allowed Eastern Europeans from eight former Soviet Bloc countries unfettered access to the UK labour market. Under the legislation, individuals can be denied entry and placed on a ‘watch list’ of criminals and terror suspects, but only if their country of origin tells UK border authorities they are dangerous. Despite his previous convictions Scuka, who stabbed his wife to death when she discovered he was cheating on her, appeared on no such list. His case will almost certainly heap further pressure on the Home Office to tighten checks on EU arrivals. Sheffield Crown Court was told that just months after arriving here Scuka committed the first of his sex attacks. In March 2010, he indecently assaulted a woman as she pushed her two-and-a-half-year-old granddaughter in a pram in Sheffield Lane Top. The second attack came a month later . when Scuka asked a 23-year-old for directions before throwing her to the . ground and saying in broken English: ‘I give you 30 quid.’ Two hours later Scuka raped his third . victim on playing fields. Scuka pushed her to the ground and ripped off . her clothes before raping her, said prosecutor Mike Smith. The woman told the court how a man . speaking broken English asked her for directions, knocked her into a . ditch and threatened her with a knife. Her ordeal ended only when her dog . jumped on her chest and Scuka fled. The final attack came last May when . Scuka targeted a student in her 20s as she walked through a park. He was arrested a few minutes later at his home just half a mile away. His DNA was found on the rape victim . while fibres from a hooded top he wore for the final attack were found . on his victim’s coat. Until then officers had failed to find a match for . it on their UK database and were in the process of searching . international records – a process that would have taken months. Scuka, who spoke through an interpreter for the court proceedings, was convicted by a jury of rape and three offences of sexual assault after a trial earlier this month. Detective Sergeant Ian Harding, of South Yorkshire Police, said: ‘It is a concern that people of this nature move freely about the EU without any restriction. ‘This man has been living in Sheffield since 2009 and we were not even aware of his presence.’ A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘We check all passengers entering the UK against watch lists but we rely on overseas police to inform us of conviction information, which did not happen in this case. ‘Had border staff been aware of these convictions we could have refused him entry and we will now seek to deport him following his custodial sentence.’ Many foreign nationals do not undergo rigorous background checks even after they have been arrested. Each year, around 30,000 pass through the criminal justice system without police exploring the full extent of their criminal pasts. By comparison, criminals from outside the EU who want to come to Britain must obtain a visa before entering – and are required to declare any previous convictions. Last year, Intars Pless, 34, a convicted axe killer from Latvia, was jailed for ten years for mowing down and killing a moped rider in Boston, Lincolnshire.","Kajus Scuka, 48, jailed for life yesterday with a minimum term of 12 years .

"Robin van Persie returns to Premier League action on Monday amid accusations that a bust-up with international strike partner Klaas-Jan Huntelaar could cost Holland a place at Euro 2016. That’s the view of former Dutch captain Ruud Gullit, who saw Van Persie and Huntelaar screaming at each other during the 3-1 qualifying win over Kazakhstan, Holland’s sole win so far between defeats by Czech Republic and Iceland. The two frontmen have rarely got on and no longer speak to each other.

That is according to Ruud Gullit, who says the bust-up could mean they don't make Euro 2016 . Van Gaal, who guided Holland to third place at last summer’s World Cup, made it clear to Huntelaar in Brazil that Van Persie was his first-choice striker and Gullit said: ‘Louis van Gaal got everyone quiet again and made the team work for Van Persie. All he wanted was other players to serve the right balls to Van Persie. 'With the help of Arjen Robben, who was brilliant, Holland got to third in the World Cup. But the problems have far from disappeared. Against Kazakhstan, Huntelaar was mouthing off again and the old confrontation with Van Persie came back to the surface.’ United fans must be praying that Van Persie’s Dutch feuds are forgotten now he has returned to his club and former national boss. There were rumours last season that Van Persie and David Moyes, Van Gaal’s predecessor, had a bust-up over the Scot’s training regime. After Moyes was sacked he made a point of thanking the United staff but not the players, who he felt let him down. Holland were beaten 2-0 by Iceland in their qualification campaign last week . Louis van Gaal built a team around Van Persie, somewhat neglecting Huntelaar . Van Gaal, meanwhile, has warned injured and suspended players they face a fight to win their places back. United beat Everton 2-1 before the international break without 10 players, including Michael Carrick, Phil Jones and Wayne Rooney. Some are available to return against West Brom, though Rooney is still serving a three-match ban, but Van Gaal warned: ‘Nobody is walking back in my team, believe me. You have to earn it on the training ground. Every player knows that.’","Ruud Gullit claims Robin van Persie and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar were screaming each other during qualifying win against Kazakhstan .

"Manchester City claimed second place from Southampton with a comfortable win at St Mary's. All three goals came in the second half, starting with Yaya Toure's deflected strike, then Frank Lampard off the bench and finally the unlikely source Gael Clichy, expertly played in by Sergio Aguero. Sportsmail's Neil Ashton was at St Mary's and rates all the players' performances. Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure celebrate Manchester City's first goal of three as they go second . SOUTHAMPTON . Fraser Forster: Unsighted when Yaya Toure shot from the edge of the area and most likely beaten by a deflection. No chance with the other two. 6 . Nathaniel Clyne: Attacking options restricted, he had his hands full keeping an eye on Samir Nasri. Another steady performance. 6 . Jose Fonte: Got away scott-free when he tripped Aguero inside the penalty area. Should have been penalty. Recovered. 6 . Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne lunges to challenge Manchester City's Samir Nasri at St Mary's . Toby Alderweireld: Moved into midfield at start of second half, speculative effort wide of Hart’s post. 6.5 . Ryan Bertrand: Southampton rely heavily on their two full backs to bomb on, but City strangle teams. 6 . Steven Davis: An influential and key member of this Saints team, full of running and bursts forward. 7 . Victor Wanyama: Booked for an early challenge. Southampton missed Jack Cork in the centre of midfield, they could have done with him here. 5 . Victor Wanyama tracks Yaya Toure as he struggles in the absence of Jack Cork . Morgan Schneiderlin: Ineffective for a change, possibly injured. Replaced by Yoshida at half-time. 5 . Dusan Tadic: Desperate to create an impression against the champions, provided the odd moment of inspiration. 6 . Graziano Pelle: Caught in a sandwich between Kompany and Mangala, found it difficult to create space. Strength and power is not the way to beat these two. 6 . Sadio Mane: Outstanding down the left, he was the biggest threat for Southampton in the first half. Subbed. 6 . Morgan Schneiderlin wasn't his self for Southampton and was replaced, likely injured, at half-time . Substitutes . Maya Yoshida (Schneiderlin 46) Came on at half time to play alongside Fonte, never got close to stopping either City goal. Not his fault. 6.5 . Shane Long (Mane 67): Worked hard, but Saints’ talisman could not come up with an equaliser. 6 . Emannuel Mayuka (Davis 82) Too little too late to make an impression. Saints were already 0-2 down. 6 . Subs: Kelvin Davis, Florin Gardos, Harrison Reed, Matt Targett. Manager - RONALD KOEMAN: Big test ahead for the Saints manager now. With City down to ten they conceded twice: Arsenal and Manchester United are up next.4 . Ronald Koeman's high-flying side conceded twice after Manchester City were reduced to 10 men . MANCHESTER CITY . Joe Hart: Looked like he was in for a busy afternoon after being bombarded with crosses. Dealt with them well. 7.5 . Pablo Zabaleta: Love his passion, love his tenacity, love his enthusiasm for the game. Narrowly beaten to MOTM award by Kompany. 7.5 . Vincent Kompany: Classy performance by the City defender. Far more composed and assured than his central defensive partner Mangala. Without him they cannot compete for title. Taken off injured a minute from time, which is a worry. 8 . Vincent Kompany is Sportsmail's star man for his composure at the back for City but worryingly limped off . Eliaquim Mangala: There should be an investigation by the Fraud Office into how this guy cost £32m. Unforgivable to pay this amount. It seems impossible on the evidence so far. Sent off. Dreadful. 1 . Gael Clichy: Couple of hoofed clearances in the second half under pressure; he’ s better than that. Otherwise steady and reliable, scored three minutes from time. 7.5 . Jesus Navas: Couple of nice slalom runs into Southampton’s half. Takes care of business when he is on the ball. Sacrificed for Demichelis. 7 . Fernandinho: Rugged, hardworking performance in the centre. Knew he would be in for a game from Steven Davis and he got one. 7.5 . Dreadful at St Mary's, Eliaquim Mangala (second right) is given just one out of 10 as his day is ended early . Mangala takes down Southampton striker Shane Long during his shocker at St Mary's . Yaya Toure: Appears disinterested during most games but is liable to set up or score the winner. Mobbed by team-mates when he scored the winner, says it all about his match-winning qualities. 7 . Samir Nasri: Lovely threaded ball for Jovetic in the first half, pace on it just right. Can make the impossible possible when he is in possession. 7 . Stevan Jovetic: Decent effort off the line by Alderweireld. Always going to be the fall guy and he was here. 6.5 . Sergio Aguero: Bizarrely booked for diving under Jose Fonte challenge when he actually should have won a penalty. Entitled to be infuriated. 7 . Sergio Aguero is fouled in the penalty area but his theatrics in going down saw him booked for diving . Substitutions . James Milner (Jovetic 55): Decent effort side footed over the cross bar after 64 minutes. Put in a shift as usual 7 . Frank Lampard (Nasri 65): Lampard wants to stay at City for the rest of the season and he will do. Scored a beaut to seal it. 7 . Martin Dimichelis (Navas 75): Brought on to steady the ship. Argeument he should have been on from the start. 6 . Frank Lampard laces his shot for City's second goal after coming off the bench in place of Samir Nasri . Subs not used: Willy Caballero, Bacary Sagna, Fernando, Jose Angel Pozo . Manager - Manuel Pellegrini: Calm and unflustered on the touchline, the champions did a number on Southampton here. 8 . Referee - Mike Jones: Disastrous start booking Aguero, but improved slightly. Got the bookings of Mangala in each half correct, which is saying something based on this dreadful performance. 6 . Referee Mike Jones chastises City boss Manuel Pellegrini on the sideline . MAN OF THE MATCH: VINCENT KOMPANY .","Eliaquim Mangala was dreadful for 1/10 and was sent off .

"More than half a century ago, Professor Stanley Milgram ran studies into how ordinary people can do extraordinary harm to others when asked to do so. His conclusion, which formed the basis of his research film Obedience, was that humans are programmed to obey orders, no matter how horrific. But now, new research suggests Professor Milgram was wrong - the participants didn’t act this way because they were inherently evil, instead their behaviour was influenced by the fact they believed they were contributing to science. Scroll down for video . During tests in 1961, Professor Stanley Milgram found ordinary people will do harm to others when following orders to do so (pictured). But now, new research suggests the findings were wrong; the participants didn’t act this way because they were evil, instead they were influenced by the fact they were contributing to science . This made their actions seem more moral and worthy, and they weren't just obeying orders, they were happy to do so - and may have acted differently outside of the lab environment. In his experiment, which took place at Yale University in 1961, Milgram asked volunteers to give what they thought were electric shocks of increasing strength to people who were trying but failing to learn a task. These ‘students’ were actors, but the volunteers believed the set up was genuine. In the best known variant of the study, two-thirds of people continued all the way up to the maximum 450 volt level. The studies have aroused furious controversy ever since, not only for their findings but for fears about the distress inflicted on those who participated. The research suggested that people will act in an evil way when they are obeying orders, and believe they won't be held responsible. This was an excuse used by Nazi soldiers during war crime trials, for example, when questioned about their behaviour - that they were only following orders.

These new understandings will contribute to a film called Shock Room, that is now in the final stages of post-production. The film begins where Milgram’s Obedience film ended. It explores how people make the choice to obey authority - but also when they choose to disobey. Professor Kathryn Millard said: ‘Milgram’s success comes down to the fact that he was a skilful dramatist as well as a psychologist. ‘Shock Room breaks open the Milgram ‘Obedience to Authority’ paradigm and re-evaluates its conclusions. ‘It tells a powerful new story about the dark side of human nature through a creative collaboration across art and science that has broad relevance for contemporary society.’","In 1963, Professor Stanley Milgram submitted a paper called Behavioural Study of Obedience .

"A goldfish feared dead after a horrific housefire has been found alive and well after nearly two years in an abandoned pond with no food or daylight. Smokey the fish was found by contractors who had been tasked with filling in the garden pond as part of the clean-up after the 2011 blaze in Harwich, Essex. Jackie and Billy Broadley lost all but the clothes on their . backs in the fire, which destroyed their and four neighbouring homes, and were delighted to find that one of their goldfish had made it to the . other side. Miracle fish: Owner Jackie Broadley thought Smokey had perished in the blaze, however the goldfish was found alive and well having survived 21 months without food and daylight . Despite spending 21 months underneath a thick plastic sheet with no fresh food, Smokey has grown from just one to three inches long, and has been returned to his delightful owners. Mr and Mrs Broadley thought they had lost all their precious goldfish in the December 2011 fire. Following the fire, Jackie's Koi carps, worth more than £3,000, were removed from the pond and had to be re-homed as the couple had no way of caring for them. Survivor Smokey has been returned to his owners . and although he no longer has a pond all to himself, he is now fed daily . in his cosy aerated tank. Experts have been stunned by the goldfish's survival and believe he may have gone into hibernation, using a tiny amount of energy to survive. Burning streets: The 2011 fire destroyed four homes on the Broadley's street in Essex, and left more than 20 people homeless . Shock find: The destruction on the Harwich street, pictured at the time of the blaze, saw Bill and Jackie Broadley empty their pond and re-homing their £3,000 worth of Koi fish - but Smokey was left behind . Something fishy: The pond, pictured with Smokey circled in red, was set to be emptied by contractors when the crew discovered the surviving lone goldfish . Jackie, 60, . said: ‘We thought we had caught all the fish from the pond - there was . only an inch of water left in there - so I was amazed when we were told . what had happened. ‘When I got the phone call to say there was a surviving fish from the old pond, I thought somebody was winding me up. Pleasant surprise: Jackie lost everything in the fire in 2011, and is happy to have been reunited with Smokey . ‘It’s . really nice to have Smokey as it was a horrible experience for us to . lose our house and have to re-home all our other fish.’ Jackie, a part-time cleaner, added: ‘It really has been a traumatic time since the fire - the blaze . ripped through the house so quickly you would not believe it and I lost . personal belongings that meant so much to me. ‘Getting . Smokey back has really lifted our spirits - I could not believe it when . I saw him. I think he must have survived on little insects and algae in . the pond.’ Her husband Billy, 71, a retired lorry driver, said: ‘It was a real surprise to hear that the goldfish had survived. ‘We had given away the other goldfish after the fire but now we got the call to say that Smokey had been found after all this time.’ Professor Matthew Gage, a biologist from the University of East Anglia, said Smokey’s story exemplified the remarkable survival instincts of fish. ‘Fish, especially cold water species like goldfish, are able to shut down physiological processes to a minimum and go into hibernation when they need no food. ‘They keep themselves on trickle charge by living off internal fat and protein reserves laid down during times of plenty.' And . an RSPCA spokeswoman said: ‘Fish require oxygen in the water to breathe . so it’s quite a surprise that Smokey has survived so long in a . covered-over pond with no obvious source of aeration. ‘However it may be that there was just enough in the water for him to survive until now. It’s . lucky that he has been found as it’s likely that the build-up of waste . products and carbon dioxide in a covered-over pond would eventually kill . a fish.’","Smokey the goldfish survived fire which destroyed four homes in 2011 .

"Sisters Charm and Brittani Niccole have both been given breast enhancements - by their plastic surgeon father. The girls, from fashionable Orange County in California, are walking advertisements for their famous plastic surgeon parent, Dr Michael Niccole. Brittani, 25, first had breast surgery as a gift for her 18th birthday when she went from an A cup to C.Then three years later Michael gave her a rhinoplasty for her 21st birthday, when he narrowed the bridge of her nose. Scroll down for video . Cosmetic Surgeon Dr Michael Niccole's adopted daughters Brittani (right) and Charm (left), posing in bikinis outside their father's practice on Newport Beach California . And shockingly, Charm first went under . Michael's knife at the tender age of ten when she had her protruding . belly button reshaped. This year she also opted for a breast augmentation to take her from 32B to 32C - and didn't have to look far for a surgeon. Charm, also 25, who works in . marketing said: 'Having surgery done by my dad makes sense - he's the . best at what he does and I know I'm in safe hands. Growing up in Orange County and seeing so many people having surgery, it never seemed like a big deal to me. 'Out here cosmetic surgery is a normal part of everyday life. Since I had my boob job all my friends tell me that I look great.' 'I . didn't want to go too big and I think this is my perfect size. You . might not even know I'd had them done if you didn't know me.' Both . women regularly have facial peels and Botox at their dad's clinic, . Cosmeticare Plastic Surgery Centre and Med Spa, to reduce the chances of . wrinkles. Cosmetic surgeon Dr Michael Niccole injecting his adopted daughter Charm in the forehead - both sisters, aged 25, regularly have Botox, which he administers himself . The sisters (Charm, left, Brittani, right), who were adopted by Michael . and wife Penny as babies, have attracted criticism about their decision . to cosmetically alter their appearance . Charm said: 'Every other month I'll get something done to my skin. ' 'I think Botox is important because it prevents you from getting wrinkles. I also get Botox in my armpits, which helps me stop sweating.' Unsurprisingly the sisters, who were adopted by Michael and wife Penny as babies, have attracted criticism about their decision to cosmetically alter their appearance. However, the girls say they have valid reasons for making the most of their dad's skills. Brittani, a make-up artist, said: 'I was totally flat chested so I just wanted to feel more comfortable in my own skin. 'When . I first told my parents I wanted my breasts done I was about 15. I knew . I had to wait until I was 18 but I was nagging them about it all the . time. 'When I . graduated high school Dad surprised me by saying, ""I've scheduled you in . to have your boobs done next week"". I was so excited. Mother Penny was initially opposed to her daughters going under the knife to alter their appearance . The pair act as ambassadors for their dad's work, and say more and more young women are approaching their father Michael for cosmetic work . 'It's the best thing I've ever done. I love my boobs now - they're perfect.' But for some people having an intimate cosmetic produce done by their dad is a little too close to home. 'When Brittani first told me she wanted to get implants I I . fought it for a long time. But she was so insistent that eventually I said ""okay show me your breasts"". Then I could see why she wanted implants' Brittani said: 'Some people say, ""Isn't it weird that your dad has seen your breasts?"" and I say no. 'First of all I'm his daughter and he's seen me naked when I was a baby, so really who cares?' 'Secondly, he sees thousands of boobs a year so a boob to him is just an object like a pen. It's just what he does.' And as ambassadors for their dad's work, more and more young women are approaching Michael for cosmetic work. Charm . said: 'Almost all of our friends have had procedures done by my dad, . whether that's boob jobs, liposuction, Botox or skin peels.

He admits: 'There are people that would critique me for doing a breast augmentation on my daughter at 18' Cosmetic Surgeon Dr Michael Niccole injecting his adopted daughter Brittani in the forehead. Brittani, 25, first had breast surgery for her 18th birthday and three years later got a new nose for her 21st birthday . 'If there are ten people in a room, nine out of the ten people have had something done by my dad. 'Random people even will find me on Facebook and will say, ""oh are you Dr. Niccole's daughter? I was thinking about getting this procedure done, can you help me?"". 'I give their information to a consultant. It's a family business so I'm contributing and so it's good.' However, not everyone was thrilled with the pair's enthusiasm for a quick fix. Penny was initially opposed to her daughters going under the knife to alter their appearance. She said: ""When Brittani first told me she wanted to get implants I I fought it for a long time. I said, ""no we're not doing this, this is not right"". 'But she was so insistent that eventually I said ""okay show me your breasts"". 'Then I could see why she wanted implants and realised it would be beneficial for her to get her breasts enlarged, so I agreed. Cosmetic Surgeon Dr Michael Niccole (centre left) with his adopted daughters Brittani (left) and Charm (right), and his wife Penny (centre right), at his practice Newport Beach California . 'Now I can see she's so much more confident and I think she looks great.' But when Brittani again turned to surgery a few years later to change her nose, Penny worried it was going to be a reoccurring trend. Penny explained: 'I didn't want them to think they could just turn to surgery every time they didn't like something about their appearance. 'And I worried that with it being so readily available they could become addicted to plastic surgery. 'I told Brittani she was beautiful the way she was - we always try to stress, beauty is within. 'I fought it for a long time but when I saw how much she hated her nose, I gave in again.' Last month Charm decided to have a breast augmentation after exercise had reduced the volume of her chest. She said: 'I work out like a fanatic and I noticed my breasts got a lot smaller and I lost a lot of the volume in them. 'Dad wouldn't do the surgery unless I convinced my mum, so when I convinced her I had to sit her down a couple of different times and really tell her that I was serious about it.' Despite continued criticism of their decision to have surgery, the sisters remain defiant. Charm says: 'Because of the criticism we have had for getting surgery done by our dad I realise people can be pretty ignorant' Now the sisters turn heads everywhere they go and are constantly recommending impressed women to their dad's clinic. Charm said: 'I went out to a restaurant the other night and started talking about the procedures and everything. 'My waiter actually wanted to come in to get Botox, so I took down her number and I booked her appointment to come in. CHARM . Breast enhancement . Botox (face and armpits) Tummy button tuck . BRITTANI . Breast enhancement . Botox . Rhinoplasty . 'In Orange County you are judged on your looks. there's just so much pressure on everyone to look perfect . 'If you go or a job interview in the beauty industry, obviously the person who is better looking is going to get the job - that's just how it is here.' But despite the continued criticism of their decision to have surgery, the sisters remain defiant. Charm said: 'Because of the criticism we have had for getting surgery done by our dad I realise people can be pretty ignorant. 'People should understand that we got procedures done because we didn't feel good about ourselves.' And Michael can't deny that his daughters polished appearance is good for business. He said: 'There are people that would critique me for doing a breast augmentation on my daughter at 18. 'But I've been doing surgery for 30 years and I wanted the best of care, which I feel I can deliver to my daughter. 'Nobody, nobody would treat my daughter the way I would. 'I don't think I influenced my daughters personally to have surgery, because we discourage it. 'But they have grown up in an environment of beauty. Our cars are always immaculate, our house is immaculate and all our friends are beautiful. 'You could say they were influenced by that environment. They understand the importance of looking and maintaining your beauty the rest of their lives . 'I felt very, very comfortable doing her surgery. And I would do it over again. 'The plastic surgical industry today is a thousand fold compared to when I first started. 'Before it was very hush-hush but these days people are having it and talking about it. 'People will come from all around the world to the United States to have cosmetic surgery.' 'You go to South America, you go to Argentina, I'll be you 50 per cent of the population have cosmetic surgery.'","Brittani had breast surgery as a gift from her father for her 18th birthday .

"President Barack Obama's hope of any movement on immigration reform in Congress died Tuesday night when House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost his Republican primary election. Canter will resign his leadership post as of July 31, sources said Wednesday. And with him out he way out, the GOP's future House leadership picture has been thrown into chaos. While political commentators and Democratic Party insiders have crowed that the populist right-wing tea party movement was on its last legs, the rumors of its death now appear to be greatly exaggerated. Not so, however, for the prospects of passing an immigration reform measure into law. Virginia voters dug a grave for the idea on Tuesday night and kicked Democrats into it. Cantor's appetite to inherit the gavel from House Speaker John Boehner was an open secret on Capitol Hill, and rumors have swirled about Boehner's desire to step down from that role. But with the seven-term congressman's unexpected loss to Dave Brat, an economics professor so obscure that his Wikipedia entry was just two lines long on Monday, the Republican House leadership sweepstakes is wide open. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Crushed: House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and his wife Diana left the stage in shock Tuesday night following his 56-44 loss to a political unknown who painted him as a fan of immigration 'amnesty' Upset: Dave Brat rejoiced wth hundreds of supporters after beating Cantor on Tuesday in the 7th Congressional District in Virginia, in a race that has revitalized tea party Republicans . And . less than 24 hours after the seismic shift in the GOP's power . structure, the party's congressmen and women will have a closed-door . meeting Wednesday afternoon to plan their next steps. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the Texan chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Wednesday that he is 'prayerfully' considering whether to run for Cantor's job inside the GOP caucus. 'I am humbled by the many people who have approached me about serving our Republican Conference in a different capacity in the future,' Hensarling told National Journal in a statement. 'There are many ways to advance the causes of freedom and free enterprise, and I am prayerfully considering the best way I can serve in those efforts.' Pete Sessions, another Texas Republican seen in tea party circles as far more moderate, is also considering a run. If Boehner should relinquish the speaker's gavel, Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan will be the front-runner, according to several House staffers with knowledge of discussions in the GOP caucus. Cantor lost, in part, because he backed modest reforms to America's immigration policies. But his political-neophyte opponent, economics professor Dave Brat, painted him as an high octane Obama-style 'amnesty' advocate. Cantor's zeal – and Obama's – to flood the U.S. with cheap labor from Mexico and Central America, Brat argued throughout the campaign, would depress wages for people in the district that stretches northwest from the state capitol of Richmond. The tactic worked far better than any political observers predicted. And now the White House's hope of congressional action on immigration this year is all but dead. Obama told a group of nurses on Monday. Alvin Viting, a 31-year-old registered nurse, told the Associated Press that the president said there was a 50-50 chance that the House would take action on immigration in the next month. But politicos in Washington were writing off any hope of that on Wednesday morning. 'I think that was probably true prior to last night,' one source who is close to the GOP leadership told MailOnline of Obama's prediction. 'And now I think that the odds of that happening are very, very low.' Another said in an email that 'immigration reform was never very likely anyway, but this was probably the [final] nail in the coffin.' No longer heir-apparent: Cantor (R) was expected to inherit the Speaker's gavel from John Boehner (L) if the Ohioan decided to step down from the most powerful role in the House . Immigration in the spotlight: Tens of thousands of Central American children have snuck into the U.S. this year without their parents, a crisis that has changed immigration reform from a political bargaining chip into a front-burner issue . Cantor would have been the Majority Leader in the House until January had he not resigned earlier today. A Capitol Hill insider with close ties to the leadership office told MailOnline that Cantor suddenly 'lost a lot of power' after last night's defeat, which would have made it hard for him to continue in a leadership role. 'My gosh, how is he going to get anyone to vote for this now?' the insider said, referring to immigration reform. A third source, a senior aide to a Republican senator, told MailOnline on Wednesday that GOP leaders on that side of the Capitol are 'actually relieved.' Senate Democrats passed Obama's preferred immigration bill in June 2013 with the help of 14 more moderate Republicans, but it 'left a sour taste in the conservative wing's mouth,' he said. 'Now everyone gets to take a deep breath, knowing that the whole thing is dead in the House. Until Cantor lost, that was an open question.' The Senate bill would give green cards – work permits – to illegal immigrants and start them on a lengthy 13-year path to citizenship. But that would only happen after the government deploys 20,000 additional border agents, mandates a system to prevent businesses from hiring unauthorized people and finishes a new 700-mile fence on the southern border. Senate Democrats are still hoping against hope that the legislation could get a hearing in the House. They're painting Cantor as an opponent of immigration reform, not as one of its champions – which is the image that earned him a crushing double-digit defeat on Tuesday. New York Sen. Chuck Schumer called Cantor the 'last major obstacle to immigration reform' on Wednesday, and warned on the Senate floor that the Republican party will lose control of the House if it doesn't come to heel. That possibility is near zero, however: The GOP is set to gain seats in November, and possibly retake the Senate from Schumer and his fellow Democrats. Cantor's district spanned urban Richmond and rural counties, areas where unemployment runs high and Dave Brat was able to argue that increased immigration would make jobs more scarce and depress wages . Senate left-wingers did have one reason to be hopeful on Tuesday, however: South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has earned the moniker 'Graham-nesty' for his support of some immigration reform planks, won his primary contest easily. But that was in a statewide race, a broader kind of contest that usually mutes the impact of the sort of grassroots organizers who doomed Cantor in his smaller district. 'Eric Cantor's loss tonight is an apocalyptic moment for the GOP establishment,' conservative icon Brent Bozell said. 'The grassroots is in revolt and marching.' Bozell is chairman of ForAmerica, an organization that has targeted moderate Republicans, including Cantor, and promoted more conservative candidates who are often tea party darlings. Still, the White House is casting Graham's victory as a sign that immigration reform advocates will ultimately have the upper hand in Congress. 'Cantor’s problem wasn't his position on immigration reform,' tweeter Obama senior aide Dan Pfeiffer. 'It was his lack of a position. Graham wrote and passed a bill and is winning big.' Speaker Boehner has never tipped his hand on the substance of immigration reform proposals, but he has said he favored holding a vote on the issue and mocked his fellow Republicans for their reluctance. 'Here's the attitude: ""Ohhhh. Don't make me do this. Ohhhh. This is too hard"",' Boehner told reporters in April, doing an impression of his Congressional caucus while squealing like a child.'We get elected to make choices. We get elected to solve problems and it's remarkable to me how many of my colleagues ... take the path of least resistance,' Boehner continued. Boehner has since reiterated that Obama's 'all or nothing' approach to immigration is off the table. Dave Brat, right, defeated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the Republican primary on Tuesday, marking one of the most improbable American political victories in the history of party primaries . In addition to the 'amnesty' albatross aroudn his neck, Cantor shot himself in the foot by ignoring the ordinary needs of his constituents, according to two Virginia Republican Party officials who spoke to MailOnline. 'He just wasn't around anymore, not since he took a leadership role in the House,' said one, jumping on the bash-Cantor bandwagon. 'He turned into a jet-setter, when what we needed was a handyman to fix normal stuff that middle-class people care about.' Playbook, the influential daily email service from Politico, noted a gossiped reaction of another knowledgeable insider: 'Cantor spent too much time on the road and in the Hamptons.' He also whiled away his afternoons in the K Street lobbying corridor, according to RedState.com editor Erik Erickson. 'Cantor's constituent services moved more toward focusing on running the Republican House majority than his congressional district,' Erickson wrote. 'K Street, the den of Washington lobbyists, became his chief constituency. ... He kept his attention off his district, constituents, and conservatives while he and his staff plotted to get the Speaker’s chair.'","House GOP calls emergency meeting for 4pm Wednesday to plot future without Eric Cantor .

"At the height of the war in Iraq, the US military required a prison camp to detain suspected jihadis not deemed dangerous enough to warrant being sent to Guantanamo Bay. The military wanted to contain the ongoing insurgency and decided to intern suspected opponents to the rebuilding of Iraq. Camp Bucca, in southern Iraq was home to more than 22,000 prisoners at its peak in 2007. It was where nine of the leading members of what would become ISIS would meet. Scroll down for video . Camp Bucca in southern Iraq, pictured, became ISIS's 'terror university' according to researchers . Between 2003 and 2009 more than 100,000 suspected jihadis passed through the internment camp . ISIS leaders radicalised illiterate detainees at the camp, converting them to their own brand of Jihad . Between 2003 and 2009 it is estimated that more than 100,000 men passed through the camp, many of whom left highly radicalised. During these years, the camp provided the leaders of the embryonic ISIS, the chance to form alliances with members of Saddam Hussein's ousted regime. The camp was divided along sectarian grounds and militants enforced their own sharia law, indoctrinating many of those who would later join ISIS. Among those held in Camp Bucca was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the current leader of ISIS. He was held in the camp 'for several years' before his release in 2009. Now, the US Department of Justice has sanctioned a $10 million bounty for information leading to the successful capture of al-Baghdadi. According to the Department of Justice: 'Abu Du’a, also known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is the senior leader of the terrorist organisation, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). 'Reflecting its greater regional ambitions, al-Qaida in Iraq changed its name in 2013 to ISIL and stepped up its attacks across Syria and Iraq. 'ISIL attacks are calculated, coordinated, and part of a strategic campaign. Abu Du’a is in charge of overseeing all operations and is currently based in Syria. The US Department of Justice has a $10 million reward out on al-Baghdadi despite releasing him in 2009 . Camp Bucca, left, was opened in 2003 and was eventually closed in December 2009 when the final detainees were released including the current head of ISIS,  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, right, who was held for five years . The US Department of Justice has offered $10 million for the capture of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, pictured . 'Abu Du’a has taken personal credit for a series of terrorist attacks in Iraq since 2011 and claimed credit for the June 2013 operations against the Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad, the March 2013 suicide bombing assault on the Ministry of Justice, among other attacks against Iraqi Security Forces and Iraqi citizens going about their daily lives. 'Abu Du’a is a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under Executive Order 13224. He is also listed at the United Nations Security Council 1267/1989 al-Qaida Sanctions Committee.' In June, al-Baghdadi said he wanted to create a 'caliph for the Muslims everywhere,' essentially claiming the entire world for ISIS. Al-Baghdadi's deputy Abu Muslim al-Turkmani was also held in Camp Bucca along with Abu Qasim, who is responsible for the terror organisation's growing band of foreign fighters. The US military used the camp to detain suspected fighters but not worth sending to Guantanamo Bay . ISIS recruited thousands of fighters while under the guard of the US military in Camp Bucca, southern Iraq . Terrorism researchers believe that ISIS leaders used their time inside to make contacts with fellow fighters . Terrorism researchers the Soufan Group, estimates that nine of ISIS's top leaders all spent time interned at Camp Bucca, where they were able to establish contacts and organise the future insurgency. In an editorial in the New York Times last month, Andrew Thompson and Jeremi Suri claimed the US made significant mistakes in the way it used Camp Bucca. He said: 'Before their detention, al-Baghdadi and others were violent radicals, intent on attacking America. Their time in prison deepened their extremism and gave them opportunities to broaden their following. 'At Camp Bucca, for example, the most radical figures were held alongside less threatening individuals, some of whom were not guilty of any violent crime. Coalition prisons became recruitment centres and training grounds for the terrorists the United States is now fighting.' Thompson and Suri added: 'At Camp Bucca, the extremists forced moderate detainees to listen to clerics who advocated jihad. The majority of prisoners were illiterate, so they were particularly susceptible. Prisoners frequently refused medical attention and vocational training for fear of breaking religious rules. The prisons became virtual terrorist universities: The hardened radicals were the professors, the other detainees were the students, and the prison authorities played the role of absent custodian.' When Camp Bucca closed in December 2009, US officials were unaware of the danger posed by the likes of al-Baghdadi and his fellow ISIS leaders, leading to many of today's problems. Inside Camp Bucca, prisoners where allowed to hold discussions on Islam with each other, which have now been blamed on allowing illiterate detainees to be radicalised. After it was closed, the camp was used as a secure hotel for foreign businessmen looking to invest in Iraq, where they were charged $200-a-night. After its closure in 2010, Camp Bucca was turned into a hotel for foreign businessmen at a rate of $200 a night .","ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi spent five years in custody in Camp Bucca .

"The family of a 48-year-old man have told how they rescued him from dying on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway by reviving him with drops of water. Andy Flanagan’s family were told that he was severely brain damaged, had organ failure and was close to death after a cardiac arrest. They gathered at his bedside to say their goodbyes after the hospital withdrew fluids and said it was going to let him ‘slip away’. Told he was dying: The family of Andy Flanagan (pictured with daughter Andi-Jo) were told he was severely brain damaged, had organ failure and close to death after a cardiac arrest but they rescued him from dying after he showed signs that he had not had severe brain damage . But when Mr Flanagan’s sister, who is a nurse, gently moved him to change his bloodstained sheets, he started to murmur words, showing signs that he had not suffered severe brain damage. Then, as she cleaned his face with a wet cloth, he desperately tried to suck in the moisture. The family continued their vigil at his bedside around the clock, concerned that doctors did not want to keep the patient alive. Every ten minutes they gave him drops of water that helped him start to come round before doctors eventually agreed to put him back on a drip. Mr Flanagan recovered and returned home. He lived for another month and was able to properly say farewell to his loved ones. His sisters last night called the Liverpool Care Pathway a ‘licence to kill’. It can involve withdrawing treatment and the heavy sedation of a patient and removal of tubes providing food and fluid in the last 24 hours of their life. 'Insidious': Sister Lesley Flanagan called the Liverpool Care Pathway a 'licence to kill' Devised in the 1990s as a means of easing pain for the dying, it has been in widespread use in the NHS in recent years. However, . critics claim it is increasingly being applied to patients without . their families’ knowledge and when they still have a chance of recovery. Lesley Flanagan, 53, last night said her brother had been put on the Pathway, which she describes as ‘insidious and a licence to kill’, long before he was ‘ready to go’. She said the hospital had chosen to ‘give up’ on Mr Flanagan,  a father of five and grandfather  of two who had been a carpenter. Mr Flanagan, who was suffering from pancreatic cancer, was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn in the early hours of June 19 after he had a cardiac arrest. When Miss Flanagan arrived at the hospital she was told that he was very ill, that his organs were shutting down and that they had taken all of the tubes from him. She said: ‘They told us that he had not got long to live and that the kindest thing to do would be to let him slip away. We did not know that they had instituted the Liverpool Care Pathway. ‘They mentioned something about a care pathway, but we didn’t perceive for a second that it was a way to kill people. ‘In the evening my sister, who is a qualified nurse, arrived from Stockton. She was angry because no one had taken care of his basic needs. The bed he was in was dirty and covered with blood. ‘She asked if she could change the sheets and when she asked Andy questions, such as if they could roll him on his side, he replied with “yes” and started to open his eyes. ‘That is when she began to suspect he had not been brain damaged. When she used a wet cloth to clean his face he tried to suck the moisture. We started to give him water from pipettes ourselves and he gradually became more awake. But we still had to campaign for the doctors to put him back on a drip.’ The family also found Mr Flanagan’s medical notes were marked with ‘do not resuscitate’, despite this never being discussed with them. Miss Flanagan added: ‘We stayed with him around the clock, because we were scared they were going to try to kill him again. Admitted: Mr Flanagan, who was suffering from pancreatic cancer, was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital (pictured) after he had a cardiac arrest . ‘He was terrified of the doctors and at one point told his consultant himself, “you tried to kill me and told my family that I wanted to die”. He went home at the end of June and lived for another month until July 25.’ Mr Flanagan’s other sister Kathy Flanagan, 57, who has worked as a nurse for 39 years, said: ‘We had another five weeks with our brother – that time was very important for us and everyone else in the family. ‘Even when Andy had started to come round we had to beg the doctor to put him back on a drip and he told us that our brother did not like needles and that he was sure that he wouldn’t want to be put back on a drip. ‘I think it’s very difficult for relatives to comprehend what’s going on when they’re in state of shock, grieving and hurting. People just listen to doctors and respect them and I’m not saying perhaps at the very end that it might not be appropriate, but who knows when that end stage is.’ Last night a hospital spokesman said: ‘This case is subject to an official complaint and we are unable to comment at this time.’","Andy Flanagan was rescued from dying on debated Liverpool Care Pathway .

"Morbidly obese workers should be treated as ‘disabled’ by their bosses, one of Europe’s top lawyers ruled yesterday. Niilo Jaaskinen, Advocate General at the European Court of Justice, said that ‘extreme, severe or morbid’ obesity prevents staff from a full ‘participation in professional life’. Mr Jaaskinen’s ruling on a test case at the Luxembourg court could lead to bosses across Europe – including in Britain – being banned from discriminating against fat employees. Controversial: Niilo Jaaskinen (left), Advocate General at the European Court of Justice, said that 'extreme, severe or morbid' obesity prevents staff from a full 'participation in professional life' (file picture right) The Advocate General was asked to rule on a case brought by 25st child-minder Karsten Kaltoft, who was sacked by a local authority in Denmark for being unable to perform basic duties due to his size. The council, Billund Kommune, claimed the child-minder was so fat that he required help from a colleague to tie up children’s shoelaces. Mr Jaaskinen found EU law does not prohibit discrimination specifically on the grounds of obesity. But he said those with extreme obesity, classified as having a body mass index (BMI) of more than 40, could be considered disabled. A healthy BMI score, which is based on weight and height, is between 18 and 25. He said: ‘If obesity has reached such a degree that it plainly hinders participation in professional life, then this can be a disability.’ He added that just because obesity is ‘self-inflicted’ it is not any less worthy of being classed as a ‘disability’ than other afflictions. Although his judgment is not binding, it will be used by the ECJ as a basis for deciding whether Mr Kaltoft’s obesity is a disability under EU law, and whether his employer was guilty of discrimination by dismissing him. And if the ECJ stick to Mr Jaaskinen’s ruling, it could result in widespread changes to workplace disability laws. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘If this opinion becomes the Court’s ruling, then the law is either an ass or barking mad. To give morbidly obese people the right to sue their employers if they become so fat that they cannot do the job they have signed up to do is beyond belief. The mind boggles as to the likely cost to employers if the Court decides to accept this opinion.’ Decision: Jaaskinen ruled on a case involving 25-stone child-minder Karsten Kaltof, who was sacked by a local council in Denmark because he was unable to perform 'basic duties' Glenn Hayes, an employment law expert at Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘It will be interesting to see how the UK courts interpret this opinion as it seems to take us a little further down the road to obesity being recognised as a disability. ‘If being obese means that an individual cannot perform the essential duties of their role and this condition is likely to be long-term, then the duty to make reasonable adjustments probably kicks in, even if there is no underlying cause or illness. ‘This could mean that employers could find themselves under a legal obligation to make adjustments such as providing car park spaces close to the workplace entrance for obese employees, providing special desks ... or possibly even ensuring that healthy meal options are provided at their staff canteen. ‘Employers will certainly be looking at this opinion closely because the repercussions could be significant.’","Niilo Jaaskinen said the obese cannot participate fully in professional life .

"Where the running of Rangers is concerned, dignity often appears to be in shorter supply than common sense. Brace yourselves, then, for an intensification of the slanderously sleekit whispering campaign under which Ally McCoist has laboured for so long. Guilty of being not quite as good a manager as he is a human being, the man whose major crime is one committed by thousands of head coaches around the world every season is about to be targeted by an immense volley of slippery slings and accusatory arrows. Ally McCoist walks away after Rangers suffered defeat against Queen of the South on Friday night . He’s going, rightly and not before time. A man from a different era, he was never suited to the new realities of managing Rangers in their current incarnation and reduced circumstances. But just walking away will never be enough for some. Before McCoist exits, even those who once sang his praises to the high heavens will be encouraged to join in the personal vilification of their former favourite. And, following the logic that the biggest lies are the easiest to sell, it will even be argued that McCoist — a man who shouldered such an enormous burden at a time of huge crisis, suffering every step of the way during the darkest days — no longer cares if the club, his club, is pushed to the brink of extinction. We have surely all heard the nonsense before. Aye, he has taken more money out of Rangers in recent years than anybody. Piffle. The Rangers boss is going, and not before time, but he should not be blamed for the club's woes . This is the best I can do… . The absolute assertion that his demand for compensation risks plunging the club into insolvency, meanwhile, is akin to blaming the bill from the newsagents for bringing the walls of Craig Whyte’s fantasy world tumbling down in 2012. The departure of a manager — especially one who has failed to live up to expectations — is never entirely without enmity. Even those ‘mutual-consent’ deals that come complete with confidentiality clauses can’t stop ‘friends’ or ‘insiders’ from throwing mud, often while ensuring their own hands remain clean. It is obvious, moreover, that McCoist has long since outlived his usefulness at the club he has served as player, assistant manager and now manager. Anyone asked to give a class on how to get sacked in football should make his case study required reading. Rangers fans have stood by their manager in the past, and they will not be diverted by this sideshow . But spare us please, the nonsense spouted about him having personally inflicted incomparable damage to a club that has been pillaged by some of the worst corporate vandals the game has ever known. A support taken for granted, fleeced for every penny — and not even entrusted with the identity of some of the shadowy investors who own large chunks of their club — are smarter than to be diverted by this sideshow ahead of next Monday’s Annual General Meeting. Tens of millions of pounds have gone. Even at the most inflated estimation of his salary, McCoist hasn’t approached that kind of recompense for his efforts. As for the argument that his spending on the squad contributed to that amount, well, just do the maths; player salaries make up only a tiny slice of recent overall losses. McCoist (second right) has served Rangers loyally as a player and manager, but has now outlived his use . And, as he has pointed out, the football budget was set by others much further up the food chain. What was he supposed to do, when assured by a series of directors and chief executives that he had X amount to spend on the team? Sit on the cash and then be accused of Arsene Wenger-like parsimony? He spent badly, sure. Criticise him for signing top-flight players and transforming them into lower-league cloggers, if you wish. But never was he given any indication that signing guys on high wages — all agreed by people chasing their next boardroom bonus, it seems — would imperil the very future of the club. Gavin Reilly scores the second goal as Rangers suffered a 2-0 defeat on Friday night at Queen of the South . It’s counter-intuitive to think that a man so visibly pained by what was done to his club would even contemplate imperilling the rebirth and rebuilding that has come at such a hefty cost. Yet the timing and terms of his departure will occupy the thoughts of all in the Rangers family over the coming days, the small matter of the club needing £8million just to reach the end of the financial year allowed to fade in the background for a little while. Then there will be the race for a replacement, the grand unveiling and early rallying of the troops. All useful stuff for those who like to do their best work in the shadows.","Ally McCoist is only guilty of being a worse manager than he is a person .
McCoist has Rangers' best interests at heart .
Poor signings have cost the club, but are not the reason for financial ruin ."

Scroll down for video . Jun Lin, left, broke up with his former boyfriend Feng Lin before starting a relationship with Luka Magnotta, right, who has admitted killing and dismembering the Chinese student but denies murder due to mental illness . Police investigating the crime scene discovered dried blood stains inside the Montreal apartment's fridge . The jury was shown a photograph of an angle grinder, pictured,  found by police at the murder scene . Canadian Luka Magnotta, 32, has admitted killing and dismembering Jun Lin's body while filming the act before sending body parts in the post to schools and two political parties. He is pleading not guilty to murder due to mental illness. Jurors were shown a series of graphic crime scene photographs as well as weapons used to dismember the victim's body. Magnotta also left behind a note taunting his victim: 'Roses are red. Violets are blue. The police will need dental records to identify you.' Police attending the crime scene in Montreal discovered an angle grinder and ice pick. Blood was found in the fridge, on a mattress, in cupboards and in the bath. Magnotta filmed the crime and uploaded it onto the internet before fleeing Montreal for Berlin. It is reported the video shows Magnotta eating Lin with a knife and fork. Investigators found part of the victim's body in a bin bag along with a dead dog. Magnotta used pink tissue paper to wrap up the body parts he sent to schools and even to the Canadian prime minister. A claw hammer, pictured,  was also recovered from the scene of the murder and shown to the jury . The jury was also shown a heavily blood-stained mattress that was discovered at the crime scene . The court was shown several interior photographs of the apartment where Jun Lin was killed in 2012 . The prosecution claims Magnotta planned the killing for six months before the 2012 crime, emailing a British journalist in 2011 saying he was going to kill a human being and videotape the act. Canadian cannibal victim Jun Lin, also known as Justin, broke up with his boyfriend Feng Lin just weeks before he was killed by Luka Magnotta, a court in Quebec has heard. Jun Lin, 33, told Feng Lin, 35, that he was being pressurised by his parents in China to settle down with a woman and get married. Feng Lin, speaking through an interpreter, told the court that despite breaking up with Jun Lin, the pair exchanged 40 to 50 text messages a day. The jury was also shown a photograph of a heavily stained white tee shirt found at the crime scene . Police found a number of knives and protective Nitrile gloves while searching the crime scene . Police investigating the murder discovered this note that they claim was written by Magnotta . He told the court that he had cut short a trip to Montreal when his former boyfriend stopped returning his texts when he received a phone call from a friend of Jun Lin's who told him about the murder. He said: 'It was only after my arrival in Montreal that I looked at the first part of the video. I don't know how long I watched, probably several minutes. The prosecutor said the jury will see the video allegedly made by Magnotta that shows the killing taking place in Magnotta's apartment. Another photograph of a knife was entered into evidence during the high profile Canadian murder trial . Jurors were shown pieces of pink tissue paper which Magnotta used to wrap up Lin's body parts . Feng Lin said he contacted the police because the man he saw in the video was not Jun Lin. The court has been told that an unidentified man appeared early in the video, alive but bound and naked on a bed in Magnotta's apartment. The rest of the video shows Lin's dead body on the same bed, the prosecutor said. Magnotta's lawyer, Luc Leclair, says he is not criminally responsible for the crime because he is mentally ill. Feng Lin said he and Jun Lin met in Beijing in 2009 and became lovers in Shanghai and then in Montreal, where they both attended university, but the relationship ended in May 2012. 'He (Jun Lin) was facing some pressure from the family. His parents were not aware that he was gay. He was trying to date a girl,' Feng Lin told the court. Defense lawyer Luc Leclair said that his client is not guilty of murder and is instead suffering a mental illness . The court heard from the victim's former lover Feng Lin who said they broke up a few weeks before the murder . Feng Lin said the Chinese engineering student moved out and was sharing an apartment with a male roommate after Feng Lin left for China. Feng Lin said he was not aware if Jun Lin - who called himself Justin in Canada - had a relationship with another man. Leclair said: 'I am suggesting that there are many things you did not know about Justin.' Earlier on Wednesday, Leclair showed jurors boxes that had been used to send gift-wrapped packages with parts of Jun Lin's body and menacing notes to two Vancouver elementary schools and two political parties in Ottawa. One of the boxes appeared to have a blood stain on it. The trial continues.

"The ugly family feud surrounding radio legend Casey Kasem who died last Sunday was put on a temporary hold as his daughter Kerri agreed that widow Jean could claim his body. But behind the scenes, the battle wages on with Kerri's team accusing her stepmom, Jean, of cheating on her father with a much younger man as he lay on his deathbed. 'Jean has a boyfriend and Kerri believes their affair has been going on for at least two years,' Kerri’s private investigator, Logan Clarke, told the MailOnline in an exclusive interview. 'Jean has even moved him into the oceanfront condo she owns in Malibu.' Battle of wills: Casey Kasem's widow Jean and his daughter Kerri have been engaged in a tug of war over Casey - his care and his money - for years. Kerry's PI is claiming that Jean was having an affair behind his back . Top 40 king: Radio personality Casey Kasem died on Father's Day, finally succumbing to Lewy body disease, the most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer's . A neighbor at the luxury, 10-unit building overlooking the Pacific confirmed that a man named John Paul (JP) Gressy is now living in the 450 square-foot condo that the Kasems have owned for many years. A maid who answered the door to the Kasems' condo also confirmed that Gressy lives there. It's not clear if Gressy is the man Kerri Kasem has accused of being involved with Jean. Neither Jean Kasem's representative nor Paul Gressy returned calls to MailOnline. Clarke described the alleged boyfriiend as tall, handsome, dark-haired man about 40 years junior to Casey, who was 82 when he died after battling  Lewy body disease, the most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer's. One of Kerri’s Los Angeles lawyers, Troy L. Martin, also made reference to Jean’s alleged extra-marital activities, writing in court papers dated March 19 this year: 'Mrs. Kasem has been lying to Mr. Kasem for at least two years, telling him that they are divorced.  What possible motive could Mrs. Kasem have for such cruelty. 'Perhaps the younger gentleman that is staying at the Malibu house and driving Mr. Kasem’s car could answer that question for us.' Love nest? Kerri Kasem's lawyer claims that Jean lied to Casey by telling him they were divorced. Why would she be so cruel, the lawyer asked in court papers. 'Perhaps the younger gentleman that is staying at the Malibu house...could answer that question for us,' he wrote . Room with a view: When a maid answered the door at Kasem's condo, she confirmed to MailOnline that a man named John Paul Gressy is living there . The cheating accusation is the latest in a seven-year battle between Jean Kasem, 60, Casey’s second wife, and Kerri and Julie Kasem - his daughters from his first marriage - over how to manage his deteriorating health.  The daughters claimed Jean was treating their father cruelly and tried to prevent them from seeing him during the last month before his death from sepsis and dementia.  Jean’s reps countered that the older children were trying to lay claim to Casey’s estimated $80 million estate. On June 13, just two days before her father died, Kerri Kasem, 41, raged at her stepmother, Jean, telling the Hollywood Reporter: 'I want this evil woman in jail for what she has done to this family.' And Kerri’s PI, Clarke told the MailOnline:  'I have been hired to gather the facts to prove that Jean Kasem committed a crime. Casey would be alive today - he probably would have lived for another year or more - if it had not been for Jean’s cruelty and abuse. ' Clarke said that the information he is collecting   will be used by Kerri and Julie in 'possible legal actions - both criminal and civil' - against Jean.  'Wrongful death, elder abuse, defamation of character, any or all of these cases could be brought to court,' he added.  'Jean has caused and incredible amount of pain and damage to the Kasem family.' The 'crime' that Clarke says he’s trying to persuade Santa Monica police to investigate is Jean’s decision in early May to take Casey from a Santa Monica hospital to a house in Washington state, without informing other family members. Vows: Kasem married Jean, a statuesque actress in 1980, a year after his divorce from first wife. They went on to have a daughter together, Liberty, now 23, who firmly sides with her mother . 'The doctor at the hospital in Santa Monica told Jean that it could kill him if she removed his feeding tube,' added Carke.  'But she did it anyway.  She put Casey in an SUV with a Mexican caretaker , no doctor or nurse.  Then she got in another SUV with Liberty (Jean’s 24 year-old daughter with Casey) and took off out of California, first to Nevada, then to Washington. 'This whole trip was deliberately to prevent Kerri and Julie from seeing their father - and seeing what a sorry state he was in.  Jean didn’t even get a proper hospital bed for him.  That’s why he ended up with bedsores. 'Kerri and Julie were concerned about their father and wanted to see him because they knew about Jean’s terrible record of caring for him - they knew their dad was being horribly neglected.' But Jean said in a June 9 court declaration:  'I have spared no expense to ensure that Casey receives state-of-the-art medical treatment and 24-hour-a-day care.' But, said Clarke:  'The reality is nothing close to that.  She would abandon him for 9,10, 11 days at a time.  I have notes from doctors saying, ""Mr. Kasem’s wife says she’s coming to visit him but she never shows up."" 'One hospital he was in discharged him and Jean didn’t come to pick him up for seven days.  He had to stay in the hospital for that extra week till she showed up.' The family feud over Casey’s health began in 2007 when he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.  He signed a document giving his older children by his first marriage the authority to make decisions concerning his medical care if he was no longer able to himself.  The document declared that he did not want to be kept alive if he had 'no reasonable hope of normal functioning.' Happier times: Court papers reveal how Kasem's three children from his previous marriage, Kerri, Michael and Julie were on good terms with Jean until his health deteriorated. But for seven years they have been fighting over who cares for him with Jean claiming they showed 'disturbing' behavior and want to secure his $80m . This snub to Jean came back to haunt the Kasem family six years later with nasty court battles and accusations from Casey’s older kids that as his health went steadily downhill, Jean was shutting them out of his life. On June 11, a Los Angeles judge, upheld Casey Kasem’s 2007 wishes, giving Kerri the authority to have doctors end his infusions of water, food and medicine after hearing from doctors that continuing nutrition would 'at best prolong the dying process for him and will certainly add suffering to an already uncomfortable dying process.' The court’s decision was condemned by Jean’s Los Angeles attorney,  Steve Haney, who called it 'the functional equivalent of a death sentence.' Haney claimed that Kerri’s real concern over her father is that she wants to profit from her father’s death.  'Kerri was cut off in 2007 after she accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans,' he said in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter the week before Casey’s death.  “Casey and Jean’s fear is that any money going to the Scientologist  kids would end up in the Church.  Instead he gave Kerri and her two siblings and Liberty a $2 million insurance policy. 'The kids did not come around from 2007 when they were cut off.  They showed up in 2013 when they heard Casey was dying - a final, desperate effort to hook into his $80 million estate.  Kerri, along with her Scientologist friends, picketed in front of Jean’s house, Jean received death threats, someone went though their trash.' Kerri, not surprisingly, completely denied these claims in the same Hollywood Reporter article.  'Absolute lies,' she ranted.  'This will be part of my defamation suit.  I never took loans from my dad and he never cut me off.  We have an irrevocable trust that was set up 30 years ago.'I have never gone a week without either seeing my dad or talking to him on the phone until Jean blocked me, my brother (Mike) and my sister Julie.'","Kerri Kasem, Casey's 41-year-old, daughter from his first marriage, has been engaged in a nasty battle with step-mother Jean, 60, for seven years .

"A mother whose four-year-old son was starved, scalded, beaten with a hammer and then buried in a shallow grave has been sentenced to at least 20 years in prison for her role in the boy's death. Stephanie Sloop, 31, was given 20 years to life behind bars for Ethan Stacy's 2010 death. Sloop pleaded guilty to aggravated murder and obstructing justice under a deal with prosecutors in Farmington, Utah. Scroll down for video . Stephanie Sloop, 31, (pictured in court on Monday) sobbed as she said she was responsible for the murder of her son Ethan. She was sentenced to 20 years to life behind bars for her son's death . Stephanie Sloop, charged with aggravated murder in the death of her son, Ethan Stacy, enters the courtroom in Farmington, Utah, on Monday . Sloop sobbed in court as she admitted she was completely responsible for her son's brutal death, following days of starvation and torture at the hands of her husband, 'because I was his mommy'. Prosecutors said Sloop failed to stop her husband and Ethan's stepfather, Nathan Sloop, from abusing her son and didn't call for help. They asked that she spends the rest of her life in prison. The 31-year-old fidgeted today as the court heard details of the little boy's brutal torture. A medical examiner testified that Ethan died from a combination of too many over-the-counter medications, aspiration pneumonia and severe burns, likely caused from hot water in a tub. Aspiration pneumonia is caused by an inhalation of foreign materials into the lungs, potentially vomit, or as prosecutors suggested, fecal matter that the boy allegedly was forced to eat. The burns would have required skin grafts and weeks of hospital treatment, doctors said. Watch more from inside court at Standard Examiner . Four-year-old Ethan Stacy was beaten beyond recognition with a hammer by his stepfather and buried in a shallow grave in 2010. His mother failed to stop his torture and abuse . Nathan Sloop confessed to wrapping the body in garbage bags and putting him in a shallow grave he dug on the mountainside. The boy’s body and items used to bury it were put in the hole in layers. A hammer was used to disfigure the boy. Stephanie Sloop bought lighter fluid, a shovel and some gloves at a hardware store beforehand. The day the boy was buried, Nathan Sloop sent a text message to his wife, which was shown in court: 'Baby can you get antioxidant vitamins please. That would be great. I can’t wait to take you to Happy Sumo. Memories. Love you!!!' Days later, they called police and reported Ethan as missing. Nathan Sloop ultimately led police to where the boy was buried. Sloop's lawyer told the court that she suffered from 'battered wife syndrome' and had a prescription medication addiction while her son was being abused, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Ethan’s father, Joe Stacy, was present in the courtroom to watch his ex-wife be sentenced. He said that he had been 'broken up' by his son's death. Nathan Sloop (right) stands next to his attorneys during his court appearance appearance in February where he was sentenced to life in prison for murdering his four-year-old stepson . Nathan Sloop, 35, was sentenced in February to 25 years to life in prison for the murder of his four-year-old stepson. Sloop buried the child on Powder Mountain in Weber Country, Utah after he left the child's face disfigured by hammer blows and his grave sprinkled with dog food. Sloop was  sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for the murder and one to 15 years for aggravated assault by a prisoner for attacking a David County jail officer. Sloop, 35, had pleaded guilty but mentally ill. A number of other charges were dismissed as part of a plea deal, which also spared him from the death penalty. Sloop’s attorney, Richard Mauro, said his client’s mental illness coupled with a high number of prescription painkillers and other medications Sloop was taking at the time led to his indifference to the child’s life. Previous court documents show Sloop was prescribed 4,146 pills in an 11-month period. Among the prescriptions were Lortab, Valium, Percocet, Xanax and an antihistamine.

"IAEA say Fukushima blast not to blame . No increase reported in U.K despite changes in Europe . Very low levels of radioactive iodine-131 have been detected throughout Europe, but the particles are not believed to pose a public health risk, the U.N.nuclear agency said on Friday. NASA have released images of 2,400 stars, known as the Tarantula Nebula, that are producing intense radiation and powerful winds, believed to be the cause for the detection in the atmosphere . Closer look: Known as the Tarantula Nebula, these stars have produced intense radiation say NASA . Outbreak: Unusual levels of iodine-131 have been detected in the Czech Republic and northern Germany . The International Atomic Energy Agency . (IAEA), the Vienna-based U.N. watchdog, said it did not believe the . radioactive particles were from Japan's stricken Fukushima nuclear power . plant after its emergency in March. Professor Malcolm Sperrin, director of medical physics at Britain's Royal Berkshire Hospital, said any link with Fukushima was extremely unlikely. 'It is far more likely that the iodine may be as a result of excretion by patients undergoing medical treatment. 'Whilst such patients are carefully controlled, some release of iodine into the environment may be inevitable but would certainly be well below any limits where health detriment would even begin to be an issue for concern,"" he said. Blameless: The Fukushima explosion is not believed to be the root cause for the increase in iodine-131 levels . The Czech Republic's nuclear security watchdog said it had tipped off the IAEA after detecting the radiation it thought was coming from abroad but not from a nuclear power plant. It suggested it may come from production of radiopharmaceuticals. Germany's Environment Ministry said slightly higher levels of radioactive iodine had been measured in the north of the country, ruling out that it came from a nuclear power plant. Hungary, Slovakia, Austria and Sweden also reported traces at very low levels that did not pose a health risk. Experts said the origin of the radiation . - which has been spreading for about two weeks - remained a mystery but . could come from many possible sources ranging from medical laboratories . or hospitals to nuclear submarines. Iodine-131, linked to cancer if found in high doses, can contaminate products such as milk and vegetables. Paddy Regan, a professor of nuclear physics at Britain's University of Surrey, said the suggestion that it may have leaked from a radiopharmaceuticals maker 'sounds very sensible and totally reasonable.' He said since iodine was used in the treatment of thyroid conditions it was also likely that hospitals in many European countries would have it in their stores. 'It would be very unlikely for it to have come from Fukushima since the accident was so many months ago and iodine-131 has a brief half-life,' he said. Iodine-131 is a short-lived radioisotope that has a radioactive decay half-life of about eight days, the IAEA said. Massimo Sepielli, head of the nuclear fission unit of Italy's national alternative energy body ENEA said any number of sources could be to blame for the readings. 'It could be coming from the transporting of (nuclear) material, it could come from a hospital ... it could even come from a nuclear submarine, even if it's a more complicated possibility ... but you can't rule that out.' Officials in Spain, Russia, Ukraine, Finland, France, Britain, Switzerland, Poland and Norway said they had not detected any abnormal radiation levels. Romania's watchdog said there had been no incident at the country's sole nuclear plant. Austria's Environment Ministry said small levels were measured in the east and north of the Alpine country, saying the estimated dose level for the population was one 40,000th of the dose of radiation received in a transatlantic flight. In the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986, an earthquake followed by a massive tsunami overwhelmed the Fukushima plant in Japan, causing a reactor meltdown and leakage of radiation, including of iodine. In the days and weeks after the accident, tiny amounts of iodine-131 believed to have come from Fukushima were detected as far away as Iceland and other parts of Europe, as well as in the United States.","IAEA say Fukushima blast not to blame .

"Former Rangers defender John Brown has warned the Ibrox support that the club's woes will not end with Ally McCoist's resignation. The Gers board finally confirmed that McCoist had given 12 months' notice of his intention to quit on Monday morning after a weekend of speculation. The club issued a 7am statement to the London Stock Exchange in which they said they now planned to hold talks with McCoist. They also confirmed the manager's salary would rise to £750,000 for his final year of employment. Rangers boss Ally McCoist handed in his resignation at the club on Monday morning . McCoist (left) will serve out a 12-month notice at Ibrox before his departure at the club . Reports over the weekend suggested the 52-year-old was quitting in a bid to shift the focus away from his performance as boss and back on to the way the Glasgow giants are being run. But Brown - who was in the same Rangers team as McCoist which won nine successive titles - insists the club will continue to suffer so long as the likes of Sandy Easdale and Mike Ashley are calling the shots behind the scenes. The former Dundee boss said: 'Ally McCoist has given fans so many happy memories over the seasons as a player and in the recent times where he has given them back-to-back promotions. 'He's had to put up with so much. He's had no support. The Easdales and others should hold their heads in shame. 'But I honestly couldn't care what the fans are thinking about performances. Their club has a cancer in it and it needs to get cut out. 'People need to wise up. Changing the manager is not going to change the situation. Until the Rangers fans realise that, their club is going to be in a sorry, sorry position.' Ex-Rangers defender John Brown (right) has criticised the way the club is currently be handled by its owners . Some of the financial figures since the club was reformed in 2012 have been astonishing. It was announced earlier this year that almost £70million had been spent in the first two years following the club's liquidation meltdown. This year's accounts, released last month, show another £8.3m loss and that the club requires a similar sum just to survive until the end of the financial year. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley - who also holds a nine per cent stake in the Light Blues - has given the club a £3m loan but Brown is alarmed at the way the money is being spent. This year's accounts show that former chief executive Graham Wallace earned £378,000 from the day he joined the company on November 20, 2013, until the end of June, almost half of which was a bonus. Wallace also earned a £100,000 pay-off when he quit in October. Former finance director Brian Stockbridge, who left halfway through the season, earned £218,000 and had a £216,000 severance package. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, who hold a nine per cent stake at Rangers, has given them a £3million loan . Another former chief executive, Craig Mather, received a £350,000 severance deal while ex-director Philip Nash made £131,412 in consultancy fees in the first six months of this year. Meanwhile, around 10 backroom employees were made redundant last month. Brown said: 'Ashley has upped his shareholding in recent weeks and brought people in. But then we have seen people with a long service at Rangers, 40 years and more, being shown the door. 'All the players know who these folk are - they were part of the family. So when you see that happening so know that things are ultimately just going to end in tears again. 'It's soul-destroying. These folk who have left were not on big money but you have got so many people in the boardroom looking after their pals and handing out golden handshakes. It's disgusting.'","Ally McCoist announced his resignation as Rangers manager on Monday .

"Climate - changing? The glaciers in the Karakoram Range between northern Pakistan and western China have actually grown, rather than shrinking . Huge glaciers in the area between Pakistan and China are puzzling scientists - and disproving the doom-laden predictions of some climate experts. The glaciers in the Karakoram Range between northern Pakistan and western China have actually grown, rather than shrinking. Unlike most mountain glaciers, the Karakoram glaciers, which account for 3 percent of the total ice-covered area in the world, excluding Greenland and Antarctica, are not shrinking. A team of French glaciologists has recently confirmed that these glaciers on average have remained stable or may have even grown slightly in recent years. The new study used data from satellites to study the Karakoram Range of northern Pakistan and western China. The researchers found that the ice had actually increased in thickness by 0.11 (plus or minus 0.22) meters per year between 1999 and 2008. Experts cautioned that the gain is so small that the glaciers might not actually be growing - but what is clear is that the glaciers are not shrinking, according to a report published in Nature Geoscience. Etienne Berthier, a glaciologist at the Université de Toulouse in France says, 'Not all glacial regions are changing in the same way.' A Nasa study earlier this year using the gravity-sensing GRACE satellites hinted that ice loss in the high Asian mountains might be far less drastic than earlier predictions. Previous estimates of . ice loss in the high Asia mountains have ranged up to 50 billion tons a year, according to the University of Colorado Boulder University's Professor John Wahr. Previously, . it had been claimed by the UN that Himalayan glaciers would have melted to a . fifth of current levels by 2035, leading to sea level rises and drought. Experts cautioned that the gain is so small that the glaciers might not actually be growing - but what is clear is that the glaciers are not shrinking, according to a report published in Nature Geoscience . Unlike most mountain glaciers, the Karakoram glaciers, which account for 3 percent of the total ice-covered area in the world, excluding Greenland and Antarctica, are not shrinking . Those . predictions used ground-based measurements, whereas the new study . measured the effect of gravity on twin Nasa satellites to give an . accurate measure of the mass of ice being lost. ‘The results in this region really . were a surprise,’ said Wahr. ‘One possible explanation is that previous . estimates were based on measurements taken primarily from some of the . lower, more accessible glaciers in Asia and were extrapolated to infer . the behavior of higher glaciers.' 'But unlike the lower glaciers, many of . the high glaciers would still be too cold to lose mass, even in the . presence of atmospheric warming.’ Around the world, melting has been overestimated. Earth's glaciers and ice caps are . shedding roughly 150 billion tons of ice annually - up to 30 per cent lower . than predicted. The researchers used satellite . measurements taken with the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or . GRACE,, to calculate that the world's . glaciers and ice caps had lost about 148 billion tons, or about 39 . cubic miles of ice annually from 2003 to 2010. Traditional estimates of Earth's ice . caps and glaciers have been made using ground-based measurements from . relatively few glaciers to infer what all of the unmonitored glaciers . around the world were doing, he said. Only a few hundred of the roughly 200,000 glaciers worldwide have been monitored for a decade or more. ‘The strength of GRACE is that it . sees everything in the system,’ said Wahr. ‘Even though we don't have . the resolution to look at individual glaciers, GRACE has proven to be an . exceptional tool.’ The total does not count . the mass from individual glacier and ice caps on the fringes of the . Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets -- roughly an additional 80 billion . tons. Lake Gray Glacier melting in a stream of blue water, Torres del Paine National Park, Patagonia, Chile: Scientists now believe that glaciers may be melting more slowly than predicted . Nasa's twin Grace satellites measured ice loss far more accurately than previous studies, which used ground-based estimates . Launched . in 2002, two GRACE satellites whip around Earth in tandem 16 times a . day at an altitude of about 300 miles, sensing subtle variations in . Earth's mass and gravitational pull. Separated . by roughly 135 miles, the satellites measure changes in Earth's gravity . field caused by regional changes in the planet's mass, including ice . sheets, oceans and water stored in the soil and in underground aquifers. A . positive change in gravity during a satellite approach over Greenland, . for example, tugs the lead GRACE satellite away from the trailing . satellite, speeding it up and increasing the distance between the two. A . sensitive ranging system allows researchers to measure the distance of . the two satellites down to as small as 1 micron- about 1/100 the width . of a human hair - and to calculate ice and water amounts from particular . regions of interest around the globe using their gravity fields. ‘The . total amount of ice lost to Earth's oceans from 2003 to 2010 would . cover the entire United States in about 1 and one-half feet of water,’ said Wahr, also a fellow at the CU-headquartered Cooperative Institute . for Research in Environmental Sciences. According . to the GRACE data, total sea level rise from all land-based ice on . Earth including Greenland and Antarctica was roughly 1.5 millimeters per . year annually or about 12 millimeters, or one-half inch, from 2003 to . 2010, said Wahr.","Glaciers between Pakistan and China have gained mass of ice since 1998 .

"Hurricane Gonzalo gathered strength moving over open water away from the eastern end of the Caribbean, and forecasters said it could become a powerful category 4 storm Wednesday as it headed toward Bermuda. Authorities on some of the smaller islands buffeted by Gonzalo said at least one person was dead and two were missing. Dozens of boats were damaged and power was knocked out in the Dutch Caribbean territory of St. Maarten. Gonzalo was blamed for the death of an unidentified elderly man who was aboard a boat in St. Maarten's Simpson Bay Lagoon, which looked like a ship graveyard Tuesday with several masts protruding from the water. Scroll down for video . Surfers ride the waves in the waters at La Pared Beach in Luquillo, Puerto Rico, on Tuesday. Hurricane Gonzalo moved away from the area, but churned up heavy surf across much of the Caribbean . The storm is expected to maintain strength and give Bermuda a direct hit. The rest of island region is experiencing clear skies with isolated areas of fair weather clouds . The storm had top sustained winds of nearly 125 mph (205 kph) and was centered about 705 miles (1,135 kilometers) south of Bermuda late Tuesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. It was moving northwest at 13 mph (20 kph). The center said Gonzalo could become a category 4 hurricane during the day while it takes a path that would take it near Bermuda on Friday. Category 4 storms have sustained winds of at least 130 mph (209 kph) with the potential to cause catastrophic damage. 'Folks in Bermuda are going to need to start paying attention to this thing,' Dennis Feltgen, a National Hurricane Center meteorologist, said by phone. Bermuda's government posted a hurricane watch for the British territory, urging islanders to keep an eye on the storm's progress. Officials said flights departing Bermuda on Thursday, Friday and Saturday were fully booked. Acting Coast Guard Director Wendell Thode said 22 of the 37 boats destroyed by the storm were in the lagoon. 'Most of the boats that are destroyed are completely under water,' he said. Authorities were searching for a man last seen on a dinghy near the French Caribbean territory of St. Martin and another man last seen standing close to a harbor in St. Barts, said Matthieu Doligez, general secretary of the prefecture in St. Martin.

Because these Parrot ZIKs boast some of the best sound quality this side of Ibiza, transforming your ears into a dance floor one minute, or concert auditorium the next. Indeed, they are sure to appeal to music lovers of all tastes and ages, their understated but substantial design likely to hit the right note across the age spectrum. Ear we go! These ZIKs boast fantastic sound quality and look stunning, too . Everything about these ZIKs oozes quality. The box itself wouldn't look out of place in the Tate Modern. The headphones, although a bit on the heavy side, are works of art, too. They fit snugly around your ears, and reduce outside noise to a minimum. The clever thing about the ZIKs is that they are wireless - connecting via Bluetooth. Plus, with their 'NFC' technology, you can sync and pair portable music players by touch (in much the same way an Oyster card works). Using a touch-sensitive pad on the left ear, you can turn the volume up and down and even skip songs. In theory this sounds great, but doesn't work quite as well as I hoped...especially on public transport. I got a few strange looks from fellow commuters who watched me tap manically on my ear to try and turn the volume down. In the gym, too, the rather fiddly touch-sensitive mechanism often causes you to skip songs accidentally or blast your ears into oblivion when you mistakenly crank up the volume. Bird of pray: You'll worship the headphones' design . A touch of genius, though, is their ability to pause music when you take them away from your ears, so you can bid farewell to having to stop mid conversation to turn off the tinny background noise emanating from your headphones. The sound quality is superb. At both low and high volume, depth of sound is fantastic, great for those who are weary of damaging their ears. For those who aren't, no fret. At full blast the ZIKs are a joy, too. Just be careful... But all these positives come at a price, with these beauties retailing for a hefty £349. The idea of touch-sensitive earphones is a master stroke, and it's the main reason you'll snap up one of these. However, the system needs more refining to elevate it from cool gadget to game-changer.

"Facebook has shut down the account of former TLC star Mama June's boyfriend, Mark McDaniel, after it was revealed that he is a convicted child molester. McDaniel was active on the social media site until Tuesday when his page was taken down by Facebook staffers. The website has a strict policy in place that prohibits convicted sex offenders from using Facebook. Scroll down for video . Kicked out: Facebook took down Mark McDaniel's page Tuesday because under the site's policy, convicted sex offenders are not allowed to be on Facebook . Vile crime: McDaniel (left) was released from prison in March after serving 10 years for molesting Mama June's daughter Anna Cardwell (right) when she was only eight years old . 'Photo-shopped': Mama June, pictured here with daughter Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' and McDaniel, has insisted that at least one of the images showing her together with the sex offender is a fake . Other Facebook users are being asked to contact the site administrations if they encounter an account 'that may belong to a convicted sex offender.' 'Once we’re able to verify someone’s status as a sex offender, we immediately disable their account and remove all the information associated with it from Facebook,' the policy states. Before McDaniel was booted from the site, he shared a photo showing him cradling his baby granddaughter, TMZ first reported. He also had posts on his wall from friends welcoming h‫im home from prison after his release earlier this year. TLC axed the long-running reality show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo last month after it has been alleged that ‘Mama June’ Shannon has secretly rekindled her romance with her former boyfriend Mark McDaniel. Nixed: TLC canceled the long-running reality show in October after allegations have emerged that Mama June Shannon has struck up a romance with her sex-offender ex . Shannon, pictured with her clan, previously claimed she has only seen him McDaniel twice since his release . Shannon has repeatedly denied that she has been dating the man who was convicted of forcing her daughter Anna 'Chickadee' to perform oral sex on him on multiple occasions in 2002, sometimes with her younger sister, Pumpkin, in bed next to her. But network executives decided to cancel the show after images emerged showing Shannon and McDaniel together. In an exclusive interview with Dr Phil Monday, Mama June insisted that at least one of the photos showing the couple reunited following McDaniel’s release has been doctored. 'I would never take my child around someone like that,' she told Dr Phil. Shannon previously claimed she has only seen him McDaniel twice since his release - once by coincidence and once to give her daughter, Pumpkin, some closure because she believed he was her father. Speaking out: In an exclusive interview with Dr Phil, Shannon has again denied she is in a relationship with her daughter's molester, claiming he is now seeing someone else . The children's uncle has also claimed in an interview that he witnessed the young girl sharing a bed with McDaniel and Mama June during a trip to North Carolina in September. 'I'm disgusted with June for not protecting Alana from Mark,' Uncle Poodle - real name Lee Thompson - told the National Enquirer. 'This guy can't be trusted. He needs to be locked up and have the key thrown away.'

Chelsea welcome Sporting Lisbon to Stamford Bridge in their final Champions League group match . Cesc Fabregas (centre) warms up alongside some of his more inexperienced colleagues on Tuesday . Mourinho said: ‘It depends on the talent you have. Every manager in the world wants to bring young people up. Sometimes you have it. Sometimes you don’t. I can compare my first spell here to now, and now the quality of the young players is clearly better. ‘I’m not saying they’re ready, but the quality is much better. ‘Go to other clubs, it’s clear it’s not easy to bring kids from the youth competitions to the top level, but every one has the same feeling. We want to do it.’ The Chelsea manager hailed their match against Sporting Lisbon as their ‘Academy Day’, celebrating the fact that young players are breaking through to the senior squad. John Terry, Eden Hazard and Willian have been given a break by Mourinho with Chelsea already qualified at the top of Group G. That made room for Loftus-Cheek and defender Nathan Ake, 19, in training. Loftus-Cheek, who is expected to start on the bench but will play some part, has trained with the senior squad every day for the past three weeks. Ake has been on the fringes of the first team this campaign. He has started twice in the Capital One Cup and made a substitute appearance in the 6-0 win against Maribor. But in recent years the chances for youngsters have been limited and Terry, 34, is the last player to come through the academy and become a regular in the first team. Chelsea's Loftus-Cheek (centre) was among the youngsters getting involved in the 11.30am session . Nathan Ake, 19, Loftus-Cheek, 18, and Mitchell Beeney, 19, were all out for the training session on Tuesday . Didier Drogba out for Chelsea training on Tuesday but John Terry, Eden Hazard and Willian were absent . ‘The people in the academy feel they are working for something,’ Mourinho said. ‘Which is why it is not Ruben’s day but “Academy Day”.’ Mourinho also warned that unless clubs allow managers to work long-term, academies will not work. He has started making plans for the future regarding how to integrate young players into his first team. ‘If you don’t bring kids through the academy, the best thing is to close it.’ he added. ‘If the kids are not good enough or the work not good enough, close the door and use the money to buy players. ‘You need to prove the academy works well and is worth it. It’s only possible if the first-team manager stays for a long time, which in this club in the last 10 years was not possible. Now I’m trying to format Ruben and other Rubens in relation to my ideas. ‘The relation between the first-team and the academy is changing with this stability we are having.’ Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who is set to be handed his Chelsea debut against Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday night, is regarded as one of the country's brightest emerging talents. The 6ft 4in central midfielder, 18, has earned rave reviews for his composed play and passing in central midfield and looks well-equipped to make the step up. Hailing from Lewisham, south London, Loftus-Cheek first pulled on a blue shirt for the U8s team and is, as Jose Mourinho said, very much 'Made in Chelsea.' Graduating through the Stamford Bridge schoolboy teams, he was appearing for the Under-18s three years ahead of schedule and captaining England schoolboys in the Victory Shield. The maturity and energy he demonstrated in the box-to-box midfield role won admiring glances from a number of big clubs, including Barcelona, and prompted Chelsea to tie down his future . Ruben Loftus-Cheek lifts the FA Youth Cup after Chelsea beat Fulham in last season's final . The central midfielder in action for Chelsea's Under 21 team in a Cup match against West Ham last season . Loftus-Cheek is always a willing outlet for the defenders and, with head up pressing forward, is adept at picking the right pass. Tall and strong, he is rarely dispossessed either, but it is his composure on the ball that is most eye-catching. He never looks rushed and always seems to be in acres of space. The breakthrough season came in 2012-2013, when Loftus-Cheek played a starring role as Chelsea progressed to the final of the FA Youth Cup and the NextGen Series, though both ended in defeat. Selection for the Under 21 side soon followed and he started two post-season first team friendlies against Manchester City out in the United States. Loftus-Cheek helped Chelsea to victory in the Under 21 Premier League, playing in the 2-1 win in the final at Old Trafford. He also played a full part in Chelsea's FA Youth Cup success, captaining the team. This season, he has been a mainstay of Chelsea's Under 21 side and has also participated in the UEFA Youth League. Loftus-Cheek has been capped for England up to Under 19 level and has six goals in 10 matches at that standard.

"Arrest warrants have been issued for two of the nation's most notorious jihadists, Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar, by the Australian Federal Police. This comes after Daily Mail Australia revealed a disturbing photo of Elomar holding up two decapitated heads for the camera in Syria. The picture was uploaded on Friday by his friend, convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf, on Twitter. Since then, the AFP have issued warrants for their arrest for terrorist activities if they return to Australia, according the ABC. Scroll down for video . Disgusting: Mohamed Elomar, who is believed to have left Australia last year to fight in Syria, is shown holding up the decapitated heads of two men . In the sickening image, Elomar is seen smiling - with a pair of sunglasses tucked into his shirt - as he holds up two decapitated heads by the victims' hair. Another image, uploaded on Friday, shows the heads of alleged Syrian solders being impaled on metal railings. Like something out of the 18th century, the heads were left on show in a sickening display that aims to cause terror and fear. The photos were uploaded by terrorist Khaled Sharrouf, alongside disgusting tweets such as 'bucket full of heads any1 in aus want some organs please dont be shy to ask I would love to assist u with body parts [sic]'. Disturbing: Sharrouf also posted a photo of two men placing severed heads on a metal railing . His disturbing rant continued 'few more heads how lovely bludy amazing stuff abuhafs u keep cutting those infidel throats but the last 1 is mine! [sic]' Elomar and Sharrouf, who spent time in jail for his part in a foiled plot to blow up targets in Sydney and Melbourne, are believed to be fighting with terrorism group Islamic State - an al-Qaeda off-shoot. They are thought to have flown to Syria together late last year after Sharrouf fled the country on his brother Mustafa's passport. Meanwhile, Elomar's wife Fatima, 29, appeared in court in Sydney on July 8 charged with 'preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities'. Khaled Sharrouf posted the photos on Twitter alongside captions such as 'this guy lost his head!!! Lol' The convicted terrorist said he wanted to cut 'infidel throats' He directed his tweets to people in Australia and joked about organ donation . Convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf has threatened the Australian Federal Police and his countrymen on his Twitter account . On Thursday night Attorney General George Brandis's spokesman told The Australian that 'if real, these photos are evidence of serious crimes against Australian law and possible war crimes.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted AFP for further comment. Sharrouf, also a former Sydney resident, taunted Australian police via his social media account two weeks ago, boasting that he would 'slaughter' Australians. Fatima Elomar hides under a burqa as she emerges from the Downing Centre court complex with her lawyer Zali Burrows (right) and four children after appearing on terrorism related charges . The jihadist is currently in the Middle East fighting with the extremist group after he evaded authorities in December. The tweets came as the nation's Director General of Security David Irvine revealed 'tens of people' had already returned to Australian shores from fighting alongside suspected terrorist organisations. Speaking to media earlier this month, Attorney-General George Brandis said engagement with the Islamic community was an important strategy 'to keep Australia free from terrorism'. 'The imams who are faith leaders, who are influential and respected opinion members in their communities, are integral to our goal to saving young men - it is almost always young men - in their communities from being radicalised,' he said. Mr Irvine added a majority of the 60 Australians they were aware of fighting with Islamic radicals were siding against the government with Al-Qaeda off-shoots. 'We have some tens of people that have already returned [from the Middle East], we have probably another 150 we're looking at here in Australia who have inclinations to support those two extremist movements,' he said. When asked if the ones who had returned to Australia were being actively monitored, Mr Irvine said 'I'm not saying anything further'. On July 14, Sharrouf fired off a tweet to the AFP and Australians, saying: 'you cowards I am running to my death I want martyrdom thats [sic] why I am blessed u rock spiders'. Just half an hour earlier, he claimed 'Australia belongs to the muslims not infidels like you' as well as boasting of his evasion of police. 'u can't stop and trust me if I wanted to attack aus I could have easily,' Sharrouf said. He also added: 'I love to slaughter [Australians] & ALLAH LOVEs when u dogs r slaughtered'. These threatening tweets are part of a more disturbing picture of Sharrouf painted by his Twitter account. Some of the content is so graphic that Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to publish the posts. On July 14, Sharrouf tweeted he loved to slaughter Australians to the AFP . He said it would have been easy for him to attack Australia if he wanted . Sharrouf's account is littered with photos of him posing with weapons and military trucks as well as a young child brandishing a rifle .

"Mohammed Merah killed three schoolchildren, a rabbi and three paratroopers . The brother of Toulouse gunman Mohammed Merah appeared before an anti-terrorist judge today and was formally charged with ‘complicity in murder’. Meanwhile the fall-out from last week's massascre has led to an escalation in religious tension, with Jewish graves being desecrated across France. Riot police have also been called to housing estates on the . outskirts of major cities like Paris because of anti-Semitic demonstrations . being held in support of the 23-year-old killer. Abdelkader Merah, the 29-year-old brother of Mohammed, appeared in court today after allegations that he was close to a Jewish school last Monday when his 23-year-old sibling gunned down a Rabbi, his two children, and a teenage pupil. He is also believed to have assisted his brother in an attack on French paratroopers, which saw three shot dead. Under conditions of utmost security in central Paris this morning, Abdelkader Merah was driven to the Palais de Justice in an armoured convoy. There a criminal investigation was opened which could see the self-confessed Islamic extremist jailed for life. In a statement read out soon afterwards, the Paris Prosecutor’s Office said: ‘The investigations being handled by the police have established the existence of serious evidence against Abdelkader Merah corroborating, or making plausible, his participation as an accomplice in the commission of crimes in connection with a terrorist enterprise.’ Abdelkader was remanded in custody, and taken to a high-security prison in Paris, where he is likely to remain until his trial. Adbelkader has already told police interrogators that he was ‘very proud’ of what Merah did, and admitted to dining with him just before the attack on the Ozar Hatorah school in Toulouse. ‘Signals from Abdelkader’s mobile phone were emitted close to the school at the time of the murders,’ said an investigating source. Suspect: Police escort Abdelkader Merah to the French police's anti-terrorist headquarters in Levallois-Perret, outside Paris on Saturday . Among numerous questions Abedelkader . is facing is how Merah got hold of an arsenal of weapons, including an . Uzi sub-machine gun, and even the kind of Sten gun used by British . soldiers during the Second World War. It is also believed that Abdekkader . also helped his brother buy the Yamaha T-Max motorbike used in all the . attacks, and to respray the vehicle and remove its tracking device. Meanwhile, new video footage released by police shows the inside of the Toulouse apartment . where Mohammed Merah had his last stand. The chaotic flat is cluttered . with furniture strewn across each room blocking the way, and one wall is . peppered in what looks like bullet holes. Merah is being held up as an martyr . in some quarters, with Jewish cemeteries targeted in attacks which . police are linking to the Merah atrocities. On Thursday night Stars of David - a . symbol of Judaism - were torn off some 30 graves in the eastern Jewish . cemetery in the Mediterranean city of Nice. Lanterns were also stolen from more . than 20 sealed tombs in the same cemetery, with local police . commissioner Hergot Nicolas saying all were targeted 'because they are . Jewish, while Christian graves nearby were ignored.' Bullet holes line the wall of the apartment of Mohamed Merah, the self-proclaimed Islamic extremist who killed seven people, after a 32-hour siege . David Shoushana, the chief rabbi in . Nice, said there had been similar attacks on other cemeteries since . Merah was shot dead on Thursday, adding that there was a 'possible . connection with the Toulouse killings.' Also on Thursday, graffiti including . 'Long Live Merah' and 'Vengeance!' appeared on a prominent wall in the . Paris suburb of Sartrouville as youths gathered to 'honour' the killer. 'They were mainly kids who are trying to make a political point out of these horrific crimes,' said a local police spokesman. 'Police have broken up similar . gatherings on other estates around Paris, and other cities, where Merah . is being portrayed by a tiny minority as martyr.' The . girlfriend of one of Merah’s victims said she intended to marry her . partner in a posthumous ceremony. Caroline . Monet, 21, has been given presidential permission to wed 25-year-old . Corporal Abel Chennouf, who was shot dead at a cash machine in the town . of Montauban, near Toulouse, this month. Her lawyer, Gilbert Collard, said Ms Monet had received approval from President Nicolas Sarkozy for the ceremony to take place. Corporal Abel Chennouf, left, was shot dead by Merah. His girlfriend Caroline Money, right, has been given permission to wed him posthumously . Posthumous marriages are unusual in France, but they can be sanctioned in ‘grave circumstances’, said Mr Collard. 'I’ve already had it done twice, for policemen’s girlfriends,' he said. 'It’s a really moving ceremony with an empty chair representing the dead spouse. 'There won’t be any problems with approval, and the marriage will allow the new child to have a father.' A teacher from Rouen, in northern . France, was also suspended after organising a minute's silence for . Mehar, saying he was a 'victim' who had a difficult childhood on an . immigrant housing estate in Toulouse. Merah, who filmed himself carrying . out the executions of four Jewish people and three French soldiers who . had fought in Afghanistan, was a self-styled Jihadist. He said he wanted to kill Jewish . children in revenge for the lives of Palestinian youngsters who had died . at the hands of the Israeli army. Victims: Imad Ibn-Ziaten, 30, Abel Chennouf, 25, and Mohamed Legouade, 26 were killed by Merah last week . There are some 500,000 Jews in . France, and security measures around them have increased after Merah . shot a rabbi and three children at a school in Toulouse last Monday. There are some six million Muslims . living in France, making up the largest group of its kind in western . Europe, but Islamic leaders have rejected Merah as being utterly . unrepresentative of a largely peace-loving and law-abiding community. Mohammed Merah was gunned down by . special forces outside his council flat in Toulouse last Thursday . following a fierce firefight. Abelkader had been arrested the day . before along with his 30-year-old wife - who has not been named - and . the brothers’ divorced mother, Zoulika Aziri, 54. At one point, police brought his mother to the scene, but she refused to urge her son to surrender, officials said. Both women have now been released, . and have expressed shock at the decision to charge Adbelkader, who . denies having anything to do with his brother’s crimes. Network: 23-year-old killer Mohammed Merah, who is said to have met with UK jihadists in Afghanistan . Tragic: The mother and father of French paratrooper Imad Ben Ziaten carry a portrait of their son as they wait for his body's arrival at Rabat airport . Evidence has also emerged that Merah was in touch with British Jihadists preparing terrorist atrocities across the world. During a visit to Afghanistan just . over a year ago, Merah was using the codename ‘Youssef Toulouse’, which . was passed to the UK authorities. Paris security sources believe that . both Merah brothers were involved in two local Islamist organisations, . Forsane Alizza (The Knights of Pride) and a more militant jihadist . network known as the Toulouse group, or Jund al-Khalifah. Jund al-Khalifah, an Al-Qaeda . splinter group, has already admitted to working with a ‘Youssef the . Frenchman’ - who is believed to be Merah. ‘Not only were members of these . groups in touch with British Jidhadists while in Europe, but they would . have met them in Afghanistan,’ said one security source in the French . capital. ‘There is a window as later as 2010 when Merah would have been in touch with Jihadists from all over the world.’ Scene: A general view of the block of apartments in which Mohammed Merah was shot by police . The source said that Merah was known . to have entered Kabul, the Capital of Afghanistan on November 13th 2010, . after a journey across Turkey and Iraq. He was picked up by American security . agents in the Afghan city of Kandahar on November 30th , and returned . to France on December 5th 2010. The Toulouse group, which brought . together young fundamentalists of North African descent, was formed in . around 2006, with the stated aim of targeting western interests in . Europe, and sending recruits to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan. The French authorities are facing . growing criticism that Merah, a known fundamentalist who was on the U.S. no-fly list and had attended an al-Qaeda training camp, was left alone . to carry out his crimes.","'Very proud' brother of Merah charged after explosives found in his car .

"Emmanuel Adebayor's older brother Kola claims the striker has been brainwashed by Islamic spiritual healers into thinking their mother used black magic to sabotage his form on the pitch. Kola, 42, a truck driver based in Bremen, Germany, told The Sun on Sunday: '[Emmanuel] has been brainwashed by these Muslim alfas - spiritual men - who prophesise when he scores goals and why he is not playing well. 'They have convinced him his sister and mother put juju curses on him. My mother is very sad. Every day she is crying. I just talked to her on the phone and she was crying again.' VIDEO Scroll down for Stop doing Juju on me! Emmanuel Adebayor's radio interview . Emmanuel Adebayor's brother Kola is angry at his brother for his treatment of their mother Alice . Spurs striker Adebayor claimed his mother had done Juju on him but denied kicking her out of his house . Juju is a word used in West Africa to refer to spells used as part of witchcraft. Juju is said to have started during the days of slavery but is still part of African tradition. Adebayor was recently moved to deny accusations from his sister Maggie that he had kicked their mum Alice out of his house in Africa because he thought she had performed Juju curses on him. Maggie claimed on radio station Peace FM in neighbouring Ghana that the Premier League striker was refusing to give his mother money and has not seen her in over a year. She said their mum was selling 'polythene bags, padlocks and other things' to provide for her family however Emmanuel says his mother left the house of her own accord. Adebayor, speaking to Peace FM, said: 'I never sacked my mum from the house. She decided to leave the house. 'How am I going to be in touch with my mum if my mum is the one telling everyone that my work will not go forward, so I will just be on my side and do my thing. Listen to the full interview at Peacefmonline.com . 'They should stop talking, they should stop doing Juju on me, they should leave me alone. 'I bought a $1.2m house in East Legon for the one talking and calling herself my sister. Can you imagine that sister went to rent the house without my knowledge?' Kola tells The Sun that he sends Alice 400 euros a month. He says he is 'angry' at his brother and that Emmanuel's financial snub has 'left our family in poverty'. While it's common for people who identify as Christian such as Emmanuel to visit a Muslim spiritual healer, Kola says the Spurs front man is 'seeing bad alfas and they are manipulating him'. 'If you are really a man of God then you have to catch our mother and prove she is a witch,' he says. 'Otherwise you are just lying to Emmanuel and taking his money.' Tottenham has been contacted for a response. Emmanuel's form for Spurs hasn't been tested since November 9, when he was a 65th-minute substitute for Etienne Capoue in their 2-1 loss to Stoke. After that match Adebayor criticised Spurs fans for not providing a supportive atmosphere at White Hart Lane. The 30-year-old is in contention to start against Hull at the KC Stadium on Sunday . 'It might be better to play away at the moment,' he said. 'At least you know you are going to be having the majority of opposition fans booing, rather than our own fans.' Tottenham Supporters' Trust member Martin Cloake hit back at Adebayor in the  Telegraph, saying:  'Are players not playing well because of booing or is the booing because players are not playing well?' 'It's a bit of both. Adebayor is a player on £170,000 a week. We know that he needs to be loved. But it does seem a little bit rich to be complaining that people paying between £50 and £80 to watch a single game are not being massively supportive when it doesn't appear as if all the time he is putting the effort in.' Adebayor has scored just twice in 12 appearances this campaign with his last goal coming in Spurs' 2-1 loss at home to Newcastle in which his side couldn't capitalise on 67 per cent of the possession.","Kola Adebayor, Emmanuel's brother, claims striker has been brainwashed .

"Ravi Bopara has leapt to the defence of Alastair Cook after England’s crushing one-day defeat by Sri Lanka in Colombo was followed by renewed demands for his resignation. Kevin Pietersen, Ian Botham and Michael Vaughan all called for Cook to quit after the Sri Lankans moved with embarrassing ease into a 2-0 lead in the seven-match series. But Bopara, whose enterprising half-century stood out in a sorry display, said Cook was not the only struggling batsman in England’s one-day side. In a formulation that has become familiar, Bopara insisted: ‘He’s quite a strong character. He’ll come out the other side.’ Ravi Bopara (right) has described England captain Alastair Cook as a 'fighter' who can prove doubters wrong . The statistics are beginning to stack up against Cook (second from right) with Bopara pictured on the far left . If England keep losing and Alastair Cook keeps failing, his position as one-day captain will come under serious pressure. If England do dispense with his services, expect Alex Hales to replace him as opener and Eoin Morgan to replace him as captain for the World Cup Down Under in February, even though the Irishman also looks out of form. Few doubt Cook’s mental strength. But his lack of runs and England’s faltering preparations for the World Cup, now less than three months away, appear to be a concern only to those outside the dressing-room. Cook’s scratchy 22 in 37 balls on Saturday meant he has scored only one half-century in 16 innings since guiding England to the final of the Champions Trophy on home soil in June 2013. And – with the surprising exception of Joe Root – that record compares unfavourably with the rest of the current top seven over the same period. In 16 innings since the Champions Trophy, Cook has averaged 29, with a lowly strike-rate per 100 balls of 71. Only Root averages fewer (27), but none of the top seven has scored more slowly than the captain . Bopara finds it easy to retain faith in a cricketer like captain Cook who has a career trait of resilience . Bopara had to try to prove his point again after being dropped by England for the home series against India . By contrast, Moeen Ali is averaging 43 with a strike-rate of almost 107, while Jos Buttler’s figures are 40 and 115. Even Ian Bell, whose place has been questioned while the likes of Alex Hales and James Taylor wait for their chance, has been scoring at 90 runs per 100 balls. Bopara, though, was toeing a loyal line. ‘One thing we must remember, it’s not just Alastair Cook who hasn’t scored over the past few games,’ he said. ‘There’s been a lot of us. ‘He is our captain. He’s done it in the past. I remember him scoring two hundreds on the bounce in the UAE. He can play, and I’m sure that form will turn around.’ Cook will have to do so without the help of batting coach Mark Ramprakash, who on Sunday night left the tour as per his part-time deal with the ECB. England’s top seven since the 2013 Champions Trophy, ordered by average . England captain Cook looks on after misfielding a ball during the second ODI against Sri Lanka . England have lost 15 of their 25 ODIs since they were beaten by India at home in the final of the Champions Trophy in June 2013. They have won just nine, with one no result. Asked about the views of Botham, Vaughan and Pietersen – who tweeted ‘Dear Alastair, if you care about England's chances this winter, pls resign and just concentrate on Test cricket... ‪#getHalesin’ – Bopara was philosophical. ‘Everyone’s entitled to their opinion,’ he said. ‘In English culture, we’re quite quick to jump on something that hasn’t gone right. What’s happened to Cook over the past year has definitely made him stronger. He smiles a lot more now than he ever did. I think he’s in a good place.’ Bopara himself may be in a better place than when England dropped him for the home one-day series against India at the end of the summer. He has begun this series with a pair of fifties, and worked out more quickly than his colleagues that Saturday’s pitch required careful accumulation – not the gung-ho strokeplay that scuppered England’s top order. ‘Getting dropped against India was a shock,’ he said. ‘I remember the phonecall quite clearly. I didn’t really want to tell anyone, to be honest. I was a little bit embarrassed. Cook (second from right) has overseen seven one-day international defeats in England's last eight matches . ‘I get dropped a lot, actually. I think I come back wiser every time, and a little bit more independent. That’s the key to playing cricket at this level: you’ve got to be very independent and not be so coach-driven.’ After being given a run at No 4 in 2012, Bopara’s role in the one-day side has been as a finisher, or a repairer of innings, from No 6 or 7. His natural gifts are well suited to both tasks, but he is clearly underwhelmed by the designation. ‘I’d like to bat a bit higher,’ he said. ‘It’s an OK role. It’s not a glorious role. You’re not quite a main batter or a main bowler. At Essex I play as a main batsman – that’s how I like to be viewed. But the role I’m given – there’s nothing I can do about it. ‘I could do with a little bit of help down the back end, I think. It would be nice to be batting with someone like Jos Buttler or Eoin Morgan.’ Right now, these are luxuries England may not be in a position to consider.","Alastair Cook has overseen seven ODI defeats in England's last eight .

"A swarm of mutant  rats that are immune to poison is 'closing in' on a Wiltshire town, pest exterminators have warned. The rodents, which have been seen elsewhere in the UK over the past year, are twice as large as normal species and cannot be killed with traditional substances. It comes after the discovery of one rodent at a food establishment measuring 20-inches, the largest on record for the town of Swindon. Scroll down for video . This rat found in Swindon is the largest on record for the Wiltshire town. Pest exterminators have warned an influx of super rats may be on its way, with the rodents immune to traditional poisons . 'It's a growing problem, and at the moment there's no sign it'll go away,' said Justin Holloway who found the rat in Swindon, told MailOnline. 'Unless you can extinguish all of the genetic line the rise of super rats is on the horizon.' At longer than 20-inches, it is the largest to have ever been found in Swindon. Though the rat was killed using traditional anti-coagulant poison, Mr Holloway warned others that are immune to the substance will become 'a greater problem. 'One particular strain of rats were not so susceptible to rodenticides or the anti-coagulants served and, as a percentage of the total rat population, they become greater over time. 'As far as resistance is concerned, it is a growing issue and over a period of time I expect this to be a greater problem than it currently is, but establishing a time-frame is harder. 'The implication is if you are a rat and you're not being taken on, you might enjoy a longer life and grow to a larger size, because you are not being taken down. 'If there's a good source of food and water it becomes a larger rat.' Another of huge rodent is the width of a shovel. The rat was discovered near a river in Gravesend, Kent, last April . Video provided by Environ Pest Control, found here . This mutant rat was found hiding in the walls of a home in Dublin. Experts have warned the breed of giant rodent is on the rise . This rat discovered in Cornwall last year measured 50cm. Unless the entire genetic line is killed, the population of super rats will continue to increase . A map details where notable rats have been recorded across the UK since 2010. The rat discovered in Swindon this week was giant at 20-inches, but not considered 'mutant' as it was killed traditionally . Mr Holloway added while he had not found any mutant rats in Swindon, their population will continue to grow across the UK. 'Most counties have shown there are some strains of genetically different rats however it's whether they have a particular control problem that's the issue. 'We haven't had any major control issues but companies like ours need to adapt new strategies for new rodents.' Super rats are typically larger than sewer rats and cannot be killed by traditional rodenticides. The species has developed a genetic mutation which means substances approved by the EU to control rat populations has no effect on them. Pest controllers are calling for new rules to be made allowing the creation of stronger poisons, though the health and safety risk to humans and the environment this bears is a bone of contention. Most rats are found in food premises, though some have been recorded across the UK in homes. To prevent the creatures from infesting your home or business, experts advise keeping conditions spotlessly clean. Ensuring wheelie bins have proper drain holes is also important, said exterminators. 'A rat in the wrong place is a problem for anybody so you have to be vigilant whether its commercial or residential. 'They'll chew water pipes, electric cables and it puts your property at risk,' said Justin Holloway of exterminators, Prokill. Earlier this year a number of abnormally large rats were recorded across the UK. Worried homeowners shared photographs of the rodents, some of which were as large as small cats. One, found on an industrial estate in Liverpool, measured two feet, while another in Gravesend, Kent, was the width of a shovel. Researchers at Huddersfield University performed studies on the rodents, with some parts of Britain more severely affected than others. In Gloucestershire and Shropshire, around 20 per cent of rats tested were immune to traditional poisons, while a third in Kingston could not be killed using the substances. In Southampton, 75 per cent of the rodents were found to have the genetic mutation. Speaking at the time, scientist Dr Dougie Clarke described the giant species as 'a time bomb'.

"Holographic displays that could show mothers their child before it is born, and let surgeons manipulate a holographic display of a patient's internal organs are being developed. Technology giant Philips is developing the system with Israeli firm RealView. They recently conducted the first trial of the system, with heart surgery. Scroll down for video . The holographic display system developed by RealView could be used to show mothers their child using live data from scans. The pilot study involved eight patients and was conducted in collaboration with the Schneider Children's Medical Center in Petach Tikva, Israel. RealView's system was used to display interactive, real-time 3D holographic images acquired by Philips' interventional X-ray and cardiac ultrasound systems. In addition to viewing the patient's heart on a 2D screen, doctors in the interventional team were able to view detailed dynamic 3D holographic images of the heart 'floating in free space' during a minimally-invasive structural heart disease procedure, without using special eyewear. The doctors were also able to manipulate the projected 3D heart structures by literally touching the holographic volumes in front of them. The study demonstrated the potential of the technology to enhance the context and guidance of structural heart repairs. The firm behind the display system said it hoped it would become commonplace. 'I see clear indications that 3D medical holography will play an important role in medical imaging in the near future,' said Aviad Kaufman, CEO of RealView Imaging Ltd. doctors are able to maipulate the images simply by 'touching' them as they appear in mid-air . 'With the advancement of live 3D imaging and increasing clinical evidence of its value for a variety of procedures, we are convinced that our holographic technology will further enhance 3D imaging and, most importantly, improve patient care.' 'The holographic projections enabled me to intuitively understand and interrogate the 3D spatial anatomy of the patient's heart, as well as to navigate and appreciate the device-tissue interaction during the procedure,' said Dr. Einat Birk, pediatric cardiologist and Director of the Institute of Pediatric Cardiology at Schneider Children's Medical Center. Researchers testing an early prototype of the system . Dr. Elchanan Bruckheimer, pediatric cardiologist and Director of the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories at Schneider Children's Medical Center, added: 'The ability to reach into the image and apply markings on the soft tissue anatomy in the X-ray and 3D ultrasound images would be extremely useful for guidance of these complex procedures.' 'Our ultimate goal is to create the future of healthcare by delivering innovative solutions that enhance clinical capabilities and improve patient outcomes,' said Bert van Meurs, General Manager of Integrated Clinical Solutions and Marketing for Imaging Systems at Philips Healthcare. 'By teaming up with partners that share our passion for innovation, we have been able to demonstrate the feasibility and potential value of the world's first holographic visualization technology targeted at guiding minimally invasive cardiac procedures.' RealView Imaging has managed to invent and develop a system that can receive volumetric stream such as 3D Ultrasound or any other static or stream of volume/s, convert it in real-time to interference patterns and project true holograms using these interference patterns. The holograms that are projected are with high resolution and quality, they are with full color and can be viewed from a very wide angle. Moreover, the reconstructed holograms are within the user’s touching reach and remain in the same coordinates, independent of the viewer’s location. Realview says there are four main uses for its technology in the operating theatre . This proprietary capability enables precise and direct interaction with and within the images by literally touching the holograms and manipulating them in real-time. As these are true holograms there is a very high level of realism thus the viewer can intuitively comprehend even unique and complex 3D structures/pathologies and additionally the interaction with the images is as intuitive as grabbing an apple or painting a statue as the image is optically real and within touching reach. RealView’s unique IP combines advanced CGH algorithms combined with a sophisticated system level approach and cost-effective computation hardware solution enabling the calculation and then generation of real-time high quality dynamic images at a smooth continuous fashion at similar rates to conventional video projection .","Philips working with Israeli firm RealView to develop technology .

"Sergio Aguero is the best striker in the world, according to Glenn Hoddle and Jamie Carragher. The pair were speaking on Sky Sports ahead of Manchester City's trip to St. Mary's, where Manuel Pellegrini's side faced an in-form Southampton, who sit one place above them in the league. City are third in the Premier League behind Chelsea and their weekend opponents, and have Aguero to thank for the majority of their goals so far this season.

Jamie Carragher (left) and Glenn Hoddle (centre) were full of praise for Aguero as they discussed the game . Aguero (left) did not score for City against Southampton, but has 17 so far this season . 'He's the best finisher in the world,' former Tottenham midfielder Hoddle said. 'He's just above [Diego] Costa at this moment in time. Where would City be without him? They'd certainly be out of the Champions League. 'As a defender, you may think you're marking him, but you're not. He's in between defenders, it's so hard to mark.' Aguero had scored 17 goals in 18 appearances for Manuel Pellegrini's men going into Sunday's game, and Carragher believes that he is too good for the Champions League standard Manchester City have set in recent years. During the match against Southampton, Aguero was booked for diving after what looked a blatant foul . Carragher said that Aguero should be winning the Champions League, and not just playing in it as he is now . 'He's the best striker in the world. Man City need to freshen up. [Aguero] shouldn't [just] be  playing in the Champions League, he should be winning the Champions League. 'He comes alive 25, 30 yards from goal.

"Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans has withdrawn from this week’s Queen’s Speech debates as he fights what he yesterday described as ‘completely false’ rape claims. The senior Tory spoke of his ‘incredulity’ after being arrested over allegations by two men he had until then ‘regarded as friends’. Mr Evans, 55, who came out as gay in 2010 after years of gossip, said he had just endured ‘the worst 24 hours of my life’. After being released on bail, he vehemently denied the accusations, revealing that the men knew each other and that he had ‘continued to socialise with one as recently as last week’. Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans was spoken to about 'inappropriate sexual behaviour' four years ago, according to reports . Mr Evans, Conservative MP for Ribble Valley, today said that he had considered the two men who made the recent allegations against him to be 'friends' Mr Evans had what appeared to be a gash on his forehead which aides asked a television make-up artist to try to conceal before he made his statement. The injury was not evident in pictures taken of him on Thursday night when he was out in Soho with former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik. News of Saturday’s arrest at the constituency home of the popular MP for the Ribble Valley in Lancashire came as a huge shock to colleagues at Westminster, many of whom spoke out in his support. Mr Evans has insisted he would not be stepping down from his high-profile position as one of John Bercow’s deputies or as an MP. However, after Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said it would be difficult for him to continue in such a ‘sensitive’ role while police continue to investigate the allegations, it emerged that he had asked to be excused from his ceremonial duties following Wednesday’s State Opening of Parliament. Instead of Mr Evans chairing any Commons debates on the Queen’s Speech in the absence of Mr Bercow, that role will be performed by his fellow deputies, Dawn Primarolo and Lindsay Hoyle, Commons sources said last night. The decision means Mr Evans is unlikely to take the Speaker’s chair for at least a fortnight – giving all sides time to consider whether he can continue to carry out his duties while under police investigation. Deputy House speaker Nigel Evans said in his statement that he had socialised with one of his accusers as recently as last week . Close up: Mr Evans appeared to have covered up a scar on his forehead with make-up when he addressed the press outside his home today . It was on Saturday morning that Mr Evans was arrested at his home in the idyllic village of Pendleton, near Clitheroe. He has owned the £250,000 two-bedroom terrace cottage – which has a small House of Commons portcullis on its wooden nameplate – for 15 years. Lancashire police – who did not name him to the media – said they were investigating allegations that he raped one man and sexually assaulted another, both in their 20s, in Pendleton between 2009 and March this year. Officers spent the day searching his London and Lancashire homes as well as his car, a white Saab convertible parked in the village. He was released on bail on Saturday night, shortly afterwards saying on Facebook: ‘Thanks for the amazing overwhelming support at this difficult time.’ Yesterday he issued a strongly worded statement in the beer garden of the Camra award-winning Swan With Two Necks pub next to his home. ‘Yesterday I was interviewed by the police concerning complaints made by two people who are well known to each other and who until yesterday I regarded as friends,’ he said. 'Incredulity': Mr Evans said he could not understand why the 'completely false' accusations had been made . Support: The Deputy House speaker Nigel Evans thanked his colleagues, friends and members of the public for their support . Denial: Mr Evans said the allegations against him were 'completely false' ‘The allegations are completely  false and I can’t understand why they have been made, especially as I have continued to socialise with one as recently as last week. ‘I appreciate the way the police have handled this in such a sensitive manner, and I’d like to thank my colleagues, friends and members of the public who have expressed their support and – like me – a sense of incredulity at these events.’ A few minutes earlier a TV crew worker had applied make-up to his forehead in an attempt to conceal what appeared to be a large blue-tinged cut. Mr Evans – said to be ‘very shaken up’ by his arrest – refused to answer questions except answering ‘ok’ when asked how he felt. After a lunchtime drink at the pub, Mr Evans said that ‘notwithstanding the death of my mum, and the loss of my brother very recently’, he had endured ‘the worst 24 hours of my life’. In 2009 the Daily Mail told how the MP had spoken of ‘shocking’ failures at Singleton Hospital in Swansea following the death of his 86-year-old mother from the superbug C.diff. Going home: Nigel Evans was last night driven from Preston police station after questioning by detectives . Thorough: Officers search the MP's white Saab convertible parked in his home village of Pendleton in Lancashire . Quaint: This image shows Mr Evans' village in Pendleton. His white Saab is pictured to the left of the stream in the distance . On patrol: Uniformed Lancashire Police officers maintain their presence in the village . Mr Evans said yesterday he had been ‘bolstered’ by the ‘amazing, overwhelming support’ he had received, both from residents of his ‘biscuit-tin-picture-like village’ but also ‘phenomenal’ backing on Facebook. In addition to online support, Mr Evans was backed by family, neighbours and political colleagues. His 49-year-old sister, Louise Collins, who took over their father’s newsagent’s business in Swansea after his death, said: ‘The family love him to death and we’re 100 per cent behind him.’ His local Conservative Association released a statement saying: ‘In our democracy everyone accused is innocent until proven guilty and therefore unless Nigel chooses himself to cease to be our MP or the electorate vote him out or justice system intervenes, we expect him to continue as normal to fulfil his duties in representing the people of the Ribble Valley.’ Arrested: Nigel Evans is pictured with David Cameron, who has been informed about the claims . Quizzed: Mr Evans is pictured posing with two dancers . Brian Binley, Tory MP for Northampton South and a friend of Mr Evans, said he had been ‘deeply disturbed and shocked’ at his arrest. ‘I know him to be caring, compassionate, and in no way would he inflict himself violently on any other person,’ he said. Leicestershire Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who was accused of a sex assault two years ago only for police to drop their inquiries six days later, also said Mr Evans should continue. Earlier, however, Mr Hammond told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show that while he stuck ‘rigidly’ to the principle of innocent until proven guilty, ‘it is quite difficult to carry out a sensitive and high-profile role while being under this kind of scrutiny’. Tory sources stressed that, as Deputy Speaker, Mr Evans does not technically take the Conservative whip, so the question of it being withdrawn does not arise. The high-profile arrest will fuel the debate over whether anonymity should be granted to those suspected but not charged over sex offences. Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair told Sky News that while it was ‘a real problem, I think the names have to be given’.

"Click here for everything you need to know about the first knockout stage. Chelsea will face Paris Saint-Germain in the knockout stages of the Champions League for the second consecutive season after the two teams were paired together in Monday's draw. Both clubs eased through the group stage and into the 16, but how do they match-up ahead of next year's two-legged tie? Sportsmail guides you through the  second-round clash. Zlatan Ibrahimovic and his Paris Saint-Germain team-mates await Chelsea in the Champions League . Will Chelsea be happy with the draw? Yes. Jose Mourinho had hoped to face the Ligue 1 champions due to the short and simple journey across the Channel. The Blues could have faced easier opposition in Basle, Bayer Leverkusen or Shakhtar Donetsk, but they will know what to expect after knocking Laurent Blanc's side out at the quarter-final stage last season. They also avoided Italian champions Juventus, which can't be a bad thing. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho was hoping to draw PSG due to the short journey to Paris, France . Will PSG be happy with the draw? Not particularly. They could've drawn Porto, Borussia Dortmund or Atletico Madrid so to get Premier League leaders Chelsea is a bit of a blow. But having said that, they did avoid favourites Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. PSG vs Chelsea, Tuesday February 17 . Chelsea vs PSG, Wednesday March 11 . Have the two teams met before? Yes. Chelsea recovered from a 3-1 defeat against PSG in the first leg of their quarter-final last season to dump Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Co out on the away goals rule. A 2-0 victory at Stamford Bridge was enough for Mourinho's men, with Demba Ba scoring late on to make himself a hero. Prior to last season's meeting, the two clubs last met in the 2004-05 group stage. Chelsea earned a convincing win at the Parc des Princes in September 2004 as a double from Didier Drogba and another from John Terry sealed a 3-0 victory. But they couldn't repeat the feat on home soil as PSG fought for a 0-0 draw. Paris Saint-Germain's official Twitter account referenced last season's quarter-final tie between the sides . Who do Chelsea have to watch out for? Key man: Zlatan Ibrahimovic . A star under Mourinho at Inter Milan, Ibrahimovic will be looking to get one over his former manager after Chelsea's triumph earlier this year. The Swede has two goals in three games in this season's Champions League and he has hit eight in 10 in Ligue 1, too. If fit, he will lead the line for PSG and could prove a thorn in the side of Terry and Co. Ibrahimovic (second from left) celebrates scoring against his former Barcelona in the group stage . Elsewhere, Brazil defender David Luiz has something to prove to Mourinho after being allowed to leave Stamford Bridge in a £50million deal last summer. And Edinson Cavani, with five Champions League goals in six appearances this season, will be looking to continue his fine form in Europe. And what about the managers? This tie will provide the third and fourth meetings between Mourinho and Blanc, with both having one win to their name so far. They didn't see eye-to-eye when Chelsea and PSG met back in April, with the Portuguese suggesting that winning the title in France was easy. Blanc hit back: 'Maybe if we're talking about the league and I'm sure that Jose Mourinho knows the French league very well. There are two really big clubs in Ligue 1 (PSG and Monaco), but if I remember correctly, I think it was the same for him in Spain, with Barcelona and Madrid.' Laurent Blanc has not always got along with Mourinho, who he will come up against twice next year . What kind of draw is it for the fans? An affordable one. Supporters can get to France by plane, train and ferry, giving them plenty of options to follow their team abroad. They could also choose to drive direct to Paris from London in about five-and-a-half hours. What has it done for Chelsea's chances of winning the Champions League? Lessened them according to the bookmakers. Chelsea are now 7-1 to lift the trophy in Berlin next May, out from 11-2 before the draw was made in Nyon.","Chelsea face Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League .

"A Spanish football supporter has died hours after sustaining fatal injuries following street clashes between rival fans of Atletico Madrid and Deportivo La Coruna prior to the’ La Liga fixture in the Spanish capital on Sunday. The man has been named as 43-year-old Deportivo supporter Francisco Javier Romero Taboada, who passed away at Madrid’s Hospital Clínico San Carlos on Sunday afternoon. He was pulled out of the Manzanares river near Atletico’s Vicente Calderon stadium earlier on having suffered cardiac arrest, hypothermia and head injuries. Deportivo La Coruna and Atletico Madrid fans clash outside Vicente Calderon Stadium on Sunday . The National Professional Football League (LFP), who were aware of the severity of the supporter’s condition before the start of the match, had tried to get the fixture called off but they were unable to do so as they could not contact The Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF). A match referee is only permitted to call off a fixture under the orders of RFEF. LFP sources also revealed that senior figures at the league organisation had attempted to get the match suspended during the first half, after it had started. The supporter was in a critical condition when the match started at midday Spanish time and his condition deteriorated rapidly. He is believed to have passed away between 2pm and 3pm. Rival fans were filmed throwing objects at each other on and near the road alongside the Manzanares river . The man  was taken out of the river suffering head injuries, cardiac arrest and hypothermia, before dying . The brawls, which reportedly involved the Frente Atletico and the Riazor Blues ultras groups and took place near the stadium and the Manzanares river, started at around 8.40am, three hours and 20 minutes before kick-off. Atletico Madrid won the match 2-0. In addition to the deceased, 10 others, including a policeman, suffered injuries. Twenty-five people have been arrested, while a further 30 have been identified, with reports suggesting up to 180 people were involved in the disturbances. Presidents of both La Liga teams condemned the violence and distanced themselves from the incident. Deportivo La Coruna fans raise their scarves during their match against Atletico Madrid on Sunday . Atletico's Arda Turan shapes to cross in his side's 2-0 win over Deportivo La Coruna . Atletico president Enrique Cerezo, speaking before the supporter’s death was announced, said: 'I want to say that this has nothing to do with football. These are radical groups who meet up and these are the consequences. 'I repeat that neither Atletico nor Deportivo have anything to do with these incidents, they are organised by radical groups who have their histories and their accounts to settle.' Meanwhile Deportivo president Tino Fernández said: 'It’s tragic news. I want to express our vehement opposition to violence.' Sunday's incident was not the first death involving a football supporter near the Vicente Calderon stadium. In December 1998, a Real Sociedad supporter Aitor Zabaleta died after he was stabbed by a rival fan, who was later sentenced to 17 years in prison.","A 43-year-old Deportivo fan died after suffering head injuries .

"Gary Cahill has been taken out of the line of fire by Jose Mourinho, who will rest the defender who was accused of diving for Tuesday night's Capital One Cup quarter-final at Derby. Hull boss Steve Bruce accused Cahill of simulation - 'like something out of Swan Lake', the Tigers boss said - following Chelsea's 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Bruce felt Cahill should have been shown a second yellow card. The England centre-back will be replaced by Kurt Zouma for the trip to Derby, even though Blues manager Mourinho has vowed to field 'the best possible team'. Gary Cahill escaped a second booking against Hull despite this dive which caused controversy . Hull manager Steve Bruce claimed Cahill's dive was 'like something out of Swan Lake' Jose Mourinho insists he is resting his centre-back because he played him against Sporting last week . 'We're going to play against a top team in the Championship,' Mourinho told Chelsea TV. 'The difference between a top team in the Championship and the teams of the Premier League are very, very small. We played there last year and it was not an easy game. 'We have no reason to rest people. Everybody goes. The only one that is not going because he played against Sporting (Lisbon) - I never gave him a break - is Cahill. 'Cahill doesn't play, I play Zouma.' It is a decision which may have been taken ahead of the diving storm when Chelsea had Diego Costa and Willian booked for simulation. Cahill is due a rest as he was not one of the six players switched out of the side for last week's Champions League match with Sporting Lisbon. Two Chelsea players, Diego Costa (above) and WIllian, were booked for diving during Saturday's win . Young defender Kurt Zouma will replace Cahill for the Capital One clash against Derby on Tuesday night . But the timing is convenient for Mourinho, who last season lambasted Luis Suarez for an 'acrobatic swimming pool jump' as he railed against simulation in English football. He also insisted 'there are no divers at Chelsea' following Oscar's booking for simulation at Southampton on January 1. Prior to the Hull contest, Mourinho insisted none of his players would be ever-presents over the congested Christmas schedule. The Derby match is Chelsea's fourth fixture of December and they now play six games in 19 days until their FA Cup third-round tie with Watford on January 4. 'I don't think one player is going to play these six matches,' Mourinho said. 'Every one of them has to go to five, the ones that play more they have to go to five; one (game) rest I think I have to give them. 'We did that against Sporting, we gave a rest to some players and we're going to do this from now until the end of the month.' Chelsea boss Mourinho will give his players a couple of days off this week ahead of the Christmas period . Mourinho will afford his players rest following the Derby match, with Chelsea's next game the Premier League contest at Stoke next Monday. 'We have two days off, which is the two days after Derby, which allows the players to go home,' Mourinho added. 'Maybe not, for sure, the South American ones, because it's very far, but the ones around England, Belgium, France, Germany, two days off; they have the chance at least to go and have a nice dinner with their families. 'It's the only two days I can give them. We play Tuesday against Derby, I give them Wednesday and Thursday, after that they are back Friday to play Monday.' Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is unlikely to be risked after missing the Premier League leaders' win over Hull with a minor muscular injury, so Petr Cech is poised to continue in goal. Petr Cech is likely to stay in goal for the Derby clash with Thibaut Courtois having missed Saturday's win . Playmaker Cesc Fabregas is available following suspension but Brazil midfielder Ramires is not yet ready to start following a groin problem. 'Ramires is being a champion, fantastic professional, step by step, working hard, always available for the team,' Mourinho added. 'He's in trouble. He's not ready to start a game. He comes to the bench and every time we can we give him a little bit (more).' Chelsea won 2-0 at Derby's iPro Stadium last season in the third round of the FA Cup and will next face familiar opposition in the Champions League, too. The Blues were drawn against Paris St Germain in the last 16, with the first leg at the Parc des Princes on February 17 and the return on March 11. It sees David Luiz reunited with Chelsea, who edged last season's quarter-final on away goals.","Defender Gary Cahill escaped booking for dive against Hull .

"A LONG (long) time ago, in a seaside town not too far away, there sat a rickety old pier. On the outside, there was nothing remarkable about the landmark in Southwold. Just another decaying British icon being swallowed up by the sea. However, on the inside, there sat a champion. Volley good show! There are simply bucket-loads of events to play through . An arcade game of such brilliance that only the finest competitors would insert 20p. Names like 'ACE', 'AAA', 'ABC'... and 'ASS' topped the leaderboards with pride - flashing away at passersby, daring them to step up to the single joystick and three red buttons. Many would walk on by and sit in the Star Wars game pretending to be Luke Skywalker. Not this gamer. I spent most, if not all, of my summer holidays to Southwold trying to break records and be crowned a champion on Track & Field. It was button-mashing genius which required great timing, even better angles and game-hardened finger and thumb tips. It was a hop, skip and jump ahead of anything else. This was over 25 years ago. Since then, most athletics games have failed to even get close to the magic of Track & Field. They’ve huffed and puffed their way onto our consoles in a bid to make money off the back of a big event. So, is London 2012 - The Official Video Game of the Olympic Games one of these titles that have forgotten their roots? Yes and no. Because although there are plenty of flaws to this game, there is a sense of a genuine attempt by developer SEGA Australia to make a good athletics title. I'm the champ! Beating your mates never gets boring . One that understands that button mashing is an athletic talent, one that takes years of training and blisters in the strive for Olympic greatness. Firstly, there are plenty of events to keep you busy. Track and Field sees you taking on 100m, 200m, 400m and 110m hurdles. There is also javelin, shot-put, long jump, triple jump and high jump. Away from the obvious, you can also try some diving, swimming, canoeing, shooting and er, trampolining. Visually, the game is a success and the stadiums and arenas really do give you a sense of what it will be like for athletes competing there. So does the gameplay deserve a medal? Well, maybe. And it would probably only be a bronze. The sprinting, for example, is fairly simply. Press A to start and then strike a fine balance on the sprint meter between yellow and red. This involves a precise button mashing that keeps you in the green zone - the longer you’re there, the faster you go. The same can be said for the 400m, but this time you have a stamina gauge - use it all up on the first bend and your athlete will be exhausted for the rest of the race. The idea is fantastically old-school, but the execution is a little flaky. On the long jump, for example, you have to flick the analogue stick a perfect 45 degrees - but the sweet spot is too fine to get close to on a regular basis which puts you off after a few attempts. It's button-mashing time: You will need strong fingers and thumbs to master this . The high jump also suffers from inconsistencies - sometimes the AI will flick your feet when you ask it, other times it just ignores you. The swimming isn’t bad. Depending on what stroke you’re attempting there are different controls you need plus hitting the correct button at the right time for a powerful tumble-turn. But again, the smallest mistake means you lose all control of the stroke and have to build up your momentum again. The commentary is a pain, too. The same voices say the same thing and often the comments don’t correlate to the action. I had one chap saying: 'It’s good..it looks good..that is a fantastic jump!' Sadly, my mis-timed run-up left me jumping too early and just about making a jump into the sand. Despite these gripes, you still get immense satisfaction when you pull off a fantastic javelin throw, or pip someone over the finish line to take the Gold and a new World Record. You can line-up a range of events and customise them like a playlist, which is a nice touch. Or you can take part in the Games themselves. Multiplayer is the best way to approach this game, especially if you have competitive friends. Looking ace: The Olympics game even serves up some table tennis action . However, the Kinect aspect is a spectacular (Fosbury) flop. It’s clearly just a rushed extra that’s been bolted on for looks. As well as a change in commentary (from the English team you suddenly get an excited American), it turns into an ugly 'party' game. The controls are sloppy and unresponsive - and by the time you’ve rearranged your lounge to fit into the 'playing area', you’re too knackered to pretend to throw a javelin. This is an okay game and it’s one you might go back to now and again.But you won’t go back to every summer. Oh, and keep an eye out for your high scores - they will be compared with other gamers around the world. It’s pretty depressing, though. Although I hurled the javelin to a new PB of 90.12m … I’m later told that some other player has gone over 105m. Cheats, I say - using some kind of cyber steroids. I didn’t catch the names. Could well have been 'AAA', 'ACE' or 'ABC'... Follow Owen on Twitter: @OsOwn and on Facebook: Daily Mail Games .","Brings back the much-loved button-mashing mayhem many would have missed .

"Russia, Qatar and England have all been accused of breaking FIFA rules during the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in a document published by Parliament. A dossier compiled by the Sunday Times and published by the Culture, Media and Sport select committee accuses Russia and Qatar of engaging in vote-trading and vote-buying while England's 2018 bid are alleged to have engineered a failed vote-swap with their counterparts in the South Korea 2022 bid. All three organisations have always denied any wrongdoing in their bids to host the tournaments, and a report published recently by Hans-Joachim Eckert, the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA's ethics committee, cleared Russia and Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments respectively. Hans-Joachim Eckert (right) is the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of the FIFA ethics committee . Michael Garcia, chairman of the investigatory chamber of the FIFA ethics committee (left), poses with Eckert, who recently cleared Russia and Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments respectively . The Sunday Times claims the allegations it submitted to Parliament were contained within a database which it says was compiled by England's 2018 bidding team. The chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, John Whittingdale, admitted none of the allegations in the Sunday Times dossier had been proven but said they gave the impression of FIFA being a 'deeply corrupt organisation'. 'Today we have published the latest evidence (the Sunday Times) have given to us which does suggest that the (Football Association) themselves compiled a very substantial amount of information suggesting corrupt practices in the process,' he told Sky News. 'Also suggesting that England was involved in some kind of collusion as well during that process. These are questions that need to be answered. FIFA president Sepp Blatter holds up the name of Russia during the announcement of the 2018 World Cup host . FIFA president Blatter announces that Qatar will be hosting the 2022  World Cup next to the famous trophy . Russia and Qatar were recently cleared to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments respectively . 'What it is alleged England have been doing is mild compared to the allegations made against some of the other nations but nevertheless it is obviously serious, it is a breach of the rules, and therefore we will want to know whether or not it is true and how the FA justify it. 'When we last spoke to the FA we asked whether or not they had any further evidence of corrupt practices and they said they didn't. 'So that in itself is worrying because it now appears that they were sitting on this dossier which contains substantial evidence. 'I think they were obviously reluctant to reveal what had been going on in terms of the investigations and obviously a lot of it is reports and hearsay. It isn't necessarily hard evidence, it isn't proven. 'But nonetheless, when it is taken together with all the other evidence that has already been accumulated it does paint a picture of (FIFA as) a deeply corrupt organisation and that the whole of the World Cup bidding process was completely flawed.' Russia, Qatar and England have been accused of breaking FIFA rules during previous bidding processes . Russian president Vladimir Putin at a press conference after Russia won the right to host the 2018 World Cup . He added: 'We need to really have a new start with the whole process and (FIFA) need to rewrite the rules.' The latest revelations come while three current FIFA executive committee members plus former member Franz Beckenbauer are under investigation by ethics investigator Michael Garcia. Spain's Angel Maria Villar Llona, Michel D'Hooghe from Belgium and Worawi Makudi from Thailand are among the names being looked at by Garcia for possible ethics code breaches, according to sources close to the world governing body. Beckenbauer is also under investigation by American attorney Garcia along with Harold Mayne-Nicholls from Chile, who headed the inspection team which compiled reports into the countries bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Garcia (pictured) responded after Eckert cleared Russia and Qatar by notifying FIFA that he intended to lodge an appeal  due to 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts' Garcia and Eckert (pictured) revealed on November 20 confirming  individuals were under investigation . Garcia and German judge Eckert released a joint statement on November 20 confirming a number of individuals were under investigation. Earlier this month Eckert cleared Russia and Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups saying rule breaches by the bidding countries were 'of very limited scope'. Garcia responded by notifying FIFA that he intended to lodge an appeal against the decision due to 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts'. FIFA has also lodged a separate criminal complaint with the Swiss attorney general. The FA released a statement on Sunday afternoon which read: 'The FIFA ethics committee made specific requests and responding to these requests involved searching in excess of half a million documents. 'The search parameters were established with Mr Garcia's office. The documents searched included intelligence gathered by the bid team. All documents within the search parameters were disclosed. 'In addition (England 2018 bid chief executive) Andy Anson has confirmed that any intelligence that he believed could be substantiated was shared with Mr Garcia in his interview and that everything else was hearsay, gossip and rumour.'","Russia and Qatar are accused of engaging in vote-trading and vote-buying .

"The descendants of a Jewish family who owned a chain of department stores in Germany that were seized by the Nazis have been awarded £40 million in compensation. A Berlin court ordered that the payment should be made to the Schocken family, whose shops were lost during the so-called 'Aryanisation' of businesses in 1938. The family was already paid almost £12 million in compensation in the 1990s for one of the buildings that was seized, but say other property their family owned was undervalued. A former Schocken family department store in the city of Chemnitz, which was seized by the Nazis in 1938 . And the court ordered that the heirs to the business, who live in Israel and the United States should receive the additional cash. The Schocken chain of department stores were founded by brothers Simon and Salman Schocken in the early 1900s with their first outlet in Leipzig. Their business then went on to open 20 stores, mainly in the Saxony area of Germany. Salman Schocken became the sole owner of the family firm when his brother Simon died in a car crash in 1929. During the rise of the Nazis, Mr Schocken was politically forced to sell his department stores during the Aryanisation of German business. At this time, the Nazis forced non-Aryans, which were mainly Jews to surrender or sell their interests in Nazi Germany business life in a bid to deprive them of their wealth. One of the buildings which house a Schocken department store was recently transformed into the State Museum for Archaeology in Chemnizt, Germany . Schocken's best known building in the eastern city of Chemnitz was designed by the architect Erich Mendelsohn and now houses the State Museum of Archaeology. The family started to pursue their claim for compensation in 1994, meaning it took 20 years for them to be awarded full compensation. Family lawyer Bernd Wilhelm Schmitz told Bloomberg his clients were delighted with the ruling. He said: 'You find us very happy to finally have the Jewish victims compensated after almost a quarter of a century of legal battles. 'This hasn’t been a case like any other, moving us very much on a personal level as well.' A spokeswoman for the German Finance Ministry said they would be reviewing the written judgement on the case when it is released before deciding whether they should appeal.","Court ordered £40 million in compensation to be paid to Schocken family .

"Ask any Welshman and they will tell you theirs is a fiercely proud country with a rich cultural heritage. But it seems that BT call centre staff may not have got the message, after a 'proud Welshwoman' called her local office only to be told by a call handler in India: 'Wales? - never heard of it.' Eve Butler, 76, had called the communications giant with a query about her bill and asked to be put through to the company's Welsh Language Bureau two miles from her home. Instead Mrs Butler, from Bangor, North Wales, was put through to a call centre 5,500 miles away in India only to be asked by a call centre advisor: 'What's Welsh?' Eve Butler, 76, had called BT with a query about her bill and asked to be put through to the company's Welsh Language Bureau. Instead she was put through to a call centre in India only to be asked by a call centre advisor: 'What's Welsh?' Then, when the grandmother tried to explain it was the language spoken by herself and around 300,000 other people in Wales, the advisor said: 'I can't put you through because I don't know what Wales is.' The call ended shortly afterwards. Mrs Butler, a retired council worker, said: 'I just find it incredible that I live in Wales and want to be put through to a Welsh speaking service - yet I'm put thought to someone employed thousands of miles away in India who's never even heard of my home country - or the language. 'I speak fluent Welsh, I'm very proud to be Welsh and I'm very proud of Wales along with many hundreds of thousands of people who speak the language. 'Yet I find it unbelievable British Telecom workers not only don't have a clue where Wales they don't know what it is.' The incident occured after Mrs Butler called BT to set up a direct debit to pay her phone bill after she accidentally missed a payment. The firm's Welsh Language Bureau allows customers to BT in their native Welsh but an operator who initally fielded the call said she had not heard of it and promised another advisor would ring Mrs Butler back . A BT spokesman said it would like to apologise to Mrs Butler if the 'level of service she experienced fell below her expectations' The firm's Welsh Language Bureau allows customers to speak to BT in their native Welsh but an operator who initially fielded the call said she had not heard of it and promised another advisor would ring Mrs Butler back. Mrs Butler said: 'This isn't what I wanted at all. I speak Welsh and want to conduct my life in Welsh. BT offer a Welsh service and I wanted to make use of it. 'It was so odd. I had rung through and asked for a Welsh speaker but without success. I was called back and I asked if the caller was from the Welsh Language Bureau. 'He then said: ""What's Welsh?"" and I replied: ""It's the language spoken in Wales."" 'He then said: ""Where's Wales?"" So I told him it was a proud country in the UK with its own history and culture. Mrs Butler said she is passionate about promoting and preserving the Welsh language, and added 'I speak Welsh and want to conduct my life in Welsh' 'He then told me he couldn't put the call through because he didn't know what Wales was. It was unbelievable. I found it so frustrating but so funny at the same time. 'He told me he was talking to me from India. I live so close to the BT call centre in Bangor. All I wanted to do was speak to someone in my native language. Instead I was told that there was no such place as Wales.' Mrs Butler married an Englishman but her two daughters and two granddaughters all speak Welsh. She said that she is passionate about promoting and preserving the Welsh language, and added 'I speak Welsh and want to conduct my life in Welsh. 'The Welsh language service is important in many aspects. It provides an important service for the Welsh people but if no one uses it, perhaps because they don't know its there, or if advisors elsewhere don't know of it, then it would not be unreasonable for BT to conclude it isn't needed and close it down. 'That would have serious consequences for both the language and the people who work for the service.' A BT spokesman said: 'BT would like to apologise to Mrs Butler if our level of service fell below her expectations. She should have been advised of the correct number for the Welsh language Bureau in Bangor and we are sorry this didn't happen on this occasion. 'The Bureau is open Monday to Saturday from 8am to 6pm and can be contacted on 0800 800 288. The bureau can handle many customer issues including billing, faults, new product orders and rental packages. 'The bureau has now been in touch with Mrs Butler and has resolved the issue she had.' Last year a report by the Welsh Language Board said the number of fluent Welsh speakers is falling by around 3,000 people a year. It said around 6,500 Welsh speakers die annually and 5,200 move away from Wales - out-pacing adult learners and children learning or raised in Welsh. In 2011,  BT was forced to apologise to Viv Tomkins after they claimed Indian call centre staff could not understand her Birmingham accent. The 59 year old had been told via letter that call centre staff had 'difficulty in resolving your inquiries whenever the advisers you have been speaking to are having problems understanding you.'","Eve Butler, 76, had asked to be put through to BT's Welsh Language Bureau two miles from her home .

"Las Vegas police have released a shocking surveillance video showing the final moments of Jerad and Amanda Miller as they made their last stand in a Walmart after slaughtering two police officers and a civilian. The video appears to show the couple pointing pistols at each other before Amanda fires a shot at her husband. Jerad Miller collapses and dies, then Amanda turns the handgun on herself. Despite appearances in the video, Las Vegas police said Wednesday that it was actually police officers who killed Jerad. Police say an autopsy has revealed Jerad, 31, was killed by a .223-caliber rifle round - not a handgun - moments before Amanda, 22, shot her husband. Three officers fired their weapons at him after following the couple into the store. Scroll down for video . Shocking: This video shows Amanda Miller (bottom) pointing a pistol at her husband Jerad (top) as he points his weapon at her - moments before he was shot and killed. Police now say SWAT officers fired the fatal bullets . Authorities also revealed that they had contact with Jerad and Amanda Miller three times since they moved to Las Vegas earlier this year - including once just days before their rampage. Assistant Sheriff Kevin McMahill said officers had no reason to believe Jerad was planning a mass shooting in any of the instances. He appeared calm and did not espouse the white supremacist and anti-government views for which he has since become infamous, the Las Vegas Journal-Review reports. The Millers slaughtered two Las Vegas police officers, Alyn Beck, 41, and Igor Soldo, 31, as they ate lunch Sunday afternoon - shooting both a close range. They then ran into a nearby Walmart, where Jerad fired a shot into the ceiling and declared 'this is the revolution' and demanded everyone leave. Joseph Robert Wilcox, 31, a shopper who was carrying a concealed weapon, tried to sneak up on Jerad. However, as he did, he passed by Amanda, not realizing the two were together. Amanda shot Wilcox at close range, killing him. Jerad Miller (top) appears to have died after being shot either by his wife Amanda or by police officers in this image from Walmart surveillance video . Police footage recently released shows the Millers taking cover in the Walmart where their last stand took place. Bradbury claims that he was affiliated with the same group as Jerad and Amanda Miller, the '765 Anarchists' The couple then fled to a back corner of the store, where they prepared to make their last stand as officers armed with assault rifles closed in. The Walmart surveillance video shows both laying on the ground, pointing handguns at each other. Amanda appears to fire her weapon at her husband, a moment later he goes limp. The 22-year-old Indiana woman then turns the gun on herself. The video cuts out a moment before she fires the pistol into her own head. Police originally reported that Amanda had killed her husband, however, autopsy results and further investigation revealed it was police officers who fired the fatal shot. All three officers who shot at Jerad Miller are on paid leave, as per the department policy on firing a weapon on duty. The Millers frequently dressed as comic book villains from Batman. Jerad especially loved the anarchist Joker . Police also revealed that they had interactions with the Millers on three occasions. In February, the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles called Las Vegas police and asked them to investigate threats Jerad Miller had made against the office. When reached at his apartment, Miller claim he never threatened anyone and said his comment was that 'that's how people get shot.' 'The interaction was normal; there were no anti-government or anti-police” statements. They did not feel through the interview that the suspects were a potential threat,' McMahill said at a press conference Thursday. Police also visited in April and took a witness statement from the Millers in relation to a domestic violence report filed by their neighbors. Finally, on May 31, the Millers gave a witness statement for a sexual assault that occurred in their apartment complex. Jerad Miller, in particular, was an avowed neo-Nazi who frequently spouted conspiracy theories about the world. After he and his wife murdered the officers, he draped their bodies with a Gadsden flag, the yellow symbol of the Tea Party, and a swastika.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A greedy postman who has been jailed after stealing nearly £250,000 worth of post was using the money to 'feather his nest'. Paul Doughty, 57, bought a timeshare in the Canary Islands and a caravan, a court was told. The Liverpool resident also kept most of his ill-gotten gains in bank accounts with balances ranging from £10,000 to £25,000. Royal Mail was forced to pay out £228,935.28 in insurance claims as a result of his crimes. Jailed: Paul Doughty stole almost £250,000 worth of post and used some of the money to buy a timeshare in the Canary Islands . Officials launched an investigation in 2011 after a number of customers complained they had not received recorded delivery parcels. The pattern of missing mail soon pointed to driver Doughty and a surveillance operation in August 2011 spotted the Warrington mail centre employee stopping on the hard shoulder of the M6 heading to Birmingham. Simon Clarke, prosecuting, told Warrington Crown Court: 'A Royal Mail investigation found there had been a sustained campaign of theft of special delivery bulk mail often used for sending reasonably high value items including currency and jewellery. Luxury: The Canary Islands in Spain (file picture), where Doughty bought a timeshare. He also bought a caravan using the money he made from his crimes . 'He was stopping his Royal Mail HGV at . the side of the motorway and removing mail sacks and putting them into . black bin bags before hiding them in bushes at the roadside. 'When he had finished his duty he would return in a private vehicle to collect the bags and dispose of them through what is thought to be a network of buyers.' Caught: A surveillance operation in August 2011 spotted the Warrington mail centre employee's thefts . He added the total loss to Royal Mail could not be calculated as many people do not report missing post. Doughty made no comment to a number of questions during police interview and initially pleaded not guilty. He then admitted fraud charges in March before being sentenced. His wife Pauline was also accused of having a hand in the operation but the charges were later dropped. Johnathon Duffy, defending, said Doughty had been an 'exemplary employee' for 16 years. He added: 'To his shame as he approached retirement, he gave in to temptation. 'He is dreadfully sorry and the consequences to him and his family are going to be disastrous as everything he has saved and worked for will be taken from him.' Judge Roger Dutton said he had no choice but to jail Doughty for three years and nine months. He added: 'Those who are employed by Royal Mail have a special position and are regarded as people the public have a high degree of trust in. 'You took thorough and complete advantage to feather your own nest while you and your wife were in a healthy financial position. 'This was pure, unadulterated greed.'

"Emile Heskey in training with Bolton in a picture shared by the club's official Twitter feed . Bolton Wanderers gave fans a tantalising glimpse of Emile Heskey in training with the club on Wednesday morning as Neil Lennon weighs up whether to sign the former England centre forward. Heskey, 36, is hoping to impress Lennon and looked to be in good shape. The Wanderers boss said in a press conference on Thursday: 'Emile is training hard. There is an Under 21s game (against Reading) on Monday and we're hoping to have a look at him in that.' The fact Bolton's official Twitter feed shared a picture of him putting in the hard yards suggests a short-term deal could be on the cards. Only last week Bolton re-signed club legend Eidur Gudjohnsen, also 36, until the end of the season with the Trotters facing a striker crisis. Lennon was forced to deploy 19-year-old Conor Wilkinson  up front on his own in the draw against Ipswich on Saturday. First-choice target man Craig Davies is injured, as is fellow forward Joe Mason and on Thursday it was confirmed that Max Clayton will be out for six months. Gudjohnsen was brought on for half-an-hour at the Macron Stadium last weekend as he started his bid to gain match fitness. But while Lennon's other attacking options lack experience, the Icelander and Heskey have 140 international caps between them. 'And about 100 years together as well,' Gudjohnsen joked last week. Their actual combined age is 72. 'He's a physical presence and you can still see it,' added Gudjohnsen of Heskey. 'There's not much changed in him. If he wants to play and if he's hungry to play then I'd love for him to be with us. 'Any bit of quality, any bit of experience, any bit of competition within the group is always helpful and whether it's him or other players, we want to find a healthy competition to get the best out of each other.' Heskey scoring against Germany during England's 5-1 victory in Munich in 2001 . Eidur Gudjohnsen (centre) pictured back in action for Bolton after re-signing for the club last week . Gudjohnsen is back at the club he first joined in 1998, aiming to experience a late-career renaissance having returned to these shores following short stints with Tottenham, Stoke and Fulham. Gudjohnsen embarked on an upward trajectory when he left Bolton in 2000, enjoying trophy-laden spells at Chelsea and Barcelona, but he has failed to settle since despite playing in France, England, Greece and Belgium. Heskey, meanwhile, recently spent two years in Australia playing for Newcastle Jets. His top-flight career has seen him score 110 goals in 586 games for Leicester, Liverpool, Wigan Athletic, Birmingham City and Aston Villa.","Emile Heskey has been training with Bolton Wanderers .

"Natasha Corrett had struggled with 'every single diet there is' for years, watching her weight bob up and down and never understanding why she always felt so tired and bloated. A chance visit to an Ayurvedic Acupuncturist after injuring her back revealed her symptoms as 'acidic', and she was put on a two-week eating plan of oily fish, green tea, whole grains, green vegetables and almonds. She cut out fizzy drinks (including soda water and tonic), sugar, sweeteners, peanuts, white flours and chocolate - and in under a year she lost two stone and shrunk by two dress sizes. Natasha Corrett, founder of Honestly Healthy, whose celebrity clients include Robbie Williams, Natalie Imbruglia and Lisa Snowdon . Four years later, Natasha - who is Sienna Miller's step-sister - now runs the Honestly Healthy food company with her godmother, nutritionist Vicki Edgson, delivering home-cooked alkaline meals to celebrities including Robbie Williams, Kelly Holmes, Lisa Snowdon, Natalie Imbruglia and swimwear designer Melissa Odabash. WIlliams has called her food 'healthy yet ridiculously delicious', and Odabash has said: 'I can eat tillmy hearts content and still look great in my bikinis!"" And now Natasha and Vicki's's new book, Honestly Healthy: Eat With Your Body In Mind, The Alkaline Way', has received online praise from Victoria Beckham who tweeted her love for the recipe bible earlier this month. Speaking to MailOnline, Natasha said: 'The thing we really want to stress as much as possible is that this is not a diet - it's a healthy way of eating. The whole reason for creating it was to get out of faddy diets. 'The alkaline eating plan is about getting your body into the optimum state it can be in - and alkaline is healthier than acidic. 'When your body is alkaline you have clear skin, greater concentration, shiny hair - all the things you want with the bonus of weight loss.' Honestly Healthy, Natasha Corrett and Vicki Edgson's first alkaline cookbook . Did you know that a lemon when digested is alkaline? And that cows milk when digested is acidic? But when tested on the PH scale both are the opposite? Food groups behave differently in the body – some provide energy (carbohydrates), whilst others are the very rebuilding and repairing blocks of our bodies and brains (proteins) – and yet others feed our neurological systems, regulate our hormones, and protect us against damage and disease (essential fats). How these foods behave in the body is broken down into two classes – acid and alkaline. Our bodies function best when in an overall alkaline state, PH 7.365 and yet much of our current eating trends and diets are very acid-forming in the body, leading to internal stress on the digestive and other systems. Our bodies do amazing things with food – its our fuel, so why feed it with something that doesn’t make it perform at its optimum?  Here at HH we want to show you how to feel at your best all the time without compromising on taste and all those treats. From www.honestlyhealthyfood.com . The basis of Honestly Healthy is that you stick to alkaline foods - green vegetables, almonds, garlic, olive oil, lemons, tea - and cut out acidic foods such as oats, milk, chicken and rhubarb.

'The best thing is that when you do go back to eating all these things 30 per cent of the time, you won't feel as good as when you don't eat them at all.

"Homeland actor Damian Lewis has told how going to Eton was the perfect training for his upcoming role as Henry VIII. The 43-year-old, who has become one of Britain’s biggest acting exports after making his name with roles in Homeland and Band Of Brothers, revealed more about his time at the top independent boarding school after being awarded an OBE. He was handed the honour, which he described as a ‘huge surprise’, by fellow Old Etonion, the Duke of Cambridge, at an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace this week. Scroll down for videos . In costume: Actor Damian Lewis, from Band Of Brothers and Homeland, is set to portray King Henry VIII . His royal highness: Lewis, 43, (right) will play  King Henry VIII (left) in the BBC1 adaptation of Wolf Hall . Chuffed: Lewis was awarded an OBE at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday afternoon for his contribution to acting. He compared receiving the honour to a similar feeling to being asked to be school prefect at Eton . With 11 years between Lewis and 32-year-old Prince William, the pair did not cross paths at Eton, the esteemed boarding school located near Windsor, which they both attended. However, after receiving the honour, Lewis said his time at the school had prepared him well for taking on his next role, as Henry VIII in a six-part BBC adaptation of Wolf Hall, Hilary Mantel’s Man Booker prize-winning historical novel. Speaking to The Sunday Times, he said: ‘I think there is no question that it helps having had the kind of schooling I’ve had to play a king. ‘It’s not such a leap oddly – even though the thought of being a monarch of any nation is mind-boggling and not something I could imagine easily at all. ‘But, yes, there’s just the sort of court structure, hierarchies and the way they are set up which is something I understand.’ His comments came after he compared his OBE, which he received on Wednesday afternoon, to being made a school prefect, as he felt it put him under pressure to be extremely responsible and to prove himself. 'I remember when I heard I was being awarded it, it was a little bit like ""now you've got to prove it"",' he said. 'It was a bit like being asked to be a prefect, now I have to be extremely responsible.' Honour: The actor, 43, said the honour, presented by the Duke of Cambridge, was as a complete surprise . 'Huge surprise': Lewis and Prince William chatted at Buckingham Palace during the investiture ceremony . Proud: Lewis was accompanied to the ceremony on Wednesday by his doting wife, actress Helen McCrory . Photo opportunity: Loving wife Helen took the opportunity to get some special snaps for the family album . Eton has educated 19 British Prime Ministers, generations of aristocracy, including William and his brother Prince Harry, and a number of actors including Eddie Redmayne, Dominic West, Hugh Laurie and Tom Hiddleston. Speaking about the educational establishment previously, Lewis told Esquire magazine: 'Suddenly all these little kingpins arrived from their own schools. You’re surrounded by the best of the best. 'Eton is an extraordinary place. And it’s interesting because unless you’re going to Oxford or Cambridge, you feel a bit like you’ve been to the best university already. 'Because the facilities are second to none. The history, the place, the sense of belonging to a tradition – you can’t beat it.' The actor, who is married to actress Helen McCrory, will take on his meatiest role yet in Wolf Hall, which is set to be shown on BBC1 in January. Combining two of Mantel’s books – Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies – the adaptation will chart the rise to power of Thomas Cromwell in the court of Henry VIII. Prepared: Lewis said his time at English boarding school Eton (pictured) had helped him with his latest role . Next job: Lewis will play Henry VIII in the BBC adaptation of Hilary Mantel's (left) book Wolf Hall (right) The TV drama, which is a co-production between Company Pictures and Playground, was agreed more than two years ago, with Peter Kosminsky as director and actor Mark Rylance in the role of Cromwell. Lewis rose to fame with his performance as Major Richard Winters in the 2001 Second World War epic Band Of Brothers and found international one again more recently in Homeland - in which he played returning prisoner of war Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody. The US drama has won five Golden Globe awards since it first aired in 2011 and describing its appeal Lewis said: 'I think people watch Homeland for different reasons. 'There's a compelling thriller at the centre of it, but I think people also got very engaged in the relationship at the centre of it between the CIA officer and this turned soldier. 'And how damaged they both were made their relationship compelling, (they were) co-dependent and needy and un-trusting at times and romantic and explosive at other times. 'Set against a backdrop of a plot to blow up the United States it was heady stuff.'

"Former Liverpool and Manchester City winger Albert Riera has denied he was sacked by Serie A club Udinese after skipping a match to play in a poker tournament. Riera spent two years at Anfield after joining Rafa Benitez's Liverpool from Espanyol for £8million in 2008, having had an unsuccessful loan spell at the Etihad two years earlier. The 32-year-old signed for Udinese from Galatasaray in March but has been allowed to leave after being accused of skipping their game against Chievo on November 23 to play poker in Slovenia, where he won £3,000 for finishing second. Albert Riera, pictured during his three years with Galatasaray, has denied he was sacked by Serie A's Udinese . Riera is a former Liverpool, Manchester City and Watford winger who signed for Udinese in March 2014 . The 32-year-old's time in the Premier League certainly wasn't ace as he was held to just four goals in 55 appearances. Udinese announced Riera's departure on Thursday on their official website. 'Udinese Calcio announces that the contract with the footballer Albert Ortega Riera has been terminated by mutual consent,' they wrote. 'Udinese Calcio wishes the footballer all the best for his future career.' But Riera has insisted it has nothing to do with his poker exploits or for reasons off the pitch.

Riera joined Watford on loan until the end of the season three days after signing a pre-contract for Udinese on March 24. He made eight appearances in the Championship, scoring once, but the former Spain international failed to make a single appearance for Udinese. Riera, now a free agent and looking for a club, has posted photographs on Twitter of him playing poker with friends and team-mates. Udinese have been contacted for a response.

"Emmanuel Adebayor has been recalled by Togo to play for the national team for the first time in 18 months as they get their African Nations Cup qualifying campaign under way next week. The 30-year-old Tottenham striker had refused call-ups for last year’s World Cup qualifiers in the wake of a public spat with coach Didier Six after the 2013 African Nations Cup finals in South Africa.

"George Osborne said Tory MPs would not be forced to support David Cameron's renegotiation . Tory MPs will be allowed to campaign to leave the EU after the general election, George Osborne revealed this morning. The Chancellor said MPs would get a 'free vote' to campaign how they want if the Tories were re-elected next year. It means Conservative MPs will not have to support Mr Cameron's EU renegotiation even if the PM claims he has won back significant powers from Brussels. Mr Osborne said: 'People will know what the Conservative Party's policy is. But ultimately it will be a free vote for backbench members of the Conservative Party - it's a referendum, of course. 'But people should be in no doubt that the Conservative government will put forward its proposal at the referendum, the reform that we will have achieved, the renegotiation that we will have achieved, the successful outcome of that renegotiation at the election.' Mr Osborne insisted that the Government could campaign to leave the EU. The Chancellor went on: 'If we didn't think it was in Britain's interests to be in the EU, we wouldn't argue for it, but we think it is in Britain's interests to change our relationship with Europe, improve the European economy and argue for that reform. 'Anyone who doubts that this Prime Minister will deliver should look at the Scottish referendum ... but we need to be in office to do that.' Mr Osborne's remarks come amid growing concern that more eurosceptic Tory MPs are planning to defect to UKIP. Rebel backbencher Mark Reckless announced his decision to leave the Conservative Party at the UKIP conference in Doncaster on Saturday. He became the second sitting Tory to leave for Nigel Farage's party, following Douglas Carswell's defection last month. Mr Reckless's defection, sparking a by-election in the Kent seat of Rochester and Strood, was the first of two blows for the Prime Minister at the start of this week's Conservative conference in Birmingham. It came hours before charities minister Brooks Newmark was forced to resign after it emerged he had sent X-rated pictures of himself to an undercover reporter. Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron, speaking yesterday, admitted the conference had not got off to the 'best of starts'. London Mayor Boris Johnson, who will address a rally at the conference today, issued an appeal to any further would-be Tory defectors, urging them not to break ranks and join Nigel Farage's 'people's army'. Writing in his weekly column in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson said Conservative MPs would be 'utterly nuts' to desert the party for Ukip as they simply risked handing power to Labour at next general election. The Tory hierarchy sought to sought to regain the initiative today with Mr Osborne's announcement that taxes on pension pots would be scrapped. Under plans revealed ahead of today's speech in Birmingham, savers will be able to pass on money in their pension pot tax-free to their children and grandchildren after their death. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the party was in talks with more MPs to defect after Mark Reckless left the Tories on Saturday . Douglas Carswell became the first Conservative to defect to UKIP last month, sparking speculation that up to eight MPs were considering leaving the party . The measure will apply to anyone inheriting cash held in a pension fund from April 2015 and is expected to benefit the families of hundreds of thousands of people to the tune of a total £150 million each year. If the person passing on the pension pot is 75 or under, beneficiaries will only have to pay their marginal tax rate when drawing down the income, as they would with any pension. If they die over the age of 75 there will be no tax to pay at all. Mr Osborne told ITV1's Good Morning Britain: 'At present, highly complex rules allow savers to pass on pensions without tax only to spouses or children under the age of 23, or in cases where they are under 75 and have not yet touched their pension pot.' Mr Osborne has also announced plans to remove housing benefit from under-21s and cut the benefit cap by £3,000 to £23,000 to fund three million new apprenticeships.","MPs will get 'free vote' in referendum regardless of the PM's renegotiation .

"It could nearly pass as a plotline from one of her spine-chilling books. Bestselling crime writer Val McDermid found herself the subject of an 18-year grudge which resulted in her being attacked at a book signing. Her woman assailant disguised herself before covering the author’s face with ink, shouting obscenities at her and bizarrely likening her to Jimmy Savile. Sandra Botham told a court she attacked The Wire In The Blood author because of a book she wrote in 1995. Revenge attack: Sandra Botham (left) threw ink at best-selling author Val McDermid (right) after holding a 28-year vendetta over a paragraph in one of her books which she thought had likened her to a Michelin man . A Suitable Job For A Woman explores the lives of real-life female private eyes in the US and the UK, which Botham, 64, said was critical of herself and her family. Sunderland magistrates’ court heard how Botham thought one of the case histories, which mentioned a woman called Sandra who was shaped ‘like a Michelin Man’, was referring to her. The claim has been denied by the author’s agent, who says the two women never even met before the incident. However, it is not known whether the case history does in fact refer to Botham, because it was related second-hand by a private eye. Bent on revenge,  Botham travelled to Sunderland University on December 6 last year, where she knew Miss McDermid would be signing books. She disguised herself in a blonde wig, trilby hat and glasses and sat at the end of the front row as the author gave a talk about her latest novel, Vanishing Point. Miss McDermid, 58, told the court: ‘I had noticed a woman sitting on the end of one row. She caught my eye a few times during the lecture because she appeared to be in disguise. Vendetta: Botham dressed in disguise and threw ink into Ms McDermid's mouth during a book-signing at Sunderland University on December 6 last year (incident not pictured) ‘After the lecture, I was giving a book signing and noticed she was at the end of the queue. ‘When she got to the front, she produced a dog-eared copy of A Suitable Job For A Woman.’ Best-selling author: Val McDermid is famed for her crime novel Wire in the Blood . Botham then asked her to dedicate it to ‘Michelin Man San’ – which she did, even though she had no idea what it was in reference to. She also asked her to sign a page of an old Top of the Pops annual with a picture of Jimmy Savile on it. She said: ‘She was quite insistent. I wasn’t keen, but I get asked to sign all sorts of things so thought it would be easier just to do it.’ It was then that Botham pulled a container of ink from her pocket, throwing it across the author and ruining her clothes. Miss McDermid added: ‘She then said to me something like “you are my female equivalent of Jimmy Savile” before walking out the building.’ Cross-examining the author, Botham, who was representing herself, stood up and said: ‘Hello Val, we meet again.’ Botham told the magistrates’ bench to ‘get stuffed’ when they refused to allow her to read paragraphs from the book. She then told magistrates she was ‘closing the case’ and instead would take it ‘to the highest court in the land’. The pensioner, of Hendon, Sunderland, stormed out of the courtroom and was convicted in her absence of common assault. Miss McDermid said never in her 25 years as an author had she experienced ‘anything like this before’. Her 1997 bestseller The Wire In The Blood was turned into an ITV series in 2002 starring Robson Green. Last year, she told how she met Jimmy Savile in 1977 when she was a young journalist and he later inspired another character in the book, Jacko Vance, a TV celebrity with a secret lust for torture, murder and under-age girls.","Val McDermid was attacked at a book signing by Sandra Botham .

"Going for dinner with friends who are overweight or obese will encourage you to gain weight, a new study has warned. U.S. scientists  hired a professional actress to wear a 'fat suit' to take part in their study. The actress was then asked to serve herself a portion of food in front of a group of study participants. Researchers then encouraged the participants to serve themselves some food, giving them the choice of pasta or salad. Going out for dinner with friends who are overweight or obese will encourage a person to gain weight, scientists at Southern Illinois and Cornwell universities have warned (file picture) When the actress served herself, while wearing the 'fat suit', those taking part in the study opted for the more unhealthy option - pasta. When she was slimmer, they were more inclined to choose the salad. Furthermore when the 'fat' actress chose to eat a large portion of salad, the participants ate less salad. The scientists, from Southern Illinois and Cornell universities, concluded the effect is the result of people being less reminded of their health goals when they are around overweight people. The study authors wrote: 'The purpose of this study was to examine whether or not the presence of an overweight eating companion influences healthy and unhealthy eating behavior, and to determine if the effect is moderated by how the companion serves himself or herself. 'Results demonstrated that regardless of how the confederate served, participants served and ate a larger amount of pasta when she was wearing the prosthesis than when she was not. 'In addition, when the confederate served herself healthily, participants served and ate a smaller amount of salad when she was wearing the prosthesis than when she was not. 'Consistent with the 'lower health commitment' hypothesis, these results demonstrated that people may eat larger portions of unhealthy food and smaller portions of healthy food when eating with an overweight person, probably because the health commitment goal is less activated. 'More generally, this study provides evidence that the body type of an eating companion, as well as whether she serves herself healthily or unhealthily, influences the quantity of food intake.' It comes as another study, by researchers at Liverpool University found almost nine in 10 people can't tell when someone is dangerously overweight. And the more fat friends someone has – the worse they are at judging when someone needs to lose weight. The Liverpool University researchers blamed the rising tide of obesity for changing our perception of what is a normal weight. As part of the study an actress wearing a 'fat suit' served food in front of a group of participants. When she was wearing the suit they were more likely to choose the unhealthy option of pasta over a salad . They said the phenomenon of fat blindness is important because acknowledging we have a problem is the first step in embarking on a diet. Researcher Melissa Oldham showed 1,000 people photos of men of various sizes and asked them to say whether the males were of a healthy weight, overweight or obese. The volunteers correctly judged 75 per cent of the photos of the slim men. However, they were less good at recognising when someone was overweight, the UK Congress on Obesity  in Birmingham heard. They judged the pictures of overweight men correctly only 30 per cent of the time. And worryingly, recognised obesity in just 13 per cent of cases. Analysis showed that they weren’t just bored or bad at the task – instead they were getting it wrong because they were systematically under-estimating weight. Miss Oldham, a PhD student, also showed that more overweight and obese friends someone had, the more likely they were to be blind to fatness. She said she was surprised at just how bad the volunteers were at judging weight and added: ‘This could be of public health relevance as recognition of obesity is necessary to motivate behaviour change and weight loss.’ Previous research has shown that parents often underestimate their children’s weight. Even doctors are not immune to the trick of the mind, with studies showing they ‘quite regularly’ think patients are thinner than they are.","Scientists in the U.S. discovered dining with fat friends makes people more inclined to eat larger portions and choose more unhealthy options .

"The American executive who is still being held hostage at his company's factory outside of Beijing has been released after a compensation dispute was resolved, a company official and union representative said.

Workers had demanded severance . packages identical to those offered to 30 employees who were recently . laid off, even though the firm planned no further layoffs, Starnes said . earlier. Scroll down for video . On lockdown: Chip Starnes was held hostage in his factory outside of Beijing for the past six days .

'As of now my boss Chip feels exhausted after two harsh days and has gone back to a hotel, okay?' Specialty Medical General Manager Xing Shuang told Reuters Television. 'This is all I have to say.' Starnes spent the week inside the . plant, which produces alcohol pads and plastic blood lancets for . diabetics, behind barred windows. He could not be immediately reached . for comment. Starnes, whose company is based in Florida, flew to China on June 18 and his detention started on Friday. Yesterday he was trying to make . light of the situation and keep his spirits high when he was interviewed . on American television this morning. 'I got shaved today, I was given an . electric razor so I'm feeling pretty good today,' Starnes said from behind . the caged windows of the Chinese factory. 'I decided I'm going to stick with the blue shirt all the way through, sort of like my little slogan thing.' Missed: Starnes' wife said that they have spoken every day since he has been in captivity but that is not enough . Mr Starnes, a co-owner of Coral . Springs, Florida-based Specialty Medical Supplies, said local officials . had visited the 10-year-old plant on the capital's outskirts and coerced . him into signing agreements Saturday to meet the workers' demands even . though he sought to make clear that the remaining 100 workers weren't . being laid off. He told The Today Show that he has tried to leave the plant but his escape attempts have not worked. He said that the conditions of his . captivity were reasonable, with McDonalds and KFC getting delivered . to him for breakfast and Chinese food with rice for lunch. 'They're hands off here- they let the workers handle it themselves,' he said of the local authorities. 'I did try and actually go over the gate but they would not let me go,' he said. His wife told NBC that while they have been in contact, that is not enough for their family. 'I just want him home, his kids want him home. Every day we do get to talk to him but it's very upsetting,' she said. The workers were expecting wire . transfers by Tuesday, he said, adding that about 80 of them had been . blocking every exit around the clock and depriving him of sleep by . shining bright lights and banging on windows of his office. Anguish: 'I feel like a trapped animal,' Mr Starnes said from his first-floor office window, while holding onto the window's bars . He declined to clarify the amount, saying he wanted to keep it confidential. 'I . feel like a trapped animal,' Mr Starnes told The Associated Press on . Monday from his first-floor office window, while holding onto the . window's bars. 'I think . it's inhumane what is going on right now.

Workers inside the compound, a pair . of two-story buildings behind gates and hedges in the Huairou district . of the northeastern Beijing suburbs, repeatedly declined requests for . comment, saying they did not want to talk to foreign media. It is not rare in China for managers . to be held by workers demanding back pay or other benefits, often from . their Chinese owners, though occasionally also involving foreign bosses. The . labor action reflects growing uneasiness among workers about their jobs . amid China's slowing economic growth and the sense that growing labor . costs make the country less attractive for some foreign-owned factories. The account about local officials coercing Starnes to meet workers' demands - if true - reflects how officials typically consider stifling . unrest to be a priority.

U.S. Embassy spokesman Nolan Barkhouse said the two sides were . on the verge of an agreement and that Starnes would have access to his . attorneys. It was unclear what agreement might be reached, and subsequent attempts to contact Starnes were not immediately successful. Starnes . said the company had gradually been winding down its plastics division, . planning to move it to Mumbai, India. He arrived in Beijing last . Tuesday to lay off the last 30 people. Some had been working there for . up to nine years, so their compensation packages were 'pretty nice,' he . said.

'not a major problem' for the foreign business community. 'It happened more often say 15 years ago than today, but it still happens from time to time,' he said.

"Pope Francis in St Peter's square today: He has announced a probe into the activities of the highly secretive and scandal-tainted Vatican Bank . Pope Francis ordered an inquiry into the activities of the Vatican bank today, after fresh accusations of corruption and continued questions about its secrecy. Francis named a commission to . investigate the bank's legal structure and activities 'to allow for a . better harmonization with the universal mission of the Apostolic See,' according to the legal document that created it. The announcement came after prosecutors in Salerno placed senior Vatican official Monsignor Nunzio Scarano under investigation for alleged money-laundering. Scarano has said he did nothing wrong, though in an interview with the local daily, La Citta di Salerno, he acknowledged he received bad advice from his accountant. The five-member commission includes two Americans: Monsignor Peter Wells, a top official in the Vatican secretariat of state, and Mary Ann Glendon, a Harvard law professor, former U.S. ambassador to the Holy See and current president of a pontifical academy. American cardinals were among the most vocal in demanding a wholesale reform of the Vatican bureaucracy - and the Vatican bank - in the meetings running up to the March conclave that elected Francis pope. The demands were raised following revelations in leaked documents last year that told of dysfunction, petty turf wars and allegations of corruption in the Holy See's governance. It was the second time in as many weeks that Francis has intervened to get information out of the Institute for Religious Works, or IOR. On June 15, he filled a key vacancy in the bank's governing structure, tapping a trusted prelate to be his eyes inside the bank. Francis, who has made clear he wants a 'poor' church, has already named a separate commission of cardinals to advise him on the broader question of reforming the Vatican bureaucracy as a whole. The Vatican bank was founded in 1942 by Pope Pius XII to manage assets destined for religious or charitable works. Located in a tower just inside the gates of Vatican City, it also manages the pension system for the Vatican's thousands of employees. Vatican City at dusk: Francis, who has made clear he wants a 'poor' church, has already named a separate commission of cardinals to advise him on the broader question of reforming the Vatican bureaucracy as a whole . The bank commission's members have the authority to gather documents, data and information about the bank's legal status and activities, even overriding normal secrecy rules to do so. Members can receive information from anyone in the Vatican bureaucracy as well as people who spontaneously volunteer information, and the commission can refer to outside advisers if necessary, according to the terms. The bank's administration continues to function as normal, as does the Vatican's new financial watchdog agency which has supervisory control over it. The commission will report back to Francis - presumably with both information and recommendations - and then will be dissolved, the document states. No timeframe was given but the commission is to start working soon. Involved with the Vatican Bank: Roberto Calvi, the head of Banco Ambrosiano, was found hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London in 1982 . Vatican spokesman Rev. Federico Lombardi, confirmed today that Scarano had been suspended temporarily from his position in one of the Vatican's key finance offices, the Administration for the Patrimony of the Apostolic See. Italian daily Corriere della Sera reported over the weekend that Italy's central bank had asked the Vatican's financial watchdog agency for information about Scarano's Vatican bank account as part of the probe. Mr Lombardi said he didn't know if the Vatican had responded to the request. There have long been questions about just what the IOR actually is and does - questions which the commission presumably will try to iron out for Francis. Vatican officials have long insisted it's not even a bank, since it doesn't perform key banking activities like making loans. It does however take deposits, transfer money and invest for its clients, performing asset management services that in 2012 helped earn it 86.6 million euros in profit on 7.1 billion euros in total assets under management. Some cardinals have questioned if the Vatican needs such a financial institution and whether its activities are even in keeping with church teaching. The Vatican bank's workings have long been shrouded in secrecy. Most famously, it was implicated in a scandal over the collapse of Italy's Banco Ambrosiano in the 1980s in one of Italy's largest fraud cases. Roberto Calvi, the head of Banco Ambrosiano, was found hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London in 1982 in circumstances that remain mysterious.","Comes as Vatican official placed under investigation for money laundering .

"Pinterest users have been the victims of yet another cyber attack after accounts began inadvertently posting messages about weight loss (pictured) Pinterest users have been the victims of yet another cyber attack after accounts began inadvertently posting messages about weight loss. The malicious hack also spread on Twitter, which meant the social media site was also flooded with the same spam messages. This happened because a significant number of Pinterest users log in to the pinboard-style photo sharing site via third-party apps such as Twitter. On both sites, the messages of ‘An Asian fruit that burns fat for you? Yes please!’ and ‘I'm 12 pounds lighter as of today!’ appeared with a link to the spam post on the Pinterest webpage. According to Comscore, Pinterest is the 39th most popular website in the U.S. as of February 2014 and the company itself is valued at over $5 billion (£2.95 billion). A report on tech site The Next Web said that this popularity has made it a target for spam and other types of malicious activity. Pinterest told MailOnline: 'The security of Pinners is a top priority. 'We were alerted to some instances of spam and responded by immediately placing impacted accounts in safe mode, and reaching out to Pinners as we solved the issue. 'We're constantly working on ways to keep Pinners safe through reactive and proactive steps, as well as educating them on the importance of using complex and unique passwords.' The malicious hack also spread on Twitter, which meant the social media site was similarly flooded with the same spam messages. On both sites, the messages of ‘An Asian fruit that burns fat for you? Yes please!’ and ‘I'm 12 pounds lighter as of today!’ appeared with a link to the spam post on the Pinterest webpage .

Due to the rise in spam, Pinterest has started warning users of unusual activity on their accounts when they log in, and suggesting they reset their password. Other hackers are creating fake boards designed as phishing scams that attempt to get access to connected Facebook accounts, for example. At the start of March, Twitter accidentally reset millions of user’s passwords but claimed it was due to a software bug, and wasn’t because the site had been hacked.

"Two U.S. troops have been shot dead by an Afghan soldier as violence rages across the country in response to Korans being burned. The gunmen opened fire after calls from Taliban insurgents to attack U.S. military bases in revenge attacks for U.S. troops setting fire to the Muslim holy books. The attack took place during a protest outside a U.S. military base in the Khogyani district of Nangarhar Province. It is the worst case of violence in three days of unrest that began when Korans – used by former Afghan . detainees at Nato’s Bagram air base – were among rubbish taken to a . ‘burn pit’ and recovered by Afghans working there. The protests drew thousands of angry Afghans to the streets, chanting 'Death to America!' for the third consecutive day in violence that has killed 11 people and wounded many more.

"Most children learn how to swear before they even know the alphabet, according to a new book that examines bad language and its origins. English speakers also use a curse word on average once in every 140 words, roughly the same proportion as the first person plural pronouns such as ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our.’ The surprising preponderance of swearing in everyday language probably explains why the majority of children know at least one obscene word by the age of two, says language expert Dr. Mellissa Mohr, from Stanford University in California. Most children learn how to swear before they even know the alphabet, according to a new book that examines bad language and its origins . It really ‘kicks off’, she adds, around the ages of three and four. She claims that over an average day around 0.7 per cent of English language consists of swear words. In her new book, ‘Holy Sh*t: A Brief . History of Swearing,’ Dr. Mohr claims the upper classes are just as . likely to turn the air blue as less educated working class people. The group least likely to use swear words, says the researcher, is the middle class. ‘This goes back to the Victorian era . idea that you get control over your language and your deportment, which . indicates that you are a proper, good person and this is a sign of your . morality and awareness of social rules,' she said. ‘Aristocrats have a secure position . in society, so they can say whatever they want — and may even make a . show of doing so,’ she adds. Dr. Mohr said her book sets out to correct some misconceptions people have about swearing. Swearing: But the bad language used by The Thick of It's Malcolm Tucker, played by Peter Capaldi, is not a sign of laziness or bad education . Research: Melissa Mohr's new book reveals the surprising truth behind the everyday life of taboo swear words . Rather than lazy language, . obscenities can have practical uses, such as providing relief from pain . if a person gets hurt, for instance when you hit your hand with a . hammer. Studies have shown that swearing sometimes has a genuine physiological effect on the body. Swearing also helps to form social . solidarity - for example, when workers use swear words while talking . about their managers, it builds an 'in-group' which aids social and . professional interaction. Dr. Mohr, who holds a PhD in Renaissance literature from Stanford, also told Time magazine that swearing is nothing new. The Romans, like us, used taboo words . relating to sexuality as insults, while the word 's***' originated in . the Old English language of the Anglo-Saxons.","0.7% of all English spoken language is swearing .

"No soccer fan: Conservative pundit Ann Coulter wrote 'any growing interest in soccer can only be a sign of the nation's moral decay' Conservative pundit Ann Coulter believes that the country’s growing interest in soccer – fueled by Team USA’s success in the 2014 World Cup - is a sure sign of America's ‘moral decay.’ In a syndicated column published on the same day that the U.S. team qualified for the last 18 of the tournament in Brazil, Coulter shared her musings on why the sports growing popularity sums up everything that is wrong with modern America. Coulter starts by claiming that she had held off from writing about the game so as ‘not to offend anyone,’ before giving a nine point explanation of how ‘any growing interest in soccer can only be a sign of the nation's moral decay.’ ‘Do they even have MVPs in soccer? Everyone just runs up and down the field and, every once in a while, a ball accidentally goes in,’ she writes. ‘That's when we're supposed to go wild. I'm already asleep.’ Coulter’s reasons for hating soccer are an rum bunch, including that ‘individual achievement is not a big factor’, it isn’t rough enough and the fact that ‘it's foreign.’ As a conservative, she also she argued that liberals only love soccer - and the metric system - because they're both 'European.' Coulter also touches on the hot topic of immigration. Scroll down for video . US soccer fans celebrate as the USA qualifies to the round of 16 as they watch the match at Hermosa Beach, California .

Soccer is like the metric system, which liberals also adore because it's European. Soccer is not ‘catching on' 'If more ""Americans"" are watching soccer today, it's only because of the demographic switch effected by Teddy Kennedy's 1965 immigration law,' she writes. 'I promise you: No American whose great-grandfather was born here is watching soccer. One can only hope that, in addition to learning English, these new Americans will drop their soccer fetish with time.' Ratings for some World Cup games in Brazil have already surpassing those for the NBA Finals and the World Series, driven by avid viewing among Latinos and young adults, reports the LA Times. More than 25 million total viewers on ESPN, Spanish-language Univision and related mobile apps tuned in to Sunday's match between the U.S. and Portugal, according to Nielsen. It was the most-watched soccer game in U.S. history - although that record could be toppled next Tuesday when the American team taking on Belgium for a place in the last 8 in the competition. Coulter has a long track record of making provocative and outspoken comments. Last month, in the wake of the 'Bring Back Our Girls' hashtag to raise awareness of kidnapped school children in Nigeria, Coulter tweeted 'My hashtag contribution to world affairs' with an image of herself holding a sign with her own hashtag, #Bring Back Our Country. The conservative pundit was mercilessly lampooned on the internet with people replacing the text on Coulter’s piece of paper with their own phrases to describe their views of her public post. The messages included 'I'm a miserable person who peddles hate to make money off dumb republicans’ and '#BRING BACK MY SOUL'. Last month Coulter tweeted this controversial photo mocking the 'Bring Back Our Girls' campaign trying to bring awareness of the missing Nigerian schoolgirls .","Conservative pundit Ann Coulter has shared her nine point explanation for why soccer sums up everything that is wrong with modern America .

"A quarter of people living in Britain’s biggest cities are immigrants, an official analysis showed yesterday. A study of census figures revealed that nearly one in three big-city residents is a member of a non-white ethnic minority, and that nearly one in ten homes has no-one who speaks English as their main language. The figures were put together by the Office for National Statistics from the results of the 2011 national census in the four biggest built-up areas: surrounding London, Manchester, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire. Different backgrounds: Nearly one in three big-city residents is a member of a non-white ethnic minority, and almost one in ten homes has no-one who speaks English as their main language . In these conurbations, more than 25 per cent of the population were born abroad. Being born outside Britain is accepted by the statisticians as the best measure of who is  an immigrant. The figures mark a major change since 2001, and reflect  the high levels of immigration from both Eastern Europe and outside Europe that were encouraged during Labour’s years in power. The census returns of 2001 showed much lower ethnic minority populations than in the ONS analysis of 2011, although the latter uses different boundaries. The 2001 census said that in London 75.9 per cent of the population was born in the UK, in Greater Manchester 92.1 per cent, in the West Midlands 88.8 per cent, and in West Yorkshire 91.2 per cent. In 2011, in the same local government areas, the UK-born population of London was down to 63.3 per cent; Greater Manchester 87.9; the West Midlands 83.4; and West Yorkshire 88.5 per cent. The latest figures also suggest that nine per cent of homes in the big cities have no-one who speaks English as their main language. The ONS said that this compares with one per cent of homes in  villages and small towns. The broad picture of the make-up of the cities is taken from an analysis of built-up areas carried out for the first time in 2011. The figures apply to areas which are considered to be ‘irreversibly urban in character’. Immigration: Census figures showed 13.3 per cent of the English population as a whole were born abroad . The four major conurbations each have well over a million inhabitants. Behind them come seven ‘large built-up areas’, each with between half a million and a million people. The countryside is disappearing around the biggest cities, officials admitted yesterday. Greater London now stretches from St Albans in the north to Harlow in the east and Guildford in the south west, according to the ONS analysis. In the north, Leeds and Bradford have effectively joined up to form a single conurbation. Planning rules and green belt laws have failed to curb urban sprawl in some areas, the ONS said. These are Bristol, Leicester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Sheffield, Tyneside and the area surrounding Southampton and Portsmouth. Second-tier cities have been much less affected by immigration than the big conurbations, the report said. The four major cities had more than double the proportion of people born abroad than the seven large built-up areas – 25.3 per cent against 11.4 per cent. Census figures published last year showed that 13.3 per cent of the English population as a whole were born abroad. Earlier this week, it emerged that more than a million schoolchildren have English as their second language. Department for Education figures show the number of pupils aged five and upwards speaking other first languages in primary, secondary, special and pupil referral units has risen by almost 54,000 to 1,061,100.","Nearly one in three big-city residents is a non-white ethnic minority .

"A cure for HIV (pictured) could be further away than scientists had hoped, new research suggests . A cure for HIV could be further away than scientists had hoped, new research suggests. Researchers discovered that dormant HIV lingers in the body even after seemingly successful treatment. This dormant HIV is now known to pose a far bigger threat than was previously thought because the amount of hidden virus that remains after treatment may be 60 times greater than earlier estimates, according to the new findings. The sleeping viruses, called proviruses, are a danger because they can become reactivated despite treatment with the best HIV drugs – if this happens, the disease will return. Experts say the discovery, which was reported in the journal Cell, is a setback in the fight against HIV/AIDS and highlights the fact that HIV infection can be treated, but not cured. ‘The findings suggest that there are a lot more of these proviruses that we have to worry about than we thought,’ said study leader Dr Robert Siliciano, from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Maryland, U.S. ‘It doesn't mean that it's hopeless, but it does mean we need to focus on getting an even clearer idea of the scope of the problem.’ In patients infected with HIV, the virus targets the immune system's T-cells – white blood cells that help with immunity - where it is integrated into human genes. The viral genes contain all the instructions to hijack the T-cell and turn it into a virus-producing factory. But in some cells, the virus remains dormant - while sitting in the cell, it is not actively replicating. Antiretroviral drugs can target active forms of the virus, but it is still unclear whether they are effective against inactive forms. Until now, scientists did not have an accurate idea of how large the pool of dormant viruses was. ‘For people that are working on HIV, . figuring out the size of the reservoir has been a really critical . issue,’ said Dr Siliciano. ‘The . field has struggled with what you even measure in people who are . participating in eradication studies. How do you know how much virus is . left?’ Dormant HIV is now known to pose a far bigger threat than was previously thought because the amount of hidden virus that remains after treatment may be 60 times higher than earlier estimates . In the past, scientists have tried to gauge the number of remaining viruses by forcing activation of the dormant viruses. This approach did not provided accurate answers. The new technique first involved stimulating infected T-cells, which sent a signal to wake up the inactive viruses. Those proviruses that remained inactive despite the wake-up call were then studied in more detail. While 88 per cent contained obvious defects that made it impossible for them to replicate, 12 per cent possessed fully intact viral genomes. Next, artificial viral genomes were made in the laboratory that matched those in the 12 per cent group. The researchers expected to find small mutations that stopped these viruses functioning, but got a shock. The sleeping viruses, called proviruses, are a danger because they can become reactivated despite treatment with the best HIV drugs - if this happens, the disease will return . ‘To our surprise, the non-induced proviruses that we judged to be intact based on their genetic sequence all replicated beautifully,’ said Dr Siliciano. This suggests that many apparently lifeless viruses could be activated in the future causing the patient to fall ill again. Suspicions were confirmed when the scientists performed a second round of T-cell activation and viruses that had previously remained dormant became active. Based on the finding that 12 per cent of non-induced proviruses retain an ability to reactivate, the scientists calculated that previous estimates of the size of the dormant HIV store in the body were out by 60 per cent. ‘This is a huge increase in the barrier to curing this disease,’ said Dr Siliciano. Even if a patient was successfully treated with antiretroviral drugs that halted all active HIV replication, the silent viruses could awaken to cause disease at any point after the therapy is stopped. Only drugs targeting the inactive viruses could lead to a complete cure or remission, said Dr Siliciano. The scientists' next goal is to uncover the mechanisms involved in reactivating dormant HIV viruses. Lisa Power, policy director at the HIV/AIDS charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘Prevention is not only better than cure; it's also the only viable option we have for the foreseeable future. ‘This study shows just one of the challenges researchers need to overcome. What is alarming is how many people believe a cure already exists. It doesn't, and false hope may be leading people to take risks. ‘Until a cure is found, we have to throw everything we've got behind HIV prevention. Using condoms, testing for HIV and getting treatment are our best weapons against the virus.’","60 times more 'hidden' HIV remains after treatment that previously thought .
It can be 'reactivated' after treatment causing the disease to return .
This finding means only drugs targeting the inactive viruses as well as the active ones could lead to a complete cure ."

"David Cameron has spoken for the first time about an alleged plot by Islamic extremists to take over schools in Birmingham, promising ‘swift action’ to ensure they are not being used to spread the ideology of terrorists. The Department for Education is believed to be investigating 12 schools in the city after claims that non-Muslim members of staff were being isolated, male and female pupils segregated and assemblies used to promote the teachings of Al Qaeda. Yesterday the Prime Minister said: ‘We will not accept any school being run by extremists or promoting extremist views. Response: Mr Cameron said Ofsted have 'all the powers they need to intervene' if extremists ran schools . ‘It’s not acceptable, we can’t have that happening in our country and Ofsted have all the powers they need to intervene. They are able to get in there and inspect to see where things have gone wrong.’ Allegations of the so-called ‘Trojan Horse’ plot to allow hardline Muslims to take over a handful of schools were revealed last month in a leaked letter – supposedly written from one extremist to another. It detailed a five-step plan designed to take over the running of several Birmingham state schools, and listed examples of the non-Muslim staff members who they had successfully ‘forced out’. Claims: It is alleged the views of radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki were promoted . The authenticity of the document has since been called into question. But following its emergence, Birmingham City Council has apparently been ‘inundated’ with claims from headteachers, parents and governors claiming that they have seen the tactics at work in their schools. Yesterday Labour MP Liam Byrne criticised the probe for progressing at a ‘glacial’ speed. And Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood claimed that the council has known about these allegations for ‘eight years at least’ but failed to act for fear of ‘appearing anti-Muslim’. The Labour politician said: ‘Young people are being targeted from a young age in schools across Birmingham. It’s much like what we got in the 1980s and 1990s where radicalism was being taught in universities where there were greater numbers of young people they could attract. ‘They are using schools in this way to persuade children to see their way of thinking, which will be useful to them later on.’ Mr Mahmood was responding to the two members of staff at Park View Academy who yesterday claimed a senior colleague had endorsed the teachings of the now dead American-born senior Al Qaeda militant Anwar al-Awlaki. The teachers also said a viewpoint politically sympathetic to the terrorist group had been promoted in an assembly. Park View Academy, in Birmingham’s Alum Rock, denies the allegations – which were broadcast anonymously on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Park View Academy in Birmingham denies the allegations, which were broadcast anonymously on BBC Radio 4 . Tahir Alam, who has been a governor at Park View for 17 years, said: ‘It is a witch hunt based on false allegations.’ However, the majority of governors at the school are said to be followers of the Wahhabi movement – an ultra-conservative branch of Sunni Islam. And another teacher, who has worked at several Birmingham schools, including Park View, told the Mail: ‘They are promoting a radical form of Islam. ‘Children know no better so they just accept it, then they go home and their parents aren’t aware of it so these views go unchallenged. I’m worried about what the future will hold for these children.’ Yesterday Graham Stuart, the chairman of the Commons education select committee, called the allegations ‘disturbing’, adding: ‘Having children indoctrinated by extremists in a state-funded school would clearly be utterly unacceptable and a scandal and needs to be dealt with as quickly as possible.’","Government is believed to be investigating 12 schools in Birmingham .

"Pope Francis surprised hundreds of commuters when he rode on a train to a Mass in Deajeon, Korea, instead of a helicopter . He has built a reputation for his down-to-earth style and has no patience for pomp. But even so, Pope Francis surprised hundreds of ordinary commuters when he took public transport to celebrate a Mass in Korea where he is on a five day visit. The pope scrapped his plans to take a helicopter from Seoul to his first public Mass instead taking a local train to Daejeon, where he held a service at a football stadium in the city. Francis was seen riding in the fourth car of the train, in first-class, while another 500 people were on board, Korean media reported. The last-minute change in plans was on account of bad weather, according to organisers of the visit. Spokesman Hur Young-yup told Yonhap news agency: 'The helicopter is his default means of transit because it is fast and safe, but the pontiff also considers other options, like the train, if taking them would allow him to arrive on schedule.' Pope Francis' pared back humble demeanour has taken locals in status-conscious, ostentatious, Korea by surprise. Having refused a Popemobile and instead requesting Korea’s smallest compact car, he arrived from the airport in a black Kia Soul that many South Koreans would consider beneath his status as a global figure. One South Korean user tweeted: 'The pope rode the Soul because he is full of soul.' Shon Cho-eun, a 22-year-old Christian . student said: 'I feel honoured that Pope Francis will not be in a . bulletproof vehicle. I hope he arrives safely and delivers good messages . to us.' Francis has already surprised several Koreans by using a Kia Soul - something many South Koreans see as beneath his global status - as his 'Popemobile' during his five-day visit . Francis has also rejected bullet proof popemobiles' , sparking security concerns on previous foreign trips such, as last year's trip to Rio. He has urged priests around the world to travel in low-key cars. In the Vatican he is driven around in a Ford Focus.","Pope Francis took train to Daejeon, where he led service at football stadium .

"President Barack Obama will embark on a previously planned two-week vacation to Martha's Vineyard tomorrow regardless of the violence in Iraq and Gaza. Even as the first military airstrikes he authorized in northern Iraq were carried out Friday, Obama did not cancel the trip. The White House said Thursday Obama would come back . to Washington midway through the getaway to attend meetings but he will . rejoin his family at the vacation spot later that week. This Aug. 12, 2013 photo shows President Barack Obama as he steps onto a tee while golfing at Vineyard Golf Club in Edgartown, Massachusetts, on the island of Martha's Vineyard, during his vacation there last summer. The White House says the president plans to return to Martha's Vineyard tomorrow regardless of the situation in Iraq . He is scheduled to arrive on the wealthy island off the Massachusetts coast on Saturday and return to Washington a week later, on Sunday, Aug. 17. After the meetings, plans call for Obama to return to the Vineyard on Aug. 19 to resume the vacation, which ends five days later on Aug. 24. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama would meet with staff, but he declined to say who else would participate or what the meetings are about. 'This is an opportunity for the president to do some in-person meetings here at the White House, just for a day or two, before he returns to Martha's Vineyard,' Earnest said Thursday. Earnest sought to contain mounting speculation about the vacation, saying the meetings aren't related to 'an emerging situation.' Later that day President Obama announced in a presidential address that the U.S. had made air drops of food and water to some 40,000 Iraqi refugees trapped on a mountain. And on Friday morning the U.S. launched an air strike against Islamic extremists threatening to eradicate them. 'When we face a situation like we do on that mountain - with innocent people facing the prospect of violence on a horrific scale . . . and when we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre, then I believe the United States of America cannot turn a blind eye,' Obama said Thursday night. 'We can act, carefully and responsibly, to prevent a potential act of genocide,'he said. 'That’s what we’re doing on that mountain.' President Obama appeared to be full steam ahead with his vacation on Friday. Earnest told reporters this afternoon he did not have an update on the president's meeting schedule, however, he said he wouldn't be surprised if some were about Iraq. 'But again the president had planned to return to the White House before this announcement,' he said, referring to this morning's air strikes. President Barack Obama, left, and his daughter Malia Obama ride a bike during a vacation on Martha's Vineyard last August. Obama and his family will take another two week vacation there, starting tomorrow. The president will return to Washington for a few days part of the way through, however . Outside of Iraq there are several . other issues brewing that could require Obama's urgent attention, . including fighting between Israel and Hamas militants and Russia's . buildup of troops along its border with Ukraine. A temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended this morning after Israel refused to adhere to the terror backed group's demand that it end its seven-year blockade of Gaza. Toward the close of the 72-hour window Hamas fired at least 10 rockets, ending the longest ceasefire since the fighting began a month ago. Israel retaliated with strikes of its own, hitting several 'terror sites' in Gaza. Meanwhile, Russia placed a one-year, 'full embargo' on the bulk of food imports from the West on Thursday, including beef, pork, fruit, produce, poultry, fish, cheese and milk, in response to enhanced sanctions on its country by the U.S. and its allies over Russian-backed separatists' occupation of eastern Ukraine. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has also threatened to ban Europe and U.S. airliners from making transit flights to the Asia-Pacific region through Russia. Even so, Obama has not cancelled his vacation. Obama rarely forgoes getaways or fundraising trips based on global or domestic crises. His . advisers often appear to take pride in resisting calls from Republicans . for the president to return to Washington or from fellow Democrats . nervous about the appearance of Obama either vacationing or tending to . what some may consider less urgent matters. 'He . travels with an array of communications equipment and national security . advisers that will allow him to perform all of the functions that are . required of America's commander in chief,' Earnest said. 'That's true of any trip that he takes, and it will be true of the trip that the president takes this week.' In 2009, Obama remained on vacation in his native of Hawaii after a man aboard a Detroit-bound flight tried to detonate a bomb on Christmas. Obama also continued on with Martha's Vineyard vacations in 2010 as rebels in Libya were on the verge of ousting their government, and last year when Egypt's military overthrew the country's first democratically elected leader. Just last month, Obama resisted calls while on a fundraising trip in Texas to visit the U.S.-Mexico border to witness the surge of unaccompanied children arriving there. Pressed about the appearance of ignoring a humanitarian crisis, Earnest declared at the time: 'We're not worried about those optics.' Obama has upended his travel plans on several occasions, however. He has canceled three trips to Asia, including one in 2013 because of the U.S. government shutdown. His late-December departures to spend Christmas in Hawaii frequently have been delayed because of late action on Capitol Hill. In 2012, he returned to Washington from a Hawaiian vacation to deal with 'fiscal cliff' negotiations. Obama's public appearances while on vacation typically are limited to stops at local merchants and dinner out with family and friends. But in another unusual twist this summer, the president plans to attend a Democratic fundraiser on Martha's Vineyard on Monday. The Obamas stay in Chilmark, on the western part of the island, and have rented a seven-bedroom, nine-bath, 8,100-square-foot house along the island's Vineyard Sound side, far off any main roads. The Martha's Vineyard Times reported earlier this month that the 17 room home sits on 10 acres of land and is worth upward of $12 million. The property also features a pool, hot tub,and a dual tennis-basketball court. Obama has vacationed on the quaint island every summer of his presidency except during the 2012 re-election campaign .","Obama is scheduled to leave tomorrow and won't return to Washington until August 17 .

"Anonymous has vowed to expose the identities of the four boys behind the rape of a 17-year-old girl who killed herself after they circulated a photograph of the assault.

Questions are now emerging over . whether authorities did enough to help the girl who relatives said . quickly slipped from an A-student to a moody, unpredictable teenager. An investigation was launched over . the November 2011 rape but the RCMP says that there was not enough . evidence for a prosecution, even for possession of indecent images of a . child. The Anonymous post is called ‘Operation Justice For Rehtaeh’. It reads: ‘Anonymous has confirmed . the identities of two of the four alleged rapists.

The petition was set up on change.org by a woman called Sherri B from Halifax in Nova Scotia. She said that it was not good enough that the RCMP investigated for a year but did nothing and asks: ‘How is this possible?’ The petition reads that ‘everyone saw . her being bullied and shamed at school.’ It then goes on to say that . ‘Nova Scotia’s Justice Minister Ross Landry must call an independent . inquiry into this situation. Struggle: After she was allegedly raped, her attackers spread a photo of the assault around her school . ‘The Minister must find out if the . police ran this investigation properly and determine if there is . important evidence that was not taken into account when they decided to . close this case.’ On a Facebook tribute page, Rehtaeh's . mother, Leah Parsons, described how her daughter was forever changed by . the alleged assault in their hometown of Cole Harbour. 'She went with a friend to another's . home,' her mother wrote. 'In that home, she was raped by four young . boys. One of those boys took a photo of her being raped and decided it . would be fun to distribute the photo to everyone in Rehtaeh's school and . community, where it quickly went viral. The alleged attack left then . 15-year-old Rehtaeh an outcast at Cole Harbour District High School, . where her rapists were also students. Friends, students and strangers . taunted her, her mother said. 'People texted her all the time, saying ""Will you have sex with me?""' she said. 'Girls texting, saying ""You're such a slut"". 'She was never left alone. She had to . leave the community. Her friends turned against her. People harassed . her... It just never stopped,' her mother told CBC. Sadness: Leah Parsons, Rehtaeh's mother, pictured, said she believes the police investigation was flawed . Family: The family even moved to escape the bullies, but she still struggled with mood swings . Her parents moved from Cole Harbour . to Halifax to help her escape the bullies and Rehtaeh made new friends . and began hearing from her old school friends, who offered her their . support. She said her daughter also started . therapy, which appeared to be helping. Yet she would become angry . quickly, and last week's suicide attempt was probably the result of a . mood swing, Leah said. 'She acted on an impulse, but I . truly, in my heart of heart, do not feel she meant to kill herself,' her . mother wrote on Facebook. 'By the time I broke into the bathroom, it . was too late.' The Canadian police launched an . investigation, which took a year, but concluded there was insufficient . evidence to bring up charges. 'An investigation into an earlier . sexual assault was completed, and in consultation with the Crown, there . was insufficient evidence to lay charges,' RCMP spokesman Cpl. Scott . MacRae said. They didn't even interview the boys until much, much later,' To me, I’d think you’d get the boys right away, separate them.” Relatives said they saw the . photograph but could not determine who had taken it, so were unable to . charge the teenagers - even though the picture legally constituted child . pornography. 'The whole case was full of things . like that,' Leah said. We didn’t have a rape kit done because we didn't . even know until several days later when she had a breakdown in my . kitchen. She was trying to keep it to herself.' Bullied: Rehtaeh eventually left the high school when even her friends turned on her, her mother said . Loss: Her family said they do not believe she wanted to die but that it was a spur of the moment decision . RCMP spokesman Cpl. Scott MacRae . confirmed to the Chronicle Herald that the authorities are currently . investigating a sudden death involving a young person, but would not . provide further details. Her mother said she wants other . people to learn from the tragedy and how social media allowed her to be . continually violated following the brutal rape. Rehtaeh shared her sadness on . Facebook, including a post on March 3 which read: 'In the end, we will . remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.' Barrett Khan, a vice-principal at . Cole Harbour District High School, told The Globe he couldn’t comment on . the case as the teenager had left more than a year ago. 'Our thoughts are with the family . during this difficult time,' a spokesman for the Halifax Regional School . Board said in a statement.

"A British academic has said conspiracy theories are built into American culture because the country was founded on them. Professor Sir Richard Evans, of the University of Cambridge, is leading a project into conspiracy theories and is Britain's leading authority on the subject matter. Speaking at the Hay Festival yesterday, he said conspiracy theories are more common in the United States compared with other countries. Lone gunman? Lee Harvey Oswald, 24, is shown after his arrest for the assassination of JFK in 1963 . 'There is an argument that conspiracy theories are built into American culture because that is how America started. 'The United States was founded on conspiracy theories: the London government was conspiring to deprive America of their liberties.' Mr Evans cited the JFK assassination, the 9/11 attacks and even campaigns which claim President Obama is not American. He also believes the internet has not led to an increased belief in such theories. Professor Sir Richard Evans is leading a project into conspiracy theories . Following the assassination of JFK in 1963, most Americans believed Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone. However, the number of people who believe this conspiracy theory now has decreased since the growth of the internet. Mr Evans believes conspiracy theories normally form following a traumatic event. For example the McCarthy witch hunts took place following the Second World War. However, in recent years, many theories have been directed at governments. Mr Evans said at the festival: 'In the late 19th century conspiracy theories were directed against big business and cartels. 'This did not happen so much in the recent economic crisis where conspiracy theories have been targeted much more at government. 'Is it because governments play a much bigger role in our lives than they did a century ago?' Research for the project will be published in 2017. Mr Evans is a Fellow of the British Academy, the Royal Society of Literature and the Royal Historical Society. He is also an Honorary Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and Birkbeck College, London. He is also the editor of the Journal of Contemporary History. September 11, 2011 - Despite repeated claims by al-Qaeda that it planned the attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York, several official and unofficial investigations into the collapse of the Twin Towers suggest that structural failure was responsible. Some theorists believe the U.S. government had prior warning of the attacks but did not do enough to stop them. Others believe the Bush administration deliberately turned a blind eye to warnings to launch wards in the Middle East. A large group of people who call themselves the 9/11 Truth Movement believe an aircraft did not hit the Pentagon and that the World Trade Centre could not have been brought down by an airliner impact and burning aviation fuel. They say there is also video evidence to suggest there were puffs of smoke coming from the Twin Towers at levels far below the impact zones. Many witnesses claim to have heard explosions before the aircraft impacts. Some theorists believe the U.S. government had prior warning of the 9/11 attacks . The assassination of John F Kennedy - . The 35th President of the United States was shot on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas at 12.30pm. He was fatally wounded by gunshots while riding with his wife - Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy - in a motorcade. The ten-month investigation of the Warren Commission of 1963 to 1964, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) of 1976 to 1979, and other government investigations concluded that the President had been assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald - who was himself shot dead by Jack Ruby while in police custody. However, there has always been doubts that Oswald was the lone gunman who fired shots from the Texas Book Depository which overlooked Dealey Plaza. Footage taken by Abraham Zapruder on 8mm film supported the belief that at least four shots were fired and not three which the Warren Commission claimed. There has always been doubts that Oswald was the lone gunman who fired shots from the Texas Book Depository . It has also been suggested that at least one of the shots came from a completely different direction. Many believe shots were fired by a gunman hiding behind a picket fence on a grassy knoll overlooking the plaza. In 1979 the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) found both the original FBI investigation and the Warren Commission Report to be seriously flawed. The HSCA also concluded that there were at least four shots fired and that it was probable that a conspiracy existed. However, later studies, including one by the National Academy of Sciences, have called into question the accuracy of the evidence used by the HSCA to support its finding of four shots. A flying saucer crashed at Roswell in 1947 - What is certain is that something did crash at Roswell, New Mexico, sometime before July 7, 1947 and - at first - the U.S. authorities stated explicitly that this was a flying saucer or disk. Numerous witnesses reported seeing metallic debris scattered over a wide area and at least one reported seeing a blazing craft crossing the sky shortly before it crashed. In 1989, former mortician Glenn Dennis claimed that he was involved in alien autopsies which were carried out at the Roswell air force base. Some theorists believe autopsies were allegedly carried out on aliens who crashed in the New Mexico desert which was then covered up by American authorities . Weight has been added to the conspiracy theory due to the U.S. military repeatedly changing its story. Since the late 1990s, several former pro-UFO researchers have concluded that the craft was, indeed, part of a U.S. military project and that it was, most likely, some sort of weather balloon. However, Walter Haut, the Roswell Army Air Field public affairs officer, said he saw alien corpses and a craft which was involved in a military cover up. He died in 2005.Nasa faked the moon landings - . Some theorists believe Apollo astronauts did not land on the Moon. They claim Nasa and possibly others deceived the public into believing the landings. They have pointed to photographs from the lunar surface which they claim show camera crosshairs partially behind rocks, a flag planted by Buzz Aldrin moving in a strange way, the lack of stars over the lunar landscape and shadows falling in different directions. Fake? Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, lunar module pilot, walks on the surface of the Moon in July 1969 . The Jesus conspiracy - The theory that launched the novel The Da Vinci Code and a film of the same name. Theorists believe Jesus married Mary Magdalene, had one or more children, and that those children or their descendants emigrated to southern France. Once there, they intermarried with the noble families that would eventually become the Merovingian dynasty, whose special claim to the throne of France is championed today by a secret society called the Priory of Sion. Theorists believe Jesus married Mary Magdalene, had one or more children, and that those children or their descendants emigrated to southern France . Elvis Presley faked his own death - There has been a belief that Elvis did not actually die in 1977. Many even think he is still alive and that he went into hiding. Two tabloid newspapers ran articles covering the continuing 'life' of Presley after his death including a broken leg from a motorcycle accident, all the way up to his 'real death' in the mid 1990s. There has been a belief that Elvis did not actually die in 1977. Many even think he went into hiding . Operation Northwoods - A conspiracy involving a plan by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to launch a fake Cuban terror campaign on American soil to persuade the U.S. public to support an invasion against Castro. The plan involved bombings and the simultaneous hijacking and blowing up of American airliners. The operation was quashed by President Kennedy leading many to speculate that it was linked to his assassination a year later. The plan has also been linked by theorists who believe that the September 11, 2001 attacks were a so-called 'inside job' because of the use of airliners. North American Union - The North American Union (NAU) is a theoretical regional union of Canada, Mexico and the United States similar in structure to the European Union, sometimes including a common currency called the amero. Theorists who believe that the three countries are planning for this believe that it is part of a global conspiracy to set up something called the New World Order (NWO). Officials from all three nations have repeatedly denied that there are plans to create a NAU. Pearl Harbor was allowed to happen - Theorists believe that President Franklin Roosevelt provoked the Japanese attack on the U.S. naval base in Hawaii in December 1941, knew about it in advance and covered up his failure to warn his fleet commanders. Sailors at Naval Air Station Ford Island watch as the destroyer USS Shaw explodes after an attack by Japanese carrier based strike aircraft on the Hawaiian port of Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941 . He apparently needed the attack to provoke Hitler into declaring war on the U.S. because the American public and Congress were overwhelmingly against entering the war in Europe. Theorists believe that the U.S. was warned by the governments of Britain, the Netherlands, Australia, Peru, Korea and the Soviet Union that a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was coming and that the Americans had intercepted and broken all the important Japanese codes in the run up to the attack.","Professor Sir Richard Evans is leading a project into conspiracy theories .

"An American who trained at an al-Qaeda camp in Afghanistan in the spring of 2001 before losing his nerve testified Thursday how he encountered Osama bin Laden and the terror group's spokesman at a safe house — and that bin Laden hinted that a suicide attack on U.S. soil was in the works. 'Just know you have brothers willing to carry their souls in their hands,' bin Laden told the witness, Sahim Alwan, and other recruits, Alwan said on the witness stand in federal court in Manhattan. Asked what he thought that meant, Alwan responded, 'To die.' Signing them up: Osama bin Laden's son-in-law Suliman Abu Ghayth (right) is currently on trial in New York for recruiting terrorists before 9/11 . His testimony came at the trial of bin Laden's son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, who's accused of plotting to kill Americans by being a motivational speaker at al-Qaida training camps before the September 11 attacks and as a spokesman for the terror group afterward when it sought to recruit more militants to its cause. Alwan, 41, was among a half-dozen men who became known as the Lackawanna Six after their arrests on charges of providing material support to terrorists by attending bin Laden's al-Farooq camp in Afghanistan in 2001. He pleaded guilty in 2003 and served about seven years behind bars. Testifying under subpoena, Alwan told jurors that he became an aspiring jihadist after worshipping at a mosque in Lackawanna , New York, where he grew up. In April of 2001, he traveled to Pakistan and crossed the border to Afghanistan, where he was directed to the safe house to wait for an assignment to a training camp. Motivational speaker:  Prosecutors say Ghayth was a motivational speaker at al-Qaida training camps before the September 11 attacks . While staying there, bin Laden showed . up in a truck with an entourage of AK-47-toting men with masks on their . faces, Alwan said. He testified that he recognized bin Laden as the . FBI's 'most wanted guy.' He also testified that Abu Ghaith showed up at the house days later and explained an Islamic oath, or 'bayat.' He said the defendant told the men that if they swore allegiance to bin Laden, they were also expected to back the Taliban. The . recruits were shown a video depicting the 2000 suicide bombing of the . USS Cole in Aden harbor in Yemen that killed 17 American sailors, Alwan . said. Prosecutors say the video was narrated by Abu Ghaith, and portions . of it were shown to jurors Thursday. After . seeing the video and understanding who was behind the USS Cole attack . and the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa in August 1998 that . killed 224 people, including a dozen Americans, he said, 'I knew I was in over my head.' Once . at the camp, where bin Laden visited the trainees one day, Alwan . informed his trainers that he wanted to go home. He said he even faked . an ankle injury, hoping to be sent to Kandahar. But . he was told that he needed to meet face-to-face with bin Laden first . and that the al-Qaida leader knew he was from the United States even . though he and the others had been warned not to disclose that fact. He testified that Bin Laden quizzed him about America, asking, 'How are Muslims there? ... How are the youth there? What do they think of the operations?' By operations, Alwan said, he assumed bin Laden meant suicide missions. 'I just said, ""Oh we don't think about it,""' he testified.

"Just what is handball? That must be the question for players, managers and fans after the first games of the new Premier League season. Mike Dean was correct when he waved away Manchester United’s penalty appeals in the dying minutes of their defeat at home against Swansea when the ball hit Angel Rangel. The full back was very close to the opponent and had his body turned away so it really was a case of unintentional handball. Down at West Ham Chris Foy and his assistant felt differently. Foy, after a long consultation with his assistant, gave a penalty for handball and dismissed Kyle Naughton for the denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity. VIDEO Scroll down for Mauricio Pochettino: The red card was unfair but it was a penalty . Harsh: Chris Foy was right to give a penalty, but Naughton's dismissal was harsh . Naughton was very close to Kevin Nolan as the West Ham man fired towards goal but as the Tottenham defender had his hands raised in what is termed as unnatural position I could see why a penalty was awarded. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino agreed, as I did with him when he felt the red card that followed was harsh. The offence defines that the opportunity must be obvious and I cannot see an angle which shows that the ball was definitely on target or that Hugo Lloris might not have saved the effort. Where doubt exists the referee really should not dismiss a player and I think Spurs have a case to appeal the red card. Finally on to Loftus Road and another handball incident when Hull’s James Chester was deemed to have deliberately handled Junior Hoilett’s cross in the penalty area. Again, he was very close to the ball when it was kicked and his arms were in a natural position, but referee Craig Pawson pointed to the spot. Justice: Charlie Austin misses the penalty awarded for handball that didn't touch Chester's hands or arms . I felt the decision was wrong and therefore a natural justice was served when Allan McGregor saved Charlie Austin’s penalty. These incidents highlighted an inconsistency in the judgement of handball which will cause issues as the season progresses unless resolved by referee chief Mike Riley. Hull manager Steve Bruce rightly pointed out that there has been no tinkering to the wording of the law dealing with handball but there has been a clear change in decision-making, with referees receiving more advice on the definition of handball. What that has led to appears to be unnecessary confusion for all involved. Handball remains the only offence which in the law needs to have a degree of intent; have a look at James Chester’s ‘offence’ and ask yourself if there was really an intention to handle the ball? Impressive: Mike Dean had a performed well when officiating between Mancghester United and Swansea . Penalty: Victor Anichebe also won a particularly soft penalty against Sunderland .","Mike Dean correct not to give Manchester United penalty .

"Thousands of migrants are exploiting lax EU rules to bring their families and spouses to Britain by the back door. Foreign nationals from outside Europe who would be unlikely to gain a visa to live or work in the UK are instead applying for citizenship elsewhere in the EU. Under Brussels rules, they can then move to Britain and apply for permission to bring in their spouse or children. 'Growing problem': Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration John Vine has warned that non-Europeans were using Brussels' free movement rules to get into the UK . Now a damning report by an immigration watchdog has found that the system is suffering ‘significant abuse’ at the hands of migrants who falsely claim they are related or married to a non-European living in the UK. Yesterday, Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration John Vine called it a ‘growing problem’. He said: ‘Our findings suggest the European citizenship route is becoming an increasingly important way into the UK for those whose origins lie outside the EEA [European Economic Area], particularly now that the immigration rules have been tightened.’ The report looked at more than 100 sample cases from the Home Office between April and September last year. It found that more than a third of Western European nationals – 36 per cent – who were applying for citizenship for their partner were born in Africa, Asia or South America and had gained European citizenship before arriving in Britain. David Cameron vowed to cut net immigration to below 100,000 a year, but is failing because of the soaring number of Europeans moving to the UK . In . a quarter of cases the ‘sponsors’ – whose new nationalities included . German, Italian and Spanish – were born in the same non-EU country as . their partner. In one case, a migrant who acquired Italian . nationality before then moving to the UK received 97 per cent of his . income from welfare handouts. Some 60 per cent of those applying for . citizenship for a  so-called spouse last year failed because immigration . officials feared the relationship was fake – but thousands still slip . through the net. Some had taken part in a sham marriage while in the . UK and others claimed they had been wed by proxy, where a couple remain . in Britain and both are represented at an overseas wedding ceremony, . usually by family members. Most proxy marriages were found to be . invalid, according to the report. It found that there is also a . problem with Eastern European women moving to the UK and applying for . citizenship for men they had supposedly married, mainly from Nigeria, . Ghana and Pakistan. Mr Vine said there had been ‘significant . attempted abuse by non-EEA nationals applying on the basis of marriage . or civil partnership with a European citizen’. He added: ‘If the . Home Office does not act decisively to identify and tackle these abuses, . many of the individuals involved may go on to obtain settlement in the . UK on the basis of relationships that are not genuine.’ Inspectors found . that in some cases where there was suspicion of a sham marriage, the . culprits were not properly investigated. The report added that the Home . Office targeted sham marriage and trafficking by organised crime gangs, . but prosecuted fewer individuals. Home Affairs Select Committee . chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘I am deeply concerned by these findings. It is . vital that all applications for admission to this country are subjected . to appropriate levels of scrutiny. We have seen during the passport . crisis that standards of scrutiny for applications should never be . lowered.’ Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘It is . clear that after four years in office Theresa May just hasn’t got a grip . on sham marriages.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are taking . ever tougher action to crack down on those who try to cheat our . immigration system by abusing marriage laws and we are pleased the Chief . Inspector has praised our robust approach to identifying sham . marriages. Last year, we intervened in more than 1,300 sham marriages – . more than double that of the previous year.’","European citizenship 'increasingly important' way into UK, Sir John warns .

"Inquest: Paul Dalling brewed the deadly concoction using poppy seeds thinking it would produce a 'pleasant' drowsy effect . A man died after drinking homemade poppy tea using a recipe he found online, an inquest heard. Paul Dalling, 27, brewed the deadly concoction using poppy seeds, thinking the drink would induce a pleasant drowsy effect. But the DJ, of Milford Haven, west Wales, died when his central nervous system shut down after he consumed a pint of the tea. A coroner warned others of the dangers of making 'poppy tea' - infamously drank in opium dens. Pembrokeshire Coroner Mark Layton said: 'Drinking poppy tea is potentially fatal. 'It is impossible to gauge the dosage as the strength varies from plant to plant.' Mr Dalling and his friends made a tea with crushed poppy seeds using a recipe they found on the internet. Although it is unknown which recipe they used, there are dozens of online blogs and websites advising how to make the dangerous concoction. Many recipes use supermarkets' own brands of poppy seeds, which can be found in ordinary food products, including bread, biscuits and cakes. The inquest heard Mr Dalling drank the tea and smoked cannabis before going for a night out with friends. He returned the his home, where he lived with his partner and her young child. Dyfed-Powys Police coroner’s officer Jeremy Davies said: 'While in bed, Mr Dalling was coughing and felt hot to touch but was not in a state which caused alarm.

'But his partner was then unable to wake him and there was blood around his nose and mouth so she called the emergency services. Poppy tea is a herbal infusion brewed from poppy straw or seeds. Side effects include drowsiness, stomach ache, lethargy, urinary retention, constipation, and nausea. At higher doses, it becomes dangerous and can cause death through factors like respiratory arrest or inhalation of vomit. Frequent users can become dependent  and withdrawal can cause cramps, insomnia, craving, lethargy and mental problems. There . have been a number of deaths reported from the drinking of poppy tea, . including a teenager from Nova Scotia and a young Tasmanian man, both in . 2012. 'The ambulance centre talked her through CPR but Mr Dalling was pronounced dead at home.' A post-mortem found levels of morphine and codeine - both present in poppy tea - in Paul’s body. Mr Dalling, described by friends as a 'a lovely guy,' enjoyed going to festivals and listening to drum and bass music. Mr Layton ruled that his death was drugs-related. The tragedy happened just four years after another man from Milford Haven died from drinking 'poppy tea'. Tristan Roberts, 28, overdosed on morphine after drinking three cups of the tea to calm him before bed. At the time his mother Sabine said: 'I think that there are quite a few people who think that anything that is really natural must be safe or must be a good thing.

"Less a television programme, more a way of life, Match of the Day has played a special part in millions of people’s lives for the past 50 years. Including mine. And, as we celebrate the anniversary of its first programme, it is worth reflecting how a simple but brilliant format then remains a ‘simply brilliant’ format now. Famous face: Jimmy Hill made more than 600 appearances on Match of the Day as presenter and analyst . From its instantly recognisable theme tune, to its famous cast of presenters, pundits and commentators, it has tracked a remarkable football journey that spans from Ramsey to Rooney. The biggest star is the action itself; the football has always come first, the talking after that, a principle the programme has stuck to down the years. And despite wall-to-wall live football, Match of the Day remains the most famous brand in televised sport. VIDEO First episode of Match of the Day . That's entertainment: Despite the proliferation of live Premier League football, Match of the Day still thrives . Lucky omen: A black cat runs across the pitch in front of the Kop during first game to be shown on MotD . By the late 1970s I was a starry-eyed assistant producer on the programme. On my first Saturday, I had a bit of lunch in the BBC canteen to settle my ‘pre-match’ nerves and found myself sharing a table with Carry On star Hattie Jacques and a green and purple alien straight off the Dr Who set. He had egg and chips, then went off to conquer the universe. A decade later I was editor of Match of the Day, helping drive the programme’s agenda. We strived to provide the first and most informed analysis of the day’s events. On April 15, 1989, that desperate day of the Hillsborough Disaster, I fought to keep our programme in the schedules so we could relay the developing story through our own experienced broadcasters, Desmond Lynam and Jimmy Hill, who had both been there that afternoon. I remain proud of that programme but wish it had never needed to be made. Legend: TV commentator John Motson covered top matches for over 30 years for the BBC . Where the show’s football opinions led, others followed. And with Lynam, the incomparable Hill, freshly retired Alan Hansen and future star presenter, Gary Lineker, in the pundits’ chairs, life was never dull. On one typically frantic afternoon, a producer scribbled down instructions for post-match reactions. One was for the BBC director at Wimbledon, who had just beaten Liverpool. ‘Get me an interview with Vinnie Jones and ROY Kinnear!’ it read. The Crazy Gang’s actual manager, Joe Kinnear, was obviously more difficult to get hold of than the late, much-loved British comedian! VIDEO First time Match of the Day theme tune broadcast in 1970 . On Monday mornings I would often field a phone call or two from irate managers who felt their team had been treated unfairly. And to this day, fans don’t like their team being featured last. The show itself only came about because, in the early 1960s, BBC’s ambitions to carry live league and cup football were repeatedly thwarted by football authorities. Football League chief Alan Hardaker was concerned the game would be damaged by over-exposure on TV. Ironically, now one pump primes the other. A deal was finally struck and a fee of £20,000 was agreed for 36 ‘highlights’ matches, and the new series’ home was to be the fledgling BBC2, then only broadcasting in London. When the first programme went on air at 6.30pm on Saturday, August 22, the 47,620 crowd at Anfield that had watched champions Liverpool beat Arsenal 3-2 in ‘Beatleville’, as commentator, Kenneth Wolstenholme regaled us, was more than watched the TV show. Favourite: Match of the Day has played a special part in millions of people's lives for the past 50 years . A black cat ran across the pitch that day. A lucky omen for the new programme? Reviews were mixed. One TV critic claimed: ‘It looks like a proper clanger to me. The real sporting breakthrough on TV will come when pay TV arrives.’ Well, half right, because despite the proliferation of live football, Match of the Day still thrives, this season with some new faces but an established format. As one’s own life-cycle spins, I have found myself with two young sons hiding behind the settee waiting for it to start. And, as the years have flown past, we all now share a beer before settling down to watch Lineker introduce the action. On Saturday night, we’ll raise a glass to Match of the Day — a show with a clock that just keeps ticking .

The size 12 writer said: 'If someone is overweight and it is going to cost them more to get to their destination then they should pay more' 'If someone is overweight and it is going to cost them more to get to their destination then they should pay more,' she added. Samantha's comments came in response to the opinions of plus size model Verity Brown. She argued that rather than charging obese people extra to fly, airlines should make their seats wider in order to accommodate larger passengers. Debate: Verity said airlines should accommodate larger passengers but Samantha said they should lose weight . Who's right? Verity said a fat tax is discrimination but Samantha doesn't believe she should pay more to cover the cost of fuel needed to power a plane made heavier by obese people . Verity, 37, from Birmingham said: 'A lot of people I know have had quite degrading experiences in terms of feeling embarrassed when they have to ask for a seat belt extension. I've never had an issue in terms of fitting in a seat so I think the idea of having to pay per weight is ridiculous.' 'I would be furious if my flight prices went up to . accommodate the fact a certain part of the population are getting bigger' Asked whether she thinks obese people should pay for a second seat, she replied: 'I don't need a second seat, slightly larger people may benefit from it. What we need to realise is people are getting bigger - not just around the waist. 'In the last 100 years people on average are four inches bigger so the airlines need to recognise that and be more customer-focused and start accommodating their passengers not just charging more money.' Writer Samantha, 42, who lives in France, said she did not agree with Verity's view. She said: 'Not all of us are getting bigger, I fly frequently . for work and I would be furious if my flight prices went up to . accommodate the fact a certain part of the population are getting bigger.' Opposing views: Verity said pay per weight is ridiculous but Samantha thinks it's fair . She added: 'Our society thinks we have a . god given right to fly, to eat what we like and not to exercise and . everyone else is going to pay for us, that's just wrong.' Samantha argued that rather than expecting other people to pay more for their flights or calling on airlines to provide wider seats, overweight people should instead consider losing weight. She cited her own example having been overweight as a child and that of a friend who she  said has never felt better since shedding the pounds. She explained: 'I was big as a child . and it doesn't feel very nice. One of my friends used to need an . extended seat belt (on a plane). She said the best feeling in the world . is going . from being clinically obese to normal weight and that not having to ask . for seat belt has changed her life.' Samoa Air recently became the world's first airline to institute a 'pay-by-weight' system, where the weight of a passenger and their luggage determines fare price . Verity questioned where the line is drawn over a fat tax given a body builder isn't obese but still weighs more than the average person. 'This is price discrimination, you can't charge a fat person more money for the same service' She said: 'Muscle is denser than fat so body builders and athletes are not seen as fat so it's a fine line. This is price discrimination, you can't charge a fat person more money for the same service.' The debate was discussed on the ITV breakfast show after Samoa Air recently became the world's first airline to institute a 'pay-by-weight' system, where the weight of a passenger and their luggage determines fare price. Their chief executive Chris Langton said this was the 'fairest' way to charge travellers while addressing the obesity crisis - an acute problem in Samoa's Pacific region. Another carrier, Southwest Airlines requires its 'customers of size' who do not fit between the armrests to purchase another seat. In a November 2012 report on the issue, Dr Bharat Bhatta from Norway's Sogn og Fjordane University College said that a 'fat tax' is the way to price tickets 'correctly'. He said: 'The model can be technically and economically feasible to implement and its proper implementation may provide significant benefits to airlines, passengers and society at large, not just economic transfers.'","Size 12 writer joined debate on Daybreak .

"The onetime Republican vice presidential candidate who quit her job as Alaska's governor wrote on Tuesday that President Barack Obama should be forced out of his White House gig. 'Enough is enough of the years of abuse . from this president,' she wrote. 'His unsecured border crisis is the last straw that . makes the battered wife say, ""no mas"".' 'The many impeachable offenses of Barack Obama can no longer be ignored. If after all this he’s not impeachable, then no one is.' Her demand rocketed around the political world, attracting thousands of tweets and keeping the tea party darling in the public eye – which may be what she wants. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has riled up the tea party troops by demanding the impeachment of President Barack Obama . Not fazed: Obama met with NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen in the Oval Office on Tuesday, and the White House hasn't commented on Palin's red-meat essay . Mocking Obama is nothing new for Palin – in March she compared the bear-wrestling Russian president Vladimir Putin to Obama 'who wears mom jeans' – but she is the highest-profile Republican yet to call for his ouster. Palin hosts a Sportsman Channel reality TV show called 'Amazing America,' a program that was renewed on Monday for a second season. She also planted a seed in Hollywood last week, throwing her hat into the ring as a potential future hire to replace one of the fired co-hosts on the talk show 'The View.' Rosie O'Donnell, the outspoken liberal former comedian, was signed on Tuesday to take one slot alongside actress Whoopi Goldberg, according to TMZ. But the show's producers are reportedly still looking to add a Hispanic woman and a conservative. Palin told The Hollywood Reporter on Monday that the show would benefit from her 'real-life groundedness [sic], candor and commonsense.' 'I hear everyone recently got canned from The View,' she said. '[M]aybe a show like that needs a punch of reality and a voice of reason from America's heartland to knock some humble sense into their scripts.' But a day later it's Palin's verbal punch in the nose to the commander-in-chief that has Washington, D.C. tongues wagging. 'Without borders, there is no nation. Obama knows this,' Palin wrote in her essay at Breitbart.com. 'Opening our borders to a flood of illegal immigrants is deliberate. This is his fundamental transformation of America. It’s the only promise he has kept.' Her jab came as national attention is focused on a flood of illegal immigrant children who have swarmed across America's southern border. Republicans claim Obama's own 2012 policy shift, delaying for years the deportation of illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, encouraged tens of thousands of underage children to make the trip – without adults – from Central America. Tea party anger: Protesters outside a U.S. Border Patrol station in Murrieta, California clashed with federal agents on Independence Day as the agency was foiled in an attempt to bus in and process illegal immigrants who have flooded the U.S. -Mexico border . Preaching to the choir: Conservatives who identify with the tea party and usually rally around Palin have already decided to blame President Obama for the border crisis . Obama, according to Palin, has 'given false hope and taxpayer’s change to millions of foreign nationals who want to sneak into our country illegally.' 'Because of Obama’s purposeful dereliction of duty an untold number of illegal immigrants will kick off their shoes and come on in, competing against Americans for our jobs and limited public services.' 'We’re the ones getting screwed,' Palin claimed, 'as we’re forced to follow all our government’s rules while others are not required to do so.' Promos for Palin's 'Amazing America' show are aggressive and no-holds-barred, like her rhetorical style, and both are seemingly calculated to generate controversy . Impeachment proceedings in Congress, she wrote, can't wait because 'irreparable harm can be done in this lame-duck term as he continues to make up his own laws as he goes along.' A host of Republican lawmakers have said in the past that impeachment should be an option, but few have expended the political capital required to demand it publicly. Senators James Inhofe and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Tim Scott of South Carolina have jumped aboard the impeachment train. So have Reps. Jason Chaffetz  of Utah, Blake Farenthold and Michael Burgess of Texas, Kerry Bentivolio Tim Scott of South Carolina – who is now a senator – and (R-Mich.), and Tim Scott of Michigan and then-Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina. Scott is now i the U.S. Senate. Allen West of Florida and Tom Tancredo of Colorado both gave the idea their approval before leaving Congress. The South Dakota Republican Party passed a resolution this weekend calling for impeachment as well. A host of scandals have plagued the president, mostly in his second term, including claims that his IRS targeted conservative groups for political punishment, that his NSA spied on millions of Americans without legal authority, and that his DOJ tapped journalists' phones and copied their emails. The 'Obamacare' medical insurance overhaul program has become more unpopular with each month. And the president has been dogged by Republicans' claims that his 2011 Iraq troop withdrawal – known in military circles as the 'Obama bug-out' – led to the current crisis there, where heavily armed Islamists have established what they call the world's first jihadi state.","Former GOP vice presidential nominee wrote online that the president is like an abusive husband and 'his unsecured border crisis is the last straw that makes the battered wife say, ""no mas""'
She says 'Obama's purposeful dereliction of duty' brought 'an untold number of illegal immigrants' to the U.S.
Palin insists that Obama will cause 'irreparable harm' to America if he's allowed to remain in the White House .

"Three veteran producers have been fired by a San Francisco TV station after they published a series of fake and racially offensive names supposedly of the pilots on-board . the crashed Asiana 214 flight. Investigative producer Roland DeWolk, special projects producer Cristina Gastelu and producer Brad Belstock were all fired over the incident. Noon news producer Elvin Sledge told colleagues he was leaving for health reasons. Scroll down for video... 'Oh s***' KTVU producer Brad Belstock, pictured, tweeted these two words after the humiliating broadcast went out . In poor taste: KTVU News read these names live . on television stating that the National Transportation Safety . Board had confirmed that these were the pilots of Asiana 214 . According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Belstock . revealed his embarrassment on the social networking site yesterday, just . moments after an anchor in all seriousness read four 'names' including Captain Sum Ting Wong. The producer with seven year's experience at KTVU wrote 'Oh S***' It is unclear whether Belstock - who cites ordering video and . writing scripts among his responsibilities at the network - was in charge of the broadcast, but his two . word response and entire Twitter profile was deleted moments later. News Director Lee Rosenthal called newsroom staff into a conference room Wednesday and informed them of the dismissals. KTVU was forced to make an immediate apology moments after the on-air gaffe at Midday yesterday. Fired: Roland De Wolk has been dismissed following the on-air mistake . Presenter . Tori Campbell announced that the station had just learned the names of . the four pilots who were on board Asiana flight 214 when it crashed at . San Francisco International Airport on Saturday. She then proceeded to read out four fake names from a teleprompter as they appeared on screen over footage of the wreckage. The names poked fun at the crash and have been further criticized for their racist undertones. The first name — 'Captain Sum Ting Wong' might have been a giveaway that something was not quite right. However, . with the camera's rolling and in the middle of a live broadcast, Ms. Campbell continued to read without so much as flinching: 'Wi Tu Lo, Ho Lee Fuk, Bang Ding Ow.' It is not yet clear where the names, which mock the tragedy which killed three, originated. The . broadcaster said they came from a source who they were refusing to . identify. They also tried to justify the move saying they confirmed the names with the National Transportation Safety . Board before airing them. The safety board admitted a summer intern told KTVU the spelling of the names was correct. The . broadcaster said they never checked the position of the employee in the . organisation and rushed to get the names into their lunchtime . broadcast. On his evening newscast, anchor Frank Somerville apologized further. 'First, we never read the names out loud, phonetically sounding them out,' he said. 'Then, . during our phone call to the NTSB where the person confirmed the . spellings of the names, we never asked that person to give us their . position with the agency. 'We heard this person verify the information without questioning who they were and then rushed the names on our noon newscast.' In . a statement the NTSB admitted a summer intern had 'erroneously' confirmed the names of the flight crew and was 'acting outside the scope . of his authority' in doing so. 'The . National Transportation Safety Board apologizes for inaccurate and . offensive names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots of . Asiana flight 214, which crashed at San Francisco International Airport . on July 6,' the NTSB said in a statement. 'Earlier . today, in response to an inquiry from a media outlet, a summer intern . acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed . the names of the flight crew on the aircraft,' it added. Days earlier, KTVU news director Lee Rosenthal was crowing about how good his news operation had performed. 'Being . first on air and on every platform in all aspects of our coverage was a . great accomplishment, but being 100% accurate, effectively using our . great sources and social media without putting a single piece of . erroneous information on our air, is what we are most proud of as a . newsroom.' The station issued a statement on acknowledging it had 'misidentified the pilots involved.' Third victim: A San Francisco hospital says a third victim of a plane crash, a Chinese girl, has died from her injuries. She was among about a dozen injured still in hospital after Asiana flight 214 crashed as it approached the airport too low last week . In an-online apology, KTVU general . manager Tom Raponi wrote: 'We sincerely regret the error and took . immediate action to apologize, both in the newscast where the mistake . occurred, as well as on our website and social media sites. Nothing is . more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and . integrity, and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of . error does not happen again.' However, the apologies from KTVU and the NTSB have done little to abate anger over the issue. Paul Cheung, president of the Asian American Journalists Association, said in a statement: 'Those . names were not only wrong, but so grossly offensive that it’s hard for . us at the Asian American Journalists Association to fathom how those . names made it on the broadcast. 'With . such a vaunted reputation among local news stations, we expected much . more from KTVU. We fail to understand how those obviously phony names . could escape detection before appearing on the broadcast and were spoken . by the news anchor. We urge KTVU to conduct a thorough review to . prevent similar lapses.' 'AAJA . is embarrassed for the anchor of the noon broadcast, who was as much a . victim as KTVU’s viewers and KTVU’s hard-working staff, including the . journalists who produced stellar work covering the crash.' 'But . we’re mostly saddened that a tragedy that took the lives of three . people and injured scores of other passengers could be taken as an . opportunity for an apparent joke.' Another unidentified teen has died of her injuries bring the death toll in the tragic crash up to three. Broken news: Anchor Tori Campbell read the names off the teleprompter and didn't bat an eye, adding that the information had been confirmed by the National Transportation Safety Board . A further 180 people were injured, many serious. Based in Oakland, California, the Fox affiliate represents a city where 16.8 per cent of the population is Asian. KTVU . also broadcasts in two heavily Asian-populated communities: San . Francisco, where Asians make up 33.3 per cent of the total population and San . Jose, where 32 per cent of the population is Asian. KTVU’s . false report comes after a week of speculating whether last week's . disastrous Asiana Airlines crash could be attributed to Korean 'culture' and whether South Korea’s tradition of deference to hierarchy could . have played a role in the crash. Asiana Airlines has identified two of the four flying crew on board as the pilot and copilot Lee Kang-kook and Lee Jung-min. Coverage . of the tragic plane crash at San Francisco International Airport, which . killed three people and injured dozens of others last Saturday has . proven tricky for some news outlets. The Chicago Sun-Times apologized for its front page headline . 'FRIGHT 214,' which was criticized for sounding like a stereotype of an . Asian accent.","Roland DeWolk, Cristina Gastelu and Brad Belstock .

"Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush says his views about America's place in the world will often be compared with those of his father and brother, but insists, 'I am my own man.' The likely Republican candidate for president, in remarks Wednesday to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, said he is 'lucky' to have family members who have 'shaped America's foreign policy from the Oval Office.' 'I recognize that as a result, my views will often be held up in comparison to theirs' – sometimes in contrast to theirs,' Bush said. In the course of answering questions from the audience, he admitted that 2002 pre-war intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was wrong, seeming to part with his brother President George W. Bush on his justification for sending America's military in full-bore. 'There were mistakes made in Iraq, for sure,' he said. Scroll down for video . Former Florida Governor Jeb. Bush took questions after speaking to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs on Wednesday in Chicago . In his brother's shadow: Jeb, right, said he loves his older brother George, center, 'but I am my own man' But he also praised his brother for an act of political 'courage' for later authorizing a troop surge in Iraq to stabilize the country, something few in the federal government at the time thought was wise. That move, he claimed, was 'hugely successful.' 'I am my own man – and my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experiences,' he insisted. 'Each president learns from those who came before – their principles, their adjustments.' While Bush has not yet formally declared his candidacy, he is all but certain to run for president in 2016 and has already faced questions about how he would distinguish himself from his family, particularly his older brother, former President George W. Bush. The older Bush brother finished his second term in 2009 amid an unpopular war in Iraq, an economy in freefall and with a majority of Americans disapproving of his job performance. Among donors, Jeb Bush has noted a strong family and religious bond with his older brother, but has also said they are not clones and have differences common among siblings. Some foreign policy experts say Bush must go farther. Peter D. Feaver, a former national security adviser to George W. Bush, said that includes taking a stance on whether George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq in 2003 was appropriate. Jeb Bush did not answer that question directly when asked about it last week after an event in Florida for his mother's literacy charity. 'The answer he gave last week, about not litigating the past, that's not a satisfying answer,' Feaver said. 'He has to come up with a better answer than that.' He seemed to go there on Wednesday. Feaver said Bush, should he win election, would inherit an international landscape far different from the one his brother left behind. Instead of the lurking threat of al-Qaida, Jeb Bush would take on a map dotted with violent and unstable spots that include Syria, Iraq and Ukraine. 'The United States has an undiminished ability to shape events and build alliances of free people,' he said. 'We can project power and enforce peaceful stability in far-off areas of the globe.' Man of the people? Jeb is trying to distinguish himself from his more famous relatives . The former governor insisted on Wednesday that the Obama administration's policies on Cuba and the ISIS terror army are wrong-headed . Bush aides also released what they called a preliminary group of experts who would provide him advice. They included familiar names, such as James Baker III and George Shultz, both secretaries of State under President Ronald Reagan; former Homeland Security secretaries Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, and former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, all three of whom served under George W. Bush. The list also included some lesser-known names, such as Meghan O'Sullivan, a former national security adviser to George W. Bush, who now teaches at Harvard and is seen as key to Jeb Bush's idea of lessening U.S. dependence on Middle East energy. Bush has harsh words for the foreign policy of President Barack Obama, whose administration is 'inconsistent and indecisive' and has led the U.S. to lose 'the trust and the confidence of our friends.' 'The great irony of the Obama presidency is this: Someone who came to office promising greater engagement with the world has left America less influential in the world,' Bush said. And he spelled out a need for America to respond to the threat of the ISIS terror army with a strategy that 'takes them out.' 'There's no talking about this. That's just not going to . work for terrorism,' he said. Bush insisted that the Obama administration's approach to Cuba was wrongheaded, and blasted the White House for conducting secret negotiations that will give the Raul Castro regime access to American tourism dollars and open markets. 'We got nothing in return,' he said. 'I wouldn't call what we did a reset. I would call it bad negotiations.' Bush aides also confirmed late Tuesday that former Minnesota congressman Vin Weber, a senior policy aide to 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, was advising Bush.","Former Florida governor still hasn't addressed the question of whether or not George W. Bush made the right decision in starting a war in Iraq .

"In the midst of the recent uprising of Islamic militants in Iraq - and the thousands of Iraqis they've slaughtered as they try to take over the violence-plagued country - former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney-Perry, a one-time assistant secretary of state, are speaking out about the series of 'wrong' decisions the Obama administration has made that made the uprising possible. Last week, a group of Islamic extremists began an insurgency throughout Iraq and have taken over several cities - including Fallujah, Tikrit, Mosul and Tel Afar - on their way to Baghdad. After saying he wouldn't send U.S. troops to the region, Obama sent 250 soldiers to guard the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Harsh: Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz - a former deputy assistant secretary of state - have harsh words for Obama's handling of the insurgency in Iraq . Jihad: Earlier this month, a jihadi group of Islamic militants called the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria began taking over cities in Iraq . The Cheneys oppose the president's plan for the uprising so far, and are critical of his actions before the uprisings that allowed the jihadi group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to grow. 'Rarely has a U.S. president been so wrong about so much at the expense . of so many,' the Cheneys wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. 'Too many times to count, Mr. Obama has told us he is . ""ending"" the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan—as though wishing made it so. His rhetoric has now come crashing into reality. Watching the black-clad . ISIS jihadists take territory once secured by American blood is final . proof, if any were needed, that America's enemies are not ""decimated."" They are emboldened and on the march.' The Cheneys contend that the uprising in Iraq is not just a threat to Iraqis, but to Americans, as well, as the country could become a safe-haven for al Qaeda and other terrorist groups that could carry out 9/11-style attacks on the U.S. and its allies. Fore! The Cheneys say that while the situation in Iraq escalates, Obama is playing golf and talking about climate change . The Cheneys mention trips they've been on to the Middle East, where government officials are confused as to what Obama has been doing in the region following the wars in Irag and Afghanistan, and say that the president is abandoning the few friends the U.S. has in the Arab world. 'In one Arab capital, a senior official pulled out a map of Syria and . Iraq,' the Cheneys write. 'Drawing an arc with his finger from Raqqa province in northern . Syria to Anbar province in western Iraq, he said, ""They will control . this territory. Al Qaeda is building safe havens and training camps . here. Don't the Americans care?"" 'Our president doesn't seem to. Iraq is at risk of falling to a radical . Islamic terror group and Mr. Obama is talking climate change. Terrorists . take control of more territory and resources than ever before in . history, and he goes golfing. He seems blithely unaware, or indifferent . to the fact, that a resurgent al Qaeda presents a clear and present . danger to the United States of America.' Brutal: ISIS crucified this man and left a note on his body saying 'Cleanliness is a civilized matter that shows ur ethics and love for country . Murderers: ISIS has reportedly driven through Iraqi cities and indiscriminately shot at random citizens . After the Iraq War, the Cheneys say al Qaeda was nearly defeated in the country thanks primarily to military efforts by the U.S. and its allies. Rather than stay in the country and make sure the peace was preserved, Obama pulled the U.S. out of the unfinished conflict, according to the Cheneys. Mr. Obama had only to negotiate an agreement to leave behind some . residual American forces, training and intelligence capabilities to help . secure the peace. Instead, he abandoned Iraq and we are watching . American defeat snatched from the jaws of victory. The Cheneys cite a Rand study that shows a 58 percent increase in the number of Salafi-jihadists between 2010 and 2013. They say that 'in the face of this threat, Mr. Obama is busy ushering America's adversaries into positions of power in the Middle East.' 'First it was the Russians in Syria. Now, in a move that defies . credulity, he toys with the idea of ushering Iran into Iraq,' they write. 'Only a fool . would believe American policy in Iraq should be ceded to Iran, the . world's largest state sponsor of terror.' Violence: The number of Iraqis executed by ISIS since the uprising began is in the thousands . They write that there is 'a dire need for American leadership around the world' and that the president has failed our allies by abandoning conflicts before they are actually over. 'It is time the president and his allies faced some hard truths: America . remains at war, and withdrawing troops from the field of battle while . our enemies stay in the fight does not ""end"" wars. Weakness and retreat . are provocative. U.S. withdrawal from the world is disastrous and puts . our own security at risk,' the Cheneys write. They went on to quote former President - and conservative hero - Ronald Reagan. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan said, ""If history teaches anything, it . teaches that simple-minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our . adversaries is folly. It means the betrayal of our past, the squandering . of our freedom."" President Obama is on track to securing his legacy as . the man who betrayed our past and squandered our freedom.","In a scathing op-ed, the Cheneys slam the Obama administration for its handling of the jihadi uprising in Iraq .
They say the president's abandoning Iraq before the war was over set the stage for the current uprising .

Fruitful: There are 6,000 apple varieties worldwide and over 2,000 different types kept at the National Fruit Collection in Kent . The tree’s fruits now include rare cooking apples such as the Withington Fillbasket, which originated in 1883, and Eady’s Magnum, from 1908, as well as more recognisable favourites. Mr Barnett, 40, said yesterday: ‘I started working at a nursery with acres of land and around 90 varieties of apple trees in rows. ‘I wanted to grow my own trees but I didn’t have the area to plant that number so I started a “family tree” where I can have all the different varieties in a smaller amount of space. I add to it each year by budding in the summer and grafting in the winter.’ For budding, a bud is cut from another apple tree and inserted into the bark of Mr Barnett’s tree, while grafting involves the same process but usually with a small branch carrying more than one bud. Over time the buds and branches grow to become part of the main tree and eventually produce even more varieties of apple. Mr Barnett added: ‘The tree has cooking, eating and cider apples on it but I normally only get a few of each variety of apple each year. It’s great to see all the different colours and sized apples on the tree this time of year.’ He has had to prop up some of the branches with planks because of the sheer weight of the fruit growing on the tree, which stands some 20ft high. He will gather his unique harvest next month, when they are at their juiciest, and show them at horticultural fairs. Core structure: Paul has been grafting different kinds of apple onto the one tree, shown here, since 1989 . Mr Barnett said: ‘My favourite eating apple is Winter Gem because it has a really nice flavour. It’s crunchy, crisp and sweet.’ He said that he adds to his collection either by buying fruit from the home of the National Fruit Collection in Kent – which has about 2,200 of the 6,000 known varieties – or swapping them with other apple enthusiasts. He said: ‘It’s really important for people to know what kind of apples they are growing, to know when they should be picking, eating and storing them. ‘There have been some varieties which have been lost over time. I don’t want to see any disappear. You don’t know what will happen in the future with global warming or pesticides. ‘You may need to crossbreed apples with older varieties to make them resistant to such things. ‘That’s why every type of apple is worth preserving.’ Fruit of his labours: Paul Barnett adds to his collection either by buying them in from the home of the National Fruit Collection or swapping them with other enthusiasts . Mr Barnett also has nine smaller family trees growing plums, pears, cherries and apples. He said: ‘My family have always been into horticulture, so it’s in my genes. My parents help me pick and tend to my garden. ‘My great-grandfather was particularly good with fruits so I have always grown up with people passionate about gardening.’ Last week it was predicted that this autumn’s harvest of apples will be one of the biggest and best tasting ever. British apples are some of the sweetest and most colourful for years, according to Richard Capper, of Stocks Farm in Suckley, Worcestershire. ‘The good weather and summer heat has upped the sugar levels in the fruit,’ said Mr Capper, who expects to gather in almost 2,000 tons of the fruit from his orchards. Gala, Bramley and Braeburn apples from the farm’s 100 acres will be sold to all the major supermarkets after they have been gathered by a team of 36 pickers over ten days.","Paul Barnett has been growing his 'family tree' for over 20 years .

"Fears that Ebola is spreading in Europe increased today as two nurses with possible exposure to the deadly virus were rushed to hospital with suspicious symptoms in two countries. A patient in Denmark was admitted to hospital with symptoms of Ebola, in what officials feared could be the country's first case of the deadly disease. But hours later an official from the Hvidovre Hospital near Copenhagen where the nurse was taken told Reuters test results had come back negative for Ebola. The unnamed patient was believed to be an aid worker with Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)who recently arrived in Denmark from West Africa with a fever - one of the first symptoms of the potentially fatal disease. Hvidovre Hospital, near Copenhagen, confirmed that the unnamed patient is being examined for Ebola . Earlier, the Danish branch of MSF said in a statement the test was being carried out on one of its employees who had returned from West Africa and felt a 'slight rise' in temperature. In France, a woman who recently helped treat an Ebola patient in France was rushed to the infectious diseases unit of Begin hospital in Paris with a high fever, Le Parisien reported. She reportedly helped tend to a MSF nurse who contracted Ebola in Liberia and was released from a Paris hospital earlier this month after successful treatment. If Ebola was confirmed, it would be the first case of Ebola transmission within France. Meanwhile, Spanish nurse Teresa Romero, the first person to contract Ebola in Europe, his well enough to spend time out of bed in her isolated ward in Madrid. Teresa Romero, pictured here with her dog Excalibur, has been able to speak to her husband Javier by telephone - but he has not yet revealed that her beloved pet  has been put down. Teresa, 44, spent ten minutes chatting to her husband Javier, who is pictured here looking out the window of an isolation ward at Madrid's Carlos III hospital. He was placed in quarantine as a precautionary measure . She has been able to speak to her husband Javier by telephone - but he has not yet revealed that her beloved pet dog Excalibur has been put down. Teresa, 44, yesterday spent ten minutes chatting to Javier, who is also  in isolation after being placed in quarantine as a precautionary measure. A cousin of the nurse told Madrid media: 'She is already getting up and sitting down, drinking liquids and showing energy. Just getting here is quite a triumph and the most critical days are behind us.' But she stressed that Teresa was still seriously ill and could suffer a relapse. The nurse's dog Excalibur was seized and euthanized by Madrid authorities after Teresa was admitted to hospital suffering from the deadly virus. Excalibur was seized and euthanized by Madrid authorities after Teresa was admitted to hospital with Ebola . This was despite protests across the city, and 30 to 40 animal rights activists taking up positions outside the Romeros' apartment complex, determined to prevent officials from entering . 'I'm in the hospital and I'm making a call to all people to help me save my dog Excalibur because they want to kill him just like that, without following any procedure,' Javier said in a video appeal from his hospital room where he was being quarantined. Within hours, the cause went viral. On Twitter, the hashtag SalvemosaExcalibur - 'Let's Save Excalibur' - was tweeted nearly 400,000 times in 24 hours. Excalibur was 'sedated beforehand to avoid suffering,' Madrid's regional health agency said in a statement. A placard is hung on a dog during a protest against the killing of Teresa Romeros's pet dog Excalibur . The corpse was then 'put into a sealed biosecurity device and transferred for incineration at an authorized disposal facility,' the statement said. The health agency said that the dog was killed because it posed a risk of transmitting the disease to humans. There is no documented case of Ebola spreading to people from dogs. But at least one major study suggests dogs can get the disease without showing symptoms. Experts say they are uncertain of what risk that poses to humans.","Paris nurse treated France's first confirmed Ebola case .

"The call went out across the land just hours after war was declared. ‘Your King and Country need you,’ the adverts implored, urging Britain  to fight the oppressor in what was already being heralded as ‘the greatest  conflict in the history of the world’. In their modest homes in terraced city streets, the Calpin boys barely hesitated. There were ten of them back then, all aged between 18 and 37. Two were already in military service for British Empire forces abroad and all were willing to put their lives on the line for liberty. David, 18, HMS Ariadne . Thomas, 27, 9th West Yorks . Henry, 22, RF Artillery . Ernest, 21, HMS Dreadnought . So in the space of those chaotic few weeks in August and September 1914, as the nation prepared for war against the Kaiser, all ten would answer the call to fight in the trenches of France and  Flanders or defend the nation at sea. And, incredibly, all appear to have come home alive. A century on, the Calpins are being hailed as the biggest band of brothers ever to go to war. Yet the full extent of their selfless patriotism is only just re-emerging after their place in history faded into virtual obscurity. Their unique example earned public thanks and congratulation from King George V, the prime minister of the day, and the lord mayor of their home city of York. Their names were trumpeted in a recruiting drive at the time and even broadcast in local cinemas. John, 39, National Reserve . Patrick, 36, Remounts Depot . Martin, 29, 9th West Yorks . James, 33, 4th West Yorks . Today, as Britain prepares to honour all those who served in the First World War, few have ever heard of them. Yesterday their family spoke proudly of the brothers’ legacy and of ‘deep admiration’ for the way they responded to the call. None knew the Calpin boys had been praised by the King until told this week by the Daily Mail. In a Buckingham Palace letter, we can reveal, the brothers’ parents Sarah and Patrick Calpin – a housewife and her builder’s labourer husband – were told His Majesty had heard the news ‘with the deepest gratification’. He offered the new recruits ‘best wishes for success, health and  happiness in their noble career’. William, 32, 3rd West Yorks . Arthur, 24, East Yorks . The Calpin parents Sarah and Patrick and their only daughter Anna . Michael Calpin, a grandson of Able Seaman Ernest Calpin, who served on HMS Dreadnought, told the Mail: ‘My father was always a little bit disappointed that they didn’t seem to get the recognition they deserved. It’s an astonishing thing for ten brothers all to go to war and it’s highly unlikely it will ever happen again. I’m really pleased to think that what they did is being recognised.’ Last night Guinness World Records was examining the information with a view to including the band of brothers in a new listing. The Imperial War Museum said it could find no record of the ten – but described the story as ‘hugely interesting’. It plans to contact relatives to consider including the brothers in forthcoming exhibitions. Most of the family lived in the early 1900s in a less than affluent area inside York’s city walls. The Calpins originally came to England from County Mayo, Ireland, driven out by the 19th century potato famine. Patrick and Sarah were born in York and raised their children there. Praise: A letter from the Chief Magistrate of York sent to the parents of the Calpin brothers . In September 1914, the classic  image of Lord Kitchener declaring ‘Your country needs YOU’ began to stare out from countless walls  and buildings across Britain. Six brothers signed up for the Army, most with the East and West Yorkshire infantry regiments. Among them was James Calpin,  a 32-year-old former Yorkshire  boxing champion who had served in the Boer War. Two more brothers joined the Royal Navy. Arthur Calpin, 24, had served nearly eight years in the Army and was in India when war broke out. William Calpin, 32, had been  serving in Malta. Soon they would reunite with the other eight to fight ‘the Hun’ on land and at sea. Although First World War records are sometimes inconclusive, it appears that Mr and Mrs Calpin saw all their boys come home despite overwhelming odds. How the Daily Mail reported the story in September 1914 . William was wounded in action, but, like the other brothers, returned to join his family. An ‘Acting Corporal A Calpin’ with the East Yorkshire Regiment, Mentioned in Despatches and listed in the London Gazette in 1917, was almost certainly Arthur. Also in 1917, David, the youngest of the ten, was serving on HMS Ariadne when it was sunk by a German U-Boat. He was rescued from the water but suffered severe exposure. Although he returned to work for a few years after the war, he died at the age of 32. Private John Calpin, the eldest brother, was gassed in the trenches in France and shipped back to hospital in Nottingham. He sent a Red Cross postcard to his wife to let her know he had landed safely in England, but died in November 1916 at the age of 39. Ninety years later the father-of-seven’s grand-daughter Brenda Allison and other family members tracked down his overgrown grave in York and held a Remembrance Sunday service there. Mrs Allison, 79, still has the postcard her grandfather sent home. ‘I’m very proud of our family  history and of the way the brothers responded,’ she told me. ‘They obviously had a very strong patriotic spirit. But from the very first day they got over to France it was an absolute bloodbath. I hope it may never happen again but if it did, I do think today’s generation would respond.’","Calpin brothers, aged between 18 and 37 in 1914, fought in First World War .

"Garry Monk won’t have needed to make one particular phone call this week. His conversations with Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez tend to come when doubts enter his mind, but that doesn’t quite apply after a win at Manchester United. There is no need for the discussions he sought this summer after three of his leading players told him they wanted to leave. No need to ask what Rodgers and Martinez would have done - as he occasionally does - but only after he has made his decision and put it into action. Wins at Old Trafford have a habit of helping confidence, especially when coming against a backdrop of criticism. ‘I pretty much guarantee that everyone in here didn’t give us a hope in hell before the game,’ he said to the press after Swansea’s 2-1 win. VIDEO Scroll down to see Monk say no one gave Swansea a chance in hell against United . Name of the game: Swansea boss Garry Monk isworking hard to earn the right to be called a 'top manager' Against the odds: Ki Sung-yeung celebrates with manager Monk after opening the scoring against Man United . Winning feeling: Monk claims nobody gave Swansea a chance of winning at Old Trafford before the 2-1 victory . Monk has been ‘written off for years’. He will, by declaration, ‘work so hard that if I fail I will know I could have done no more’. The club joker of the past decade is not smiling and isn’t breaking eye contact. In a room called the creche at the Liberty Stadium, the League’s youngest manager tells Sportsmail: ‘Every day I am earning the right to be seen as a better manager. I want to earn the right to call myself a top manager. But I know this could be my only chance.’ Moments later he yawns; some club staff think he is working too hard. This is a 35-year-old man feeling his way into a brutal trade, where the statistics he quotes say ‘50 per cent of first-time managers lose their job in the first year and 50 per cent of those won’t go on to manage again’. It’s a position he has spent years thinking about, but one he might never have reached if his back hadn’t gone into spasm two seasons ago. ‘That was a big moment,’ Monk says. Joker: Monk shares a laugh with new Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford on Saturday . He is trying to make sense of the events that led to him taking over from Michael Laudrup in February. In August 2012 the Dane told Monk he was free to leave. The message was not delivered callously, but it set in motion a sequence of events that may have stopped Monk replacing Laudrup. ‘I didn’t have conversations with Michael about leaving. I read it in the press. I didn’t want to go, definitely not. I was close to my 10th year here, we had gone through the divisions together. This is not just a club for me. ‘But I know how football works. A move to Bristol City was arranged and I’m not sure people realise how close I was to going. ‘I was going to go that weekend but got a back spasm and didn’t train for three days. I told them I would be ready in two weeks, but they needed me immediately. It fell through, so I decided to work my nuts off and convince the manager he could rely on me. I ended up playing 15 games that season and the rest is history.’ It meant he was at the club and under serious consideration in February when Laudrup was sacked. In the opinion of chairman Huw Jenkins, the club’s principles were being ‘eroded’. Captain: Monk, pictured in action against Newcastle in 2013, first moved to South Wales in 2004 from Barnsley . Monk, a Swan since 2004, stepped in as caretaker, several years ahead of schedule. He slept one hour a day in his first four days on the job and opened with a derby demolition of Cardiff. They finished 12th and barring a week off in the summer with his partner, their young daughter and five-month-old twins, Monk has not stopped since Laudrup left. ‘It’s been so hectic I’ve barely had time to think,’ he says. The early part of his summer was dominated by the fallout of talks with Michu, Pablo Hernandez and Chico Flores, all of whom said they wanted to leave. ‘I wanted to keep them but they wanted different challenges,’ says Monk. ‘I made a decision that I only wanted players who really wanted to be here so I let them go. It’s important here that players want to be part of this group.’ Once the decisions were made, he phoned a couple of old Swansea managers who help when they can. ‘I tend to act first, then call,’ Monk says. ‘Brendan (Rodgers) and Roberto (Martinez) have been great. I [don’t] just call up managers and ask what to do. I’ll deal with it myself because I feel that is the way I’ll learn. If I think I have done it right then great, but if I think I could have done it better I’ll ask for advice, “This is how I dealt with it. How would you deal with it?"" ‘Every mistake I have learnt from. I had chats with Brendan about the situation with players leaving. I have asked about situations he and Roberto had. But it was only after I did something myself - there is a lot to learn and often not much time.’ Advice: Monk has learnt from former Swansea managers Brendan Rodgers (left) and Roberto Martinez (right) Time comes up frequently in this conversation. ‘I know how hard it is to stay in this business,’ he says. ‘I know that as well as I get on with the board, they will not hesitate to do what is best for the club if we don’t perform. ‘But if you manage by fear of that you’re done. You have to keep learning until you are a good manager - you have to use your time well. I am in this job and now I have to work as hard as I can to learn fast and make it a success. ‘It’s all happened very quickly. My thought process was to do my badges, carry on with the Under 13s and probably head into the academy and build myself up. But the situation changed. ‘It was always my hope to manage this club but I thought it would be far into the future. It might not have come again, so do I stand up and be counted or lay down and die? I have always stood up to be counted.’ With that, the man who made the ‘£90million block’ to stop Noel Hunt’s shot in the 2011 play-off final against Reading is diving into his memory, from League Two to Premier League. Huge achievement: Monk celebrates promotion to the Premier League with Alan Tate and Leon Britton in 2011 . ‘People talk about what it was like when I first got here, but in 2012 we were a Premier League club training at a health club. ‘You’d come in thinking about playing Chelsea and in the shower you’d have an 80-year-old man next to you, asking what happened in the previous game. That’s Swansea. I love this club. ‘It’s part of our journey. We have top-class facilities now but when Michael Laudrup joined his office was a cupboard under the stairs.’ Monk is laughing. He says management gained him 2,000 followers on Twitter and that ‘twins are easier to deal with than players because they don’t answer back. They only care about getting fed and CBeebies’. He sets aside an hour a night where he ignores his phone. ‘It is so hard to switch off but I try,’ he says. The phone has buzzed three times in this interview. ‘After downtime at home there are always missed calls I struggle to return,’ he says. ‘That’s the job.’ If he has his way - and more results like at Old Trafford - it will be his for a while yet.","Garry Monk claims he wants to 'earn the right' to be called a top manager .

"Offensive ‘tribute’ pages devoted to alleged criminals on Facebook will not be tolerated as the social networking site takes a strong stance against internet trolls. It comes after a man was arrested for allegedly creating a tribute page for Dale Cregan, the alleged killer of police officers Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes. Simon Milner, Facebook’s director of policy, said there was ‘no grey area’ when it came to the offensive tribute pages and that immediate action will be taken against anyone who deliberately sets up such a group.

Police arrested and questioned a man in September under the Communications Act 2003 after they traced the Facebook page ‘Dale Cregan is a Hero’ back to his home. The page contained posts which mocked the deaths of policewomen Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes. One read: ‘So a pair of coppers got killed who gives a s***?’ Another internet troll, who described Cregan as a ‘legend,’ stood by his comments, comparing the murder suspect to crazed killer Raoul Moat.

Mr Milner said: ‘Only a small minority of our users ever report problems. ‘This will just increase transparency around how we respond to those that do.’ Earlier this year an online bully, who targeted dead teenagers and cruelly mocked their deaths, has been spared jail and banned from social networking sites today for 'trolling' about a tragic schoolgirl. Sean Duffy, 26, from Reading, Berkshire, had admitted defacing a tribute site set up to remember Sophie Taylor, 16, between April 18 and 20 last year. The teenager was shot accidentally by her boyfriend, 18-year-old trainee gamekeeper Calum Murray, who then turned the gun on himself at a cottage near Tomintoul, Moray in Scotland, that month. Duffy, an autistic alcoholic, was accused of posting fake photos of Sophie with bullet holes in her head. He earlier admitted he was hooked on 'trolling' – where internet users deliberately leave abusive and bullying comments on networking sites to provoke others. He was sentenced to a community payback order with supervision for two years and told to do 300 hours of unpaid work. He is also banned from creating any accounts on social networking sites and is not allowed to post any videos or buy any device with internet access.

"Health officials have been banned from shaking hands with those arriving from Ebola-hit countries just days after the practice was defended. Immigration officers at Heathrow Airport were criticised for shaking hands with passengers on the chaotic first day of Britain's airport screening procedures this week. Public Health England (PHE), which is in charge of the screening process, originally defended the practice, saying there was no evidence the virus could be caught through hand contact. Scroll down for video . Health officials screening arrivals at UK airports are being told not to shake hands with passengers, despite a statement put out earlier this week claiming the practice was safe . Officials were criticised over screening procedures earlier this week after it emerged they are not compulsory . But despite sticking to that claim, the organisation has now told its staff not to shake hands with arrivals as an 'extra precaution'. Passengers arriving from West African countries hit out at the screening process on Tuesday, with some branded it 'a complete joke'. Sorius Samura, who flew in from Liberia, told the Telegraph: 'I've just come back  via Brussels and our flight was met by an airport official saying we might be screened. 'He even shook our hands. That's something nobody does now in Liberia and infected countries, you have to learn not to.' He said officials in Liberian airports were much more organised about making sure the infection did not spread. PHE later shrugged off the claims, insisting: 'If you are well enough to be getting on the plane and walking off the other end, you are not symptomatic and would not pass the disease on by shaking hands with someone.' Passengers said they were shocked that immigration officials were shaking hands with those flying in . Passengers arrive at Terminal 1 of London Heathrow, as enhanced screening for Ebola began at the airport . Clive Patterson (left), who had been working in Liberia, was critical of the screening techniques, which include a form  for passengers to fill in (right) Today however, just two days later, it emerged that the organisation were telling their own staff to refrain from shaking hands with new arrivals. Sorious Samura, who arrived at Heathrow from Liberia on Tuesday, branded screening procedures 'a joke' A PHE spokesperson said today: 'Unless you have come into contact with the blood or bodily fluid of an infected person, for example by providing healthcare for a person with Ebola or handling the dead body of someone who died from Ebola, there is little chance of being infected. 'Ebola virus disease is not spread through intact skin, or by ordinary social contact, such as shaking hands or sitting next to someone. People who are well are not at risk of transmitting the virus. 'However, we have advised PHE staff responsible for screening people from countries with endemic Ebola to not shake their hands. 'This is because they are travelling from a high risk area and therefore extra precaution must be taken. This is covered within the training which all staff undertaking screening are being given. 'However this does not change our public health advice to members of the public, which remains the same.' The spokesman added: 'If there is physical contact between screening staff and passengers on occasion – such as a handshake or through temperature checking – this does not present any significant health risk. 'PHE has also been working closely with Heathrow management teams to review advice to a range of airport staff. 'We are confident that there are sufficient, sensible safeguards built into existing working arrangements, which remain appropriate for their protection, at this time.' British authorities were heavily criticised on the first day of screening at airports when it emerged checks were not compulsory and only those who 'show symptoms of the virus' were being spoken to. Clive Patterson, 32, who flew in from Liberia, said: 'If you are going to make the effort and take this measure, you might as well make it compulsory. I could have Ebola and I could have walked straight through.' Passengers arriving from Britain from high risk areas are being subject to screening at Heathrow. They are being asked to complete a questionnaire asking about their current health and where they have come from. As well as personal details, including name, nationality, address in UK and phone number they have been asked: . Health: . Currently do you have any of the following: . The advice from PHE emerged as Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted it was only a matter of time before someone with the disease arrived in Britain. Speaking to reporters during a ministerial visit to the West Midlands, he said: 'I think we will see someone with Ebola arriving in the UK and the Chief Medical Officer thinks it will be a handful of cases in the next three months. 'We have to be prepared. We have very strict procedures and we have to make sure everyone knows those procedures.' It is estimated the death toll from the Ebola crisis will rise to more than 4,500 lives this week from among 9,000 people infected by the deadly disease. Dr Isabelle Nuttall of the World Health Organisation said the new numbers also show the outbreak is hitting health workers hard, with 2,700 infected and 236 dead. She told reporters in Geneva that cases are doubling every four weeks, and the effects of the crisis are increasingly being felt beyond its epicentre in West Africa. After speaking to US president Barack Obama and the leaders of Germany, France and Italy by video conference call yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron was today chairing the latest meeting of the Government's Cobra contingencies committee in Whitehall to discuss the UK's response. A No 10 spokeswoman said: 'The Prime Minister said we would welcome countries partnering with us in Sierra Leone so that we can provide more treatment beds and we will now explore this further with the Italians.' Mr Cameron called for further discussions when European and Asian leaders gather in Italy tomorrow for a pre-planned summit.","Immigration officials criticised for shaking hands with new arrivals this week .

"Her penchant for elaborate hats and red lipstick is legendary but it seems the Queen is about to shake up her elegant signature style. Her Majesty is famous for her boxy Launer handbags and the latest version, the Judi, has been carefully calibrated to work with the royal wardrobe. While the £1,130 arm candy retains the ladylike shape beloved of the Queen, the new version is smaller and lighter than her usual luggage and comes in a rainbow of cheerful colours. Fit for a Queen: The new Launer Judi bag was included in the selection sent to Buckingham Palace for summer . Although the Queen usually carries the Traviata style, Launer say the Judi bag was included in the selection sent to Buckingham Palace for S/S14 - and met with a favourable reception from officials. 'Throughout 2014, Her Majesty has opted for bolder colour choices . and our more fashion forward designs,' commented Launer London CEO, Gerald Bodmer. 'For Her Majesty to wear one . of our Judi’s would really encapsulate her time as a British fashion . icon. He added: 'The Judi was actually named after Dame Judi Dench who lent her . name after becoming the latest in a long line of British . actresses to fall in love with our designs, so it be a really . special patriotic statement if Her Majesty wore this design.' The new bag is the smallest Launer have ever produced and comes in a range of bright hues, including fuschia and tangerine. Trademark: The Queen, pictured left with Ireland's first lady Sabina Higgins, is rarely without a Launer bag . Cheerful: The new Judi bag comes in a choice of tangerine, grey, fuchsia or teal, as well as bespoke hues . Although the Queen usually plumps for the black patent option, Launer say that some of the more colourful versions were included in the selection sent to Buckingham Place. This, say the brand, marks a new direction in their relationship with the monarch who often requests bespoke alterations and smaller . measurements on some of Launer’s bigger styles, including the Traviata . and Lydia handbags. Available in dove grey, fuchsia and teal, the bag is smaller and brighter than the rest of the Launer collection and is crafted from the brand's trademark patent calf leather and finished with Launer’s new gold-plated glossy rope logo fitting. 'This is the smallest handbag style . Launer has ever produced,' adds Bodmer. 'The bag is designed to be worn over the shoulder and sit perfectly . on the waist. 'It’s a very chic and unique addition to the Launer . family.'","The Judi is the latest style from leather bag Launer London .

"Tragic: Mohammed Abdul Razzak, 16, was found on the M60 motorway with multiple injuries days after missing a mock GCSE exam . A gifted schoolboy overcome by stress over his forthcoming GCSE exams jumped to his death from a motorway bridge. Mohammed Abdul Razzak, 16, had told his GP of his desire to end his life at least six times, an inquest heard. Finally, he walked to a motorway bridge near his home, climbed over the barrier and plunged 30ft on to the road below. He was taken to hospital but died from his injuries. The inquest heard that Mohammed was a well-liked and studious boy who was expected to do very well in his exams. But after starting his GCSE year he became withdrawn and anxious, sometimes disappearing from his home at night. His mother, Lufta Begum, said her son became distant and spent a lot of time alone on his computer drinking energy drinks and coffee. In a statement she told the inquest: ‘He was a healthy child, a hard-working, studious young man with a clever demeanour. ‘He was a young man who kept himself to himself and had very good predictions in terms of his academic achievements. But he did not discuss anything with the family or those close to him.’ Last autumn, the pupil went missing from his home in Oldham but turned up at his aunt’s house at 11pm. On another occasion he was reported missing after leaving at 1am and not answering his phone. He returned two hours later. Eventually he skipped a mock exam, later handing a letter to his English teacher explaining that he felt an urge to self-harm. At this point child protection services and his school intervened, and Mohammed spent a weekend in hospital where he was assessed by psychiatrists. Dr Debra Bradley, who oversaw his admission, told the inquest he had missed the exam because he was tired and wanted to end his life out of frustration. Tributes: Oldham Academy North paid tribute to Mohammed, a 'talented' and 'hard-working young man' After the assessment he was discharged and assigned a social worker. A few weeks later he appeared happy after being allowed to visit family in Bangladesh during term time. But just days before his death on January 6, Mohammed spoke to his GP and confided he had planned to commit suicide six times in the past – adding he was only talking about it to test people’s reactions. On January 5, he slept late and was seen by his mother only when he left his room for a shower at 11pm. Over the next few hours Mohammed sent a text message to a friend stating his intention to kill himself, before going out into the night and leaping to his death. His mother was informed at around 4am. Tests on the bridge over the M60 near Oldham showed scuff marks on the barrier, indicating he had climbed over the railing. Recording a verdict of suicide, Rochdale assistant coroner Lisa Hashmi said: ‘Mohammed was a healthy, intelligent young man who clearly had a very promising future. Save his obvious intellect, he was a quiet and reserved individual, however in the autumn of 2013 his mother noticed a change in his demeanour. Mohammed’s family, school and other professionals subsequently became involved in supporting him.’ Colette Burgess, headteacher at his school, Oldham Academy North, said: ‘He was an intelligent, hard-working and talented student with a particular gift for computing. He was a popular and mature young man, highly regarded by his teachers and well respected by his peers.’","Mohammed Abdul Razzak was vice student principal, predicted top grades .

"She used to spend her days posing in her underwear but now glamour model Carley Watts, 24, is to cover up after falling in love with Tunisian lifeguard, Mohammed Salah, 25. The model, from Dearham in Norfolk, met Salah during a holiday in Tunisia in April and says she is so serious about the lifeguard she is set to Islam to become his wife. From October, Carley and her daughter Alannah, two, will live close to his family in the city of Monastir, where she will spend six months learning about the faith - and planning their wedding. Convert: Carley Watts will convert to Islam ahead of her marriage to Tunisian lifeguard Mohammed Salah . Husband to be: Carley met her fiance Mohammed during a holiday in the Tunisian city of Monastir . Carley told the Sun on Sunday that her friends think she is mad and that this is just a phase: 'They can’t get their heads round me going from being . the last girl standing on every night out to wearing a veil and . converting to Islam. Meeting . Mohammed has made me really look at my life. I don’t want to be going . wild, flashing my boobs and falling out of nightclubs any more. But we . couldn’t be more different. 'As . a glamour model I show off my boobs, dress up in kinky outfits and . generally act outrageous.

The day job: Mohammed's parents won't be told about Carley's glamour modelling career . Although Mohammed does know what Carley does for a living, she told the Sun that his family aren't aware of her career and won't be told. She explained that the fact she is a single mother was already enough of a shock for them. She said: 'He explained that he . loved me and wanted me to be his wife and they have come round to that. He accepts that [glamour modelling] is what I do and doesn’t try to change me. But he says once we are married my body is for his eyes only.' Single mothers are almost unheard of in Tunisia, where sex outside of marriage is frowned upon and is punishable by law. 'Single mums don’t exist in his world . and men who get unmarried women pregnant go to prison. It is all about . family and he idolises his mother,' she added. 'These . are the kind of values I love about their culture. Women are treated . with respect and they also respect themselves and their bodies. They . don’t do one-night stands or casual flings.

"David Cameron last night warned Vladimir Putin his billionaire ‘cronies’ will have their assets frozen in London unless he co-operates with the probe into Flight MH17. The Prime Minister vented his fury at Russia’s obstruction in a 30-minute phone call – the first direct contact between the leaders since the jet was shot down with the loss of 298 lives. He effectively blamed Russia, telling Mr Putin he had ‘contributed to an appalling tragedy’. Scroll down for video . Warned: Vladimir Putin was at the receiving end of a tense 30-minute rant from David Cameron over the phone three days after Flight MH17 crashed as the Prime Minister effectively blamed him for 'an appalling tragedy' The Prime Minister likened the failure to tackle Vladimir Putin to the appeasement of Hitler in the 1930s, while Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Russia risked becoming a 'pariah state' if it carried on arming rebels . Germany's Angela Merkel and French president Francois Hollande said they will hit Russia with fresh sanctions . The Government has openly accused Russia of arming and supporting the Ukrainian rebels who shot down flight MH17. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'The Russians have influence, if not direct control, over these people. 'They have been supplying, they have been supporting them, they cannot deny their responsibility for the acts these people are carrying out.' 'There a growing number of strands of evidence, which looked at together in the round, lead the reasonable person to the unavoidable truth that this was a missile fired from rebel-held territory, almost certainly a missile supplied by the Russians.' The Prime Minister has said the conflict 'could have been stopped by Moscow'. He said all the evidence pointed to the fact that 'Flight MH17 was blown out of the sky by a surface-to-air missile fired from a rebel-held area'. Mr Cameron said: 'If this is the case then we must be clear what it means: this is a direct result of Russia destabilising a sovereign state, violating its territorial integrity, backing thuggish militias and training and arming them.' And he urged him to ‘change course’ by calling off the armed thugs in eastern Ukraine thought to have been . behind the atrocity that left ten Britons dead. Britain . is now pushing for EU sanctions against Mr Putin’s ‘crony group’ of . wealthy supporters, some of whom use London as their playground. Downing . Street refused to comment on exactly which individuals would be . targeted, but there is speculation it could eventually include . well-known figures such as Roman Abramovich, who has close links to the . Putin regime. No10 . played down suggestions Mr Putin, who is thought to have spirited away . billions, could be personally targeted at this stage. Sanctions . could also include an EU-wide ban on arms sales to Russia and curbs on . the ability of Russian energy firms to raise money in Europe. Mr . Cameron, who will make a statement to the Commons on the crisis today, . told Mr Putin that Russia’s stance so far was ‘completely unacceptable’. He urged him to . intervene immediately to ensure the victims, whose bodies have been . removed by local militias, could have proper funerals. A . source said he told the Russian President: ‘Ten of my citizens have . just been killed in a plane brought down by a missile fired by Russian . separatists. 'I have . been asking to speak to you since this happened. You clearly can play a . role in exerting influence on the separatists to grant us access to the . site.’ Earlier, Mr Cameron said the West must ‘fundamentally change our approach to Russia’ in the wake of the crisis. Britain . and Australia will today try to push through a UN Security Council . resolution calling for investigators to be granted immediate access. But British sources are gloomy about its prospects after Moscow vetoed a similar call on Saturday. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond will travel to Brussels tomorrow to hammer out the details of new sanctions on Russia. Armed separatists in the area around Donetsk in eastern Ukraine have refused investigators access to the site . Recovery: Ukrainian State Emergency Service employees continue to search for bodies amongst the wreckage at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, near the village of Grabove, 100km east of Donetsk . Mr . Cameron yesterday held talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and . French President Francois Hollande, both of whom were resisting tough . sanctions on Russia less than 24 hours before the Malaysia Airlines jet . was shot down on Thursday. A . No10 spokesman said the two leaders agreed with Mr Cameron that ‘the EU . must reconsider its approach to Russia and that foreign ministers . should be ready to impose further sanctions’. However, . No10 cautioned that the crisis was running faster than the Brussels . machinery can cope with – meaning that it may take some weeks before the . new sanctions regime is fully in place. Sources stressed Mr Putin has the chance to limit the damage to Russia’s struggling economy by co-operating fully now. A . small number of senior Russian officials have been subjected to asset . freezes and travel bans following Russia’s annexation of the Crimea . earlier this year. Mr Hammond yesterday said these would now be widened to ‘include the so-called crony group around President Putin’. Mr Cameron has led calls for tougher sanctions on Russia but has faced resistance from Germany's Angela Merkel. The Netherlands' Mark Rutte (right) is likely to back sanctions following last week's attack . Downing . Street said it would press for action against ‘individuals who have . influence on the Russian leadership and who have influence in terms of . financial flows’. Mr . Hammond acknowledged that the level of sanctions being considered could . hurt London, where wealthy Russians have invested an estimated . £27billion, and said other countries must ‘share the pain’. He said: ‘We have levers which we can apply to Russia; we can inflict damage on the Russian economy.’ In a strongly-worded article in the Sunday Times, Mr Cameron said the West could not allow Russia’s actions in Ukraine to stand. ‘This is not about military action, plainly,’ he said. ‘But . it is time to make our power, influence and resources count. Our . economies are strong, and growing in strength. And yet we sometimes . behave as if we need Russia more than Russia needs us.’ Following . Moscow’s annexation of Crimea, Alexei Navalny, a leading critic of Mr . Putin, said sanctions should target figures such as Mr Abramovich and . businessman Alisher Usmanov, who owns a major stake in Arsenal football . club. Mr Abramovich . made no comment at the time but is understood to consider himself a . private citizen who should not face sanctions. He . is a close ally of Mr Putin and is said to enjoy ‘privileged access’ to . the Russian President, but has always denied playing any political . role.","Cameron spoke to Vladimir Putin this evening after three days trying .

"A team of scientists who were given the go-ahead by Nasa to crowd-fund the revival of a seemingly 'dead' spacecraft have announced their mission was successful. Contact was last made with the spacecraft, called ISEE-3 (International Sun-Earth Explorer), in the late 90s. As it approached our planet, scientists had a brief chance to communicate with the 36-year-old probe in an . attempt to bring it back to life - which they have now managed to do. Nasa has officially endorsed an amateur group, known as the the ISEE-3 Reboot Project, for them to attempt to bring a vintage spacecraft, called ISEE-3, back to life. Pictured is an artist's concept image of ISEE-3 . ‘The ISEE-3 Reboot Project is pleased to announce that our team has established two-way communication with the ISEE-3 spacecraft and has begun commanding it to perform specific functions,’ one of the team’s leaders, Keith Cowing, wrote on Space College. ‘Over the coming days and weeks our team will make an assessment of the spacecraft's overall health and refine the techniques required to fire its engines and bring it back to an orbit near Earth.’ The team will then decide what sort of mission they intend to send the spacecraft on. According to Cowing, ‘first contact with ISEE-3 was achieved at the Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico.’ The achievement was a collaboration with a number of other organisations and people including the staff at Arecibo and a team at the Bochum Observatory in Germany. In April the ISEE-3 Reboot Project team - made up of the groups Space College, Skycorp, and SpaceRef - undertook a successful crowd funding project to raise £74,000 ($125,000) to rescue the probe. Nasa officially endorsed the Virginia-based project and signed a space act agreement for the group to take command and control of the 1970s-era craft. This is the first time Nasa has worked on such an agreement for use of a spacecraft the agency is no longer using or ever planned to use again. 'We contacted the spacecraft after recreating hardware that was discarded by NASA decades ago using command language that was recreated from old documents that were sitting in former employees' basements,' Cowan tells MailOnline. 'Now that we have taken command of the spacecraft we will study its current condition and  then prepare to fire its engines. 'We need to fire the engines soon - within the month of June - to put ISEE-3 into an orbit close to Earth. 'If we manage to accomplish all of this then we intend to use the spacecraft for science again - and to involve citizens in its operation in a way not yet attempted.' ISEE-3 was the first satellite to study the constant flow of solar wind streaming toward Earth from a stable orbit point between our planet and the sun known as the Lagrangian 1, or L1. Monitoring that wind helped scientists better understand the interconnected sun-Earth system, which at its most turbulent can affect satellites around Earth. In 1984, it was given a new mission and called the International Cometary Explorer. In September 1985, it passed through the tail of Comet Giacobini-Zinner, making it the first spacecraft to gather data from a comet. It also went on to fly by Comet Halley in March 1986. From 1991 until 1997, when it was too far away for reliable communications, this satellite continued to investigate the sun. Now it's coming home to visit - making its closest approach to Earth in August. ‘The intrepid ISEE-3 spacecraft was sent . away from its primary mission to study the physics of the solar wind . extending its mission of discovery to study two comets,’ said Nasa . astronaut John Grunsfeld last week. ‘We have a chance to engage a new generation of citizen scientists through this creative effort to recapture the ISEE-3 spacecraft as it zips by the Earth this summer.’ In March, amateur radio astronomers were able to track the spacecraft and find out its route, raising hopes that the mission could be revived. Launched in 1978 to study the constant flow of solar wind streaming toward Earth, ISEE-3 successfully completed its prime mission in 1981. With remaining fuel and functioning instruments, it then was redirected to observe two comets. Following the end of that mission, the spacecraft continued in orbit around the sun. It is now making its closest approach to Earth in more than 30 years. The goal of the ISEE-3 Reboot Project is to put the spacecraft into an orbit at a gravitationally stable point between Earth and the sun known as Lagrangian 1 (L1). Once safely back in orbit, the next step would be to return the spacecraft to operations and use its instruments as they were originally designed. The mission's original communication hardware no longer exists, so controlling the spacecraft required the amateur group to create virtual software versions of the original hardware. Once proving this was possible, the project is now using the Arecibo Radio Observatory (pictured) in Puerto Rico to send commands to ISEE-3 . ISEE-3's close approach provided optimal conditions to attempt communication. Nasa said it has shared technical data with the amateur group to help them communicate with and return data from ISEE-3. The mission’s original communication hardware no longer exists, so controlling the spacecraft will require the amateur group to create virtual software versions of the original hardware. If they are able to do this, the project will use the Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico to send commands to ISEE-3. New data resulting from the project will be shared with the science community and the public, providing a unique tool for teaching students and the public about spacecraft operations and data gathering. The data also will provide valuable information about the effects of the space environment on the 36-year old spacecraft.","A Virginia-based amateur group has succeeded in reviving a 'dead' probe .

"Guessing the royal baby’s name has quickly become one of the nation’s favourite pastimes. George and James became the favourites at the bookies last night, after hundreds of thousands of pounds were staked on the possibilities. Alexander, Henry, Louis, Richard and Arthur were the next most betted-on choices. Scroll down for videos . Anonymous: But the British public are speculating over the name of the future King, pictured . Happy couple: It is not yet known what Kate and William will choose to call their firstborn son . The name will likely come to symbolise an entire era - as in Georgian, Victorian and Elizabethan. Yesterday, mug and tea-towel makers were poised to go into production the moment the name is announced. It is also likely that unofficial Twitter accounts, Facebook pages and even ‘.com’ internet addresses bearing the baby’s name will spring up immediately. The waiting game could go on for some time. When Prince William arrived in 1982, his parents took seven days to decide what to call him. Joy: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge left hospital last night a day after Kate gave birth . Radiant: Kate wore a blue polka-dot dress as she faced the world's media with her baby for the first time . Princess Diana was thought to have argued for Sebastian and Oliver, while Charles reportedly had his heart set on Albert or Arthur. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have 42 days to register their son’s birth, but are unlikely to take that long. Charles Kidd, editor of Debrett’s Peerage and Baronetage, said: ‘I think the Royal Family quite like to do things slowly. ‘It’s quite dignified to have a bit of breathing space between the birth and the announcement of the name. It’s a measured approach. ‘But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge seem very organised. I would be surprised if it took them longer than a week.’ Royals: The baby is likely to be given a traditional name, but will probably not be named after his grandfather Charles . Grandparents: But Carole Middleton insisted that she and Michael had not given advice on the name . Edward and Charles are seen as unlikely first names, but could be suitable as middle names. So could Michael, should Kate wish to honour her father. Another possible middle name is Francis, a recurring moniker in Kate’s family tree. It is both her father and her grandfather’s middle name and Frances was her great-great-great grandmother’s first name. It was also Princess Diana’s middle name, meaning William could honour his mother’s memory through his son if he chose its masculine form. The Queen will be informed of the chosen names prior to their announcement, but is unlikely to wield a veto. Odds: Bookmakers have been taking bets on the name of the royal baby for several months . Announcement: The birth of the new Prince was officially announced on an easel outside Buckingham Palace . Royal writer Christopher Warwick said: ‘The Queen is so down to earth that she’s not likely to jump up and down and say this boy has got to be called Charles and George. ‘This isn’t going to be, “Granny, do you approve?” but more “These are the names we’ve chosen - do you like them?” ‘It’s much more of a personal thing these days.’ Great-great-grandfather: The last king called George was George VI, the current Queen's father . 1) George (7/4) Meaning: ‘Farmer / earth worker’ George is a popular modern choice, and there have been six previous reigning Georges. For this reason, the name George would be seen as a ‘safe’ choice, symbolising the continuity of the monarchy. It was the Sovereign name of the Queen’s beloved father, George VI, and is also one of Prince Charles’s middle names. Even King Edward VIII - who abdicated the throne - had George among his seven names. But there are also reasons for thinking the bookies’ favourite may not be the royals’ first choice. Nottingham Trent University social historian Dr Judith Rowbotham speculated: ‘Royal advisers are likely to point out that the 19th century Prince George of Cambridge was not exactly a model that Kate and William would wish the new prince to emulate. ‘He was not popular with his cousin Queen Victoria, especially after he married an actress who was the mother of four children by three different fathers.’ In the BBC television comedy Blackadder, Prince George was a childish, spoiled, bumbling foppish fool who spent money extravagantly. Precedent: King James I was also James VI of Scotland and could provide inspiration . 2) James (4/1) Meaning: ‘He who supplants’ The name James has strong royal ties, with two English kings bearing the name. It was also the name of six Scottish kings, so could prove popular north of the border - something to bear in mind as the Scottish independence debate rages. But William already has a cousin called James - the Earl and Countess of Wessex’s son Viscount Severn - and it is the name of his brother-in-law. Kate, who is close to her brother James, may feel that having one in the family is enough. 3) Alexander (7/1 or 8/1) Meaning: ‘Protector of men’ This would be another one popular in Scotland, where Alexander III was regarded as one of the country’s greatest rulers. A Prince Alexander would inevitably be nicknamed Alexander the Great after the ancient Greek legend. In April this year, Willem-Alexander was sworn in as King of the Netherlands after the abdication of his mother, Queen Beatrix. Consolation prize? The baby could be named after his uncle, Prince Harry . 4) Henry (12/1) Meaning: ‘Rules his household’ A flurry of last-minute bets slashed the odds on Henry from 50/1 at Ladbrokes in the 48 hours leading up to the birth. It is Prince Harry’s full first name, and would pay a brotherly homage to William’s best man - plus serve as a consolation prize after the newborn pushed Harry into fourth place in the line of succession. England’s most famous Henry was King Henry VIII, who married six times and set up the Church of England to split from the Roman Catholic Church. 5) Louis (12/1) Meaning: ‘Famous warrior’ This name has deep significance in the Windsor family in honour of the Prince of Wales’s favourite uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten, who was killed by the IRA in 1979. Louis is the last of William’s three middle names.","Britain is on tenterhooks as nation waits for announcement of baby's name .

"A Northern California deputy district attorney has been removed from a criminal prosecution after officials say he failed to disclose a romantic relationship with a crime lab technician. Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Ted Kajani is no longer overseeing the prosecution of brothers David Zimmer and Robert Zimmer for the 1989 strangulation of David Zimmer's estranged wife, Cathy. Officials say Kajani had put the criminalist Amanda Cardenas with whom he had an affair on the stand to testify about DNA evidence in the case. Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Ted Kajani has been removed from a criminal prosecution after officials say he failed to disclose a romantic relationship with crime lab technician Amanda Cardenas . The affair began before Cardenas testified in May at a preliminary hearing for the Zimmer brothers, authorities said. Cardenas also testified before a grand jury that would indict the two on charges that they killed Cathy Zimmer, reported the San Francisco Chornicle. Mother Cathy Zimmer, 38, was killed in 1989 . There is no evidence that DNA or other evidence was compromised as a result of the affair, said Assistant District Attorney David Angel, head of the conviction integrity unit at the district attorney's office. 'Legally, I don't think it's a conflict of interest or anything like that,' Angel said. 'However, it gives an appearance of impropriety, and it's unprofessional, and when we found out about it, we wanted to disclose it and try to rectify it.' The body of Cathy Zimmer, a 38-year-old mother of two  was discovered in the back seat of her Chrysler New Yorker in the short-term parking lot on March 10, 1989 and her body was covered up with a quilt. David Zimmer, and his 70-year-old brother, were both arrested earlier this year and charged with first-degree-murder. Initial evidence pointed to at least Robert Zimmer being involved, his DNA was found on an ‘intimate’ area of the murdered woman’s clothes, investigators said. The brother-in-law insisted all along he did not have a physical relationship with her, but investigators kept pursuing his guilt. The couple was in the middle of a divorce and her soon-to-be ex-husband mysteriously cashed two life insurance policies worth $183,000 before selling their home for $225,000 shortly after her death , according to KTVU. Robert Zimmer’s daughter Paula recalled in 2010 to investigators that his father obsessed over his fingerprints being found in her car as police combed it for evidence in the days after the discovery. He insisted he never had any type of personal or sexual relationship with Cindy Zimmer, but could not recall if he was ever alone in a car with her, authorities said.

"Hatem Ben Arfa is set for a January move after finding himself unwanted at Newcastle United and Hull City - and in France a film is being produced about the mercurial winger. The 27-year-old former Marseille player appears set for a January transfer after Newcastle manager Alan Pardew declared he did not want to take Ben Arfa back from his loan spell at Hull, where boss Steve Bruce has written him out of his plans. His agent Michel Ouzaine told 20minutes.fr: 'There are a lot of clubs interested in him, despite everything that has been said. He will have a new club in January, that won't be a problem, don't you worry.' Hatem Ben Arfa (right), pictured in action against Southampton, is currently back in Paris, France . Alan Pardew (right) insists Ben Arfa will not be allowed to return to the Newcastle United dressing room . A surprising development, according to the same report, is the work-in-progress that is the documentary being made about the former France international. Film-maker Bruno Sevaistre, who produced a documentary series from 1999 to 2002 that featured the daily lives of Ben Arfa and a host of other young players at France's Clairefontaine football headquarters, has been given access to the footballer's life away from the pitch. In the 'A la Clairefontaine' series, the teenage Ben Arfa and fellow future professional Abou Diaby were seen grappling in an angry exchange. Sevaistre said: 'I feel a little responsible for all the media exposure around Hatem and the consequence this has had on his career. Ben Arfa has not appeared in any of Hull City's last three games but will not be allowed to return to Magpies . 'This film, or this series - it hasn't been decided yet - is a way to redress the balance. 'We don't always see the best of Hatem. I filmed him crying with those close to him, but he is a boy who is the total opposite to his reputation. He is sensitive, serious, fragile. People don't have any idea of the obstacles he has had to overcome in his career.' Ben Arfa has played just nine times for Hull since his loan move from the Magpies and Bruce admitted on Thursday that the relationship between player and club had almost certainly run its course. He denied media reports of a heated row with Ben Arfa, but is understood to be dismayed by the midfielder's lack of work ethic - in training and in matches. Ben Arfa could be without a club in January as Newcastle are unwilling to take him back after his loan spell . 'If he decides to stay in France that's up to him, there's only 10 days until the window opens and I think it's fair to say he's probably played his last game for Hull,' said Bruce. 'He didn't deserve to be in the team on merit. It's my job to pick a team which I think will win a game on the Saturday. All this reported bust-up and the rest of it...I think you (journalists) want to make that story. 'What I've said to Ben Arfa is unfortunately I wasn't going to accept a performance like I saw from him against Manchester United. It's up to him to force himself back into the squad, that's the way it is. 'Sometimes transfers don't work, especially with a loan deal. Sometimes they can be the best thing for the player and the club. Unfortunately it hasn't worked out. I wish him the best of luck. I hope he goes on to have the career his talent deserves, that's all I've got to say on the matter.' Hull boss Steve Bruce claimed he was unaware of Ben Arfa's location when asked about him last weekend .","Hatem Ben Arfa is to have his loan deal at Hull City terminated in January .

"Savings: The chancellor, George Osborne is expected to outline a further £10bn of welfare savings in the autumn statement on December 5 . Hidden public service cuts will drain Britain's poorest families of 30 per cent of their annual income by 2017, as the coalition's tough spending targets begin to bite, new TUC research reveals. It said reductions in benefits and family tax credits, combined with continuing cuts to welfare, will 'cause considerable financial harm for millions of families'. The dire predictions come as chancellor George Osborne prepares to deliver his autumn statement on December 5, in which he is expected to detail a further £10bn of welfare savings over the next five years. 'Unless George Osborne changes course,' the TUC warned. 'These cuts will be dwarfed by massive reductions in public services.' Their figures revealed that by 2016-17, the cumulative cost of lost public services for the poorest ten per cent of household will be £3,995 in cash terms - or 31.7 per cent of their average annual income. By contrast, the top tenth of the income scale will lose just £2,805 - or 2.5 per cent of annual income. This is because higher earners may use public transport less frequently, opt out of public schooling or healthcare, and less likely to rely on Sure Start centres. The analysis also said that the average household had already lost more than £1,200 in public services but the real pain is still to come - this is just a third of the cuts they are likely to experience by 2014-2015. The TUC report coincided with a study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation which found that 6.1m people in working households live in poverty and more than 5.1m people live in working age households where no one has a job. Julia Unwin, the foundation's chief executive, told The Observer: 'The most distinctive characteristic of poverty today is the very high number of working people who are also poor.' Against the cuts: Protesters take part in a TUC march against the welfare cuts. Research by the Congress suggests that the poorest families could lose 30 per cent of their income as public services are withdrawn . Nick Davies, policy director at Children England, said on the scaling back back of children's services: 'Demand has increased, but funding reduced, and that has led to the withdrawal of some services and the rationing of others. 'Local authorities have to focus on their statutory responsibilities and other things get neglected.' Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, added: 'We are hearing reports from welfare rights advisers up and down the country that the services they provide are being cut or closed down. 'So a perfect storm is brewing: benefit cuts, service cuts and large-scale welfare reform.'","Public service cuts will drain Britain's poorest families of 30 per cent of their income, TUC say .

"Louis van Gaal, Wayne Rooney and Angel di Maria were mocked up as 'Only Fools and Man United' on T-shirts outside White Hart Lane as even Tottenham's merchandise vendors began poking fun at their Premier League rivals. A famous quote from the cult BBC comedy was also twisted, with it instead reading: 'This time next year, we'll be champions'. The shop owners were clearly trying to cash in on United's plight ahead of their Capital One Cup clash with Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night. Man United mock up T shirts made outside White Hart Lane were based on BBC Comedy Only Fools and Horses . Louis van Gaal has struggled to pick up results at the start of his Manchester United tenure . Angel di Maria was signed for a record £60m as the Old Trafford club made the Argentinian a marquee signing . Rooney was made Man United captain by Van Gaal and has been tasked with turning their fortunes around . The caption printed on the shirts comes from Del Boy and Rodney Trotters' misguided belief that one day, they would be millionaires. Van Gaal and Co may just get the last laugh though, as that eventually came true!
