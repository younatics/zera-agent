"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Netflix is expanding its empire of original content with a talk show to be hosted by Chelsea Handler. After months of negotiations and speculation, the streaming service has announced a deal with the comedian that includes a talk show, to launch in early 2016. The online TV network said it will update the format of her current E! talk show, Chelsea Lately, but retain the comedic focus on entertainment and cultural issues. Handler will end the seven-year run of Chelsea Lately on August 26. Scroll down for video . In demand: Chelsea Handler has lined up her next TV gig - a talk show on Netflix. After months of negotiations and speculation, the show will launch in early 2016 . Handler's Netflix show will feature her unfiltered opinions on topics of the day as well as guest interviews. It has not been determined yet what  frequency the show will be released with — daily, weekly or in-between — with Netflix only noting that it will debut simultaneously in all Netflix territories. 'The Internet has disrupted many of the conventions of traditional television and together with Chelsea Handler, Netflix is looking forward to reimagining the late night talk show for the on-demand generation, starting with the late night part….' said Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos. He added, 'Chelsea has built a huge following on tour, on nightly TV and through her bestselling books, and we can’t wait to introduce her breathtakingly honest and irreverent voice to our global membership.' In Handler’s now infamous Howard Stern Show radio interview in March, in which she called E! 'a sad, sad place to live' and 'a failure,'  Handler suggested that after she leaves the cable network she would be interested in going to an outlet like Netflix. 'If I was going to continue working in this industry, I knew I had to do something outside the box to keep myself interested,' Handler said. Netflix next: The next venture for me is not going to be filling someone else¿s shoes, Chelsea Handler says . 'I wanted to sit with the cool kids at lunch so I approached Netflix to make sure they were as cool as I thought they were, and when I confirmed my suspicions, like with any other future lover, I made my move. I’m more excited than I’ve been in awhile, and the team at Netflix is the most forward thinking, alert group I’ve sat down with in ages. No offense to the Shahs Of Sunset.' In an exclusive interview with MailOnline earlier this month,  the statuesque blonde, 39, said: 'To be quite honest I don't really care about Justin Bieber and I don't want to talk about him anymore. In order to make that happen I had to just stop doing my show. Straight away. Despite being in a Hollywood clique - and highly protective of friends who include A listers Jennifer Aniston, Cameron Diaz and Reese Witherspoon - Chelsea said she was exhausted of being made to cover the shenanigans that surround the Kardashians. Even though she is on the same network as Keeping Up With The Kardashians - and Khloe stood in for her while she was away in April - she said: 'I think if you participate in the celebrity world then you don't really have a choice but to be involved in the drama. Moving on: Chelsea Handler says that after seven years of taunting celebrities, she's over it- saying: 'I don't care about Justin Bieber and I don't want to talk about him anymore' 'You end up getting so into the mix that it changes the topics of the day. You can sit around and complain about all that s**t and the Kardashians all day but if you're participating in it then what can you do? It really didn't feel great doing the show and the only way to sort things out was to extricate myself from the entire situation.' Currently on tour with a show based on her New York Times bestseller Uganda Be Kidding Me, Chelsea plans to take some well deserved R&R when the tour finishes. She has plans to travel around Europe, Asia 'and where ever the wind blows me...then it will be time to start up a new kind of show.' She said: 'Now I want to do things differently. I want to talk to people who are going to educate me. Politicians, medical professionals and people with real human interest stories. 'I want to talk to people who have changed the course of the world. Inventors, invaders and people who have been doing exciting stuff.' Change of pace: The chat show host, who will bid farewell to her E! show Chelsea Lately in August, admits she is quitting because she is totally fed up of stars . E! told Variety the last month of Chelsea Lately would feature special guests and special episodes. And as ever Chelsea had a sense of humour as she announced the end of the show, saying: 'I myself am more surprised than anyone that I was able to hold down a job for seven years, and it was a fantastic seven years. 'I will always look back at my time on E! as most people look back at their time in college. I’m glad I went.' The Netflix deal with Handler begins with a standup performance premiering on October 10. She will also create four specials debuting in 2015. In addition, next year Handler will create four new docu-comedy specials exclusively for Netflix covering her exploration of subjects including politics, NASCAR, the NBA draft and Silicon Valley. Handler is producing the standup special, docu-comedy specials and new talk show along with her partners in Borderline Amazing, Tom Brunelle and Brad Wollack. Handler's announced departure from E! had earlier sparked speculation that she might find a late-night home on a broadcast network. Netflix has already scored with original scripted series including House of Cards.","Chelsea, 39, ends her E! show Chelsea Lately in August .

"By . Claire Elliott . Employment Minister Esther McVey has revealed that she has never had children because she has not found someone to ‘wind up’ her biological clock. The 46-year-old former GMTV presenter, who was promoted to attend the Cabinet last week, said that despite ‘loving’ children, she has not met the right person to have them with. In her first in-depth interview following the reshuffle, Miss McVey said: ‘I always thought as I was growing up that I’d be married with children. That hasn't happened. Scroll down for video . Former TV presenter Esther McVey assumed that she would get married and have children . ‘So I guess that is a sacrifice because I do actually love kids: I just haven’t got them myself. Why? Because I obviously never met the person I was going to have children with, and I had to be realistic. ‘Was I going to put the right amount of time into that if I was living between two places? All I’m saying, having worked hard and been the breadwinner, for me, that’s how things ended up.’ ‘This is how I am, I’m happy with my friends, my family, my job. I’ve had other friends who had such a burning desire to have children, they have this biological ticking clock . I don’t know what happened to mine. Nobody ever wound it up,’ she told Grazia (below). Miss McVey has had relationships with television producer Mal Young and Conservative Culture Minister Ed Vaizey, but has never married and is currently single. Ex-lovers: Esther McVey has had relationships with Tory MP Ed Vaizey (left) and television producer Mal Young (right) who used to be in charge of soap opera Brookside, which is set in Miss McVey's home city . She dominated headlines last week when she appeared outside Downing Street during a women-friendly reshuffle. Her job remained the same but she is now allowed to sit in on the Cabinet. Yesterday, Tory MP Richard Drax was criticised for describing the reshuffle, which saw several women promoted, as the ‘Night of the Petticoats’. He also accused David Cameron of ‘tokenism’ and said female colleagues had been promoted because ‘a quota needs to be filled’. Those were the dats: Esther McVey in her previous life as a breakfast television presenter with a youthful and svelte Eamonn Holmes (right) in 1989 . But his claims were rubbished by fellow Tory MP Richard Benyon who said: ‘In a week that saw the Church of England finally come to its senses over women bishops we also saw some talented women MPs promoted. And some talented men.’ Miss McVey, a privately educated law graduate, attributed the media interest in the reshuffle to the idea that women are traditionally seen as nurturers. ‘We do want to know a little bit more about the soft side of a woman than we do of a man. 'Maybe as a woman you want to say: “Do I like this lady, do I feel she’s one of us?”,’ she said. Last week, she said the attention was ‘fine if it inspires girls to go into politics’. The builder’s daughter from Liverpool has previously attributed her career achievements to hard graft. Earlier this year, she said that young people should take jobs in Costa coffee shops because her own stint as a waitress had paved the way to her success in the media. She added: ‘I’ve met people at the top of companies like Accenture who started off in McDonald’s.’","Former breakfast TV presenter always assumed she would get married .

"By . James Tozer . A woman with cancer delayed potentially life-saving treatment for fear it would harm her chances of becoming a mother. When Nicola Cockx did become pregnant she bravely continued to postpone chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant for the sake of her unborn child. Instead she fought multiple myeloma – a form of bone marrow cancer which affects plasma cells – by studying nutrition and concentrating on a healthy diet. Nicola Cockx, 35, was so desperate to have a child she delayed cancer treatment so she could have her daughter Harriet. The young mother died eight months after the child's birth . After her daughter was born, Mrs Cockx . finally underwent intensive treatment. But she died aged 35 from an . infection when Harriet was just eight months old. The family of Mrs . Cockx – described as ‘beautiful, courageous and determined’ – believe . that if she had had chemotherapy she would have survived, but never had . the child she longed for. The businesswoman of Little Bollington near . Altrincham, Cheshire, had fought a three-year battle against cancer by . the time she became pregnant in 2011. Mrs Cockx, a businesswoman, was first diagnosed with bone marrow cancer in 2008. She sought holistic remedies rather than conventional methods as she wanted to protect her fertility . Around 4,800 cases of multiple . myeloma are diagnosed in this country every year, representing about 1 . per cent of all cancers. It affects places in the body where there is . bone marrow, causing abnormal cells to build up and leading to . infections and fractures. Mrs Cockx was initially treated with . radiotherapy in her hip but also sought alternative medication and . therapy, her husband Rudy, 39, an IT consultant, told a Manchester . inquest. She did a course in nutrition at Manchester University and . even talked of contacting Jamie Oliver for advice. But she refused . aggressive treatment in the hope of preserving her fertility and . fulfilling her dream of becoming a mother, the inquest heard. Dr Jim . Cavet, her consultant at Christie Hospital in Manchester, said she . hadn’t wanted chemotherapy even though the cancer was threatening her . spinal cord, so she was given steroids instead. ‘Her real priority was preserving her fertility as much as possible,’ he said. She . also backed out of an autologous stem cell transplant – where a . patient’s stem cells are removed and blasted with chemotherapy – for . fear the toxins would affect her chances of becoming pregnant. Dr Cavet . said that despite her decisions, she fought the cancer off and went into . a period of remission. Mrs Cockx was overjoyed to become pregnant and continued to opt out of treatment that might harm Harriet. The baby was born by emergency caesarean in June 2012, but tests showed the cancer was much stronger than before. Dr . Cavet said Mrs Cockx was still reluctant to have any chemotherapy. But . by now she was weeks away from death, so she finally had chemotherapy . and a full donor stem cell transplant. Mrs Cockx pictured with husband Rudy, 39. The mother - who had an avid interest in fitness - fought off the cancer and was in remission in 2011 when she fell pregnant with her first child . ‘If it wasn’t for this she would have only had a month or so to live,’ the consultant said. ‘Only because she was so young and fit did she get to the point of delivering the baby.’ While . in hospital that October she started a blog, telling friends about a . ‘Sex and the City’ moment when she was given ice lollies to ease the . sore mouth caused by chemotherapy like Samantha in the US sitcom when . she had cancer. The businesswoman gave birth to her healthy daughter Harriet in June 2012. However, during her pregnancy the disease spread - and she underwent emergency chemotherapy after the birth . She also wrote excitedly about cuddling Harriet during visits and speaking to her via Skype. The . transplant initially seemed to work, but Mrs Cockx started to . experience side effects and in  February 2013 was referred to Salford . Hospital. She was discharged but died four days later from sepsis and a drug-related inflammation of the heart. Recording . a narrative verdict, assistant coroner Sara Lewis said: ‘Nicola’s main . concern was her fertility and that she should have a child, and of . course she did in 2012. Following the birth of her daughter, Mrs Cockx also had a stem cell transplant. Recording a narrative verdict, a coroner said the new mother died of myocarditis - a heart condition caused by the drugs used in her treatment . 'Clearly it is very tragic that the stem cell . transplant could not provide a longer remission for her. ‘It is also . right to say she was a very engaged and intelligent young woman who . liked to explore all the information she could obtain to take care of . her health.’ The family are now raising money for more research into the illness. They . declined to comment after the hearing, but mother Patricia Flowers said . on a Just Giving online page: ‘Nicola’s determination to find a way to . fight this horrible disease by natural methods was inspirational. Her . end goal was to survive and have a family. That was all she wanted. Mrs Cockx's family paid tribute to the 'inspirational' woman - saying they we 'so proud' of her. They are now raising money to raise awareness and fund research in to the rare form of cancer . ‘She . was a very well-informed and intelligent young woman and her journey . led her on to an holistic route that worked for her for four years.’ According . to Cancer Research UK, chemotherapy is considered safe during pregnancy . except during the first 14 weeks or in the weeks leading to delivery, . but  more research is being done on any long-term impact on the child . following birth.

Multiple . myeloma is a cancer arising from plasma cells, a type of white blood . cell made in the bone marrow.  Bone marrow is the ‘spongy’ material . found in the centre of the larger bones in the body - and where all . blood cells are made. About 1 . person in 200 will develop myeloma at some time in their life (about . 5,000 people are diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year in the UK). The most common age at which people are diagnosed with the disease is . 72. The main types of . treatment are chemotherapy and for patients who are otherwise fit and . well, stem cell transplantation. Radiotherapy may also be given. While . myeloma is very treatable, there is currently no cure. However, . survival of myeloma patients has improved at a faster rate than any . other cancer in the UK in the last 10 years, mainly due to the . availability of new drugs, according to the charity Myeloma UK. Figures . from the Office for National Statistics showed that around 40 per cent . of patients in England live for at least 5 years.

The maths and finance student, from Leicester, was diabetic and chose Kidasha because it was helping to fight high rates of the condition among children in the Kathmandu Valley. Richard's aunt Elizabeth Mayne said: 'It's brilliant to see that people are making donations, as it was a cause close to Richard's heart. 'He did so much for charity and, like the Stephen Sutton appeal, it shows his life wasn't in vain and his memory will be used to raise even more money.

Mrs Mayne, 56, from Broughton, Hampshire, paid tribute to the 20-year-old, who had been on his way to Perth, Australia.

"By . James Chapman . Prediction: Ed Davey . A Liberal Democrat Cabinet minister has predicted that his party will enter coalition with Labour after next year’s general election. Energy Secretary Ed Davey, who is on the right of his party, said he believes Labour will be the largest party after the election in May and that the Lib Dems will enter power-sharing talks with them. At a conference organised by the Lib Dem Social Liberal Forum in London at the weekend, Mr Davey suggested that the Lib Dems would use their experience to extract a better deal than they did in 2010. ‘If we were negotiating again and I hope we will be, but probably with the Labour Party this time... that would be my prediction, I think because we are used to coalition politics, we would negotiate even better,’ the minister said, according to a transcript of the event obtained by the Huffington Post UK website. His intervention let slip what many senior Lib Dems are saying privately – with Labour and the Lib Dems quietly aligning policy pledges in more than a dozen areas, apparently in readiness for a potential power-sharing deal. There are now many areas where their policies have converged, including preserving the Human Rights Act, scrapping Conservative tax breaks for married couples, cutting pensioner benefits and imposing a mansion tax on expensive homes. Ed Miliband has announced that he will only support an EU referendum following any new transfer of powers from Britain to Brussels. This is something no-one is contemplating so effectively rules out a referendum. The stance is identical to that of the Lib Dems. Although the Lib Dems are flatlining in national opinion polls, most pollsters think they have every chance of hanging onto enough seats to hold the balance of power once more. Policies both parties support . Nick Clegg has suggested the Lib Dems would be willing to work with either the Tories or Labour in the event of another hung Parliament, and has made strenuous efforts to suggest his party will be ‘equidistant’ between the two. But some senior Lib Dems fear voters would be so enraged by the party jumping straight from coalition with the Tories to Labour that they would be ‘wiped out’ in the 2020 general election. Senior Labour figures are split over whether to prepare for the possibility of a pact. * Lib Dem voters prefer David Cameron as Prime Minister to their own leader, a poll has found. Thirty-five per cent thought Mr Cameron was the best choice, compared with 34 per cent who said Mr Clegg would be better, according to the survey carried out by former Tory party chairman Lord Ashcroft.","Ed Davey says Lib Dems can use experience in Coalition to get more power .

"By . Deborah Arthurs . Steeped in tradition, the history of the Norland nanny has gone virtually unchanged since the company was founded in 1892. The gold standard of nannies, the Norland nanny is impeccably trained - and just as impeccably dressed. Norland founder Emily Ward introduced a distinctive uniform so her highly trained nannies would not be mistaken for housemaids. But now, for the first time in 70 years the uniform of these formidable figures, so beloved by royalty, celebrities and the wealthiest of families, has undergone an update. No need for hysteria though. As befits one of the most highly esteemed Nanny schools in the world, the Norland uniform remains as proper as ever - and is certainly not a dramatic departure from the old. Scroll down for video . New look: Norland Nanny students (from left to right) Hana Medwell, Anest Davies, Charlotte Davies, Gabrielle Cottam, Gabriella Broom, Millicent Cope unveil the new Norland uniform - its first in 70 years . Added . flourish: Norland students (from left) Lauren Tinsley, Georgie Buntie . and Lydia Breen in old Norland uniform, and Gabrielle Cottam, Gabriella . Broom, Millicent Cope in the new uniform . Out with the old: Norland . students (from left) Lucy Draper, 24, Chloe Gidney, 19, Abigail Harris, . 19 and Hannah Janes, 20 wearing the old Norland uniform, which went unchanged for 70 years . Legacy: . The first Norland Nurses in 1892 wore full-length dresses with aprons . and leg o'mutton sleeves - a touch less practical than today's offering . The nannies' dresses maintain the . beige, white and brown colouring that has long been associated with the brand. The practical styling and . simple accessories - brown hat and brown gloves, or white in summer - remain . unchanged. But the new Norland nanny's outfit has a few modern flourishes that give the uniform a flavour of the modern day. Turned-up cuffs, a more open neck (with no brown neck-tie) give a more . contemporary look. Toned panelling at the waistline give the illusion of . shape, making the dress a touch more flattering. The fabric is heavier, falls in a more appealing way and keeps its shape better. The brown tights and sensible brown brogues remain. For . winter, the coat has had a stylish update. The loose, fawn . single-breasted overcoat has been replaced by a rather smart button-up . coat in brown with a wraparound collar that has more than a hint of Mary . Poppins about it. Velvet cuffs and an embroidered N on the tie complete . the look. The changes have been introduced in an attempt to make the dresses more flattering and practical. As well as the formal uniform, the nannies have a ‘practical outfit’ for work placements, which features the vibrant blue used on the original Norland uniform. The practical outfit consists of navy blue trousers and jumper and a speedwell blue polo shirt and a wax jacket. Liz Hunt, Principal of Norland College, said: 'We felt it was important to modernise the uniform, just as we have made changes to the curriculum at the College [the college now includes self defence, skidpan driving and Taekwondo on the syllabus]. Rigorous testing: Norland College students from left Hana Medwell, Anest Davies, Charlotte Davies, Gabrielle Cottam, Gabriella Broom, Millicent Cope try out their new uniforms for the first time . Modest: The 1950s style dress remains, but with a neater silhouette and heavier fabric - and retains its demure hemline . 'Norland . trains the childcare professionals and nannies of the future and we . wanted a uniform which would appeal to modern-day students. 'Over the . years, our uniform has gone from wools to silks and frills to stripes . before settling on the brown and beige palette which is now recognised . worldwide. 'The new style is more comfortable and practical for the . students to wear, whilst also bringing the image of Norland up to date . and in line with our new degree course.' Norland College in Bath, Somerset, has been training professional nannies for the rich and famous since it inauguration - and has even placed its nannies in the Royal family: Prince Charles famously had a Norland nanny. Graduates . pay £36,000 for a four-year course. The Norland uniform has been many colours over the . years, starting as grey and pink, which quickly changed to blue to . distinguish Norlanders from hospital ward maids. It was in 1910 that the cloak became brown and then over the years hemlines rose from ankle to knee along with the fashions. However, no major overhaul of the uniform has taken place since the 1930s. Left: New uniform designer Lauren Cope (left) and Norland student Sarah Hayes. Right: First year Norland College students Sarah Haynes (left) and Ellis Carveth show off the neater silhouette of the winter coat . The . new uniform, for pupils studying for a BA (Hons) Early Years . Development and Learning, was designed by Somerset-based, Lauren Cope . and produced by UK suppliers. Liz Hunt added: 'We have worked with . our designer to ensure we keep the ‘essence’ of what makes a Norlander . stand out, and that the standards expected from our students in terms of . appearance and practice is not lost. 'Norland students are well . known for their impeccable, smart appearance, whether they are . travelling to college or on work placements with families or in a . nursery or school. 'They are such recognisable figures on the streets . of Bath and elsewhere, and we feel the new uniform has just the right . mix of tradition and fashion.' Trainee . Charlotte Hannahford, 18, from Newton Abbott, Devon, added: 'I love the . new uniform; it is much more flattering and feminine than the old one.' Ellis . Carveth, 19, from Newbury, Berks., added: 'The uniform was a really . important factor when choosing to come to Norland College, the new . uniform is much more flattering and contemporary, than the old uniform . and I love it. 'It’s so much easier to move around with huge hidden pockets. 'There . are really strict guidelines on our uniform when we are studying at the . College and I think that’s really important as it means we always look . smart and very professional.' After . unveiling the new uniforms, the pupils took part in a Mary .

Norland College, founded in 1892 by Emily Ward, is a leading provider of childcare training.Emily Ward introduced a uniform so Norland graduates needed to be recognised as professionals and not mistaken for housemaids and it is still a strong part of the college's tradition.The founder focused her training on the principles of Friedrich Froebel, the German educationalist who developed the 'kindergarten system'.Its Early Childhood Studies course concentrates on numerous aspects of childhood.Students study elements of social science, psychology, child health, history, literature and education.It also trains its students - known as 'Norlanders' when they graduate - how to work with families, develop a child's math skills and become a whizz in the kitchen and teach a child not only how to cook, but how to cook healthy meals. Along with the traditional skills of cooking, sewing and first aid, new subjects on the curriculum include Taekwondo, self defence, skidpan driving - and escaping from paparazzi. In the second year of the course, students learn from a stunt driver on the Castle Combe Racing Circuit in Wiltshire who prepares them for all kinds of situations, from icy roads to potential kidnappers or paparazzi.","Norland Nanny college founded in 1892 by Emily Ward, who identified a need for more dedicated, nurturing childcare .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Wolves are prowling into Western Europe in their largest numbers for more than a century after a spate of mysterious sheep massacres that has spread fear through farms across the continent. Scientists in Holland made the revelation after a mysterious creature found dead by the side of a road was revealed to be the country's first wolf in 150 years. Meanwhile in Germany, 50 wolf-pack raids were recorded in Germany last year alone despite the fact that the country's supposed 'last wolf' was shot dead in 1904. Making a comeback: Last year alone, 50 wolf-pack raids were recorded in Germany leaving farmers fearing for their livelihoods. Germany's 'last wolf' was shot dead in 1904 . 'Most European countries have signed the 1979 Berne convention which . prohibits the killing of wolves,' Vanessa Ludwig, a biologist who . monitors the growing wolf population in Germany’s Lausitz region, told The Independent. 'In Europe, the wolf is at the top of the predatory chain. It has no . enemies except humans. We have not reached the legal limit in wolf . numbers which would allow for culling, so the species is, by its nature, . destined to spread across the continent,' she added. European heartland: Traditionally, Europe has nine wolf population zones including Scandinavia, the Baltic states, Poland, Romania, south-eastern France, Italy and the Iberian peninsula in Spain . The wolves are coming: Traditionally, Europe has nine wolf population zones including Scandinavia, the Baltic states, Poland, Romania, south-eastern France, Italy and the Iberian peninsula in Spain . Last week, a wolf, was run over and killed by a car near the Dutch hamlet of Luttelgeest, just 30 miles from Holland’s densely populated North Sea coast. Wolves were abundant throughout the forests of mainland Europe during the 18th century. But a vast cull all but wiped them out in all central and northern European countries during the 19th century and the post World War II period. Survivors of that cull remain in pockets in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and Finland, though the largest populations are now found in eastern Europe, primarily in Romania, the Balkans and Poland. There is now an estimated population of between 18,000 and 25,000 wolves left in the wilds of Europe. They tend mostly to hunt in large packs, relying on a keen sense of smell and teamwork to catch prey, from moose to deer to wild boar. When chasing prey, they run at around 40mph; not particularly fast compared with big cats. But they can keep going for an hour, chasing and chasing until their quarry runs out of steam. They listen to their prey’s heartbeat from several metres away with their uncannily ­powerful hearing and can judge when it is petrified — the moment they decide to go in for the kill. They are also highly intelligent. Packs have been known to fill their mouths with snow when stalking so that their breath does not steam in the cold — which might give them away to their prey. They have been . considered so rare in the area that the possibility it was a wolf was almost ruled out until test were carried out by biologists. Germany, however, has experienced a . sharp rise in wolf-pack attacks forcing farmers to resort to ever-more . extreme methods of protecting their sheep. For many farmers, electric fences are not enough forcing some to pay up to 3,000 Euro for Pyrenean sheepdogs who live among the flock and bark loudly when wolves appear. But experts say attacks on humans are rare and wolves are generally as scared of people as people are of them. Scientists attribute the rise of . wolves in Western Europe to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 when they . were made a protected species. Wolves . started entering Lausitz from Poland in the 1990s using rusting . machinery and vast and desolate former Soviet training grounds left over . from the Cold War as their home. Traditionally, . Europe has nine wolf population zones including Scandinavia, the Baltic . states, Poland, Romania, south-eastern France, Italy and the Iberian . peninsula in Spain. The first clue that wolves were breeding in Germany came in 2000 when an infra red camera picked up a male and female caring for a tiny cub for the first time. Germany’s 'last wolf' was shot dead in 1904 while Britain has not seen a one on its shores for more than 200 years. Wolves live with their cubs for about two years until their offspring mature enough to move on and form a new pack elsewhere. 'This happens when the wolf population is too large to be sustained by the deer and boar which live around it and which are its natural food supply,' said Ms Ludwig.","Last year, 50 wolf-pack raids on farms were recorded in Germany .

"By . David Wilkes . Faced with the birth of their first child, Ian and Rebekah Pugh decided they needed to tighten their belts. Realising that supermarkets were costing them a small fortune, they set themselves the challenge of shunning them for a year. Sticking to ten strict rules, the couple limited their food budget to £50 a week and began buying all their groceries from local shops and markets. Shop swap: Ian and Rebekah Pugh gave up supermarkets before the birth of their daughter Lizzie and say they have saved money and have a better diet . A year later, they have not only completed their challenge, they have saved themselves £895.23 – and are reaping the benefits of a healthier lifestyle. It has been such a success the couple, who live in Faringdon, Oxfordshire, with 18-month-old daughter Elizabeth, have now decided to give up supermarkets for good. Mrs Pugh, 29, said: ‘I used to think we spent £50 on the weekly supermarket shop. But when I looked at the bank statements it was more like £90. ‘The trouble is you do the weekly shop then end up popping in to get bread and milk one day and come out with a load of other stuff you hadn’t planned on getting because you see all the two-for-ones and special offers as you go round. ‘You see things for £1 and think that’s really cheap, but if you stopped to think about it you don’t really need them. Supermarkets are engineered to make you buy. That’s why the bread and milk is at the back. ‘You can definitely buy certain things cheaper in supermarkets. But it’s the lifestyle change which has made the savings – we’re not buying food or products any more, but ingredients, and the amount of them we need, to make things. ‘We used to waste a lot of things we couldn’t get through. ‘Now we don’t have to buy large quantities of things because that’s how they come packaged. I have the time to cook from scratch every day and we make the most of everything we buy. ‘For example, we buy a quality chicken from the butcher which we will roast, then have cold in sandwiches and use the  carcass to make stock or soup.’ The Pughs’ ten rules include the opportunity to eat out in a restaurant once a fortnight and the need to avoid wasting any food or drink. They shop at a local street market and monthly farmer’s market. They use the local butcher’s, delicatessen and cheese shop and have even started getting their pork straight from a nearby farm. They have also begun making their own bread and get their eggs from their hens Tom, Dick and Harry. If for any reason, they failed to stick to their £50 budget, the couple slashed the following week’s budget by half. Mr Pugh, 28, an academic administrator at St Cross College at the University of Oxford, has had to give up his favourite biscuits, but his sweet tooth is now more than satisfied by his wife’s home-made cakes. Mrs Pugh, who blogged about her ‘Year Without Supermarkets’ during her maternity leave from her job as a mental health worker, said: ‘We are healthier as we have lost weight, and we really appreciate things we used to take for granted like golden syrup, which is ridiculously cheap in supermarkets compared to elsewhere. ‘We think a lot more about what we’re eating too. If you fry a bit of supermarket bacon it usually shrivels away and there’s a lot of water. ‘Ours isn’t like that any more –  we know where it comes from and that the pigs have been cared for. We meet the traders and hear about their products. It’s all an added bonus.’ She added: ‘It’s been a good discipline to learn to live this way. We’ve been under our £50 a week food budget – on average we spend about £35. 'I used to keep the cupboard rammed full as if we were expecting a nuclear disaster. Now I just get in what we need. 'We’re eating better quality food, certainly more fruit and vegetables. Lizzie has never had any preserved or processed food. It’s all been home-made. ‘Our diet is also more varied. We buy vegetables in season and meat like pheasant and venison which before we’d have associated with paying for in a restaurant.’","Ian and Rebekah Pugh gave up supermarkets to save money .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Britain will assist France in its attempt to stop the advancement of al-Qaeda rebels in Mali, it has been revealed. The UK will transport troops and specialist equipment to the West African country after France launched an operation in conjunction with the Malian Government to halt Islamic extremists. Assistance was agreed in a phone call between David Cameron and French President Francois Hollande. The Prime Minister earlier expressed his 'deep concern' about the advancement of rebels in the country. Onlookers walk past a fire at Ngolonina market in the Malian capital of Bamako. The fire began as France launched air strikes against Islamist militants . France launched its air offensive after al-Qaeda rebels made advances in the key Mali city of Konna . A police officer and firemen walk at the scene of the fire . Downing Street stressed that British . troops would not engage in combat in the country, but two transport . planes are expected to be deployed within 24-48 hours. A Downing Street spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister spoke to President . Hollande this evening to discuss the deteriorating situation in Mali . and how the UK can support French military assistance provided to the . Malian Government to contain rebel and extremist groups in the north of . the country.' 'The Prime Minister has agreed that . the UK will provide logistical military assistance to help transport . foreign troops and equipment quickly to Mali. 'We will not be deploying any British . personnel in a combat role. They also agreed that the peacekeeping . mission from West African countries needs to be strongly supported by . countries in the region and deployed as quickly as possible. 'Both leaders agreed that the situation in Mali poses a real threat to international security given terrorist activity there.' The Government's National Security Council is set to discuss the situation in Mali when it meets on Tuesday. More than 100 people were killed . when troops French began their operation in the country on Friday. Mr Hollande said his troops would target Islamist . terrorists in the former French territory for 'as long as necessary', . despite the death of a pilot in the attack. The . dramatic intervention coincided with a failed operation, launched only . hours before, to free a French hostage being held captive in Somali, . during which the hostage and two commandos were killed.

French President Francois Hollande has said he had to take action against the terrorists who 'show a brutality that threatens us all' The involvement of French forces in . the African nation marks a dramatic change in Mr Hollande's attitude to . foreign intervention. The President was spurred to act by . the potential southern advancement of rebels towards Mali's capital . Bamako, having already occupied much of the country's northern region. The operation, backed by the UN . Security Council and West African nations, was in response to a plea for . help from the country's government. Mr Hollande sent 200 troops, as well as . the bombers, to join local forces as they wrestled control back in the . strategic, rebel-held town of Konna. Western powers fear that the al-Qaeda-linked militants . will seek to use the vast desert zone in Mali as a springboard for international . attacks. Speaking about the decision to intervene, Mr Hollande said he was . forced to act against the terrorists who 'show a brutality that . threatens us all', and . said the operation was in part aimed at protecting Mali's 6,000 French . citizens. He said: 'We have already held back . the progress of our adversaries and inflicted heavy losses on them. But . our mission is not over yet. 'The terrorists should know that France . will always be there when the rights of a people, those of Mali who want . to live freely and in a democracy, are at issue.' Mr Hollande said Islamists had shown 'blatant aggression that is threatening Mali's very existence' and said the operation was in part aimed at protecting Mali's 6,000 French citizens . Concerned about reprisals on French soil, Hollande said he had asked his . prime minister to reinforce security in public buildings and on public . transport as quickly as possible. David Cameron earlier expressed his . 'deep concern' about the advancement of al-Qaeda in Mali, backing . France's decision to launch military action against the terror group's . militants. The offensive has prompted British Islamists to protest outside the French Embassy in London. Mr . Cameron also sent his condolences to the family of the dead . hostage killed in Somalia, Denis Alexx. 'I am . deeply concerned about the recent rebel advances in Mali, which extend . the reach of terrorist groups and threaten the stability of the country . and the wider region,' said Mr Cameron. 'I welcome the military assistance France has provided to the Malian government, at their request, to halt this advance. 'These developments show the need to . make urgent progress in implementing UN Security Council resolutions on . Mali and ensure that military intervention is reinforced by an inclusive . political process leading to elections and a return to full civilian . rule. 'I would also like to . send personal condolences to the families of the French hostage killed . in Somalia and those of the two soldiers either killed or missing in the . rescue attempt.

About 50 protestors waved placards and shouted in opposition to the sir strikes on Islamic militants, authorised by French President Francois Hollande . 'Last night's tragic events underline how essential it is that we work together to combat terrorism in Africa.' An army officer at the headquarters . of Mali's former military junta in Bamako said nearly 30 vehicles . carrying Islamist fighters had been hit by the French airstrikes and . 'over 100' rebels had been killed in fighting. 'We have driven them out, we are effectively in Konna,' Malian Defence Ministry spokesman Lt. Col. Diaran Kone said. 'We don't know if they have planted mines or other traps, so we are moving with caution. There were many deaths on both sides.' A shopkeeper in Konna said he had . counted 148 bodies in four different locations in the town, including . several dozen uniformed government soldiers. French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the militants threatened to create 'a terrorist state at the doorstep of France and Europe'. French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian (left) told a news conference in Paris that the rebels in Mali threatened to create a terrorist state on the doorstep of Europe. He was backed by David Cameron (right) The fighting involved hundreds of French troops and overnight airstrikes on three rebel targets, said Mr Le Drian. A spokesman for al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) said he considered the French operation a 'crusader intervention', and told France it would be 'digging the tombs of its sons' if the operation continued, according to the Mauritania-based Sahara Media website. A military official in Mali said Islamist militants were driven out of Konna, but that the city captured by the extremists earlier this week was not yet under government control. 'We are doing sweeps of the city to find any hidden Islamist extremist elements,' said Lt. Col. Diarran Kone. 'The full recovery of the city is too early to determine as we do not yet control the city, and we remain vigilant.' The fall of the town of Konna had been a major blow to government forces but on Saturday, with the aid of French airstrikes, they took back the town from the rebels . Sanda Abou Mohamed, spokesman for Islamist group Ansar Dine, told The Associated Press he could not confirm if his fighters were still in Konna. 'I cannot tell you if our fighters are still in the city of Konna or if they are not, because since yesterday afternoon I have not had contact with them as the telephone network has been down in this zone.' Other West African nations authorised an immediate deployment of troops to join the offensive, which had previously been set to happen in September. Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara signed an order on Friday to deploy some 3,300 regional troops under a U.N. mandated operation. 'By Monday by the latest, the troops will be there or will have started to arrive,' said Ali Coulibaly, the country's African Integration Minister. 'Things are accelerating ... The reconquest of the north has already begun.' The bulk of the forces are expected to come from Nigeria, Niger, Senegal and Togo, led by Nigerian Major-General Shehu Abdulkadir. Burkina Faso, which has tried to mediate talks with some of the Islamist groups, said on Saturday it would rapidly deploy 500 soldiers to Mali to support. Al-Qaeda's affiliate in Africa has been a shadowy presence for years in the forests and deserts of Mali, a country hobbled by poverty and a relentless cycle of hunger. Most Malians adhere to a moderate form of Islam. In recent months, however, the terrorist group and its allies have taken advantage of political instability, taking territory they are using to stock weapons and train forces. Turbaned fighters control major towns in the north, carrying out amputations in public squares just as the Taliban did. And as in Afghanistan, they are flogging women for not covering up. Since taking control of Timbuktu, they have destroyed seven of the 16 mausoleums listed as world heritage sites.","Follows conversation between David Cameron and Francois Hollande .

"By . Chris Brooke . A climber has been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after his friend plunged to his death at a coastal beauty spot. The men were abseiling down cliffs to look for the semi-precious gemstone Jet when the tragedy happened. The 51-year-old victim was airlifted to hospital where he was pronounced dead. Both men were abseiling down a 375ft cliff face at Kettleness Point, near Runswick Bay, North Yorkshire . Police revealed the friend climbing with him, aged in his 20s, was arrested and released on bail pending further inquiries. Both men were abseiling down a 375ft cliff face at Kettleness Point, near Runswick Bay, North Yorkshire, when the incident happened at around 11.20am on Friday. A Whitby coastguard team attended the scene and looked after the second climber, who was said to be suffering from shock. A coastguard spokesman said: ‘He just said his friend was going down the cliff and they had tied this rope round a rock. But it moved and down he went.’ The victim was airlifted by an RAF Sea King Helicopter to James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough, but nothing could be done to save him. The dead man, who is from the Cleveland area, has not been identified. North Yorkshire Police have now launched a full inquiry. The men were abseiling down cliffs to look for the semi-precious gemstone Jet . Temporary Detective Superintendent Steve Smith, said: ‘This is a tragic incident involving two climbers who appear to have got into difficulty, resulting in the death of one of them. 'A full investigation is underway to establish exactly what happened.’ Police have appealed to any walkers in the area who saw the two men to come forward. At least two walkers were nearby at the time, it is believed. It is not known how far the dead man fell or exactly why the accident happened. Police are looking at what part the equipment the men were using played and also why one man fell and the other survived. The rope they were using had not been cut, said police. It is thought that the men were looking for Whitby Jet – a gemstone used to create jewellery for centuries. Jet's colour is responsible for the term ‘jet black’ and is in reality the fossilised wood remains of the monkey puzzle tree. The seams were laid down about 180 million years ago. The gemstone is only found along a seven-and-a-half mile stretch of North Yorkshire coast near Whitby. The black fossil was so popular during Victorian times that around 1,400 people worked in the local industry as finders, carvers and polishers. The rugged coastline remains a magnet for Jet hunters today.

"By . Deborah Arthurs . It is one of those popular Beatles songs that appeals across generations. Octopus's Garden, like Maxwell's Silver Hammer or Yellow Submarine, have the sort of merry tunes and simple lyrics that please music lovers from nursery to nursing home and all those in between. When I play the song, from the 1969 Abbey Road album, to my three-year-old son Leo, the story-like lyrics captivate him. And now those lyrics, conjured up by Ringo Starr in 1968 while holidaying in Sardinia on Peter Sellers' yacht, have been turned into the words of a children's book. Colourful creation: Ringo Starr has teamed up with Ben Cort, illustrator of Aliens In Underpants, to create this bright literary take on his 1969 song . Illustrated by Ben Cort, the talented artist behind bestselling book series Aliens In Underpants, the book follows five children on an underwater adventure though the Octopus's garden. The children's fantasy journey sees them hide in giant whelk shells, swim with a blue whale and ride on the back of a fleet of turtles before joining the octopus in his garden and adorning him with jewels. The book comes with a CD featuring a reading by Ringo Starr and a never-before-heard version of the song. Fantasy journey: The five children in the story embark on an underwater adventure with a friendly octopus . Legend has it Ringo Starr came up with the idea for his song about this magpie of a sea creature when the captain on Seller's boat offered him freshly caught squid for lunch. One story goes that Starr ate the creature, declared it 'ok, just like chicken', and listened as the captain went onto tell him him how octopuses trawl the sea bed for shiny stones and objects to put in front of their caves, creating a sort of garden there. Others say Sellers did not eat the creature. Whatever, the truth, the tale piqued Starr's imagination and the song was born. Inspiration: Starr came up with the idea for the song Octopus's Garden, which featured on The Beatles' 1969 album Abbey Road, when dining on squid on Peter Sellers' yacht off the coast of Sardinia . Starr said today it is 'great' that Octopus's Garden is being brought to life for a whole new generation. 'Ben Cort's colourful illustrations really capture the feel of the song. I love it!' said Starr, adding, 'peace and love'. The 1970 Let It Be film shows fellow Beatle George Harrison helping Ringo Starr shape the melody on the piano. Since the song's release, it has been covered by the Muppets and The Punkels, made into a mash-up with Blondie's Heart Of Glass, called Glass Octopus, in 2007, and had its lyrics borrowed by Oasis. Delighted: Starr says it is 'great' that Octopus's Garden is being brought to life for another generation, adding that Ben Cort's illustrations 'really capture the feel of the song'. 'I love it,' he says . Octopus's Garden by Ringo Starr and Ben Cort is published by Simon and Schuster will be released as a book and CD set on 24 October.","Illustrated by artist of bestselling series Aliens In Underpants .

"By . Mark Duell . Sick: Jimmy Savile made the shocking claims in his 1974 Barrie & Jenkins book As It Happens . Jimmy Savile once spent the night in a tent on a hillside with six girls wearing matching mini-skirts and white boots as ‘payment’ for taking part in a charity event, he wrote in an out-of-print memoir. The shamed TV star and the girls ‘fell about and over each other, making enough noise to wake the dead’ at a location in Yorkshire, he said in his 1974 Barrie & Jenkins book As It Happens. Savile, who died last year in Leeds aged 84, also recalled being recognised on a beach by a girl, who began to take off her swimsuit inside her caravan for him, leaving him ‘wringing wet with heat and temptation’, until her parents entered. He claimed a council chairman called him as he wanted the annual mayoral ball to become a youth dance, because the event had previously only attracted a few hundred locals in the past. The presenter told the chairman: ‘I will come if you will arrange for me to sleep in a tent up the local hillside with another tent alongside with six girls to sleep there as my bodyguards. He added: ‘My demands really put the dance on the map and 2,000 tickets went like hot cakes. 'My ultimatum of “no tents, no girls, no me” meant the council had to go through with it.’ A newspaper advert was placed for young girls to spend the night with him, and he claimed that hundreds applied, reported the Sunday Mirror. Savile even said the unknown council called a . meeting to decide which six girls to use, and half of the . members left in disbelief at the discussion. Scroll down for video . Disgraced presenter: Savile (left) and the girls 'fell about and over each other', he claimed in the memoir. The antics happened at an unknown location in Yorkshire (file picture, right) Jimmy Savile was today astonishingly linked to the Yorkshire Ripper's killings, after it was revealed the third victim Irene Richardson was murdered yards from his home in Leeds. Savile was a regular visitor to Broadmoor psychiatric hospital and befriended Peter Sutcliffe, now 66, after he was moved there. Britain’s top expert on serial killers said police should probe whether the pair developed a friendship before Sutcliffe was caught – and the family of the Ripper's first victim have joined calls for officers to question Savile. Former prison officer Professor David Wilson of Birmingham City University told the Sun: ‘At first sight the suggestion that Savile might be connected with the crimes committed by Sutcliffe will seem farfetched. ‘Yet predatory paedophiles and serial killers are the awful products of common forces which, in their case, were allowed to develop unchecked.' Richard McCann, 42, son of the Ripper’s first victim Wilma McCann, added that if an expert has called for a probe into Sutcliffe’s relationship with Savile, then it should happen. Savile described the girls as ‘good enough to eat’ and he had an ‘incredible evening’. But the father of one girl realised what was happening before the event started and dragged his daughter home. Later on that evening Savile claimed the ‘girls’ tent fell over and we all had to finish up together’. He also wrote in the book about being recognised on a beach by a girl, who invited into him into her family’s caravan while his two minders stayed with her parents, reported the Sunday Mirror. Savile said the girl began to undress. He wrote: ‘I have sunk into a chair, wringing wet with the heat and temptation. A rustling and snapping from the dark end tells me that the swimsuit is off.' He said her parents suddenly entered the caravan - but the situation was ‘saved’ as the girl quickly slid into a dress and pretended to make tea. Friendship: Savile (left) was said to be so close to Prince Charles (right) that he advised him on the appointment of Sir Christopher Airy as his private secretary in 1990. The duo are pictured together in 1999 . Meanwhile, Savile was said to be so close to Prince Charles that he advised him on the appointment of Sir Christopher Airy as his private secretary in 1990, it was claimed today by the Sunday Times. 'I have sunk into a chair, wringing wet with the heat and temptation. A rustling and snapping from the dark end tells me that the swimsuit is off' Jimmy Savile . Savile and Charles met former major-general Airy before he was offered the post, portraying an extraordinary close friendship between the heir to the throne and the disgraced TV star. 'Savile was in and out of the palace at that time pretty frequently,' a source said. 'His bling and his tracksuits made him rather unconventional and I think that was appealing to Prince Charles.’ Ex-royal press secretary Dickie Arbiter said Savile was a ‘brought in by an aide as a sort of “Jim’ll Fix It” to fix the state of the marriage’ of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, ‘but of course it didn’t work’. St James’s Palace said it had no record of Savile being at Airy’s interview. Airy refused to comment. Probed: Comedian Freddie Starr (left) and former pop star Gary Glitter (right), whose real name is Paul Gadd, have both been questioned by officers investigating the abuse scandal . Plastic bag: Savile was said to have left toys meant for sick children for years at his flat in the grounds of Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire. Proof of the hoard was captured in a picture taken in 1999 . Savile's reputation was hit again after claims he hoarded toys left by the public in memory of Princess Diana - which were meant for sick children - in his hospital flat in green bin bags. The toys had been placed among thousands of floral tributes outside the gates of Kensington Palace in west London. Royal aides decided the toys should be given to sick children in Diana’s memory. But Savile was said to have left them for years at his flat in the grounds of Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. Instead of passing them around, the toys languished in his flat for at least two years. Proof of the hoard was captured in a picture taken in 1999, two years after Diana’s death. A Stoke Mandeville Hospital source said: ‘I am sure that the public will be shocked to hear that Savile could not be bothered to give the donated toys to the sick child patients.’ The Savile scandal first arose when ITV broadcast new sex abuse allegations in a documentary about the late presenter on October 3, which sparked a mammoth police inquiry. Intense scrutiny over the BBC followed, after the Corporation dropped a Newsnight report into the presenter’s actions last year after his death. Savile is believed to have been one of the UK's most prolific abusers, with about 300 possible victims. Scotland Yard is leading a probe into his activities, with detectives following 400 lines of inquiry. Comedian Freddie Starr and former pop star Gary Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, have both been questioned by officers investigating the abuse scandal. A number of alleged victims claim they were abused by Savile while pupils at Duncroft Approved School in Surrey during the 1970s. Savile's estate, reportedly worth £4.3million, has been frozen in response to the allegations. NatWest Bank, which is acting as his executor and trustee, said the distribution of his assets had been put on hold in anticipation of legal action from his alleged victims. Institution: University of Leeds chiefs awarded the honorary doctorate of law to Savile in 1986 . A university which awarded Jimmy Savile an honorary doctorate of law in the 1980s could become the latest institution to distance itself from the disgraced DJ. Chiefs at the University of Leeds proudly awarded the accolade to the Leeds-born TV presenter and charity fundraiser in 1986. But in view of more than a month of shocking allegations which have left the former star's reputation in tatters, the award is due to be discussed by a university committee. A university spokesman said: ‘At the time of (Savile's) nomination and when the award was conferred, no concerns had been raised with the university about his behaviour and we were not aware of any allegations against him. ‘In the light of this new information, the matter will be discussed when the honorary degree committee next meets (later this month).’ VIDEO: Jimmy Savile's nephew speaks out about his 'monster' uncle .","He spent night with six girls wearing matching mini-skirts and white boots .

"By . Stephen Doughty . and David Wilkes . British Airways check-in clerk Nadia Eweida triumphed over the airline yesterday after a six-year battle to wear her cross at work. Her right to profess her religious belief should have trumped the airline’s powers to mould its image by imposing petty uniform rules on its staff, European judges declared. A ‘jubilant’ Miss Eweida, who had lost at a string of hearings in Britain, said her first reaction to the ruling had been to say: ‘Thank you, Jesus.’ Scroll down for video . Victory: A jubilant Nadia Eweida with her cross after she won her court battle . Defeat: (left to right) Shirley Chaplin, Lillian Ladel and Gary McFarlane . But her victory came as three other Christians lost claims at the European Court of Human Rights. Nurse Shirley Chaplin, who wanted to wear a cross with her uniform, was told that her bosses were right to remove her from the wards because of the importance of health and safety for NHS patients. And two Christians who were sacked in gay rights disputes were both properly dismissed, the Strasbourg court ruled. Lillian Ladele, a registrar with Islington council, had declined to conduct civil partnership ceremonies. Gary McFarlane, a Relate counsellor, had been reluctant to give sex advice to gay couples. The judgment in Miss Eweida’s case is likely to open the way for Christians to declare their faith by wearing or displaying the cross at work, unless their employer can show a good reason why they should not. Victory: Miss Eweida said she 'jumped for joy' and thanked Jesus after hearing the decision this morning . But the Government’s Equality and Human Rights Commission said employers would be confused. It called for new laws from . Westminster on the rights of religious believers to demonstrate and . practise their beliefs in public. Miss Eweida, 61, had been told by . British Airways that she must remove the cross she wore with her . uniform, even though the airline was happy for Sikh men to wear turbans . and bracelets and for Muslim women to wear headscarves. After her victory she said: ‘I’m . overwhelmed, but jubilant. When I heard the result I literally jumped up . and down for joy and said “thank you, Jesus”. ‘I’m very pleased Christian rights . have been vindicated. I believe there will be a big impact and it will . encourage employees who are too timid or reserved to wear their crosses . not to be afraid to show their faith.’ Backing: The Prime Minister tweeted this morning he was 'delighted' about the ruling in Strasbourg . The Daily Mail revealed in 2006 that Nadia Eweida had been suspended for wearing a cross . The Egyptian-born Coptic Christian was . sent home without pay in September 2006. Her suspension provoked a . public outcry after it was reported by the Daily Mail. The airline allowed her back to work . in February 2007 under new rules allowing the cross and the Star of . David to be displayed with uniforms. However a series of British tribunals and the Court of Appeal said the airline had been right and she had been wrong. Yesterday the Strasbourg judges said . that while BA had a right to protect its corporate image, ‘Miss Eweida’s . cross was discreet and cannot have detracted from her professional . appearance’. Lost: Andrea Williams of the Christian Legal Centre holds the cross of Shirley Chaplin, whose complaint about not being able to wear it at work in a hospital was not upheld . Case: Marriage counsellor Gary McFarlane, 51, who was sacked for saying he might object to offering sex therapy to homosexuals also lost today . Disappointment: Shirley Chaplin with her confirmation cross pendant which she wears on a necklace - but her discrimination case was lost today . Government lawyers opposed her claim . and the three others in Strasbourg. British officials said the . Government is bound to uphold the decisions of the British courts. However yesterday David Cameron . tweeted that he was ‘delighted that the principle of wearing religious . symbols at work has been upheld – people shouldn’t suffer discrimination . due to religious beliefs’. Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu . welcomed the ruling. ‘Christians and those of other faiths should be . free to wear the symbols of their own religion without discrimination,’ he said. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, . who has backed the right of Christians to declare their faith, said of . Miss Eweida’s victory: ‘I’m delighted that the principle of it has been . upheld by the European Court. ‘The Prime Minister has said we would . change the law if it wasn’t. Our lawyers are still looking through the . judgement but their view is it is not going to be necessary to have to . change the law.’ The judges added: ‘There was no . evidence that the wearing of other, previously authorised, items of . religious clothing, such as turbans and hijabs, by other employees, had . any negative impact on British Airways’ brand or image. Moreover, the fact that the company . was able to amend the uniform code to allow for the visible wearing of . religious symbolic jewellery demonstrates that the earlier prohibition . was not of crucial importance.’ Dr John Sentamu said tribunals and courts should not have to rule on what symbols people could or could not wear . Christians should be able to wear the symbols of their religion without being discriminated against, the Archbishop of York said today.Reacting to the judgment from the European Court of Human Rights, Dr John Sentamu also said tribunals and courts should not have to rule on what symbols people could or could not wear.But the National Secular Society (NSS) said 'true religious freedom' was for employees who feel parts of their job go against their conscience to find another role.Dr Sentamu said: 'Christians are not obliged to wear a cross but should be free to show their love for and trust in Jesus Christ in this way if they so wish.'In July 2012, the General Synod stated that it is the calling of Christians to order and govern their lives in accordance with the teaching of Holy Scripture and to manifest their faith in public life as well as in private.'This means giving expression to their beliefs in the written and spoken word, and in practical acts of service to the local community and to the nation.'The Equality Act 2010 encourages employers to embrace diversity - including people of faith. Whether people can wear a cross or pray with someone should not be something about which courts and tribunals have to rule.'

"By . Deborah Arthurs . Supermarket chain Morrisons was today declared the cheapest place on the high street to buy your Christmas dinner. The store beat close rival Lidl with its £2.88 per-head cost - managing to shave 23p a head off Lidl's per head cost of £3.11. The budget price for the festive feast brings the total for a Christmas lunch for eight to an undeniably manageable £23.07 - and that's with a mince pie left over for Boxing Day. Bargain festive feast: Morrisons' Christmas dinner basket comes in at £23.07 for a family of eight . Super savers: The store's festive feast . The store unveiled the details of its cut-price Christmas feast this morning, as research from personal finance website Lovemoney.com revealed the per-head costs of Morrisons' competitors after creating comparable Christmas lunch shopping baskets across eight major supermarkets. Each basket contained the same 11 main ingredients widely considered to be 'essential' to a Christmas lunch. STORE          TOTAL   PER HEAD . Morrisons     £23.07         £2.88 .

While such luxuries as chipolatas, cauliflower cheese, bread sauce and Yorkshire puddings are not allowed for, the baskets do include cranberry sauce, sage and onion stuffing, and a selection of puddings including Christmas cake, Christmas pud and mince pies as well as brandy butter. Morrisons . takes the crown for the second year running, with its festive food . basket of eleven different Christmas essentials coming to a total of . just £23.07. The basket, which is the same across all . the stores, includes items such as a turkey, Brussels sprouts and . potatoes along with mince pies, two Christmas puddings and brandy butter. The basket from Morrisons comes in at £37.51 less than a similar basket from the most expensive shop on the list, Waitrose. Lidl narrowly misses the top spot with a price tag of £24.89, or £3.11 per head, while Asda is in third place with a lunch of £25.78 or £3.22 per person. Aldi took second place last year but has slipped to sixth this year, behind Tesco and the Co-operative, which have total bills of £30.74 or £3.84 each. Winning the cut-price war: Morrisons is offering the cheapest festive basket for the second year in a row . Aldi's elevated basket prices comes . largely because they have upped the quality of the items they are . selling in their standard basket, a spokesman for Lovemoney.com said . today. 'The potatoes . from Aldi, for example, are ""specially selected for goose fat roasting"" while the parsnips are ""honey glazed’""compared to the bog standard of . both which most other supermarkets are selling in their most basic . range.' The consumer expert at Lovemoney says that while the vegetables are roughly similar for most shops it is the larger items, such as the turkey or the Christmas cake, which make the most difference to the cost of the basket. 'At Waitrose, for example, where the bill comes to £60.58 or £7.57 per head, the cost of the turkey is significantly more. 'This is because it’s priced by weight and it is free range. Ocado is also the only other supermarket which has a fresh turkey included.' NB: The shopping bills for each supermarket are not identical as the weights and varieties are not always the same. If an exact product comparison wasn’t available, Lovemoney.com used the closest match. Turkey: Whole basted British frozen turkey, 3.6 – 4.8kg, £10 . Vegetables: Unwashed potatoes, 1kg, £1.18 .

The author flew to London this week from her Californian home to attend the Buckingham Palace investiture ceremony hosted by the Queen. She said: 'My first book was The World Is Full OF Married Men - banned all over the world. 'The Queen said 'it's quite something to write books' and I said 'yes especially for a school drop out'.' She added laughing: 'I was wondering . what she was going to say to me because most women say 'oh you taught me . everything I know about sex, I used to read my mum's copy under the . covers in bed' - but I don't think she would say that to me.

'He . had a Zoolander moment. He did some very dodgy Zoolander moves, I was . like ""Oh my gosh, what have I given birth to""', laughed Charlotte after . the show. Proving that fashion doesn't have an . age restriction, the young models looked bang-on-trend in their stylish . designs. There were John Galliano waistcoats, Roberto Cavalli . leopard-print handbags, Kenzo bobble hats and Fendi leather coats, to name but a few. And . it wouldn't be Kid's Fashion Week without an element of fun. As the show drew to a close, the . bass-filled beats of Kanye West Gold Digga played as three youngsters . cartwheeled and break danced along the catwalk as the raucous audience . cheered along. The adorable models show Chloe's A/W 13 collection which features fresh neutral shades in cosy fabrics . Jodie Kidd's blonde-haired baby boy watched avidly as his model mother boogied to the beats and admired the clothes. 'It was all gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. I just wish they made grown-up sizes . in some of those dresses, they were so cute. 'It was really fun, a . lovely idea. I've got my own little boy and it's just so nice shopping . for them so we've had a really lovely afternoon,' she said after the show. Emily Johnston, founder of hit fashion site FashionFoieGras.com was front row at the show. She said: 'Never before have I seen a catwalk that brought about so many smiles in the audience. From kids skipping to kids cartwheeling down the runway, each and every look they showcased was beautiful and very professionally presented. Roberto Cavalli's pieces were sophisticated and tailored, featurting pops of animal print . 'Although, I do believe this is the only event in the fashion calendar when a young one can storm the catwalk and cause laughs instead of sheer panic. 'It was all wonderfully executed and left me rethinking the plan to wait on little ones. I foresee this being a permanent fixture on the fashion calendar.'

"By . Alexandra Williams . Simon Butler, pictured, from Surrey believes his prosecution by French authorities was a 'racist vendetta' claiming that his British skiing qualification should allow him to teach in France. A ski instructor from Surrey has been fined €30,000 (£24,000) for teaching illegally in the Alps after French authorities refused to recognise his British qualifications. Simon Butler, 51, said he had been subjected to a 'racist vendetta' and launched an immediate appeal. He was supported by Mayor of London Boris Johnson who accused the French of a 'naked' breach of the European single market. Mr Butler was warned by the court in Bonneville, Haute-Savoie, that if he failed to pay the fine he would face spending 200 days in prison. Mr Butler, from Guildford, Surrey, has been teaching clients how to ski in the French Alps for 32 years. Despite having the highest-rated British ski instructor’s licence, Mr Butler has refused to obtain qualifications required to teach in France. He says France's refusal to recognise British certificates violates EU laws on freedom of movement, in particular a 2005 directive on Europe-wide recognition of qualifications. Speaking after the today's ruling he said: 'Obviously I'm very disappointed with that result. 'As far as I'm concerned I'm not guilty of anything. I believe I have done everything in my power to prove that my British ski qualifications are in order and that I absolutely have the right to teach skiing in France. 'This has been nothing but a racist vendetta to get me out.' Mr Butler said he had been victimised for years by rival French ski instructors. He said: 'I have run a successful business out here and the local ski instructors don't like it because they believe I'm taking clients from them.' The row centres over the fact that Mr Butler qualified before the introduction of a controversial rule that all non-French teachers had to pass the 'Eurotest', a timed high-speed slalom run, in order to work in France. Mr Butler, left, speaking with his counsel Jean-Yves Laperiere has announced he is appealing the French court's decision to fine him ¿30,000 for running his ski school in the Alps . The French authorities introduced the test in 2004. Mr Butler insists his qualifications, which he achieved in 1985, are the equivalent of this test. The trial has sparked consternation in Britain. London Mayor Boris Johnson called the dispute 'a complete, naked, shameless and unrepentant breach -- by the French -- of the principles of the European Single Market'. This prompted the French embassy in London to deny there was a 'piste war' taking place in the French Alps. The sentence comes after Mr Butler was arrested on a chairlift in Megeve in February. He was escorted off the piste by police and held in custody for 36 hours. Mr Butler employs 28 people and hosts about 100 guests a week from December to April in the resort of Megeve . The court also fined his six fellow British instructors who work with him in Megeve between €1,000 to €4,000 for teaching illegally.

"By . John Stevens, Political Reporter . Support: The proposal is backed by some of the Prime Minister's closest allies including Education Secretary Michael Gove (pictured) Newly retired workers from a range of different fields will be parachuted in to teach at Britain’s toughest schools under Tory manifesto plans. Recent retirees will enrol on an intensive course to retrain as teachers, before being fast-tracked into schools in inner cities and other deprived areas. The Teach Seniors programme will be based on Teach First, which has seen thousands of high-flying graduates heading into the classroom. It is hoped it will encourage professionals from a broad spectrum of careers to work as teachers before fully retiring, using their experience to educate the next generation. The proposal is currently being considered by David Cameron and MP Jo Johnson, Boris’s younger brother, who is drafting the Conservatives’ general election manifesto. It is supported by some of the Prime Minister’s closest allies and is the brainchild of the 2020 Group, which presented the idea to him at Downing Street. One of those involved in the presentation said: ‘Teach First has seen a lot of talented younger people going into schools before embarking on other careers. This would follow the same logic but in reverse, with people who have already had careers opting to go into the classroom. ‘For example someone who has been working as a chemical engineer might teach science and would have a lot of experience to give to younger people.’ The 2020 Group includes about a quarter of the 305 Tory MPs and promotes ‘a modern progressive Conservatism’. It is made up of some of Mr Cameron’s most loyal supporters, with Education Secretary Michael Gove among its members. The group, which was founded by energy and climate change minister Greg Barker, also includes ministers Justine Greening, Helen Grant, David Willetts, Theresa Villiers, Nicky Morgan and Sajid Javid. One member said Teach Seniors was one of a ‘whole range of exciting, aspirational and optimistic ideas’ that had been presented for consideration. Teach First has seen thousands of high-calibre graduates enter the classroom after just a six-week course in teaching. Founded by former City business consultant Brett Wigdortz in 2002, it takes on more than 1,000 graduates a year with 2:1 degrees or above, who want to avoid the traditional teacher-training path. Originally aimed solely at secondary schools in London, it has been expanded to include primary schools and now covers ten regions across England and Wales. Teach First has proved popular with students wanting to try teaching, but has been criticised by unions, which argue that participants do not receive enough training before they are placed in charge of a class. Before starting in schools, participants attend the Summer Institute, a residential course where they study educational theory and practice. Trainees are required to stay in the classroom for only two years, and many sign up to hone skills such as communication, which they believe will help them in future careers in different fields. But more than half stay in teaching and the most successful are fast-tracked into senior roles.","Retirees will enrol on an intensive course to retrain as teachers .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A science teacher at a Baltimore Catholic boys high school has been arrested for having a sexual relationship with one of her current students. Lynette Trotta, 33, is accused of having sexual contact with a 17-year-old student at Archbishop Curley High School, where she has taught since 2007. Trotta, whose husband is a math teacher at the school, allegedly conducted the affair inside her car after class and even inside her classroom during school hours. Illicit affair: Lynette Trotta, a married 33-year-old science teacher, is accused of having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student . Lieutenant Eric Kowalczyk of the Baltimore City Police told CBS that the affair began in December 2013. It came to light after a librarian at the school became aware of the relationship and reported it to the archdiocese on April 1. The archdiocese reported the matter to police. Trotta has been suspended from work and the librarian has also been suspended for not reporting the alleged affair immediately, instead waiting a number of weeks. The student told police that Trotta began showing a special interest in him in November 2012. The pair began emailing and texting before the exchanges became sexual. Boys school: Trotta has been a teacher at Archbishop Curley High School since 2007 . According to the Baltimore Sun, the student told police that Trotta would pull him out of class and spend time kissing him in her classroom. Reverend Joseph Benicewicz, the president of Archbishop Curley, sent a letter to parents explaining the situation to parents and alumni, asking that anyone with any further information come forward. 'I as president and the entire administration do our absolute best to make sure that our teachers and staff are of high moral quality and that they embody the values on which this school is built,' Benicewicz said in the letter. Trotta is being held on $100,000 bail.","Lynette Trotta, 33, has been accused of having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student .

"By . Harriet Arkell . After watching a film in which a man travelled around the world on his motorbike, Welsh journalist Hannah Engelkamp was inspired to go on an odyssey of her own. The international aspect didn't really appeal to her, though, and she thought she'd like some company. So it was, then, that on May 27 last year, Miss Engelkamp set off on her own challenge: a six-month, 1,000-mile trek around Wales, with Chico, her newly-acquired donkey. Hannah Engelkamp, 34, and her donkey, Chico, spent nearly six months trekking 1,000 miles around Wales . Chico, who never made it as a beach donkey because he doesn't like sand, walked more than 1,000 miles . Miss Engelkamp was joined occasionally by relatives or her boyfriend, but mostly it was just her and Chico . Miss Engelkamp said: 'I was inspired by the film Twice Upon A Caravan, and remember seeing horses in it, but I thought a horse would have been a bit too big and scary. 'When the Wales Coast Path opened, I thought the idea of walking right the way around the country was amazing.' She bought Chico, a five-year-old gelding, from a Shropshire dealer who was selling him because he was meant to be a beach donkey but didn't like putting his hooves on sand. The pair of them set off from Miss Engelkamp's home in Aberystwyth early last summer, heading north up the coast and then clockwise the whole way around Wales. With little more than 29 maps, a video camera, and a couple of panniers with such essentials as hoofpicks and fly repellent, the pair made the countryside their home, camping in fields overnight, and clip-clopping through the countryside by day. Miss Engelkamp said: 'Thankfully I met a lot of kind people . along the way and many of them let me stay in their living rooms or . camp in their back gardens. Chico and Miss Engelkamp walked clockwise around Wales after starting in Aberystwyth last May . Route: The pair started in Aberystwyth in May last year and walked clockwise around Wales . Room at the inn?  Miss Engelkamp camped in fields or, if she was lucky, stayed in kind strangers' spare rooms . 'My . mum and dad came along with me for a few days, as did my partner and . sister, but for a lot of the time it was just me and Chico.' People living along the route who read . about her trip on social media sites would get in touch and offer Miss . Engelkamp a bed for the night, something she particularly appreciated when the weather got colder. 'Even . when I hadn't met people I would still manage to stay in camp sites or farmers' fields with their permission,' she said.  'I was overwhelmed . by the support I received.' While the scenery and the kindness of strangers were the high points, the low point was when Chico decided to demonstrate just how stubborn a donkey can be. Miss Engelkamp said: 'Just as we reached Hay on Wye, Chico decided he didn't want to walk up hills. 'That area is full of hills, so it was a complete nightmare.  We'd only walked about a mile from where we woke up, and I spent five hours tugging him to come with me, but he wouldn't budge. 'In the end, I decided to take him off the leading rein and I just walked on, hoping he would follow me of his own accord. 'Thankfully, he did, but not before I'd had time to wonder why on earth I was doing this in the first place.' The trip, which she initially thought might take two or three months ended up taking nearly six, and Miss Engelkamp and Chico trotted back into Aberystwyth just before Christmas. Mane attraction: Trekking with a donkey drew lots of attention, including from these two punks . Better turn back: The route wasn't always suited to Chico, forcing last-minute changes of plan . Little donkey: Chico enjoyed the attentions of some young schoolchildren during his Welsh odyssey . Chico is now resting in a field near Miss Engelkamp's home in Aberystwyth after his six-month trek . Stunning scenery: The journalist and the donkey spent all day in the fresh air, admiring the Welsh countryside . She said: 'By . the end of it I was absolutely shattered. My shoe laces were rotten, so I . had to buy some more, and a few other bits and bobs along the way, but it was totally worth . it. 'I'm . just glad I've shown people that it is possible to go out and have an . adventure on your own doorstep without spending a fortune.' Chico is now putting his hooves up in a field near Miss Engelkamp's house, and she has bought him a friend, another donkey called Florence, to keep him company through the winter. Miss Engelkamp raised £600 for local charities during her travels, and is now hoping to turn the 3,000 photos and 200 hours of video footage she shot along the way into a book and film. She needs to raise £28,000 by the end of the month to do this and already has £17,000 pledged to help her. She said: 'I got 200 hours of video footage along the way so my partner Rhys, who is a film-maker, and I are hoping to put it all together. 'I'm also writing a book about the journey.'

"By . John Stevens . Updated: . 03:09 EST, 1 February 2012 . They say the customer is always right. But not many can claim to being so right they forced a supermarket to change one of its products. Little Lily Robinson can, however, after the three-year-old got Sainsbury's to rename its tiger bread after writing a letter saying it looked more like the markings of a giraffe. Consumer power: Loaves of the newly-named giraffe bread went on sale in Sainsbury's yesterday . Lily, who gave her age as '3½', fired off her comments to the company last May suggesting the name be altered. She received a reply two weeks later from customer manager Chris King who wrote: ‘I think renaming tiger bread giraffe bread is a brilliant idea. ‘It looks much more like the blotches on a giraffe than the stripes on a tiger, doesn’t it?’ Misnomer moan: Lily Robinson's letter to Sainsbury's asking why tiger bread wasn't called giraffe bread . Understanding: This witty and friendly reply from Customer Manager Chris King won him a lot of praise . Viral: Lily's mother posted her daughter's letter and the response on this Facebook campaign page which went on to get more than 140,000 'likes' He went on to explain that the bread had got its name because the first baker who made it a ‘looong time ago thought it looked stripey like a tiger.’ 'Maybe they were a bit silly,’ he added before signing off with his age ’27 1/3’, just as Lily did. The girl’s letter and the supermarket’s reply has now gone viral eight months later with over 150,000 ‘likes’ on Facebook after her mother posted them online. Sainsbury’s last night said it had given in to popular demand and started selling the new loaves from yesterday. What do you think? A look at these images makes it hard to disagree with Lily . A spokesman said: ‘In response to overwhelming customer feedback that our tiger bread has more resemblance to a giraffe, from today we will be changing our tiger bread to giraffe bread and seeing how that goes.’ The supermarket said that Mr King, who has been widely praised by Twitter and Facebook users for his impressive reply, has left the company and is training as a primary school teacher. Tiger bread is typically made by brushing a rice paste onto the surface of a bloomer loaf prior to baking, with the pattern forming as the paste dries and cracks.","Little Lily Robinson said loaf markings looked more like a giraffe than tiger .

"By . Deborah Arthurs In Shanghai . In a glittering event that will (probably) see Cara Delevingne and Suki Waterhouse take Shanghai by storm (VIP details are as yet unconfirmed, but let’s face it, they HAVE to be there...) Burberry tonight officially launches its largest store in Asia. Despite the fact the brand has kept its celebrity guest list and details of the event a closely-guarded secret, the two arrived in Shanghai earlier this week and have been merrily Instagramming photos of themselves around the city ever since. So naturally, we put two and two together...and decided that they will of course be there (more details to follow this evening when the event begins at around 8pm Shanghai time, 1pm GMT). Scroll down for video . It's coming! Cara Delevingne (left) and Suki Waterhouse are living it up in Shanghai ahead of Burberry's new store opening . The event, entitled London In Shanghai, will be held at a shipping yard in the sprawling metropolis, with VIPs dressed in Burberry’s latest Gold collection (exclusive to the new store) bringing a classic Burberry performance to the guests, a mix of private invitees and competition winners. True to Burberry’s position as global leaders in social media and interactivity, they won’t just leave this one to be Snapchatted by a few crowd members either. They have partnered up with China’s largest and fastest-growing social media site, WeChat, with 600m members and counting. Big hitters on the site, like actors Angelababy, Vicki Zhao, Chen Kun and Dou Xiao have up to 80m followers each, dwarfing even Justin Bieber’s loyal Twitter headcount. The store itself, in the gleaming Kerry Centre mall in Shanghai's Jing An district, pays tribute to the UK Regent Street flagship that opened in September 2012. Glittering event: The event, entitled London In Shanghai, will be held at a shipping yard in the sprawling metropolis, with VIPs dressed in Burberry's latest Gold collection . Party people: While it hasn't been confirmed that the supermodels will be attending, Cara and Suki are the stars of the event's teaser video so one can only presume... It is smaller, but the design echoes that of its London counterpart, with a vast, open ‘landing page’ area (like the London store, the intention is that you feel almost as though you have walked into the Burberry.com website, with the digital experience brought to life in a physical space) that plays host to a free-standing screen beaming out catwalk footage and a sweeping Corinthian stone staircase leading up to two more floors. It is not only the largest Burberry store in Asia to date, but it also carries the largest beauty room, watch room and Prorsum collection.

High-tech: The store has a 'landing page' area (like the London store, the intention is that you feel almost as though you have walked into the Burberry.com website . Anything else? Oh yes - interactive mirrors that respond when you approach with a garment to feed you related content - a catwalk show, perhaps, or information about the fabric. The only thing they don’t do is tell you how awesome you look (Burberry - could you look into that for us please?!). The icing on the cake though is an intelligent glass facade that reacts to the weather and can change accordingly. By night it is lit up with the heritage Burberry check across the building; by day it responds to natural light or rain to present itself in different guises - something that 121 Regent Street, with its beautiful old stone exterior, cannot match. Furniture and fittings are all British-designed, and the window display is given over to the Heritage collection - a celebration of the trench distilled down to its very essence, with three classic takes on the trench for women - The Kensington, The Sandringham and The Westminster (men have four) -  each tweaked just slightly to offer a slimmer cut or tapered waist, for example. Interactive: There will be interactive mirrors that respond when you approach with a garment to feed you related content .

Of course, there are those who will just buy both. Sigh. For your own virtual front row seat at the Burberry event tonight, follow Burberry on WeChat, Vine, Twitter and Facebook.

"By . Anna Edwards . Robbie Morgan is accused of demolishing a house after driving in his father's Jeep . A teenage driver demolished a house and knocked down a pedestrian with his dad's Jeep after swerving off the road while speeding, a court heard today. Robbie Morgan, 18, had only been driving for six months when he got behind the the wheel of his father's 4x4 Jeep after he left a party to buy cigarettes. But a court heard Morgan sped off the road in the £30,000 vehicle, before knocking down an 18-year-old girl causing life-threatening injuries, hitting a car and smashing into a house. It knocked down the two-storey extension of the terraced house - leaving the home in ruins. Homeowner Lucie Flowers, 38, only escaped because she was in an upstairs room watching EastEnders. The court heard A-level student Morgan 'put his foot down' in the four litre Jeep Cherokee hitting speeds of up to 60 miles an hour along a quiet village road. Prosecutor Jonathan Howell said: 'Morgan had only been driving for six months. 'He was 17 at the time and was driving a Jeep Cherokee in poor weather conditions - it was dark, wet and windy. 'The car he was driving was too powerful. 'He had been at a sixth form party at a rugby club, he left with two friends and was driving to get a takeaway and some cigarettes. 'They were travelling along the road when Morgan put his foot down - he was driving too fast for the 30mph road. 'A Renault Megan tried to turn safely across the road but Morgan was going too fast. 'He tried to brake but there was not enough distance, he veered to try and avoid the collision. 'But he hit that car and went on going, knocking down a pedestrian who suffered horrific injuries requiring hospitalisation. 'He then ploughed into a house causing extensive damage.' Pictured is Lucie Flowers house, which was damaged so badly the extension needed to be rebuilt . Lucie Flowers only escaped because she was in an upstairs room watching EastEnders, the court heard . It caused damage running 'into five figures' to the home of Mrs Flowers and the extension had to be rebuilt. Morgan had two school friends in the three ton Jeep when it smashed into the house in Nelson, near Caerphilly, South Wales. Friend Yarden Aaron, 18, told the court: 'I felt the car getting faster and faster, it was too fast to be OK on that road. 'We were driving between 50 and 60 miles per hour, I don’t believe he was in control of the car.' Destruction: Robbie Morgan denies dangerous driving, Newport Crown Court heard .

"By . Mark Shand . During my years as a conservationist, I have witnessed many shocking sights: elephants hacked to death for their ivory; rhinos butchered for the supposed healing properties of their horns; and tigers ensnared in vicious traps so that their body parts can be harvested as a cure for impotence in parts of China and South-East Asia. I thought I’d seen just about every example of man’s inhumanity to his fellow creatures. But even I was shocked by the news that Copenhagen Zoo has shot dead a perfectly healthy young giraffe named Marius. Not only shot him, but dissected his corpse in front of an audience of zoo visitors, including many young children. In a final insult, his dismembered body was fed to its resident pride of lions. Marius the giraffe was killed at Copenhagen Zoo yesterday after he was deemed 'surplus to requirements' Keepers shot the infant with a bolt gun before dissecting his body in front of a crowd including children . This came soon after reports that Longleat, one of the Britain’s most-visited safari parks, had killed six of its lions, including a lioness and four of her cubs, apparently because of overcrowding in the enclosures. Employees were said to have wept when they heard what had happened to their beloved animals when there was no obvious reason for them to have been killed. Before the cull was reported at the weekend, no explanation had been given for the lions’ absence when Longleat reopened after a long winter break. There was a sense of wanting to keep the cull quiet. Yet Copenhagen Zoo seems almost to have revelled in the publicity. After Marius had been given a last meal of rye bread, then shot with a bolt gun, the three-hour spectacle of his rather public dissection began. Thousands more watched via the internet. The zoo’s spokesman Tobias Stenbaek Bro declared that he was ‘proud’ the children had been given an unrivalled opportunity to gain  ‘huge understanding of the anatomy of a giraffe’. Meanwhile, the zoo’s scientific director, Bengt Holst, defended the execution, claiming that Marius had been ‘surplus to requirements’. The killing took place despite and offer from Yorkshire Wildlife Park to take the young male in . After the autopsy Marius was fed to the lions, with staff calling the procedure part of the 'circle of life' By this, he meant Marius had been declared too closely related genetically to the other giraffes in its breeding programme. To prevent inbreeding, it had been told by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) that if it kept him, there was a danger of inbreeding and so poor Marius had to go. This was all presented as a regrettable, but ethical necessity. The decision to turn this elegant animal into cat food was justified as part of the ‘cycle of nature’. Yes, it is true that lions eat giraffes in the wild and we shouldn’t shy away from that. But a bolt-gun to the head in a zoo is very far from nature. Marius’s dismemberment on a cold  concrete floor at Copenhagen Zoo is all the more hard to bear since  his death could have been entirely avoidable. The zoo had apparently ruled out castration because it requires sedation, a high-risk procedure for giraffes as they risk breaking their necks when they drop down unconscious. Neither, according to the zoo, was contraception possible for the females with whom Marius was likely to come into contact, since this can damage a female giraffe’s internal organs. Marius’s fate seemed sealed. Then, at the very last minute, an offer to save him was made by the Yorkshire Wildlife Park, which has a state-of-the-art giraffe house and capacity for an extra male. This was rejected by Holst, who argued that any such space should be reserved for a ‘genetically more important’ giraffe. That Holst should reject their offer left Marius’s would-be saviours understandably ‘saddened’ and presumably mystified — as was the rest of the world. Why did the zoo go ahead with the slaughter regardless? And what were the parents of those children taken to watch the subsequent autopsy thinking? Do children really need to see a giraffe’s insides to appreciate what a miracle of  natural engineering such a creature represents? The only lesson I can imagine most children taking away from such an experience is that zoo keepers are only one step away from butchers. We are so very fond of animals in this country that many of us will find ourselves asking why Marius had to die in the first place. As the cull of lions at Longleat suggests, this is a problem that faces zoos all over the world. Will Travers, president of the Born Free Foundation, describes this as the ‘dirty secret’ of many zoos and wildlife parks. Last month, Marius the giraffe was killed, chopped up and fed to lions at Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark . Indeed, at the Copenhagen Zoo there have been previous culls of bears, tigers and zebras, according to one Danish newspaper. Put simply, it is that their breeding programmes are often all too effective. As Longleat has admitted, a recent increase in pregnancies had led to a 40 per cent increase in the number of cubs. With all that youthful energy, keepers noticed ‘excessive violent behaviour’ within their enclosure. In 2011, a whistle-blower at Knowsley Safari Park on Merseyside released images of carcases of animals left to rot by bins after being shot. There is no suggestion that Longleat is similarly irresponsible, but there is no escaping the fact that, like Copenhagen and all zoos, it sometimes breeds more of a particular species than it can realistically keep. In blaming a ‘recent increase in pregnancies’, Longleat seem almost to imply that circumstances were beyond their control, but theirs is a strictly controlled population of lions, so who else but the humans in charge can be blamed for any increase in their lion population? We must also question why zoos are breeding such animals in the first place. There is no question that they are often involved in invaluable conservation work. For example, Bedfordshire’s Woburn Safari Park has been successful in preserving the rare and beautiful Pere David deer, which were virtually extinct in their native China. Breeding programmes which produce too many offspring are to blame for extra culls (Marius circled) The news of Marius' demise came just a day after it was revealed a lioness and four of her cubs were put down at Longleat (pictured are lions and cubs from the same pride) But when it comes to animals such as lions, what is the point of breeding them when there is no realistic chance they can ever be released back into the wild because they are so used to being fed by their human keepers that they would be unable to fend for themselves? The same is true of elephants. There are seven specimens of this magnificent species at Copenhagen Zoo, which boasts that its Asian elephants are kept in a grand enclosure and house designed by the renowned architect Norman Foster. They say the architecture provides ‘these magnificent animals with a stimulating environment’. I have never been to Copenhagen Zoo, but it apparently occupies a site of only 27 acres and, since elephants range huge distances — sometimes hundreds of miles — in the wild, it is clearly anything but a natural environment for them. Those who defend zoos argue that they make such animals accessible to people who might otherwise never get to see them. But is our natural human desire to gawk really sufficient reason to imprison them in habitats and conditions so far from those in which they should live out their lives? And then to cut them into pieces in front of small children? I will never forget the experience of taking my daughter to London Zoo when she was eight years old. The visit was swiftly cut short when she began crying at the sight of the animals in their cages. I can only imagine her trauma had she witnessed the recent events in Copenhagen and at Longleat. The Safari park, built in the ground of Longleat House, Wiltshire (pictured), said a 'population increase' which lead a rise in violent behaviour was behind the decision to put the animals down . These travesties of all that is natural are even more unfortunate given that London is about to host an international summit on conserving endangered species, due to start this Thursday. It is a vital opportunity to address the illegal trade in wildlife parts, which is worth an estimated £12 billion a year. The fate of Marius and the Longleat lions reminds us that we must also look to the welfare of those species supposedly being protected in zoos much closer to home. Animals are not here for our entertainment, to be made into trinkets or to be killed on a whim to ‘educate’ a group of schoolchildren. Surely we should be teaching children that animals are worth more alive than dead. Otherwise what hope is there for the future of the species that are rapidly disappearing from our planet. Mark Shand is chairman of Elephant Family, a charity that campaigns for the conservation and welfare of Asian elephants and all animals that share their habitat.","Marius the giraffe was killed at Copenhagen Zoo yesterday .

"By . Hugo Gye . Two men have been arrested on suspicion of historic sex offences as part of the investigation sparked by the allegations against shamed DJ Jimmy Savile. The suspects, aged 64 and 74, were arrested separately today at two different addresses in south London. Scotland Yard said tonight that both men were bailed until early January 2014 pending further inquiries. Arrests: Two more people have been arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, which was set up in response to the crimes of Jimmy Savile, pictured . They are the 15th and 16th people arrested as part of the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree. The investigation was set up last year after it emerged that Savile had got away with abusing dozens of children over the decades before his death in 2011. It has been divided into three strands - allegations involving only Savile, claims relating to Savile and other people, and those involving only others. The two men arrested today are being held in connection with allegations from the 'others' strand of the investigation. Suspect: David Smith, a former BBC chauffeur, has been found dead shortly before he was due to face trial . Many of the other people arrested as part of Operation Yewtree have been high-profile figures from the world of entertainment. They include Dave Lee Travis, Max Clifford and Rolf Harris, all of whom are set to stand trial on charges of historic sex offences. Comedian Jim Davidson was also arrested under Operation Yewtree, but was later told he would not face any charges. Yesterday David Smith, a former BBC driver and convicted paedophile, was found dead at his London home on the day he was due to appear in court over allegations related to Yewtree. He is thought to have killed himself on the eve of his trial.

"By . Associated Press . Dallas Mavericks point guard Raymond Felton pleaded guilty Wednesday in a New York gun case, taking a plea deal that involved admitting a felony but spares him jail. Felton pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a firearm. He admitted he knowingly had a large-capacity ammunition magazine and a semi-automatic pistol without a license. Dallas Mavericks basketball player Raymond Felton pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a firearm . 'Are those charges true?' Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Larry Stephen asked. 'Yes, sir,' Felton said, later adding in a soft voice: 'I apologize. I realize what I did was wrong.' He was immediately sentenced to 500 hours of community service and ordered to pay a $5,000 fine. Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Jonathan Rebold said Felton will be allowed to do the service outside New York. If he complies, the case will be closed without jail time or probation. 'At this point, Raymond is looking forward to starting the next chapter of his life and focusing on success in Dallas,' his lawyer, James Walden, said after court. The criminal case arose last winter, as Felton grappled with the breakup of his marriage and navigated a struggling season with the New York Knicks. He was traded to Dallas last month, two days after his plea plan was announced. The team declined to comment Wednesday. About a week after Felton's law student wife filed for divorce, her attorney brought a loaded semi-automatic handgun to a police precinct and said it was Felton's and she wanted it out of the house, authorities said. Walden has said Felton never threatened anyone with the gun. Felton admitted he knowingly had a large-capacity ammunition magazine and a pistol without a license. He was immediately sentenced to 500 hours of community service and ordered to pay a $5,000 fine . After police contacted Felton, he turned himself in shortly after a Mavericks-Knicks game at Madison Square Garden. Felton was charged under a state law that bans many large-capacity ammunition magazines. Prosecutors said Felton's could hold about 20 rounds. The NBA, which has said it is monitoring the case, had no immediate comment Wednesday. The league usually waits until criminal cases against players are resolved before deciding whether to impose any fine or suspension. Felton, 30, was a star at the University of North Carolina and was the fifth pick of the 2005 NBA draft. Besides Dallas and New York, he's played for the Charlotte Bobcats, Denver Nuggets and Portland Trail Blazers. Last season, Felton missed 17 games while battling injuries and averaged a career-low 9.7 points as the Knicks went 37-45 and missed the playoffs.","Felton pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a firearm .

"By . Steve Nolan . Manchester United star Paul Scholes had his £30,000 car stolen after he left the engine running while defrosting it on his driveway yesterday. The 38-year-old former England midfielder had gone back inside his home while ice melted on the windscreen of his Chevrolet Captiva LT 2 Estate. When he came back out of the house between 7.45am and 8am the car had gone. Victim: Paul Scholes, pictured with his wife Claire and during his Manchester United playing days, had left the engine running when his Chevrolet Captiva LT 2 was stolen on Monday morning . Greater Manchester Police confirmed that they are now investigating the theft from Scholes' home in Oldham. A spokesman for the force said: 'Police are investigating after a car was stolen while the owner was defrosting the vehicle. 'The grey Chevrolet Estate was stolen from the drive of a house in the Greenfield area of Oldham. 'Inquiries to locate the car are ongoing.' The force also issued a warning to other motorists to beware opportunist thieves while defrosting their cars. Chevrolet sponsor United and the Reds' squad were offered a choice of their vehicles as part of the multi-million pound deal. But Reds manager Sir Alex Ferguson banned his young stars from owning the manufacturer's Corvette model, which can hit top speeds of 195mph. It is not the first time that Scholes and his family have fallen victim to thieves. Stolen: Scholes car is a Chevrolet Captiva 2.4 LT like the one pictured . In 2007 a gang of raiders armed with a knife stole a car belonging to his parents car after breaking into their home in Middleton, Greater Manchester. After that incident, his dad Stewart said: 'My wife went down to confront them. She screamed at me and I ran down to see them waving knives. 'They were shouting what they were going to do if I didn't give them the keys, so I just said ""there's the keys, leave us alone"".' Scholes was said at the time to be 'disgusted' by the raid.","The former England star's Chevrolet Captiva LT 2 Estate was stolen .

Fat-cat Greeks have secretly shifted more than €228billion euros out of their country's crisis-hit banks and into accounts in Switzerland, according to a report. The big money is fleeing the country as rich Greeks fear the possible re-introduction of their old currency, the drachma, would instantly halve the value of their euros if they are left in Greek banks.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A high school student who suffers from multiple sclerosis has turned the condition into an advantage on the track field - because she cannot feel pain in her legs. Since Kayla Montgomery, 18, from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, was diagnosed with the condition three years ago, she has gone on to become one of the fastest high school runners in the country. The condition blocks nerve signals from her legs to . her brain, meaning she cannot sense pain as she maintains a fast pace - giving her a bizarre athletic advantage. But exercise also causes her to go numb below the waist, meaning that she must continue moving or she will lose control of her body. At the finish line, her coach has to get ready to catch her. Scroll down for video . Fighter: Kayla Montgomery, 18, is one of the fastest high school track athletes in the country despite having multiple sclerosis. The condition blocks nerve signals from her legs to her brain so she cannot feel pain . In action: Exercise makes her legs numb so Kayla must keep momentum to stop from falling over . 'When I finish, it feels like there's nothing underneath me,' Montgomery, a senior at Mount Tabor High School, told the New York Times. 'I start out feeling normal and then my legs gradually go numb. I've trained myself to think about other things while I race, to get through. But when I break the motion, I can't control them and I fall.' After she falls at the finish line, her coach scoops her up and takes her to the side of the track where her teammates ice her legs until she can feel them again. It is a bizarre routine that has seen great success in a short time. When she first began running, she was one of the slowest on her team. But whereas a five-kilometer race used to take her 24:29, by last November, she had completed it in 17:22. Welcoming committee: At the end of every race, her coach and teammates catch her and carry her off . Pained: Teammates ice Kayla's legs until she regains feeling and can get back on her feet on her own . Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system. MS affects the brain and the nervous system and destroys myelin sheath layers between the nerves in the brain and spinal cord which stops impulses being carried around the body. It can cause blindness, slurred speech, muscle weakness and a loss of coordination. There is no known cause or cure for MS, which is twice as common in women than men. Between two and five per cent of cases are discovered in children under 16. It typically worsens during a 'flare' in symptoms - what doctors call an exacerbation. These can last anywhere from a couple days to a couple months and quicken the disease's progress in destroying the protective barrier around a person's nervous system. It is not known what causes MS. Environmental factors, exposure to infections and viruses and genes are all thought to play a part. And last month, the teenager won the North Carolina state title in the 3,200 meters. She completed the route in 10 minutes 43 seconds, placing her 21st in the country. Next week, she hopes to break 17 minutes as she competes in a five-kilometer race at the national indoor track championships in New York. Her coach said that he was immediately struck by her determination. 'When she was diagnosed, she said to me, ""Coach, I don’t know how much time I have left, so I want to run fast - don't hold back"",' said Patrick Cromwell. 'That's when I said, ""Wow, who are you?""' Montgomery was diagnosed with the condition when she could not feel her legs following soccer practice and track meets three years ago. Her coach initially dismissed her numbness as normal but when it remained, he said he knew it wasn't usual fatigue and Montgomery visited a doctor, who discovered lesions on her brain and spine. But following treatment, she returned to the track. Support: Her coach, Patrick Cromwell, said he had been stunned by her determination after her diagnoses . No giving up: Kayla, pictured saying a prayer before a meet, left, says she forces herself to fight on . She knows that it's only a matter of time before MS - which does not have a cure - puts her in wheelchair. But until then, she's not giving up. Sometimes she has been particularly tested, such as during a state cross-country meet last year when she tripped on another runner's foot while leading and fell to the ground. She was unable to get back to her legs and have to crawl to a nearby fence to help her get back on her feet - and she ran into 10th place. 'I make myself do it,' she said. 'I tell . myself, ""I know you're tired and you can't feel anything and it's hard . but you're going to finish this."" And then I do.' While she claims that some universities never called her back after she told them she had MS, Lipscomb University in Tennessee offered her a scholarship and she will start there this fall.","Kayla Montgomery was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 3 years ago and decided to run track while she still could .

"By . Associated Press . The politically connected former CEO of a prominent New York City charity was sentenced to prison Wednesday for helping to steal more than $9 million from the anti-poverty organization. William Rapfogel, who once headed the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, will serve a term of 40 months to 10 years in a case that rattled New York's political circles. Authorities linked the decades-long theft to campaign contributions, and both the charity and Rapfogel himself have deep political ties. William Rapfogel, who formerly led the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, was sentenced Wednesday to a term of 40 months to 10 years in prison for helping to steal more than $9 million from the anti-poverty organization . His wife, who's not accused of any involvement in his scheme, is Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's chief of staff. 'I deeply regret harming the . organization that I worked 21 years to build and that I hurt and . disappointed many people,' Rapfogel said as he was sentenced. 'I have . tried hard to make amends, but I also recognize that what I did was . seriously wrong and that I will continue to pay a steep price for my . actions. I am terribly sorry.' His wife, Judy, and other supporters looked on as Rapfogel was led out of court, uncuffed, to start serving his term. Rapfogel, who pleaded guilty in April to grand larceny and other charges, also has paid $3 million in restitution. Rapfogel became the executive director of the Met Council, as it is known, in 1992. He soon joined several conspirators in conniving to overcharge the charity for insurance so they could pocket the difference, state prosecutors said. 'He conspired with others to steal over $9 million, and personally stole over $1 million, from the people who needed it most, to benefit himself and his lifestyle,' Assistant Attorney General Gary Fishman said at the sentencing. Rapfogel used $27,000 of that money to pay a contractor working on his home, and he had more than $400,000 in cash hidden in his home when investigators searched it in August 2013, authorities said. Video Source YouTube . Rapfogel's wife Judy Rapfogel said she knew nothing about his misdeeds . Insurance company owner Joseph Ross and former Met Council Executive Director David Cohen also pleaded guilty in the scheme. As part of it, Rapfogel and Cohen . directed Ross to use money reaped from the insurance scam to make . donations to candidates Rapfogel believed could help the Met Council, . the attorney general has said. No candidates have been accused of wrongdoing. After the allegations emerged, several New York City Democratic mayoral candidates decided to return contributions related to the insurance company, mostly received years ago. Among them was now-Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose campaign gave back $1,650 given in the 2009 election cycle. Both Silver and Rapfogel's wife have said they knew nothing about Rapfogel's misdeeds, and no official made any connection between the donations and Silver's office. 'My heart goes out to the family,' Silver said in a statement Wednesday. Judy Rapfogel declined to comment as she left court.

"By . Associated Press . The son of late Penn State football coach Joe Paterno has sued the university over his dismissal from its coaching staff two years ago, saying he has been unfairly linked to the Jerry Sandusky child molestation scandal. Former assistant coach Jay Paterno and another former assistant, Bill Kenney, filed a federal lawsuit in Philadelphia on Monday, seeking more than $1 million. They have also requested a statement from the university saying they did nothing wrong related to Sandusky, who was convicted of abusing several boys, some on campus. Jay Paterno, son of former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno, seen speaking during a memorial service for Joe Paterno . Paterno and Kenney said in the lawsuit . that they and other coaches at Penn State were let go in early 2012 'at . the height of the Sandusky scandal's dark shroud and without any attempt . whatsoever by Penn State to preserve the reputations of these guiltless . individuals.' Joe Paterno was fired as the Nittany Lions' coach before the end of the 2011 season, and his assistants took over for the last few games. Bill O'Brien, who was hired as coach in January 2012, replaced much of Paterno's staff. In response to the claims in the lawsuit, Penn State spokeswoman Lisa Powers said it's common practice for incoming head coaches to pick their own assistants. She declined to comment further. Jay Paterno was on the coaching staff for 17 seasons, mostly as quarterbacks coach, and Kenney spent 23 years as an offensive assistant and recruiting coordinator. Former Penn State University assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky pictured leaving the Centre County Courthouse in January 2013 . Their lawsuit says Penn State's consent decree with the NCAA over the Sandusky scandal and its commissioned report into the matter led by former FBI director Louis Freeh have made it impossible for them to get hired for comparable positions in college or professional sports or in the media. Kenney is now an assistant at Western Michigan University, and Paterno is a freelance sports writer and consultant with a book coming out soon. Their lawsuit says they have been deprived of their constitutional liberty and property interest without due process of law, alleges intentional interference with contractual relations, says a civil conspiracy has occurred and charges that Penn State violated state wage law. Joe Paterno died of lung cancer in January 2012, two months after Sandusky, his former longtime defensive coordinator, was charged with child sexual abuse. Sandusky was convicted of dozens of criminal counts and is serving a 30- to 60-year prison sentence but maintains his innocence, acknowledging he showered with boys but denying he molested them.

"By . Associated Press . Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers has said he'll resign if Donald Sterling remains owner, it was revealed in court this week during a legal battle over who should take ownership of the team. Clippers owner Donald Sterling has filed a new lawsuit in his attempt to retain the team and derail a potential $2 billion sale. The lawsuit filed on Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court names estranged wife Shelly Sterling, the NBA and Commissioner Adam Silver, saying they committed fraud and violated corporate law in their attempt to sell the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, pictured in 2011, is suing his estranged wife, the NBA and Commissioner Adam Silver . The suit lists many arguments already being heard in a probate court trial on the legality of the Ballmer deal. They include Sterling's assertion that he's the team's sole owner, that his wife deceived him in persuading him to get mental examinations and that the NBA and Ballmer colluded to deprive him of his rights as owner. Attorneys for the defendants couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Coach Doc Rivers has said he'll resign, the team's interim CEO testified, saying such a move would be a 'disaster' for the franchise. Clippers coach Doc Rivers (pictured earlier this year) said he will resign if Donald Sterling remains owner, a move which the team's CEO called a 'disaster' 'If Mr. Sterling continues as owner, he does not want to continue as coach,' Richard Parsons said in court on Tuesday, recounting recent conversations with Rivers. His testimony was a rare foray into the basketball side of the Clippers at a probate-court trial that has focused on the narrow question of whether Sterling's wife, Shelly, can sell the team for $2 billion to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer as the NBA looks to force Donald Sterling from the league over racist statements. Shelly Sterling is scheduled to return to the stand on Wednesday as the final witness, with the two sides returning for closing arguments next week. Parsons, a former chief executive at Time Warner and Citigroup who took over leadership of the Clippers in May during the media blitz surrounding the banishment of Sterling, said under questioning by Ballmer's lawyer that the departure of Rivers would 'accelerate the death spiral' of the Clippers. 'If Doc were to leave, that would be a disaster,' Parsons said. 'Doc is the father figure, the one who leads.' Team representatives said Rivers had no comment on the testimony. Parsons said he fears there would also be an exodus of key players, including team captain Chris Paul, who heads the NBA players' union. The judge stopped Parsons from giving an account of his conversations with Paul when an NBA lawyer objected over privacy issues. Parsons said corporate sponsors and season ticket holders would likely be the next to leave. 'If your coach leaves, if your players don't want to play with you, what do you have?' Parsons asked. 'If your sponsors leave and the fans leave, it's going to spiral down and down.' Parsons also said he doesn't believe that anyone will offer as much money for the team as Ballmer. That opinion was seconded by witness Anwar Zakkour, an investment banker who helped broker the deal for Ballmer's purchase and said he never expected a bid so big. The lawsuit filed by Donald Sterling on Tuesday names his estranged wife Shelly Sterling, the NBA and Commissioner Adam Silver (right), saying they committed fraud in their attempt to sell the Clippers . Explaining why Ballmer would have bid over the value of the team, Zakkour said, 'It was a trophy asset.' 'This is the highest price ever achieved for a sports team,' he said. 'However way you count it, this is an amazing price that anyone should be satisfied with.' Parsons and Zakkour said that if the NBA seized the team and put it up for auction, the price would drop because there would be less certainty about the team's future. Outside court, Sterling's lawyer, Bobby Samini, said the billionaire would persist in his opposition to the sale because 'he feels he was wronged' by the NBA. 'He has no desire to destroy the team,' Samini said. 'He is fighting to protect his rights.' Later on Tuesday, Sterling fired off another legal volley, filing a new lawsuit against his wife, the NBA and league Commissioner Adam Silver that alleges fraud, breach of contract, unfair business practices and infliction of emotional distress. He claimed, among other things, that he was tricked into being examined by psychiatrists to establish whether he was mentally competent. The NBA declined to comment on the new lawsuit. Shelly Sterling's attorney called it a 'frivolous, last ditch act of desperation' in a statement. 'This action shows once more how obsessed he is with ruining a record-setting $2 billion sale of the Los Angeles Clippers,' attorney Pierce O'Donnell said, 'a sale that would solve the problems his racist rant started three months ago'.","Coach Doc Rivers has said he'll resign, .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 17-year-old skater has died after accidentally stumbling onto train tracks into the path of a train, police said. Tyler Bailey was 'partying' with four friends when he was struck near the Dundas Street underpass in Toronto, Canada about 7pm Monday. The teen's grief-stricken mother said she'd spoken to her son only moments before the tragedy. 'The last thing he said to me was, ‘Bye, mom, I love you’,' Shelley Bailey told Toronto Sun. 'That’s how we ended all our conversations. I’m just totally devastated, this doesn’t feel real.' Scroll down for video . Tragic: Skater Tyler Bailey, 17, was 'partying' with four friends by the train tracks when he was fatally struck by a train in Toronto on Monday night . The mother-of-three described her son as bright and happy: 'Ever since he was little, everybody that met him loved him so much.' Tyler's 20-year-old sister, Chantelle, said: 'My little brother was an amazing child and he did nothing but make people smile and laugh and make smiley faces.' Police, who described Tyler's death as 'avoidable', said he'd walked close to the tracks. His friends, seeing the approaching train, called for him to get out of the way, but he tripped onto the tracks and was hit. 'There was just no time for anyone to react,' Detective-Constable Stu Parsons, of the Traffic Services Division, said. A witness told the Toronto Sun she heard teenaged boys 'having a good time' on the tracks before the accident. 'They were being very loud and partying,' the woman, who asked not to be identified, said. 'I was actually quite scared for them because I knew rush hour traffic was coming.'

"By . Associated Press . Updated: . 17:06 EST, 12 January 2012 . A judge has declared Natalee Holloway legally dead . A judge in Alabama has declared Natalee Holloway dead, more than six years after the teenager vanished on the Caribbean island of Aruba. Judge Alan King announced his decision at a hearing in his Birmingham courtroom Thursday attended by the missing woman's divorced parents, David and Beth Holloway. David Holloway told the judge in September he believed his daughter had died and he wanted to stop payments on her medical insurance and use her $2,000 college fund to help her younger brother. Thursday's hearing was set before a . suspect questioned in Holloway's disappearance, Dutchman Joran van der . Sloot, pleaded guilty Wednesday in Peru to the 2010 murder of a woman in . Lima. Natalee Holloway . disappeared on a high school graduation trip May 30, 2005. She was last . seen leaving a bar with van der Sloot early that day. Her body was never . found, and the case garnered intense media scrutiny and international . attention. Judge King acted on a petition by David Holloway to have the missing 18-year-old declared dead. Her mother originally objected, but her lawyer, Charlie DeBardeleben, said she now had no objection. Natalee Holloway's parents were divorced in 1993 and Beth Holloway sat in the back row of the courtroom, mostly staring at her hands in her lap during the afternoon hearing. She declined comment when she entered the courtroom. Admission: Joran van der Sloot pleaded guilty to murdering Stephany Flores in Lima, Peru, but has not admitted a role in Miss Holloway's disappearance . Mark White, an attorney for Dave Holloway, told the judge just before he announced his decision, that there was no evidence that Holloway was alive. Stephany Flores Ramirez, 21, was found murdered at the Miraflores Hotel Tac in Lima, Peru, in April 2010 . 'Despite all that, no evidence has been . found Natalee Holloway is alive,' he told the judge, noting that . exhaustive searches, blanket international media coverage and even the . offer of rewards had turned up nothing new. Judge King had ruled in September that Dave Holloway had met the legal presumption of death for his daughter and it was up to someone to prove she didn't die on a high school graduation trip. He set the hearing for Thursday to allow time for anyone to come forward. Dave Holloway said he was expecting to hear the judge would declare his daughter dead because he had no doubt about that. 'We've been dealing with her death for the last six and a half years,' he said. He added that the judge's order closes one chapter in a long story, but added: 'We've still got a long way to go to get justice.' In Peru, Van der Sloot, 24, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to the murder of a 21-year-old woman he met at a Lima casino. Stephany Flores was killed five years to the day after Natalee Holloway, an 18-year-old from the wealthy Birmingham suburb of Mountain Brook, disappeared. She was last seen leaving a bar with van der Sloot. Not closure: David Holloway, left, asked a judge to declare his daughter dead but said the legal action changes little . Beth Holloway's attorney, John Q. Kelly, had said earlier this week: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with . the Flores family during these extraordinarily painful and public . proceedings. We hope they find some measure of privacy, inner strength . and peace as time goes by.' Mr . Kelly said that once van der Sloot is sentenced on Friday, he expected . U.S. authorities would try to bring him to Alabama to face pending . federal charges accusing him of extorting $25,000 from Beth Holloway to . reveal the location of her body daughter's body in Aruba. Kelly went to . Aruba for the revelation, but van der Sloot did not deliver.","Miss Holloway was last seen May 30, 2005 leaving an island bar with Joran ver der Sloot .

The dead body was found in the dumpster, so we're looking at all the access points to the dumpster... throughout the building,' he said. He added the investigation will become clearer once Lorain County Coroner's office completes an autopsy.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A prisoner gouged out his eyes in protest at the sweltering conditions inside his cell, it was claimed today. The unnamed man is said to have inflicted the horrifying injuries on himself at HMP Nottingham on Monday evening as temperatures reached about 25C. It is thought he was protesting at the temperature in his cell. However, the Ministry of Justice have today denied this was the case. An ambulance then took the man, believed . to be just days from his release date, to the Queen’s Medical Centre . hospital in Nottingham. A prisoner at HMP Nottingham, pictured, is said to have gouged out his own eyes in protest at sweltering conditions. It is thought the unnamed man inflicted the injuries as temperatures reached 25C on Monday . This morning, the hospital would not confirm the inmate's condition. Prison bosses say they have now launched an investigation. A number of inmates were thought to be protesting at conditions across the jail when the shocking incident took place. A source inside the jail said: 'Somebody cut their eyes out of their face. He was protesting. The . heat is just so high. Prisoners simply can’t deal with it. 'They need to . let some air in the room. It’s only going to get worse.' Prisoners who were released from the jail today described what they had heard. Graham Doughty, who was held on the same wing as the man, said: 'I was told he got a blade out of a razor and was gouging his eyes out. 'There was blood all over the place. We heard the screams about 7.30pm, but nobody came until 8pm. When they came, they came en masse, and he was pulling his other eye out as well.' East Midlands Ambulance Service . confirmed it was called to the scene at 6.43pm to treat a male . patient and that a prison nurse was already helping the man. Police . also confirmed they were called to the jail at 8pm the same evening to a . report of an injured man and, following inquiries, 'it was established that no crime had taken place'. A statement from the Ministry of Justice said: 'A prisoner at HMP Nottingham was taken to hospital following an act of self-harm. 'Staff reacted quickly and paramedics attended. No other prisoners were involved. 'The prison is investigating the incident and police were informed as a matter of course.' Frances Crook, Chief Executive of the . Howard League for Penal Reform, was critical of conditions in prisons today. She said: 'Prison windows allow virtually no . ventilation so temperatures in tiny cells holding two or three men soar . to unbearable levels and the stench from the open toilet is . overwhelming. 'Men are caged in these cells for up to 23 hours a day. 'We have reverted to prison conditions of the eighteenth century.' The incident comes after a critical report of the Category B prison was released by the Independent Monitoring Board. The organisation’s annual review said a 25 per cent cut in budget had led to the loss of 140 officers despite the capacity of the prison being upped in the same period. The IMB said the changes in operations were 'unsustainable' and would lead to 'more prisoner disruption and a further reduction in already low staff morale' in the future. It said prisoners were being stopped from having showers, work and education programmes were being cancelled, prisoners with serious mental health problems were being kept in cells formerly used for solitary confinement and Muslim inmates’ food had been contaminated with pork products. Speaking earlier this week, a Prison Service spokesman said: 'Staffing levels at HMP Nottingham are at an appropriate level to ensure the prison runs safely. 'Our approach to staffing levels has been agreed with the unions and puts prison officers back in frontline roles where they are most needed.' But a woman visiting the prison said the conditions were 'dreadful.' She added: 'It is disgusting. They hardly leave their cells, being in there at least 23 hours a day if not 24. 'They can have as little as one shower a week and exercise twice a week, which they are meant to have every day. That place is just horrible.'","HMP Nottingham prisoner 'pulled out his eyes due to sweltering conditions'

"By . Chris Pleasance . Border officials have been accused of pointing a loaded gun at a Boy Scout's head while the child was on a camping trip. According to Troop Leader Jim Fox, officials also threatened another boy with arrest, ten years in jail, and a $10,000 fine after he took a picture of them. The incident happened as Mid-Iowa Boy Scout Troop 111 were attempting to cross the border between Canada and Alaska. Scout leader Jim Fox (front) says border officials threatened to arrest one of his troop when he took a picture as they were crossing from Canada into Alaska, then pointed a loaded gun at another boy's head . Mr Fox said the incident began after one of the children took a picture of the border guards, at which point the officer threatened him with arrest, saying it was a felony offence . According to WCCI TV, four vans full of Scouts were travelling through the crossing as part of a 23-day trip when one boy attempted to take a picture of the guards. Fox said: 'The agent immediately confiscated his camera, informed him he would be arrested, fined possibly $10,000 and 10 years in prison.' The guard informed Fox that taking a picture of a border official was a felony offence, then ordered all the vehicles to be pulled over to one side to be searched. Fox said he didn't complain as he did not want the situation to escalate further, but as another boy was taking camping gear down from the top of a truck, a second border guard pulled his gun. Speaking about the boy, Fox added: 'He hears a snap of a holster, turns around, and here’s this agent, both hands on a loaded pistol, pointing at the young man’s head.' The troop, which included 17 other Scouts and three volunteers, was held for another four hours before they were finally allowed to go on their way, with Fox saying the situation left them all afraid. But despite suffering through a terrifying ordeal, Scouting official Charles Vonderheid said the children should view the experience as a valuable lesson in 'civics'. He added that it was every scout's mission to become a good citizen, and that it was important for boys to learn to follow the rules. In total the group of 18 Scouts and four volunteers were held for four hours while border guards searched them . Fox, meanwhile, says the crossing incident has left him feeling deeply angry and upset. He added: 'I am outraged by that fact that you have 18 boy scouts that want to come home [getting stopped], yet we have southern borders and border protection but it's like a sieve.' According to regulations, pictures of federal facilities are allowed 'only with written permission of an authorized official of the occupying agency concerned.' However, it is unclear whether that also applies to federal buildings and agents clearly visible in public places, which would be protected under constitutional law. The law gives people the right to photograph anything visible in a public space in which a person is legally present as long as the building or people are in plain sight, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. A spokesman for the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said that the agency are aware of the story, but are not commenting at this time.","Mid-Iowa Scout Troop 111 were taking part in 23-day camping trip .

The chat show panelist put up the structure to provide a backdrop for her nuptials - which were held at her home in Edge, Gloucestershire, on Saturday. The television star's new husband Paul Jessup first submitted a planning application to Painswick Parish Council to build the gazebo in April this year. Former Loose Women star Lisa Maxwell has angered her neighbours after erecting a wooden gazebo near to her home (grounds pictured) for her wedding.

The television star tweeted after the event that some neighbours had attended the nuptials  - and that 'only a few had complained' about the work .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Children in Commonwealth countries today struggled to identify the Queen, pictured with the Glasgow games baton last year, with some thinking she was Angela Merkel . You would think the Queen has one of the most recognisable faces in the world. But when a group of schoolchildren in Kenya were shown a picture of the royal, they couldn't identify her - and instead thought she was German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Others speaking with journalist Gabriel Gatehouse thought the Queen - who is Head of the Commonwealth - was Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff. Later, BBC Radio 4's Andrew North interviewed pupils from Delhi, India. The journalist showed several groups of children pictures of both Queen Elizabeth II and the Prince of Wales. He then asked them: 'Do you recognise these two people.' Many simply replied: 'No.' Others, however, did do a little better - managing to correctly name the Queen but not Prince Charles while a few could correctly name both the royals. One even said they thought their country shouldn't compete in the Commonwealth Games 'as it has only a symbolic relevance in the country'. The footage, played on the Today Show this morning, comes just hours before the Queen will officially open the Glasgow 2014 Games. A crowd of 40,000 people are expected to gather at the city's Celtic Park for the ceremony - which will begin at 9pm BST. Organisers say they are expecting up to a billion people around the world to watch the event - which will include performances from Rod Stewart and Susan Boyle. About 4,500 sportspeople from the 71 competing nations and territories will parade through the venue in the event that organisers claim will be 'uniquely Glaswegian and Scottish.' The Queen is due to read out a message that was hidden inside a Commonwealth Games Baton at Buckingham Palace in October last year.

The 38-year-old added: 'As soon as the opening ceremony starts, I think people are going to be swept away with the excitement.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Maybe even the criminals enjoy a slower pace of life in the countryside. Because this new police vehicle, a tractor with a top speed of just 20mph, would not be much use in pursuit. Unless, that is, the chase takes place across a muddy field. With flashing blue lights and police paintwork on the bonnet, Britain’s most rural police force yesterday unveiled their new patrol vehicle. Dyfed Powys Police officers stand next to the new vehicle they'll use to chase criminals, a tractor . Dyfed Powys Police hope the machine will improve their relationshops with rural communities in Mid and West Wales. Inspector Tim Davies said: ‘We're very impressed with this new piece of kit. ‘Engagement with our rural communities is important to us, and we want people to come and discuss any concerns they may have about rural crime.’ Officers will use the vehicle to visit farmers working their land and to access more remote parts of their policing area. Manchester police are considering buying two Segways to give officers 'greater visibility and accessibility' The tractor, it is hoped, will help police fight back against criminals who target farmers for their fuel supplies, livestock and high-tech machinery. In the last year thefts of farm machinery doubled and rural crime cost the UK economy more than £40million a year. Dyfed-Powys Police have set up a centre of excellence to improve rural policing after discovering the countryside was being neglected compared to cities. The force covers the largest police area in England and Wales – but has only 1,183 officers, the third smallest in England and Wales. The New Holland tractor, on loan to the force from a farm machinery company, was unveiled at the Royal Welsh Agricultural Show in Builth Wells, Mid Wales. Schoolboy Morgan Thompson, 13, of Merthyr Tydfil, said: ‘It is awesome – it may not be fast but it would frighten anyone being chased by it. ‘It looks great when the lights are flashing.’","The tractor will be used to reduce thefts of farm machinery and supplies .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Frank Lampard (pictured in 2001) is facing a backlash from US soccer fans after a New York tabloid republished details of him abusing US tourists in the wake of 9/11 . Frank Lampard is facing a backlash from US soccer fans after a newspaper ran an article reminding people of a 2001 incident during which he allegedly mocked tourists stranded by the 9/11 attacks. During the incident on September 12, Lampard and three team mates allegedly stripped, swore and vomited in front of US tourists stranded at Heathrow after flights were grounded following the attacks by terrorists on the World Trade Center. The former Chelsea star and his fellow players were docked two weeks' wages over the incident, though the 9/11 attacks were not specifically mentioned by the footballers. The New York Daily News ran the article yesterday, under the headline: 'British soccer star poised to join NY team once mocked Americans after 9/11 attacks.' The story was published just as Lampard, 36, is reportedly finalising a deal with New York Football Club. The incident took place at Heathrow airport after Chelsea's game against Levski Sofia of Bulgaria was suspended as a mark of respect for those killed on 9/11. Lampard and other players reportedly went on a five-hour drinking binge before returning to the Posthouse hotel where they abused guests. According to The Telegraph, a manager at Heathrow's Post House hotel said: 'They were utterly disgusting. They just didn't seem to care about what had happened. 'We had a lot of Americans here and were simply trying to comfort them in their hour of need. Meanwhile these men were laughing and joking, taking off their clothes and abusing our guests.' The players were fined two weeks' wages, around £130,000, with the proceeds donated to victims of the tragedy. Scroll down for video . On NYCFC fan forums, supporters reacted angrily to the news, with one called Tom saying: 'This is a poorly thought out signing. If it happens. 'Trying to appeal to the city aspect of New York, and bringing in a guy whose ""youthful gaffe"" was about as appalling to New Yorkers as it gets, is tone deaf to say the least.' Lampard is thought to be finalising a deal that would see him transfer to New York City Football Club for the start of the new MLS season in April 2015 after he departed from former club Chelsea . Yankeedom added: 'If you're old enough to get drunk and abuse American tourists regarding something as tragic as 9/11, hours after it happened, then you are old enough to deserve any ill-will people will have toward you.' According to some reports, Lampard could sign for NYCFC as early as this week, though he will be unable to play until the start of the 2015 season when they will debut inside the Yankee Stadium. Until then he may play for Melbourne FC, New York's sister club.","Lampard was fined in 2001 after abusing US tourists at Heathrow hotel .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Michael Hayes, 20, pictured, grabbed a woman police officer's bottom 'as a joke' as he walked through central London . A drunken man who grabbed a woman police officer's bottom in the street 'as a joke' was convicted of sexual assault today. Michael Hayes, 20, of Wallington, Surrey, molested the woman as she was walking along Bridge Street in Westminster, central London. The Met officer then turned around and confronted him, asking: 'What the hell do you think you're doing?' She told him she was an off-duty policewoman and Hayes then said: 'I’m sorry, I’m drunk,' Westminster Magistrates Court heard. The man tried to escape - but the officer chased him down the road and he was arrested by a uniformed officer. After he was arrested, Hayes claimed he grabbed the officer’s bottom 'as a joke' because one of his friends had dared him to. He pleaded guilty to sexual assault in court today following the incident on July 21. He was released on bail and will be sentenced on 12 August. Prosecutor Nicholas Earl told the court today: ‘The complainant in this case was an off-duty police officer. ‘She was walking along Bridge Street and felt her bottom being grabbed. ‘She turned around and confronted Hayes, asking him ""what the hell do you think you’re doing?"" ‘She explained she was an off-duty officer, produced a warrant card, showed it to him and told him to remain there. ‘He replied ""I’m sorry, I’m drunk"".  She tried to stop him getting away by grabbing his arm but he managed to wriggle out and run away. ‘She chased after him and saw a uniformed officer and alerted him to Hayes. ‘He was detained a short while later and when cautioned said ""I want to apologise, it’s only because I’m drunk."" ‘In interview he fully admitted assaulting the officer. ‘Hayes claimed he was with his friend, they had been drinking alcohol and his friend dared him to grab someone’s bottom and with that in mind he went up to the off-duty officer 'for a joke'. ‘He knew that was wrong and improper but did it anyway.’ Euan Macmillan, defending, said Hayes is remorseful. He said: ‘He clearly picked on the wrong person for all sorts of obvious reasons and his behaviour was poor and he knows that.’ Magistrate Gay Cheyne warned Hayes that he could be sent to prison. ‘We are going to adjourn this matter for a pre-sentence report,’ she said. ‘We are leaving all options open so the sentence could be anything up to custody.’ Hayes grabbed the off-duty officer's bottom while the two were walking down Bridge Street in Westminster, London. A court heard how the woman confronted him, asking: 'What the hell do you think you are doing?' The man pleaded guilty to sexual assault and was released on bail. He will be sentenced next month .","Michael Hayes, 20, grabbed off-duty officer's bottom in Westminster, London .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Germany has condemned the anti-Semitic chants and threats heard at some of the protests against Israel's conflict with Hamas in Gaza, saying such behaviour will not be tolerated. As three men were jailed in France for rioting after a synagogue and Jewish-owned businesses were attacked during a pro-Palestinian rally in a Paris suburb, the German government has reassured Jewish people living in the country that they should feel safe. Georg Streiter, spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel, told a news conference today: 'The chancellor and the government are happy to see the revival of Jewish life in Germany and will continue to campaign for the security of Jewish citizens.' Rioters face riot police, following a pro-Palestinian demonstration, in Sarcelles, north of Paris, on Sunday . The German media has expressed shock at the tenor of anti-Israel chants at some of the demonstrations. German anti-racist laws forbid incitement to racial hatred such as anti-Semitic slogans. The threats made at the protests were an 'attack on freedom and tolerance, and an attempt to destroy Germany's democracy', Streiter said. A French court meanwhile has jailed three men, aged 21 and 28, for between six and ten months after a pro-Palestinian rally descended into violence in Sarcelles, a northern suburb of Paris, at the weekend, the BBC has reported. The court also handed a fourth man a suspended sentence, while a minor was fined. Escalating violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has prompted a disturbing rise in anti-Semitism in Europe in the last few days. Murderous slogans dating back to the days of Hitler have been chanted at pro-Palestinian rallies in Germany. The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, said: ‘They pursue the Jews in the streets of Berlin… as if we were in 1938.’ Participants of a pro-Gaza demonstration hold a poster depicting Israeli's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Berlin authorities announced yesterday they've banned  protesters from chanting anti-Semitic slogan . Jewish groups expressed disgust over the tide of anti-Semitic incidents and warned of ‘a new level of hatred and violence in all of Europe’. Foreign ministers from Germany, France and Italy yesterday issued a joint statement condemning the rise in anti-Semitic protests and violence and vowed to combat hostility against Jewish people. In Germany, there have been reports of protesters chanting ‘Jews to the gas chambers’. Police in Berlin have banned race-hate slogans that reappeared after being originally used in the days of the Nazis. Officers had to protect an Israeli tourist at the weekend after protesters spotted his yarmulke (a small, round cap) and reportedly charged towards him shouting ‘Jew! We’ll get you.’ Fourteen people were arrested in the western city of Essen on suspicion of planning an attack on a synagogue. The imam of a Berlin mosque was under investigation after allegedly calling on Muslims to murder ‘Zionist Jews’. In Paris, hundreds of protesters have attacked synagogues and set fire to shops in the suburb of Sarcelles, nicknamed Little Jerusalem. Posters urged anti-Israel demonstrators to join ‘a raid on the Jewish district’, saying: ‘Come equipped with hammers, fire extinguishers and batons.’ Witnesses said several hundred youths marched on a synagogue chanting ‘Death to Jews’ and were beaten back by riot police using tear gas. The protesters then targeted a shopping centre, a kosher grocery and a Jewish-owned chemist. Police said 19 people were arrested after the violence on Sunday. Eight synagogues in France were said to have been targeted in the last week. In the Netherlands, the home of the Dutch chief rabbi was attacked twice in one week. Authorities see a heightened risk for Israeli buildings and interests in Germany and are providing appropriate security, a spokesman for the interior ministry said. French youths defying a ban on a protest against Israel's Gaza offensive went on a rampage in a Paris suburb . The president of Germany's central council of Jews, Dieter Graumann, thanked German leaders for their support. But he added: 'Many in our community are feeling very insecure, anxious and completely shocked at the horrid anti-Jewish slogans, some of which have been chanted by large, wild crowds, calling for Jews to be ""gassed"", ""burned"" or ""slaughtered"".' French prime minister Manuel Valls condemned the violence in Paris as ‘intolerable’ and warned that France faced ‘a new form of anti-Semitism’. Roger Cukierman, of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, said Jewish people were living in fear. He said: ‘They are not shouting “Death to the Israelis” on the streets of Paris. They are screaming “Death to the Jews”.’ Since the outbreak of violence between Israel and Hamas, participants at anti-Israel demonstrations across Germany have frequently used anti-Semitic slogans and also called for Jewish people to be gassed . French President Francois Hollande met . Jewish and Muslim leaders in the Elysee Palace on Monday and told them . that fighting anti-Semitism will be a ‘national cause’. France has around half a million Jewish residents, the biggest population in Europe, and around five million Muslims. The Jewish population of Germany has increased in the past two decades to around 250,000, most of them migrants from the former Soviet Union who came after German reunification. Israeli troops battled Hamas militants today near a southern Gaza Strip town as the top U.S. diplomat reported progress in efforts to broker a truce in a war that has so far killed at least 684 Palestinians and 31 Israelis. But neither side appeared close to backing down, after Palestinian rocket fire led several international airlines to cancel flights to Tel Aviv and Israeli troops clashed with Hamas fighters near the Gaza town of Khan Younis, forcing dozens of families to flee.","Spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel says anti-Semitic chants and threats heard at protests will not be tolerated .

"By . Jack Doyle . Olympics supremo Sebastian Coe is in line to be the next  chairman of the BBC, it emerged last night. The former track star and London 2012 chief is the frontrunner to replace Lord Patten, who stood down three weeks ago after heart surgery. Downing Street refused to comment on the report first made by ITV News but Whitehall sources last night confirmed Lord Coe is the leading candidate. Whitehall sources claim that Lord Coe, pictured, is the leading contender to replace Chris Patten as chairman of the BBC Trust . London Mayor Boris Johnson appeared to inadvertently confirm the story  when he said that Lord Coe was a ‘first-rate choice’. Mr Johnson said: ‘I think it’s fantastic news for the BBC and British broadcasting. Seb Coe is a great leader, I’ve worked with him a lot over the last few years and I think he’ll demand very high standards of the BBC. ‘I think he’ll be exactly in the right  tradition of British broadcasting.’ Yesterday Lord Coe, 57, did not deny he was linked to the role, saying only that he was ‘very flattered’ to be considered  a contender. He said: ‘I think you will find that whenever any job at the moment comes up I seem to be slated in for it. ‘Either the Mayor of London, Fifa, International Olympic Committee. I’m very flattered, thank you,  but I’ve actually just got off a plane. I have absolutely nothing more  to say.’ After Lord Patten stood down, it was suggested that David Cameron wanted a woman to fill the role, with Dame Marjorie Scardino, the former chief executive of FTSE100 company Pearson, heavily tipped. Lord Coe’s appointment would be popular among Tory MPs who remain concerned about left-wing bias within the corporation. Unlike Lord Patten, he is seen as a ‘true Tory’ in his beliefs. Seb Coe, who is rooted in the real world and renowned for his common sense would be an 'inspirational choice' Coe was a Conservative MP for five years before losing his seat in the 1997 general election, returning to politics for a short time as  William Hague’s chief of staff after receiving a life peerage in 2000. A double Olympic gold medallist in the Eighties, he has also already had a working relationship with BBC director-general Tony Hall. In 2009, Hall, then chief executive of the Royal Opera House, was asked to chair a board to direct the Cultural Olympiad. This gave Hall a seat on the board of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, which Coe chaired. Lord Coe would move into the job following a string of highly damaging scandals at the corporation. The BBC was lambasted for its handling of the Jimmy Savile scandal that broke after the presenter’s death in 2011. In November 2012 George Entwistle quit as director-general after a disastrous Newsnight programme wrongly implicated Lord McAlpine in a child sex abuse scandal. The BBC has also been criticised after details emerged of shocking payoffs worth tens of millions of pounds to senior BBC managers. Technological changes have also led to question marks about the future of the licence fee. The BBC’s royal charter, which secures its funding from the  compulsory licence fee, which  currently costs £145.50, is up for renewal at the end of 2016. As Sebastian Coe, he became a household name in 1980 when  he won the 1500 metres Olympic gold medal – a feat he repeated at the Los Angeles Games in 1984. Tory peer Lord Patten stood down as BBC Trust chairman after three turbulent years in charge. He said he could no longer do the job because of ill health . His victory over his great rival Steve Ovett in Moscow in 1980 is still seen as one of the great  Olympic stories. He . claimed the gold, crossing the line, arms aloft, only days after . losing to Ovett over 800 metres, which was seen as Coe’s specialism. After . retiring from athletics, he was elected in 1992 as a Tory MP for the . Cornwall constituency of Falmouth and Camborne until his defeat in the . 1997 election. He was . chairman of Britain’s triumphant bid to host the 2012 Olympics, and took . the same role in the committee organising the Games, which were widely . seen as one of the most successful in recent years. The . formal selection process for the chair of the BBC – for which Lord . Patten was paid £110,000 a year for a three-day week – will be overseen . by Culture Secretary Sajid Javid.","Tory peer refuses to deny reports he has been chosen to head BBC Trust .

"By . James Chapman . Angry: Teacher Katharine Birbalsingh, has said she will no longer be voting for the Conservatives following Michael Gove's sacking . Michael Gove’s sacking risks ‘killing the goose that laid the golden eggs’ of school reform, one of his allies warned last night. A teacher who lost her job after giving a speech to the Conservative Party conference in which she condemned the standard of state education said she would withdraw her support for the Tories. ‘I never thought much of Cameron and now I think even less of him,’ said Katharine Birbalsingh, who is opening a free school in London. ‘There goes my vote for the Conservatives.’ The Tory Right has reacted angrily to Mr Gove being moved to Chief Whip in Tuesday’s reshuffle. David Cameron told MPs he needed ‘the very best candidate’ to replace Sir George Young, who has stepped down from the Cabinet. ‘Let me tell you what the former education secretary achieved,’ said the Prime Minister. ‘A record number of academies, new free schools, standards rising across the country, and reforms that will endure.’ Government sources insisted that new Education Secretary Nicky Morgan will ‘100 per cent’ push ahead with Mr Gove’s plans to shake up schools, the curriculum and exams. Veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke, who also left the Government this week, said he had been ‘as surprised as everybody else’ by Mr Gove’s move from education. He told the BBC’s Daily Politics programme be believed the Prime Minister wanted to ‘quieten the subject down’ in the nine months before the general election. He compared the move to his own shift from health to education by Margaret Thatcher in her final Cabinet reshuffle after he clashed with the medical establishment. ‘Her intention was to quieten it down before the election,’ he added. Today’s Spectator magazine claims Mr Cameron had been mulling a move for Mr Gove since late last year. Chief election strategist Lynton Crosby is understood to have warned the Prime Minister that Mr Gove had become ‘toxic’, with his unpopularity spreading beyond the teaching profession. An Ipsos MORI poll yesterday confirmed that Mr Gove had become one of Britain’s least popular politicians, liked by just 22 per cent of the public and disliked by 54 per cent. Mr Cameron had also become ‘incensed’ by Mr Gove’s tendency to become embroiled in public arguments with colleagues, most notably Home Secretary Theresa May. Mr Gove is understood to have been reluctant to move, and it took ‘a lot of time and persuasion’ to make him accept the shift to the whips’ office, where he will be in charge of party discipline. It means a downgrading of his status as a full member of the Cabinet and a pay cut of almost £40,000 a year. Public image: Chief election strategist Lynton Crosby (left) is understood to have warned the Prime Minister that Michael Gove (right) had become ‘toxic’, with his unpopularity spreading beyond the teaching profession . Miss Birbalsingh said that with Mr Gove in post, ‘for once in our history, Britain had a government that took education seriously’. She branded Mr Cameron ‘the man who killed the goose that laid the golden eggs’. ‘Education isn’t important enough to the people for governments to care enough to take a principled stance. Freedom from government is what schools need,’ she said. Her free school will be outside local authority control. Author and commentator Toby Young, who has set up a free school in London, said Mr Gove had been ‘the most radical education secretary of the past 50 years’. ‘The problem he’s always faced, from a political point of view, is that it will take decades before any of his reforms begin to bear fruit,’ he added. ‘That means he hasn’t been able to respond to his critics by pointing to the positive impact his policies have had, unlike George Osborne.’","Katharine Birbalsingh says she now thinks 'even less' of David Cameron .

"By . Tamara Cohen . and Tom Mctague . Labour's former election coordinator has admitted the party are having a ‘judder’ amid dismal poll ratings, and that some in the party ‘predict disaster’ for Ed Miliband. Tom Watson MP pulled no punches about the mood of some in the party, on the same day as US guru David Axelrod addressed the shadow cabinet about how to sharpen up Labour’s campaign. Mr Watson, writing on a Labour website, acknowledged the recent ‘struggles and difficulties’ but urged the party to pull together ahead of the local and European elections next week. Labour leader Ed Miliband held a shadow cabinet meeting accompanied for the first time by his new superstar American advisor David Axelrod . Mr Axelrod (right) was brought in by Labour's election strategist Douglas Alexander. The American pollster was an influential adviser to US President Barack Obama and hopes to take Ed Miliband and Harriet Harman into government next year . Behind . David Axelrod's self-confessed 'tired and rumpled' appearance lies one of the sharpest political brains of his generation. He . won fame in the States after helping to convince Americans to pick . their first black president in 2008 and then helped Barack Obama's . re-election four years later. But . the two Presidential triumphs are only the highest profile in a string of Democrat successes . that have made the 59-year-old New Yorker a back room political superstar. It began 30 . years ago when, fresh from quitting his job as the youngest political . editor in the history of the Chicago Tribune, he helped oust a three-term Republican senator for Illinois. Three . years later, he was a key member of the team that helped re-elect Chicago's first black mayor Harold Washington. But he has not been as successful in Europe as he was in the States. Former Italian prime minister Mario Monti secured only 10.5% of the vote in Italy last year despite the guru's advice. In a blog entitled ’10 reasons to be cheerful’ he reassured activists they could win over Ukip supporters, by telling them the party’s policy is a flat rate of tax for everyone from bankers to cleaners, and breaking up the NHS. He added that Labour could win back seats from the Liberal Democrats, who he said were in ‘long term decline’ and had struggled to get candidates to stand, and that the party had to coax out the under-25 to vote, as 65 per cent of them back Labour. Two polls today gave the party a small lead, after a disastrous week in which the Tories gained a lead in the polls for the first time in two years, and frontbenchers saying that Labour are bracing themselves for a minority government. Mr Axelrod, credited with masterminding Barack Obama’s two election victories, and hired by Mr Miliband last month, watched Prime Minister’s Questions this week and is said to be advising him on how to improve his image. He said when he was hired: 'I think candidates who can win are candidates who articulate a vision that speaks to the lives and concerns of the people they are running to represent.’ The strategist - known as ‘The Axe’ - gave a short speech to the shadow cabinet, telling them the cost of living message is the right one, but it has to resonate with middle class people. He then held meetings with key frontbenchers including Harriet Harman and Ed Balls, and addressed party staff about campaigning techniques.

"By . Tamara Cohen, In Sweden . Angela Merkel today publicly slapped down David Cameron for issuing 'threats' to leave Europe if he does not get his way over choosing the European Commission president. Mr Cameron was at a summit in Sweden  trying to drum up support to block Jean-Claude Juncker - an arch pro-European who is the front runner for the top job. He fears that the former Luxembourg prime minister is not open to reform of the EU, and has suggested appointing him could send Britain drifting towards exit door in the in-out referendum he has promised for 2017. German Chancellor Angela Merkel this morning warned David Cameron not to make threats in his bid to overhaul Britain's relationship with Brussels . Mrs Merkel insisted she was still backing Jean-Claude Juncker to be President of the European Commission, but urged other leaders to act in a 'European spirit' Mrs Merkel issued the warning at a joint press conference hosted by Swedish Prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt . But Mrs Merkel - who has publicly backed Mr Juncker, but is privately said to be sensitive to Britain's concerns - rebuked Mr Cameron for being too heavy-handed and not acting in the ‘European spirit’. When the Prime Minister was asked if he had threatened to leave the European Union, at a press conference in Harpsund, the Swedish prime minister's country residence, Mrs Merkel cut in. She said: 'I made myself clear by saying that I am for Jean-Claude Juncker. But when I made that statement in Germany I also made the point that we act in a European spirit. ‘We always do that because otherwise you would never reach a compromise...Threats are not part and parcel of that spirit. That is not part of the way in which we usually proceed.' It was a snub for Mr Cameron who is understood to have hit out at Mr Juncker's suitability for the role at the leaders dinner on Monday night. The four leaders agreed that whoever the next commissioner is, a commitment to tackle benefit tourism must be top of their agenda. The commissioner's programme is written in the next few months and they plan to convince the other 24 national leaders that protecting country's social security systems from the freedom of movement rules must be on it. Tensions were laid bare during the joint press conference between Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Swedish Prime Minister, Fredrik Reinfeldt and British Prime Minister David Cameron, at the summer residence, Harpsund, south of Stockholm, Sweden . The four European leaders posed first on a boat and later at lecterns in the sunshine, keen to present a united front. But behind the scenes there remain deep divisions about who will run the European Commission. Last night they dined on smoked salmon tartare, followed by roast filet of beef with bacon and morel ragu and for dessert, elderflower semifredo strawberry compote with meringue and strawberries. The public spat over Jean-Claude Juncker will leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth. Mr Cameron attending the mini summit in the Swedish countryside, with Mrs Merkel, the Swedish prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, all EU reformers. The foursome enjoyed a scenic boat trip on a balmy Monday evening in matching life jackets, then an intimate meal at the residence, where Mr Cameron told them allowing Mr Juncker to have the role would be a 'stitch up' by the European Parliament and would set a ‘dangerous precedent’ for the future. The leaders nailed down their priorities for reform and who would best fulfil them. A clampdown on benefit tourism is a top priority, along with jobs and growth, cutting red tape for businesses and completing the single market in energy. Downing Street sources say there are ‘high quality’ alternative candidates Mr Cameron would support. They are thought to include the Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who featured in a selfie with Mr Cameron and Barack Obama last year in South Africa. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund has ruled herself out, but would be a popular choice for many, and Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, a free marketer who models herself on Margaret Thatcher. Last night the leaders helds talks in a rowing boat, a tradition for all visitors to the rural retreat in Harpsund . Despite the display of bonhomie, there remain major differences between Mrs Merkel and the other leaders on the future leadership of the European Commission . Sweden’s Mr Reinfeldt boosted Mr Cameron’s hopes yesterday this week by saying he agreed that national leaders, not MEPs should pick the Commission president. Mr Cameron said after the summit that he wanted Britain to stay in a reformed EU, and would leave the decision to a referendum. But he added: ‘Obviously the approach that the EU takes between now and then will be very important. If we can achieve reforms, if we can demonstrate openness, competitiveness, flexibility, less interference, reform - if people are capable of taking the EU forward in that direction that will be helpful. Obviously if the EU doesn't go in that direction that would be very unhelpful.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have both backed Mr Cameron’s bid to block Mr Juncker, and he is thought to have support from other leaders including Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi. Mr Juncker emerged as the front runner because he was picked earlier this year by MEPs from the European People's Party group - which won the most seats in the EU Parliament, but still only took less than a third. Angela Merkel is pushing for arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker (left) to become the new EC president, but IMF chief Christine Lagarde (second left) has emerged as a compromise candidate favoured by David Cameron. Other politicians in line for Europe's most powerful position include Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny . Jean-Claude Juncker is the favourite to become the new European Commission President - replacing the outgoing former Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Manuel Barroso. The former Luxembourg prime minister was chosen as the candidate for the top job by the European Parliament's main conservative group, the European People's Party. The EPP emerged from last week's elections with the most seats - leaving Mr Juncker in poll position for the EU's most powerful job. But the Commission President is chosen by European leaders including David Cameron - and not by the Parliament. MEPs do however have to confirm the leaders' choice for the job in a vote. The other candidates for the top EU job include the IMF chief Christine Lagarde. Miss Lagarde was finance minister under former President Nicolas Sarkozy before moving to the IMF at the height of the euro zone's debt crisis in 2011 to replace disgraced French politician Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Her term runs until 2016. A fluent English-speaker who headed a major US law firm before holding ministerial office in France, she is highly regarded by German leader Angela Merkel. Center-left Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt is also under consideration. The former MEP is the daughter-in-law of Neil Kinnock, the ex Labour leader and European commissioner. If Mrs Merkel was open to a French candidate for one of the top jobs, Paris might offer Socialist former Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault - a fluent German-speaker who was replaced in March but is well regarded in Berlin. Another candidate for the EU Commission President is the current Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny. The Fine Gael leader became Ireland's leader in 2011, so might be open to moving to Brussels.","German Chancellor says threat to walk out 'not in European spirit'

"By . Tamara Cohen . Cameras could broadcast live from criminal courts in Britain within the next five years, the ex-top prosecutor Keir Starmer has predicted. The former Director of Public Prosecutions said the heightened interest in trials televised abroad such as that of Oscar Pistorius strengthened the argument for cameras in UK courts. In his first interview since stepping down last October, he said it was 'odd' that the public know more about the legal system in other countries than our own, where footage is banned. Scroll down for video . The former director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, said cameras could broadcast live from criminal courts in Britain within the next five years . 'The case for cameras in courts really gets stronger and stronger,' he said. 'The principle is open justice and there's a disconnect between the fact we've got a right to walk into any court but it can't be screened. Most people don't have the time to go to court and therefore they don't know what's going on in courts. 'And it is odd that I suspect in most households the legal system in Italy because of the Amanda Knox case, in South Africa because of the Pistorius case and then the US because of OJ Simpson are better known than their own legal systems. Most people know something about those cases. 'When you cut all that with the fact you can now use Twitter in court, the case becomes compelling.' He told the Mail: 'I think that there's only one direction of travel. I would be very surprised if in the next five years we haven't moved on again.' Since he first cautiously backed the idea trials three years ago, he said screening of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court had gone ahead successfully and it is now a 'moving issue'. He suggested courts could start by putting sentencing hearings on camera, and over time extend their reach to witness testimony. Broadcast: Olympic and Paralympic track star Oscar Pistorius  speaks with his defence lawyer Barry Roux at the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria . Mr Starmer, a human rights barrister at London's Doughty Street chambers, dismissed criticism that putting trials on television would cause witnesses to play to the cameras, saying there was no evidence of this from other countries. In disturbing scenes from the Pistorius trial – which returned to TV screens this week – the athlete is seen breaking down in tears while giving evidence. But Mr Starmer said: 'I think it's only a soap opera because it's the only one. If you say no cameras, and its therefore a very odd and strange thing, it becomes sensational. The way to deal with that I think is to make it the norm across all cases. 'If you look at any of the big cases of the past week, Max Clifford or Constance Briscoe, they are headline news because the public want to know about them. And what you get is journalists at court describing in detail what's happening, so you don't avoid that by not having a camera. Make it the norm and it becomes the norm.' Mr Starmer said: 'If you look at any of the big cases of the past week, Max Clifford or Constance Briscoe, they are headline news because the public want to know about them' But Mr Starmer, who is working on a justice review for the Labour party which will include new proposals for a Victims' Law, warned that judges would need powers to exempt evidence from vulnerable people or children from being broadcast. He said similar arguments were made against live television broadcasting from Parliament, which was only allowed in 1989, around 60 years after it was first proposed. 'It's a moving issue now, it's gradually changing and I think we will get there and it will then become the norm', he said. 'It has become the norm with Parliament. 'There was great worry that if Parliament was televised people would act to the camera, but we now regularly see clips on the news and people know more about what it does and that's a good thing. 'I think opposition to the idea is lessening. By seeing trials, the public will better understand what's going in. But I also think the scrutiny would improve criminal justice. 'If a torch is shone, that tends to improve things. Speed and efficiency of cases would be improved. Our legal system sometimes moves slowly and constant scrutiny helps with issues of efficiency.' The ban on cameras in court has been in place since the Criminal Justice Act 1925. Among critics of overturning it are the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, who has warned televising criminal trials would be disruptive and deter witnesses from giving evidence. He said there had been incidents in New Zealand when it was introduced of 'cheers and boos' from the gallery. Helena Kennedy QC, also a leading human rights barrister and peer spoke out against cameras in courts six months ago. She said television 'seeks the salacious and the sensational'. She said: 'Such exposure will put witnesses off, discourage victims even if their faces are not on screen and distort the behaviour of lawyers and judges.' She added: 'Fear and anxiety will multiply for those involved and public trust will decrease… Transparency does not mean the whole country has to see highlights like the goals in a football match.' The Ministry of Justice say they intend to extend filming into crown courts for sentencing 'in due course' but no date has been given. Last year Helen Grant, then a justice minister said: 'We believe televising court proceedings will help improve transparency and bring greater public confidence and understanding of the criminal justice system. 'We want to modernise the system and make the courts accessible to the public, whilst ensuring correct procedures are in place to safeguard all participants.'","Keir Starmer said there has been interest in trials televised abroad .

"By . Gerri Peev . Calling for help: Commons speaker John Bercow has ordered a hotline that allows staff to report bullying . Bullying MPs will be more easily reported by staff after Commons Speaker John Bercow ordered a whistleblowers’ phone line to be set up. The confidential hotline will allow anyone working in Parliament to report harassment, bullying or other gripes when it goes live later this month. Employees from across the Palace of Westminster from bar staff to research assistants will be able to use it. The phone line will offer confidential support and advice and it is understood it will be manned. The decision to launch the phone line, sanctioned by the House of Commons Commission, comes in the wake of the court case involving former deputy speaker Nigel Evans. The senior Tory strenuously denies accusations of sexual assault. It also follows damaging claims of inappropriate sexual advances by Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard against party workers and volunteers. Lord Rennard has always denied any wrongdoing and the Liberal Democrats are working with the complainants and Lord Rennard to try and broker a truce. Although the main political parties have internal processes for dealing with claims of bullying and harassment and the Lords and Commons have other welfare services, there is no single unified help point for employees. Unions have asked the Speaker and Commons Commission to come up with a system for all staff. In a statement announcing the phone line late last night, Mr Bercow said that Parliament was an ‘extraordinary place in which to work’ and that the Commons ‘strives to be an exemplar of good employment practice’. He said the phone line was a ‘step in the right direction in modernising the culture of the House of Commons, clearly signalling that, wherever the place of work, people are entitled to be treated with dignity, courtesy and respect as they carry out their work. Although the main political parties have internal processes for dealing with claims of bullying and harassment and the Lords and Commons have other welfare services, there is no single unified help point for employees . He added: ‘Parliament is an extraordinary place in which to work and the House of Commons strives to be an exemplar of good employment practice. I am pleased that a helpline for staff is going to be established, as a safety net designed to complement existing pastoral care.’ The Speaker himself is no stranger to claims of being difficult to work for. He lost two private secretaries in two years. One branded him as being ‘intolerable’ to work for and claimed she had been pushed out for being ‘too posh’ while another was ‘too old-fashioned.’","Speaker John Bercow has ordered a phone line for whistleblowers .

"By . Emma Innes . A super-fit cage fighter has been given just months to live after being diagnosed with bowel cancer. Wil Handford, 22, from Burnley, Lancashire, was ‘in the best shape of his life’ - at 6ft 5in and 14st - when he was taken ill. Within weeks he had lost 2st and was struggling even to eat a bowl of cereal. Scroll down for video . Wil Handford, 22, has been given just three to six months to live after being diagnosed with inoperable bowel cancer. He is pictured before his diagnosis . He has been hailed as ‘inspirational’ and received hundreds of messages of support after posting a diary of his battle on his blog. He says his doctors say the cancer is terminal and have given him three to six months. Bowel cancer is extremely rare in young people. About three quarters of all case occur in over-65s but Stephen Sutton, 19, from Burntwood, Staffordshire, who has raised £3.1million for charity, also has bowel cancer. Mr Handford, a mixed martial arts expert learned he had cancer after returning from a boxing training camp in Thailand. He said he started to suffer agonising stomach pains after a sparring session and couldn’t sleep or eat. Mr Handford, a cage fighter, fell ill while attending a training camp in Thailand . Mr Handford (pictured with his girlfriend Rose Barrowclough) was diagnosed after experiencing unexplained weight loss, severe stomach pains and difficulty eating . After a few days he visited a local hospital where scans revealed nodules around his abdomen. Doctors urged him to return to the UK for further tests. His mother, Karen, met him at Manchester Airport, where he said she looked ‘gutted’ as he ‘looked like a skeleton’. Bowel cancer is cancer which starts in the large bowel. It is sometimes also called colon cancer or rectal cancer. Symptoms include blood in the stools, a change in bowel habits, abdominal pain and unexplained weight loss. As the disease progresses, it can also cause fatigue and breathlessness. Bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in England and there are about 40,000 cases diagnosed every year. Approximately 72 per cent of bowel cancer cases occur in people who are over 65. People who are older, who eat a diet low in fibre and high in fat, those who are overweight and those who take little exercise are most at risk. People who smoke and drink a lot of alcohol, as well as those with a family history of the disease, are also at increased risk. Source: NHS Choices . She took him straight to Royal Blackburn Hospital where he spent two weeks. Doctors then gave him the devastating news he had bowel cancer which had spread through his abdomen and his colon. Describing the moment, Mr Handford said: ‘After that, they went on to give more and more bad news. They said because of the severity of it they couldn’t operate. ‘There were a few big tumours. They said all they could offer is to try to reduce it to prolong my life. ‘When you’re sat there and they’re telling you this, it’s hard to clock in your head. I said: “So you’re telling me I’m going to die from this?” and they just said “yeah”. ‘They said at this stage if you do nothing at all, it’s really aggressive. You’ve lasted as long as you have because you’re young and fit. You’ve probably got three to six months. I was just sat there gobsmacked.’ But Mr Handford, who had hopes of becoming a plumber, has vowed to ‘keep his chin up’ and not let cancer beat him. And he said his whole family, including his mother Karen, twin sister Catherine, little brother Eduard, and long-term girlfriend Rose Barrowclough, are backing him in his ultimate battle. He said: ‘You’ve got to keep fighting, chin up. I’ve had loads of support and it’s great to know you’ve got people that care for you. ‘But you’ve got to keep the fight and I will be doing that. 'It was tough telling my family, my sister, my girlfriend, all my friends. It’s horrendous news for everyone.

As soon as he arrived in the UK his mother took him to hospital where he was diagnosed . Mr Handford (pictured before his diagnosis) has been told the cancer has spread throughout his abdomen . ‘But I’m trying to be confident about it, trying not to get down. That helps everyone in the house. ‘Everyone has got a really good attitude for it really and believe, no matter what the doctors say, I’ll come out on top.’ Messages of support for Mr Handford have flooded in from Facebook users.

"By . Mark Staniforth, Press Association . Nicola Adams plans to use a gift from a six-year-old Scottish schoolgirl to win over any wavering host nation fans at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. England's Olympic gold medallist will wear a tartan bandana into the ring when the women's flyweight boxing competition gets under way on Monday.

Hopeful: Nicola Adams wants Scottish fans to get behind her after she was sent a tartan bandana . Hopeful: Jonas, left, will be eyeing a gold medal in the lightweight boxing event in Glasgow . Adams told Press Association Sport: 'I've got a bandana made out of Adams tartan that a six-year-old girl Scottish girl sent me in the post. 'I hope I've already done enough to win over the Scottish fans but hopefully if I wear a bit of tartan into the ring it will help even more.' Adams has no host nation rivals in the flyweight division as she starts a strong favourite to create more history as the first female Commonwealth Games boxing gold medallist.

'I still thought I had done enough to win the fight but the judges thought otherwise and I have got to fight back and do it again.

"By . William Turvill . Storm-force winds forced this huge 30ft fibreglass storage tank two miles before it crashed into a young family's home. A terrified mother and three children were in the house when the tank steamrollered over the family's car and into the porch. Thankfully, no one was hurt. After renovating the property for two years, David and Catriona Soudan had moved into the house just six weeks before the incident, which forced them to move into temporary accommodation while it is repaired. This fibreglass storage tank rolled two miles in storm-force winds into this family home in Scotland . It is thought the tank was a storage vessel from a distillery which was blown from a distillery in Dhurrie - around two miles from the house, in Campbeltown in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. Mrs Soudan, 41, said: ‘I heard an almighty crash and looked out and thought it was a wind turbine – I was shaking and the children were terrified.’ Mr Soudan, also 41, was at work at the time and his wife couldn’t reach him because of bad phone signal. The farm manager said: ‘It couldn't have happened at a worse time of year with Christmas around the corner. ‘Catriona and the kids are still pretty shaken by what happened. There was no warning, the tank just came crashing through the porch.’ 'Devastated' Mr Soudan said he couldn’t believe what he was seeing when he got home from work. Catriona Soudan (top right) was with her three children (bottom) when the tank crashed in the family home . The tank is believed to have rolled around two miles, from Dhurrie to a home in Campbeltown, Scotland . Mr Soudan added: ‘The porch will need to be totally rebuilt and there are some minor cracks in the main building. The tank has hit it with an amazing force. ‘But, it's only bricks and should be grateful no one was injured. If someone had got in the way of this, they wouldn't have stood a chance.’ Local firm McFadyens Contractors has since broken up the tank and removed it from the Soudans’ property. Police confirmed they are no longer involved and an insurance investigation is underway to determine exactly what happened. Mr Soudan said: 'It's even more devastating as we've spent the last two years doing the house up' David, Catriona and their children Claire, 12, Erin, nine, and Matthew, five, have all taken refuge in a local guest house and fear it could be some time before they are able to move back in. Mr Soudan added: ‘Someone is coming out to inspect the property but we are hopeful it will be covered. The early indications are we should be okay. ‘At the moment it's not clear what happened. We think the tube was tethered down and broke free, but we aren't totally sure. ‘It's pretty much destroyed the car as well. I don't think anyone is to blame, it's just a freak accident.’ A spokesman for the police confirmed they had attended the incident in the immediate aftermath. He said: ‘We got a call about the fibreglass tube having been blown by the wind and striking a house. ‘We attended to establish if there were any injuries and upon ascertaining there weren't officers were stood down.’","Mother and three children home when tank steamrollered into the property .

"By . Tamara Cohen . Women need a change in the law to stop their jilted ex-partners publishing explicit pictures of them on the internet, Maria Miller said yesterday. The former Tory cabinet minister is campaigning for the Government to ban the rising tide of 'revenge porn' ruining women's lives. Campaigners say it is a fast-growing trend with up to 30 websites in the UK already being used by former boyfriends and husbands to post humiliating pictures of their one-time lovers. Ministers are in talks about changing the law to stop ex-partners posting sexual images online . Victims find the images are impossible to remove -  as they are reproduced on a host of other websites within minutes often with their name and sometimes even their contact details. Mrs Miller said they 'can destroy somebody's career, destroy their relationships and the recourse is very patchy indeed'. There is currently no law which addresses the practice. When she was Culture Secretary, Mrs Miller helped to crack down on vile child abuse and rape images online, and drew up plans for an automatic block on explicit sites unless households opt in. Speaking to the Mail in her first interview since stepping down, Mrs Miller said a new law to ban revenge porn was urgently needed. She is in talks with Justice Secretary Chris Grayling who is backing her campaign. 'This is a form of sexual violence against women in our own country', Mrs Miller said. 'The issue is explicit and nude pictures being posted on the internet without an individuals' consent. 'These are not taken in a studio, they are taken in someone's front room and clearly not meant for public release. This is not one or two people, this is quite widespread. 'What I want to do is run faster than . the internet and make sure we have the right legal protection in place . for these women. My fear is that there will be a lot of women who are . suffering in silence.' Mrs . Miller was forced to step down from the Cabinet in April after a storm . about expenses she claimed for her home, for which she was forced to . repay £5,800. She is still MP for Basingstoke. Ex-culture Secretary Maria Miller is campaigning for the Government to ban the rising tide of 'revenge porn' ruining women's lives .

(thurs) to try and raise awareness among MPs, and said police and social . media sites need training in how to handle it. Currently . there are only laws preventing 'malicious communications', which . usually involves written abuse not pictures, and harassment laws which . usually require a number of offences. The . Ministry of Justice will look at how existing sexual offences laws . could be amended to outlaw the distribution of sexual images without the . person's consent. Justice . Secretary Chris Grayling said yesterday: 'This sort of behaviour is . deeply abhorrent and motivated solely by a desire to cause harm and . embarrassment.  It's not acceptable. 'If . there is a gap that we need to address in making sure that individuals . who do this sort of thing are properly brought to book, then it can only . be right that we look at ways it might be closed.'

Mrs Miller said MPs should not tell people how to behave in their private lives, but try to alert women to the 'dangers' of sharing images. Charities say nearly half (45 per cent) of domestic violence cases involve an element of online abuse. 'There's a very close link', Mrs Miller said. Distributing pictures like this really is just another form of domestic violence and yet at the moment there are few – of any – convictions. 'If you posted explicit pictures of someone in the pub, the landlord would take them down and probably call the police, and it shouldn't be any different online'. The practice is now so widespread in America, three states have enacted laws against it. 'In Britain this is the lull before the storm, we must clamp down before it really takes off', she said.

"By . Freya Noble And Aap . Australia's largest telecommunications company is set to send almost 700 jobs offshore to Asia. As part of its plans to expand in the region, from September of this year Telstra will outsource 671 Australian roles to its industry partners. Telstra confirmed to the ABC that it will cut the jobs from it's Global Services Division. In a bid to increase resources in its global division, over the next 12 months 463 internal positions and 208 contractor roles will be outsourced. Telstra will send nearly 700 Australian jobs offshore to Asia from this September . Chief executive David Thodey recently outlined Telstra's vision to become a major company in Asia, offering wireless technology and software. 'To compete effectively internationally we need to have resources in the region and the capability to scale rapidly to meet demand,"" the company said in a statement on Wednesday. 'These are not decisions we take lightly and we will consult and work closely with our people on this proposal. Over the next 12 months 463 internal positions and 208 contractor roles will be outsourced . 'If a decision is made to proceed we will aim to redeploy as many affected employees as possible.' Staff were shocked and saddened by the news, Community and Public Sector Union President Michael Tull told said. 'Telstra is moving into a very worrying phase of offshoring,' he told AAP. 'The affected area is a very profitable and growing part of the business, so it's shocking to see that Telstra is prepared to outsource its future.'","Telstra set to send 671 jobs to Asia in the next year .

"By . Sophie Borland . Almost half of all adults could be offered statins under new guidelines from the health watchdog. NICE is advising GPs to consider prescribing the pills to up to 17million patients to prevent heart disease. Family doctors are being urged to trawl medical records to find patients at risk who will then be invited in for check-ups. Family doctors are being asked to trawl through the medical records of patients to find those at risk from the side-affects of statins, then book check-up appointments which they warn could over-burden surgeries . However, GPs say that already overstretched surgeries will be deluged with patients booking the check-ups, leading to even longer waiting times for appointments. Other doctors warn that the population faces being ‘medicalised’ when too little is known about the potential side-effects. The known side-effects include type 2 diabetes and severe muscular pain and there is also evidence that patients regard the pills as an excuse to lead unhealthy lifestyles. Guidelines issued by NICE today tell GPs to consider prescribing statins to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease within a decade (generally people over the age of 40). Currently, they are offered to patients with a 20 per cent risk. NICE estimates that between five and ten million adults are currently taking the drugs, although 12.5million are eligible. But under the new guidelines, another 4.5million would qualify. This means that 17million adults – nearly half of the 37million adults in Britain – would either be on statins or offered them. NICE estimates that it would cost the NHS an extra £52million to prescribe statins to the 4.5million adults newly eligible. Experts say if all eligible patients took statins, 510,000 heart attacks or strokes could be prevented a year. Professor Mark Baker, director of the Centre for Clinical Practice at NICE, said: ‘Statins are safe and effective and now they are cheaper it is a good deal for more people to have access to them under the NHS. ‘The overwhelming body of evidence supports their use, even in people at low risk of cardiovascular disease. The effectiveness of these medicines is now well proven and their cost has fallen. ‘It is ludicrous to suggest that we are over-medicalising the population when the whole point of using modern, safe and effective drugs in an economic way is to prevent bad things happening in the future.’ However, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said: ‘In making their decision NICE have failed to take the current pressures on general practice into account, and the further impact this will have on already overstretched GPs and those patients requiring treatment for other illnesses.’ Other experts say there is no evidence the drugs prevent heart attacks or strokes in healthy patients who don’t have heart disease. Dr Kailash Chand, a GP and deputy chair of the British Medical Association who stopped taking statins after developing crippling muscle pain, said: ‘These guidelines mean you are medicalising millions of the population without any evidence. ‘Statins have an important role for patients who already have heart disease. But for healthy patients, the benefits are very, very minimal. 'When people have side effects and they need follow-up investigations and scans they are going to take up a lot of time and NHS resources.’ Dr Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist who also runs the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges, said: ‘A mass prescription to millions of healthy people will not benefit population health and will contribute to excess costs. 'Low-risk patients must be told statins will not reduce their risk of death. What I see with my own patients is they think they have got the magic pill, which is an excuse to gorge on junk food.’ Last month it emerged that six of the 12-strong panel of experts drawing up the NICE guidelines had financial links to drugs firms making statins, or similar pills. At the time a group of leading doctors wrote to NICE and the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urging them to rethink the proposed guidelines.","Statins could be offered to half of all adults in UK under new guidelines .

"By . Alice Smellie . A type of medication that  is normally used by asthma sufferers has been proving stunningly effective in treating a form or paralysis – and has even allowed a wheelchair-bound teenager to walk unaided for the first time in seven years. Jimmy Webster, 18, took salbutamol to treat congenital myasthenia. He had been so disabled he sometimes needed an oxygen-mask to breathe. But he says: ‘Within three days I could stand and within a week I could walk.’ Now he is about to go camping and adds: ‘I wouldn’t have contemplated this last year.’ Remarkable: Jimmy Webster, 18, took salbutamol to treat congenital myasthenia. He claims he could stand up and walk within three days (file picture) Salbutamol is prescribed to asthmatics in inhaler form under the brand name Ventolin. It is now proving a remarkable treatment for myasthenia, which affects 12,000 Britons and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild drooping of the eyelids to full-blown paralysis. The drug is a beta-2-agonist, a class of compounds that affect the nerve communications in the muscles. It was already known that a similar drug, ephedrine – a stimulant also found in cold and flu remedies, and in higher doses in dangerous ‘fat-burning’ diet pills – was sometimes effective in treating myasthenia. Studies had shown widespread benefits, with another teenage patient going from needing crutches to walk, to jogging and doing sit-ups. So Professor David Beeson at the Weatherall Institute, of Molecular Medicine, Oxford University, looked for other drugs which may work as well or better. One of these was salbutamol. Myasthenia is either congenital – due to a genetic mutation – or caused by the immune system turning inward and attacking the body, developing later in life. So Professor David Beeson at the Weatherall Institute, of Molecular Medicine, Oxford University, suggested Jimmy try the drug . The congenital condition is noticeable from birth but the problem with treating it is that it is caused by different genetic mutations, which need different drug combinations. Prof Beeson explains: ‘Our research is devoted to working out what drugs best treat each one.’ Salbutamol can be used alone or with other drugs. Prof Beeson adds: ‘It is not yet licensed for use in the condition, but clinicians are happy to prescribe it.’ He suggested that Jimmy try salbutamol alongside pyridostigmine, a standard drug which he had been taking since he was four. ‘I expected I’d get stronger, but had no idea I’d be able to walk again,’ says Jimmy, from Cardiff, who is awaiting A-level results before hopefully going to study Economics at Oxford University. ‘I still use my wheelchair out and about, but at home I walk around – just getting dressed, washing and cooking, it’s amazing to be able to normal things.’ Prof Beeson says: ‘It is incredibly rewarding to see results like this. Over the last couple of years we have seen patients rise from their wheelchairs within months, but Jimmy’s quite exceptional.’","Jimmy Webster, 18, took salbutamol to treat congenital myasthenia .

"A mother with seven boys, who was so desperate for a girl that she spent $50,000 flying over to the US to ensure she could add daughters to her growing brood, said she was a victim of cyber bullying. Jodi McMahon, from Tumut in rural NSW, decided to make the trip overseas to have the option to choose the gender of her youngest children via IVF. Ms McMahon, along with husband Andrew, sparked a national debate in 2012 when they spoke publicly on Channel Nine program 60 Minutes about their choice to take matters into their own hands when their plans to use gender selection IVF in NSW were stalled by changes that outlawed the option in Australia. Jodi McMahon said she bullied online after her story that revealed she would be spending $50,000 to choose the gender of her children aired on 60 Minutes . When their story was revealed, malicious critics took to the internet to shame the family's extreme lengths to have sisters for siblings Luke, Aiden, Josh, Billy, Cody and Declan. Some went as far as threatening to drive to Ms McMahon's Tumut home to 'get the b****'. 'I got bullied [online],' Mrs McMahon told 9 Stories. 'There was only like a handful of people who took it to the extreme, they were just nasty, just plain out nasty. 'They said nasty horrible things, which I would be pretty sure not all those people would say to your face.' She and her husband, Andrew, travelled to the US where gender selection IVF is legal . Now the McMahons have two girls, Addison - who born in 2011 - and Evie - born in 2012. Despite the bullying and the cost of their conception, Ms McMahon does not have any regrets. 'I just look at [the girls'] when they go to bed at night and I just think every night how lucky I am that my dream and my plan all worked out and all paid off,' she said. Ms McMahon was also adamant Addison and Evie received no special treatment. '[They] aren't loved more than the boys, they're disciplined the same way, it's not like they're on a pedestal,' she said. 'There was no magic moment [when they were born], I've got to tell you,' Mrs McMahon said. 'It was just like, ""That hurt and now the baby's out and now it doesn't hurt anymore"". 'Even with Evie there was no magic moment - hers was the most unattractive birth. '60 Minutes thought about wanting to videotape that [but] they wouldn't have put it on TV. I was vomiting while I was giving birth, it was not a pretty birth.' With seven boys (only five are pictured here), Ms McMahon desperately yearned to have daughters. She now has two, Addison and Evie . Ms McMahon also added that she would not withholdhow much they cost  from her daughters and said the family already joked the girls were 'made in America'. The McMahons were one of the estimated 100 Australian couples who travelled overseas each year to countries where choosing a baby's gender through IVF was legal - including the US, Cyprus and Thailand. A poll done last year by Roy Morgan Research, which was commissioned by leading IVF expert Professor Gab Kovacs, found 92 per cent of Australians supported the costly procedure, but only 20 per cent agreed with gender selection. Critics believe it encourages the concept of designer babies and are against it even when it is used as a tool to balance out genders in a family. But research shows this never occurs in countries where gender selection is legal.","Mother Jodi McMahon now has two daughters, Addison and Evie .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A three-year-old girl has died in a house fire exactly a year ago to the day her baby brother died suddenly from suspected cot death. Angel Jade Smith died after a fire broke out at her family home in Carmarthen, Wales at around 6.15pm on Sunday. Her mother, Alice Smith, 24, remains in a serious condition in hospital following the blaze, which is being investigated by police. Angel Jade Smith (left) died after a fire broke out at her family's home in Carmarthen, Wales on Sunday. Her death comes a year to the day that her brother Jake (right) died from suspected sudden cot death . The pair were taken to Glangwili Hospital, along with the youngster’s father, after the fire broke out at the terraced house in the Bryn Gorwel area, where the average property price is £100,000. It took more than eight firefighters . nearly four hours to get the blaze under control and thick, black smoke . could be seen billowing from the property at the height of the fire. Due to her injuries, the . toddler was later transferred to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, where she died the following day. It comes exactly a year to the day that her baby brother Jake died suddenly from suspected cot death. Shortly after Jake’s death at their former home in Llanelli, Wales last year, the family moved to the Carmarthen. Friends in Llanelli had raised more than £300 towards a headstone for Jake last year, and described Miss Smith as ‘a great mum’. Angel Jade Smith died and her mother Alice, 24, remains in a serious condition after the fire broke out at the family home in Carmarthen, Wales on Sunday. Floral tributes for the youngster have been left at the scene . Tributes have been flooding in for the youngster (pictured) including one from Hannah Birmingham who said: 'Love u Alice. My heart goes out to Angel. You have grown wings now and you are with your brother' Lisa Naether, who lives in the town, said news of the fire had come as a shock. She said: ‘It was a total shock to hear, especially as it was the anniversary of her baby’s death.’ Tributes have been flooding in for the youngster and several of flowers and cards have been left outside the family home. Angel Jade Smith was taken to Glangwili Hospital following the fire but later transferred to University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, where she later died . Sian Tucker said: ‘So sad my heart goes out to the family rip little one x.’ Meanwhile Danielle Coelho wrote: ‘So sad r.i.p angel-jade you are now with your baby brother Jakey. Watch over mammy up there sweethearts. Alice keep strong babe keep fighting.’ And Hannah Birmingham said: ‘RIP Angel miss and love u baby girl.

"By . Tamara Cohen . Lord Ashdown yesterday appeared to compare Vince Cable to one of Shakespeare’s worst villains – as a poll revealed that Nick Clegg is the least popular political leader in modern British history. The former Liberal Democrat chief hinted at the Business Secretary’s involvement in a ‘plot of deep malice’ to unseat Mr Clegg as the head of the party. In an outspoken interview, he appeared to liken Mr Cable to Iago, the trusted adviser who betrays and then destroys his commander in Shakespeare’s Othello. Popularity problem: A poll revealed that Nick Clegg is the least popular political leader in modern British history, as it was claimed that Vince Cable was involved in a 'plot of deep malice' to oust the Liberal Democrat leader . It came as a YouGov poll revealed only 13 per cent of people think Mr Clegg is doing a good job, while 78 per cent think he is doing badly. Lord Ashdown, a staunch ally of the Lib Dem leader, fanned the flames engulfing the party by hitting out at internal  enemies who have ‘made a bad  situation worse’. Last week Mr Clegg’s long-term adversary Lord Oakeshott resigned after it was revealed he leaked embarrassing private polls, which he paid for, to a newspaper and said the party was headed for ‘disaster’ under its current leadership. As a parting shot he claimed his close friend Mr Cable, who was due back in Britain last night after a week-long trade visit to China, knew about the research which suggested the party would do better with a different leader. The Business Secretary has strenuously denied trying to oust Mr Clegg. When asked whether Mr Cable was one of the plotters, Lord Ashdown, said: ‘He says not, Nick says he wasn’t, so let’s leave it at that, we have to accept him at face value.’ But pressed further on his suspicions about the Business Secretary’s role, he warned cryptically: ‘One of the rules of politics is choose your Iagos carefully.’ Shakespearian intrigue: Lord Ashdown, a staunch ally of Clegg, fanned the flames engulfing the Lib Dems by hitting out at internal enemies . Mr Clegg will attend a showdown meeting with the party’s MPs, peers and council leaders tomorrow night, as Lib Dem activists have begun circulating a motion of no confidence in him. Top of the Lib Dems’ agenda is likely to be the infighting which has followed their disastrous performance in the local and European elections, in which they lost  about 300 councillors and 11 of 12 MEPs. Lord Ashdown confirmed reports he had threatened to castrate Lord Oakeshott if he made ‘difficult days for the party more difficult’ after the elections. He told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show he said to the peer: ‘Matthew ... I will first of all remove your head and then your testicles’, if he made matters worse – but said it was meant as a metaphor. He urged the party to put aside its differences before the general election. ‘What has happened after these elections has made a bad situation worse,’ he said. ‘We now know there has been a plot of deep malice to try and remove the leader. ‘I have got a very clear message for the party, and that is anything you do now which is not getting out on the streets campaigning in the context of the next general election ... is a distraction and a dangerous distraction.’ Lord Oakeshott’s resignation letter, which savaged Mr Clegg’s leadership, escalated the crisis by making bombshell allegations that the Lib Dems are involved a cash for peerages scandal. Scottish National Party MP Angus MacNeil, who exposed the original cash for peerages affair in 2006, has over the weekend written to the Metropolitan Police asking for an investigation. Adding to Mr Clegg’s woes is the attempted comeback of Lord Rennard, the party’s former chief executive, who was suspended over claims he sexually harassed a string of women.","Lord Ashdown hints of Vince Cable's involvement in a 'plot of deep malice'

"By . Victoria Woollaston . and Ellie Zolfagharifard . Evidence of extraterrestrial clouds covering two of the most common types of planets in our galaxy have been discovered by the Hubble telescope. The atmospheres were discovered by two separate teams of scientists who were analysing the climate of planets GJ 436b and GJ 1214b. The researchers claim their work is an important milestone in characterising potentially habitable, Earth-like worlds beyond the solar system. An artist's impression of the cloudy super-Earth exoplanet GJ 1214b. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have determined the planet is shrouded by high-altitude clouds. Its parent star also raises temperatures to 232°C and these weather conditions are expected to last 'for the foreseeable future' GJ 1214b was discovered in 2009 by the . MEarth Project. It is roughly 2.7 times larger than the Earth and its star lies in the constellation Ophiuchus. Using the Hubble Space Telescope to study . light filtering through the planet's atmosphere, U.S. astronomers . determined that the planet GJ 1214b is shrouded by high-altitude clouds. Earlier studies of the planet were not . able to tell whether it had clear or cloudy skies but now scientists are . confident it is both hot and permanently overcast - a little like Venus . in our own Solar System. As was the case with Venus until the era . of space probes, the cloud cover makes it impossible to know exactly what the . planet's surface is like. GJ 436b is categorised as a 'warm Neptune' because it is much closer to its star than frigid Neptune is to our sun. The planet is located 36 light-years away in the constellation Leo. GJ 1214b, meanwhile, is known as a 'super-Earth' type planet. Super-Earths have masses between that of Earth and Neptune. Because no such planet exists in our solar system, the physical nature of super-Earths is largely unknown. GJ1214b is located just 40 light-years from Earth, in the constellation Ophiuchus. 'Both planets are telling us something about the diversity of planet types that occur outside of our own solar system; in this case we are discovering we may not know them as well as we thought,' said Heather Knutson of the California Institute of Technology. The planets can be observed passing in front of, or transiting, their parent stars. This provides an opportunity to study these planets in more detail as starlight filters through their atmospheres. For the Neptune-like GJ 436b, the results were more about what the researchers didn't find. The light, or spectra, was featureless, revealing no chemical fingerprints in the planet's atmosphere. 'Either this planet has a high cloud layer obscuring the view, or it has a cloud-free atmosphere that is deficient in hydrogen, which would make it very unlike Neptune,' said Professor Knutson. GJ 1214b was discovered in 2009 by the MEarth Project. It is roughly 2.7 times larger than the Earth and its star lies in the constellation Ophiuchus. It is called a super-Earth because it has a mass between that of the Earth and Neptune, pictured. Exoplanet GJ 436b is shown here to demonstrate scale . GJ 436b is categorised as a 'warm Neptune' because it is much closer to its star than frigid Neptune is to our sun. The planet is located 36 light years away in the constellation Leo. For the Neptune-like GJ 436b, the results were more about what the researchers didn't find. The light, or spectra, was featureless, revealing no chemical fingerprints in the planet's atmosphere. 'Either this planet has a high cloud layer obscuring the view, or it has a cloud-free atmosphere that is deficient in hydrogen,' said Heather Knutson of the California Institute of Technology. Instead of hydrogen, it could have . relatively large amounts of heavier molecules which would compress the atmosphere . and make it hard to detect any chemical signature. 'Instead of hydrogen, it could have relatively large amounts of heavier molecules such as water vapor, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, which would compress the atmosphere and make it hard for us to detect any chemical signatures.' Observations similar to those obtained for GJ 436b had been previously obtained for GJ 1214b. The first spectra of this planet were also featureless and presented a similar puzzle: The planet's atmosphere either was predominantly water vapour or hydrogen-dominated with high-altitude clouds . GJ 1214b, whose star lies in the constellation Ophiuchus, is roughly 2.7 times larger than the Earth. What its clouds are made of is still unknown, but computer simulations suggest they could be composed of potassium chloride or zinc sulphide dust. Dr Jacob Bean, leader of the University of Chicago astronomers, said: 'I think it’s very exciting that we can use a telescope like Hubble that was never designed with this in mind, do these kinds of observations with such exquisite precision, and really nail down some property of a small planet orbiting a distant star.' The observations took around 96 hours . spread over 11 months - the longest period ever devoted to studying a . single exoplanet with the space telescope. Dr . Bean's team analysed near-infrared light from the planet each time it . passed in front of, or 'transited', its star, an event that occurs every . 38 hours. Hubble's high-performance Wide Field Camera 3 is one of few capable of peering into the atmospheres of exoplanets many trillions of miles away . Follow-up observations suggested that the planet’s atmosphere was either mostly composed of water vapour or dominated by hydrogen with high-altitude clouds. The new study ruled out a cloud-free atmosphere of water, methane, nitrogen, carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. A 'flat' signal from the Hubble data, lacking chemical fingerprints, indicated the presence of high altitude clouds of uncertain composition shielding what lay beneath. The U.S. space agency Nasa's 6.5 metre James Webb Space Telescope, due to be placed in orbit later this decade, is expected to reveal more information about exoplanet atmospheres. 'Looking forward, JWST will be transformative,' said graduate student Laura Keidberg, another member of the University of Chicago team. 'The new capabilities of this telescope will allow us to peer through the clouds on planets like GJ 1214b. But more than that, it may open the door to studies of Earth-like planets around nearby stars.'","Super-Earth GJ 1214b orbits a star situated 40 light-years from Earth .

"By . Tamara Cohen . Controversial planning minister Nick Boles will unveil plans where councils will have to make land available for people to build their own homes . Councils will have to make land available for people to their build their own homes, the Conservatives will announce this week. Controversial planning minister Nick Boles will unveil a new ‘Right to Build’ scheme to allow people who have lived in a local for area for three years to buy vacant land. The local authority would have to meet their demand, and supply water, energy and other services to the property, under the radical plan to boost levels of homebuilding. Mr Boles denied these buildings would resemble the ambitious and vastly expensive projects which feature on Channel 4’s Grand Designs, saying self-building is an affordable option. He said the policy would be approved before the next election, but would then be a key part of a second Conservative government if his party wins. George Osborne indicated in the Budget that there would be support for self-builders, saying £150million had been set aside to help the first wave of councils sell 10,000 plots. But it is hoped this will be extended to hundreds of thousands of people and the cash councils earn from selling the land could be ploughed back into developing new areas for home-building. Mr Boles has already angered countryside campaigners by claiming an area the size of London needs to be made into new homes and his attempt to tear up planning rules on extensions. He is likely to encounter further opposition from traditionalists as it emerged that councils which do not sell off land could have it seized by the government’s Homes and Communities Agency, which will administer the home-building scheme. Minister are under pressure to build more than 200,000 homes a year to keep up with the growing and ageing population, and years of failure to build enough houses. Mr Boles said should be enough plots for another 100,000 homes by 2015, and said the scheme would generate the same ‘electric shock to the system’ as Right to Buy, Margaret Thatcher’s flagship policy allowing tenants to buy their council houses, did in the 1980s. Britain is well behind other countries in self-building, with just 10,000 constructed every year, compared with around 60pc of all home in Germany France and Italy. George Osborne indicated in the Budget there would be support for self-builders, saying £150million had been set aside to help the first wave of councils sell 10,000 plots (library image) Mr Boles said in an interview with the Sunday Times: ‘I hope 50,000 a year are going to councils to demand this. The councils will have a legal duty to provide them with a site. ‘Giving council tenants the right to buy their houses and flats....created a vast new army of people with a stake in their community, and a valuable asset to leave to their children.’ The policy, which will be announced at an event on Tuesday, is not just for the well-off, he said. ‘Grand Designs makes it seem like self-build is for retired people or people who want to build an amazing house out of goat hair’, he said. ‘But this is an affordable option’. Surveys suggest millions of people want to build their own homes. An individual or small group of people would team up with small building firms to build homes at a lower cost than those offered by the construction giants, he said. ‘This doesn’t mean spending the weekends laying the bricks yourself but you get the same house for much less money’. According to the National Self-Build Association, most people spent £100,000 to £150,000 building their own home, excluding the land cost, which is around 25pc cheaper than buying an identical property.","'Right to Build' scheme will allow locals to buy vacant land after three years .

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . Janet Ellis, who has suffered the pain of ten miscarriages shared her story to promote health charity Wellbeing of Women . It is a heartache she chose to keep private for many years. But having suffered the pain of ten miscarriages, Janet Ellis feels she is well-placed to observe how women can often be ‘stoic’ when it comes to their feelings. Miss Ellis, 58, one of Blue Peter’s best-loved presenters, had a string of miscarriages between 1994 and 1999. She eventually gave up on having a fourth child to focus on her daughter Sophie Ellis-Bextor, now 35 and a singer, and her two younger siblings. Sharing her story to promote health charity Wellbeing of Women, she said her gender has a tendency to ‘suffer in silence’. ‘I talked to the people who needed to know ... I didn’t want it to become the main thing about me,’ she said. Miss Ellis said she believes women often neglect their own wellbeing to care for others, adding: ‘There is a tendency for women to ignore their own health problems until things get really terrible. ‘I think most women are quite stoic about how they are feeling. They tend not to mention the trivial headache or the cold, whereas it does sometimes become a bit more of a production for men.’ Miss Ellis presented Blue Peter from 1983 to 1987. She quit after giving birth to her son Jackson, now 27, with her second husband John Leach. At the time it was speculated that the presenter was forced to leave the BBC because they were unmarried at the time. But she now insists the decision was entirely her own. She said: ‘I was prioritising baby. With two small children, and that amount of filming and live shows, it wasn’t a difficult decision to make. Janet eventually gave up on having a fourth child to focus on her daughter Sophie Ellis Bextor, pictured, and her two younger siblings . ‘Blue Peter was perfect while it lasted. Sophie was young enough to fit in with what I was doing. But I think that sort of thing becomes harder when children get older. 'I might have stayed on a couple of years if I hadn’t had Jack, but he was a jolly good reason to leave. So I never regretted it.’ Calling for more older women to be put on TV, she added: ‘I think the right person for the job, and if she happens to be an older women, then of course. A bit of positive discrimination doesn’t go amiss.’ Miss Ellis went on to have her second daughter Martha-Rose in 1991.","TV presenter suffered the pain of ten miscarriages between 1994 and 1999 .

He also described the House of Lords as a ‘bloated balloon’ in urgent need of reform. Lord Oakeshott’s claim may lead to close scrutiny of some of the peerages granted by the Liberal Democrat leader. Last year Mr Clegg ennobled Ministry of Sound owner James Palumbo – now Lord Palumbo of Southwark – who has donated more than £500,000 to the party over the past nine years. Domino’s pizza tycoon Rumi Verjee was made Lord Verjee of Portobello after handing over £770,000, some via his company Brompton Capital Ltd. His donations were investigated by the Electoral Commission in 2012 and cleared. A party list also revealed Sudhir Choudhrie was put forward for a peerage last summer, after the multi-millionaire’s family and companies gave £1.2million  since 2004, but he was passed over. Mr Choudhrie, who has been entertained at Mr Clegg’s grace and favour residence, Chevening, was non-domiciled for tax reasons until two years ago, and earlier this year he and his son were quizzed by the Serious Fraud Office as part of a probe into bribery at Rolls-Royce. Lord Oakeshott’s statement said: ‘When Charles Kennedy rang to make me a peer, he wanted me to shake up the Lords. Donations: Lord Palumbo, who donated £500,000 to the Lib Dems over nine years . 'I’ve tried  – my bills to ban non-dom peers are now law – but my efforts to expose and end cash for peerages in all parties, including our own, and help get the Lords elected have failed. The unreformed Lords is now a bloated balloon…’ Angus MacNeil, the Scottish National Party MP who uncovered the ‘cash for honours’ scandal in 2006 said the claims reignited a row over an upper house ‘full of party donors’. He said: ‘His claim resurrects this whole scandal, and we need full disclosure of which members of the House of Lords he is talking about, and what they gave in return for a peerage.’ Non-domiciled peers were banned in 2010 under Labour, with cross-party support. But Mr Clegg’s plans to slash the number of peers from more than 800 to 450, with 80 per cent elected, was dropped after 91 Tory MPs rebelled and Labour refused to back the move. Lord Oakeshott fired savage parting shots at both Nick Clegg and Vince Cable . The ‘cash for honours’ scandal saw several men who loaned money to Labour – which unlike a donation does not have to be declared – nominated for life peerages. They were reported to the police by Mr MacNeil. A resulting investigation saw then prime minister Tony Blair questioned by detectives and Labour forced to repay the loans, although no charges were brought. A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘This is absolute nonsense. Liberal Democrats have never been engaged in cash for peerages.’","Lord Oakeshott made explosive claim in devastating leaving statement .

"By . Daniel Martin . and Tamara Cohen . Militant union firebrand Len McCluskey has handed Labour its biggest donation since Ed Miliband came to power, it was revealed last night. Tories said the £1.8million from Unite, the union he leads, makes a mockery of the Labour leader’s claims to be reducing his party’s financial reliance on unions. News of the donation comes just days after Labour unveiled plans to cap private rents – a policy long demanded by Unite. Union money: Ed Miliband (left) has accepted £1.8million from Len McCluskey's Unite union . Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said the huge gift was proof that, whatever Mr Miliband claims, his party is still in hock to the unions. The figures, from the Electoral Commission, show that 75 per cent of the donations in the first quarter of this year came from unions. ‘Ed Miliband said he’d stand up to his union paymasters like Len McCluskey – but he’s failed and broken his promise,’ said Mr Shapps. ‘Ed Miliband is too weak to stand up to his union bosses and that means he’s too weak to stand up for Britain. ‘Union bosses are still in the driving seat at Labour HQ. They are holding the purse strings, selecting the candidates and picking the policies. 'We all know what this means - more borrowing, more spending and more taxes hitting families across the country.’ The commission figures show Labour lagging well behind the Tories in raising money,  with less than a year to go until  the general election. It received £4.4million in significant donations in the first quarter of the year – three-quarters of them from unions, including £2.5million from Unite and Usdaw. However, the Conservatives raked in £6.6million during the same period. Labour said the figures include only donations of £7,500 or more. A spokesman said that once small donations and party membership fees are included, union gifts make up only 32 per cent of the total. Party fees account for 35 per cent. ‘We welcome the unions’ support but it would be wrong to suggest that in any way it gains them undue influence over policy or that they are the sole source of the party’s funding,’ said the spokesman. The figures were released as Tom Watson, Labour’s former election coordinator, admitted that the party is having a ‘judder’ amid dismal poll ratings, and that some in the party ‘predict disaster’ for Mr Miliband. The former minister pulled no punches about the mood of some in the party but, writing on a Labour website, he urged activists to be ‘cheerful’ ahead of local and European elections next week. He said Ukip supporters were usually won over when they found out about the party’s policies, including a flat rate of tax for everyone from bankers to cleaners, and proposals to break up the NHS. Labour can also bank on a collapse in the Lib Dem vote and having more activists than the Conservatives, he said. US strategist David Axelrod, who propelled Barack Obama to the White House, addressed the shadow cabinet yesterday about how to sharpen up their campaign. After a disastrous week in which the Tories gained a poll lead for the first time in two years, Mr Axelrod said the cost-of-living message could win over middle-class voters. A controversial Tory donor has given £1.5million to the party just months after being granted a knighthood. The gift was accepted even though hedge fund boss Sir Michael Hintze was involved in a tax row. Two years ago, it emerged that his company CQS paid just £77,000 in corporation tax in 2010 despite annual earnings of £125million. Donor: Sir Michael Hintze, right, poses with actor Kevin Spacey at a theatre opening in London in 2009 . Half of the Tories’ total donations in the first quarter of the year - £3.2million - came from donors who attended private dinners with David Cameron and other senior ministers. Many of them are hedge fund managers. Labour claims that the Coalition has brought in £145million of tax cuts for hedge funds. The Tories also received almost £90,000 from three people who received ‘priority investor’ status when the Royal Mail was sold, allowing them extra shares.","Labour took a £1.8million donation from Len McCluskey's Unite union .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Gerri Peev . Children as young as two will start going to school under government plans to help working parents. Education minister Liz Truss is writing to every council in England to suggest that school nurseries widen their intake to youngsters a year earlier. As well as increasing access to childcare she also hopes the move will dramatically improve the academic ability of toddlers to give them a head start in their education. Younger: The move to accept children into nurseries at an earlier age would ease the childcare headache that leaves many parents relying on grandparents or childminders for up to four hours a day (file image) Ministers are also asking schools to . extend their opening hours to allow parents to leave their children . there for up to ten hours a day. The move would ease the childcare headache that leaves many parents relying on grandparents or childminders for up to four hours a day. As part of the move, the Government will introduce legislation to remove red tape that previously put off schools from opening their doors to two-year-olds. Ministers say it would open up tens of thousands more places as very few schools currently cater for the age group. Miss Truss said: ‘Schools have excellent facilities. It is age-appropriate, so what you are doing with two-year-olds in terms of singing, reading stories, playing with paint is very different from what you do with a seven-year-old. Education minister Liz Truss is writing to every councils to suggest nurseries widen their intake . ‘If you have a really high quality . school nursery, children who are behind can catch up with their peers by . the time they start school.’ The latest move comes after a Tory . proposal to allow childminders to look after more children was blocked . by the Lib Dems last year. A shortage of affordable childcare is cited by many parents – most of them mothers – as the top reason for not returning to work. Fees for nurseries have also soared by 30 per cent in the past three years, vastly outstripping wages. The average cost of 25 hours a week in nursery for a child aged two or over for is £107 – and much higher in London. But the Coalition as well as the previous Labour government have faced criticism for trying to march mothers back to work with little regard for the impact on children. While full-time childcare such as nursery can help youngsters from deprived backgrounds from slipping behind once they reach school age, it can have the reverse effect on those from other backgrounds. Yet it is middle class mothers the Government most wants to encourage back to work because of their potential to pay more in tax. Mrs Truss will give 49 primary schools a grant of £10,000 each to determine the best way of educating two-year-olds. The minister also wants parents to be able to choose how to spread their allocation of free childcare. Most state nurseries currently only offer up to three hours a day of care, forcing parents to top up their childcare elsewhere. Miss Truss told the Telegraph: ‘Many parents would prefer longer days rather than five short bursts during the week. ‘If you’re working part-time, you could have two sessions of seven and a half hours, or three sessions of five hours. It gives much more flexibility.’ All three and four year-olds qualify for 15 hours free childcare every week. The coalition has moved to extend it to the 40 per cent two-year-olds from the poorest backgrounds to get up to 15 free hours of . nursery care a week by the end of this year. Families on higher incomes . will have to pay. A government-backed survey last week showed one in three working mothers would quit their jobs to raise their children if they could afford to. More than a quarter of parents also said they struggle to meet their childcare costs. On average, families are paying out around £54 a week on nurseries, babysitters, childminders and after-school care. The . most expensive type of childcare was a nanny or au pair costing on . average £202 a week, followed by a day nursery (£105 a week on average) and a nursery school (£86 on average). The cheapest were breakfast clubs (£14 a week) and after-school activities (£22). The . poll found that 32 per cent of parents rated the affordability of local . childcare as very or fairly good, while 29 per cent were unsure and 39 . per cent said it was very or fairly poor. While . almost half (49 per cent) of those surveyed said they found it easy or . very easy to meet their childcare costs, a substantial minority - 27 per . cent said it was difficult or very difficult.","Education minister Liz Truss says plan designed to help working parents .

"By . Tamara Cohen . Frank Field said Labour needs 'big ideas' to grab the peoples' attention . Labour are considering raising an ‘NHS tax’ if they win power to plug a £30billion black hole in funding for hospitals and elderly care. Influential former minister Frank Field has put forward the idea of a 1 per cent rise in National Insurance contributions to make the NHS sustainable. The health service today costs £95billion a year but this is expected to soar to around £130billion a year by the year 2020, according to official figures from the House of Commons Library. Mr Field has argued that without drastic action, the NHS will not be able to provide free care for all. And some Labour supporters are said to be backing the scheme, hoping that it could provide a way to solve the chronic financial problems in the health service without imposing further cuts to local authority budgets. A Labour spokesman has claimed that the proposed rise is not under consideration. But Mr Field said at the weekend: ‘Labour desperately needs two or three big ideas to capture the imagination and this should be one of them. In no way can we have anything like the NHS that we have now if we are running such a huge deficit every year. ‘We have to think about the second phase of the NHS. It has to be reborn. Otherwise it will be unsustainable in a few years.’ The NHS currently costs £95billion a year to run but this is predicted to rocket to £135billion by 2020 . Andy Burnham, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, is believed to favour higher inheritance tax as a method of increasing NHS funding . Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, is thought to prefer the death taxes plan floated at the last election – which would levy 10 to 15 per cent on people’s estates when they die. A spokesman for Mr Burnham said the party needed to be ‘open to new thinking’ about the challenges of an ageing society, and stressed that a long-term solution for the NHS had to include social care.","NHS predicted to cost to £130billion a year by 2020 - a rise of £35billion .

"By . Tamara Cohen . A senior Labour MP has triggered a new immigration storm by saying Gordon Brown was right to brand Gillian Duffy – the voter who famously challenged him – ‘a bigoted woman’. Alex Cunningham, the MP for Stockton North, suggested to colleagues that the former Prime Minister was right to rail against Mrs Duffy on the campaign trail four years ago. When a former Labour official brought up the incident, Mr Cunningham said he felt that Mr Brown had been ‘too grovelling and apologetic’. A senior Labour MP suggested to colleagues that former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, pictured left, was correct to call Gillian Duffy, pictured right, a 'bigoted woman' while on the campaign trail in 2010 . Damaging: The gaffe overshadowed the 2010 campaign . He added: ‘She was a bigoted woman and that’s all there is to it'. On a calamitous day just a week before the 2010 general election, Mrs Duffy, a retired council worker, had an impromptu chat with Mr Brown as he visited her hometown of Rochdale. But in a gaffe which would overshadow the campaign, he left his microphone on his lapel as he was driven away. He was heard telling aides: ‘That was a disaster. You should never have put me with that woman’. When asked by one of his staff what she had said, he replied: ‘Everything. She is just a sort of bigoted woman, she said she used to be Labour.’ Mrs Duffy, a lifelong Labour voter, had quizzed Mr Brown about the state of the public finances, how her grandchildren could afford to go to university and why her pension was being taxed. She then moved on to immigration, telling him: ‘You can’t say anything about the immigrants….all these Eastern Europeans what are coming in — where are they flocking from?’ The lifelong Labour supporter confronted Mr Brown while he was on the election campaign trail in Rochdale and quizzed him about the state of the public finances . The grandmother said it was ‘drummed in’ to her as a child the need to help vulnerable people, but said ‘there’s too many people now’. When his comments were made public Mr Brown went to her home to deliver a profuse apology and told journalists: ‘I don’t think she is that [bigoted].’ He said he was ‘mortified’ and claimed he had misunderstood what she had said. Ed Miliband has insisted Labour has now been ‘on a journey’ about immigration and told an audience in Essex this week that people concerned about its impact are not prejudiced. But at a £100-a-head fundraising dinner for MPs and supporters at a smart London hotel this month where the incident was discussed, Mr Cunningham, 59,  - a former PR executive and aide to shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan - did not take the same stance. 'I am deeply sorry. What I said was wrong and cannot be excused. I will be writing to Mrs Duffy to offer a sincere and personal apology.' Alex Cunningham, MP for Stockton North . When the subject was raised at the event called ‘Labour the Media’, Mr Cunningham was recorded telling colleagues: ‘She was a bigoted woman and that’s all there is to it’. Yesterday he issued a statement saying: ‘I am deeply sorry.  What I said was wrong and cannot be excused.  I will be writing to Mrs Duffy to offer a sincere and personal apology.’ He had been speaking after one of the panelists at the event said: ‘With the Gordon Brown incident…my personal opinion was the woman said ‘these people’ talking about eastern Europeans. ‘She also said where do these people, these eastern Europeans come from? They come from eastern Europe don’t they? Alex Cunningham, MP for Stockton North, was recorded saying: 'Wasn't he too apologetic and grovelling to that woman? In my opinion he was.' ‘So my point is shouldn’t Gordon have said ‘she seems to me to be slightly bigoted, I only had a brief moment with her, if I offended her in any way I apologise.’ He added: ‘Wasn’t he [Brown] too apologetic and grovelling to that woman? In my opinion he was.’ The event was held two weeks ago, just ahead of the local elections in which Labour lost council seats to Ukip, which also topped the poll at the European elections. Mr Brown went to Mrs Duffy's home, pictured, to apologise in person after the embarrassing gaffe . Mrs Duffy, 69, who has said in the past she was deeply hurt by Mr Brown’s comments, did not wish to speak last night. A widow since her husband Richard, a painter and decorator, died of cancer eight years ago, she worked with disabled children for three decades, and lives alone in the town. In her exchange with Mr Brown, who she spotted on a campaign visit as she headed to the shops, she said: ‘My family have voted Labour all their lives. My father, even, when he was in his teens, went to Free Trade Hall, to sing the Red Flag. And now I’m absolutely ashamed of saying I’m Labour’. Simon Danczuk, who was elected MP for Rochdale in 2010 and was with Mr Brown on the day, said he was ‘surprised’ by his colleague’s remarks. He said: ‘Gordon was right to apologise for his comments, I think the vast majority of the public believe that. He clearly overstepped the mark. I’ve spent a lot of time with Gillian Duffy, she’s not racist she just has a concern about immigration. ‘I’m surprised there are Labour MPs who still think she was bigoted and I’m pretty disappointed. People were concerned about immigration then, and they are concerned about it now. ‘The sad thing is there’s this unhealthy consensus within the mainstream political parties that immigration is always a good thing. Sometimes it’s a bad thing and can adversely affect hard working people. It’s time to have a straight and honest debate about it.’ Tory MP Priti Patel said last night:  ‘Behind the phony public statements, this shows nothing has changed when it comes to Labour’s attitude to immigration. 'Labour opened the door to uncontrolled immigration with no thought to its impacts on communities, and as Peter Mandelson admitted, were even sending out search parties for migrants. ‘It’s the Conservatives who are building an immigration system that is fair to British citizens and legitimate migrants and tough on those who abuse the system or flout the law’.","Gordon Brown infamously called Gillian Duffy a 'bigoted woman' in 2010 .

"By . Jane Shilling . When Mary Mulry was born in Caltra, Co  Galway in 1921, no one could have foreseen that a couple of months after her 19th birthday, she would be working as a nurse in wartime, tending injured survivors of the Dunkirk evacuation. Her mother died when Mary was just three weeks old, and she was brought up by her beloved aunt in a part of Ireland  so rural that the family transport was a donkey and trap. Her father, a poetry-loving visionary who fought alongside Michael Collins and Sean MacEoin in the Irish War of Independence, passed on his passion for ideas and his independent-mindedness to Mary. Saviour: Mary, centre, tends to a patient in wartime. She was aged just 19 when she nursed survivors at Dunkirk . There were few opportunities for work in Ireland. Mary’s elder brother, Michael, emigrated to America, while Mary travelled to London in 1939 to begin training as a nurse at Guy’s Hospital. During her probation she began an intimate diary, which is now in the Imperial War Museum. The day she started her journal, May 31, 1940, began like any other. Mary noted that ‘Staff Nurse Jones reduced me to tears twice before the 9am break’. But then the order came to prepare the ward for casualties, and a fleet of ambulances arrived bearing injured Dunkirk survivors. Among the most seriously wounded was Private Brian Mullins, so severely burned that his naked body had to be suspended on straps above his bed. ‘He is about 18 — my age,’ Mary noted.Captain John Evans, the skipper of the Brighton Belle, which sank on its second return trip across the Channel, ‘got off lightly’ with a broken leg. He described the motley fleet of coasters, paddle steamers, fishing boats and pleasure boats that joined the rescue mission as ‘the queerest and most nondescript flotilla that ever was’. Mary had a narrow escape when a London hotel where she was staying on leave was bombed in the Blitz, and she took part in the Normandy landings, where patients and nurses were lodged in tents, the water supply was 2km away, and the sterilising equipment was so primitive that she commented: ‘I am sure Florence Nightingale was better off in the Crimea.’ 3,076 British nurses lost their lives during World War Two. Throughout it all, Mary’s sense of humour and her high spirits rarely failed. In Normandy there were dances with the RAF and a string of dashing chaps keen to take her out to dinner. But a note of melancholy was never far away. ‘Transient fleeting friendships are a part of the war,’ Mary wrote. ‘There is never time to get to know anybody, and for some there may not be a tomorrow.’ One man she did manage to keep in touch with was Malcolm, a subaltern whom she met on a blind date in Normandy in 1945. Unlike Mary, who had won prizes in Ireland for her dancing, Malcolm’s sense of rhythm was hopeless, but he made up for it with ‘a lovely sense of humour’. Love in a  time of war: Mary met her future husband Malcolm Morris, while on active service in Belgium. He was four years younger than Mary — ‘I feel quite ancient at times, have seen too much suffering,’ she reflected. Just two weeks after they met, he asked her to marry him, and she accepted. Their marriage would last until Mary’s death in 1997, aged 76, but they faced plenty of obstacles during their engagement, not least the question of what Mary could wear as a wartime bride. ‘I never realised that getting married entailed such a lot of fuss,’ she complained. Resourceful as ever, she wrote to a London film studio, asking to borrow one of their gowns, and they offered her a white Elizabeth dress and lace veil worn by the actress Flora Robson. (There is photograph of Mary on her wedding day, looking fabulous in her borrowed finery). Wartime bride: Mary in her nurse's uniform and on her wedding day, wearing a white Elizabethan dress . Mary is a talented writer and a humane observer of her remarkable experiences. Her diary is full of vivid, sometimes shocking vignettes, such as the starving German prisoners of war admitted to the Belgian hospital where she was working in December 1945. ‘What are we to feel or say when prisoners come in from our own PoW camps suffering from . . . advanced starvation,’ she wrote furiously, predicting that ‘this little episode will be covered up . . .  nothing of it will reach the newspapers or the people at home . . .’ Proud legacy: Mary and Malcolm with their four children, who all remember her courage and sense of adventure . But nothing crushed Mary’s spirits for long. Soon she had organised the entire ward — the Germans working alongside their former enemies — into making Christmas decorations: ‘The ward is in a state of happy chaos — most un-military, but I am determined that [it] will be a happy place this Christmas.’ In a postscript to this fascinating and deeply moving book, Mary’s daughter Kathryn reflects on the courage and sense of adventure that took her mother as a teenager from rural Ireland to the dangers of nursing in wartime Europe. ‘She had great empathy for others, and was determined to do something useful,’ she writes. It is an epitaph that anyone would be proud of.","Aged 19, Mary Mulry nursed injured survivors of the Dunkirk evacuation .

"By . Gerri Peev . Fall out: Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary and the party¿s chief election strategist has been accused of being 'impossible' to work with . Labour appeared to be in a state of civil war last night as senior figures sought to blame each other for its tumbling poll ratings. Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary and the party’s chief election strategist has been accused of being ‘impossible’ to work with. And it is claimed he has fallen out with Labour’s so-called enforcer, the shadow minister Michael Dugher and Ed Balls, the shadow Chancellor. The split comes as one poll showed Labour’s lead over the Conservatives has been squeezed to one point. Mr Dugher is said to have threatened to quit over the ‘safety first’ approach favoured by Labour leader Ed Miliband, which relies on Ukip votes drifting to the Tories, and warned he was being ‘shut out’ by Mr Alexander. He is understood to have told Mr Miliband: ‘Douglas is totally bloody impossible. Everybody says it. You have got to do something about him.’ Mr Balls is believed to have snubbed Mr Alexander at a crisis meeting chaired by the Labour leader, who insiders said was too weak to intervene. Meanwhile the party’s election guru - Arnie Graf, who mentored Barack Obama, was also said to have been sacked and sent back to the US - although Mr Alexander insisted he was still working for Labour. Yesterday, Mr Alexander denied claims of a feud in Labour’s high command. He insisted that Mr Graf was ‘absolutely’ still a part of the election campaign team. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘I don’t think it’s a great headline for the newspapers saying ‘Labour team united and working for a victory’ so I think we can dismiss some of the headlines. ‘One of the insights of this generation of Labour leaders is that it’s a totally false choice to be credible or radical. If you’re not credible then people won’t trust you with the governance of the country. If you’re not radical people just say you’re all the same. That’s why I believe that we will offer credible and radical policies.’ But one influential commentator with strong links to the Labour party yesterday laid bare the five factions of Labour. Split: It is claimed Mr Alexander has fallen out with Labour’s so-called enforcer, the shadow minister Michael Dugher (right) and Ed Balls, the shadow Chancellor (left) Andrew Rawnsley, the New Labour biographer and Observer columnist, revealed the party was divided into the following groups: . The exposure of Labour’s factions came as an Observer poll yesterday showed Labour’s lead being cut to just one point, with a backing of 33%, down two points from a fortnight ago. The poll showed the Tories on 32 per cent, up two points. But a YouGov poll for The Sunday Times suggested Labour had a seven-point advantage over the Tories. The survey put Labour on 40 per cent, with the Conservatives on 33 per cent.","Douglas Alexander has had disagreement with Michael Dugher and Ed Balls .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Problems with a conveyor system designed to haul rafts to the top of the world's tallest water slide have forced officials to cancel two scheduled media sneak preview days and could delay the ride's official opening for the third time. National and local media members were scheduled to take rides Thursday and Friday on the 17-story, 168-foot-tall Verruckt water slide, but Schlitterbahn Waterpark spokeswoman Winter Prosapio said glitches last weekend with the conveyor hadn't been resolved in time for that to happen. There's a chance the Kansas City, Kansas, attraction will be ready for operation on Sunday - more than a month after it had been slated to open May 23 - as long as the issues have been ironed out, she said. 'When we had problems this weekend, we flew in parts, flew in people, flew in all kinds of stuff,' Prosapio said Wednesday. 'Crews are still working toward Sunday. That's still our goal.' Scroll down for video . No risks: A spokeswoman for the waterpark said they'd rather face embarrassment than risk injuries . Verruckt, which means 'insane' in German, was certified as the world's tallest water slide in April by Guinness World Records. The slide sends riders on four-person rafts plummeting at 60 to 70 mph. The ride's official opening date was moved from the May date to June 5 to allow for more testing, then pushed back again to June 29. Prosapio said park officials would not hesitate to delay operation for however long it takes to make sure the slide is safe. 'We'll take embarrassment before putting someone in the slide when it is not ready,' she said. Sunday's opening would coincide with a one-hour special on the Travel Channel titled 'Xtreme Waterparks' documenting the designing and building of Verruckt. Vertigo inducing: The Verruckt - German for Insane - will become the . world's tallest, steepest and fastest water ride when it opens . 'Game changer': The 17-storey drop will beat the current record of 134.5ft held by a Brazilian slide . Huge: The enormous slide is being built at water park Schlitterbahn in Kansas City . A promotional video for the show . includes footage of two men riding a raft down a half-size test model of . the slide and going slightly airborne as it crests the top of the first . big hill. The conveyor . system hauls the 100-pound rafts to the top of the slide because 'that's . not something you can have guests carry up 264 steps,' Prosapio said. The . Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas, . inspected the ride to make sure it was structurally sound but is not . responsible for the safety of riders, Unified Government spokesman Edwin . Birch said. 'There are very few, if any, rules in the state of Kansas regulating amusement parks and rider safety,' Birch said. Prosapio said the water slide is still in the manufacturing phase and 'hasn't been handed over as a completed project.' Park owners have high hopes for the ride, which they anticipate becoming a destination attraction. The . opening of a second highly anticipated ride in the area, SteelHawk at . Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, Missouri, also has been delayed. Under construction: The slide was due to open in May but that still hasn't happened . Thrilling: Once at the bottom of the huge drop, riders are then sent up a second five-storey hill . The ride, which spins people around a 301-foot tower, was supposed to open last month. In . announcing the delay in the scheduled May 24 opening, a park spokesman . attributed the setback to bad weather and said the ride would open . within a few days. A Worlds of Fun spokeswoman didn't immediately return a call Wednesday afternoon seeking comment. In January, the makers of the giant 17-storey water slide released a terrifying promotional video of the new ride. When they finally get to ride Verruckt, thrill-seekers will be sent down in four-person inflatable rafts at more than 65mph. Bosses at the Kansas City water park Schlitterbahn promised their ride will become the world's tallest, fastest and steepest. The video showed vertigo-inducing pictures of the giant slide being built on site. The slide's drop is so steep, it is almost at a right-angle to the ground. Thrill-seekers will need to climb 264 steps to reach the top where they will wait on a deck made from railroad tanker cars. Big climb: Riders will ascend more than 260 steps to reach the top deck made from railroad cars . Building momentum: The water park released a video of the first stages of the construction work . Current record holder: Schlitterbahn bosses promise their ride will be higher than the Guinness Book of Records official tallest water ride of Insano in Brazil . They will then be sent hurtling down into the pool below. Before the Verruckt, the record holder for tallest water slide was the 134.5ft Insano slide in Fortaleza, Brazil. Larry . Pitcher, the park's director of marketing and sales, told The Kansas . City Star in January: 'We have always been family friendly, but this . will attract those adrenaline junkies who are always looking for that . next biggest, coolest thrill.' The rafts will drop more than 130ft before being sent up another five-story tall hump and then down again into the pool. Mr Pitcher said: 'At Schlitterbahn we . love rides that encourage people to share the experience. Besides it’s . more fun if someone is screaming in your ear.' The ride was designed by Schlitterbahn co-owner Jeff Henry who said it will be a 'game changer' for the industry. He has also created pioneering rides including the uphill water slide.","Problems with a conveyor system that hauls rafts to the top of the world's tallest water slide have forced officials to cancel two media preview days .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Innocent: Teresa Hughes, 39, launched a hate campaign against primary school headteacher Phil Jackson (pictured) by spreading false rumours he had abused her daughter . An angry mother launched a hate campaign against a primary school headteacher by spreading false rumours that he had sexually abused her daughter, a court heard. Teresa Hughes, 39, sent a hand-written letter to teacher Phil Jackson before bombarding Lyppard Grange Primary School in Worcester with phone calls. Hughes then met another parent outside Tesco and pretended Mr Jackson had been suspended for touching her nine-year-old daughter Gabriella. She also left a rambling message on the school's answerphone, claiming staff were trying to get Gabriella to leave. Hughes, who lives in Worcester, admitted one charge of harassment when she appeared before magistrates in the town on Monday. Prosecutor Leslie Ashton told the court the 'malicious unfounded allegations' caused Mr Jackson so much stress that he likened it to being diagnosed with cancer. The court heard how Hughes started a smear campaign following an altercation in the school playground on June 11 last year. Ms . Ashton said: 'Mr Jackson was in the school playground welcoming . students into the school when Gabriella approached him saying she wanted . to speak to him and he said he would find her later and she went off. 'Then Teresa came up to him two minutes later, raised both her arms in the air, and then walked away.' On the same day a letter arrived for the headteacher, who had been at the school since 2009, which said that Hughes had felt used. The court was told that Mr Jackson had found the letter confusing and showed it to his deputy head, who told the governors about it and contacted the local authority. Staff and governors sent a reply to Hughes after a meeting at the school two days later. On . June 14 Hughes left a number of messages on the school’s answerphone. Some said her daughter would not be returning to the school, while others accused staff of trying to force her daughter to leave. Abuse: Hughes sent a hand-written letter to Mr Jackson before bombarding Lyppard Grange Primary School in Worcester with phone calls . In her final message, she said she had spoken to her daughter and that Gabriella did not want to leave adding that the school would not be allowed to 'get away with it'. When Hughes saw another parent, whose daughter is in the same class as Gabriella, outside a branch of Tesco, she told him false rumours about Mr Jackson. Ms Ashton told the court: 'She said ""don’t tell anyone but Mr Jackson has been suspended"". 'And when he (the parent) asked why, she whispered ‘for touching Gabby’. 'These were malicious unfounded allegations against the teacher that have had an effect on him. 'The allegations have caused him such a huge amount of stress that he likened it to when he was diagnosed with cancer.' Mark Lister, mitigating, told the court that it was an unusual case, and that Hughes was of good character. Chairman of the bench Judy Hulland adjourned the case for the mum to be sentenced on March 31. Lyppard Grange Primary School is located at the heart of Warndon Villages in Worcester and has 307 pupils aged 4-11. The school received a ‘satisfactory’ rating in all areas by Ofsted inspectors in July 2012. A staff member at the school today told MailOnline that Mr Jackson did not wish to speak about the case. 'I think it's all been said,' she added.","Theresa Hughes, 39, admitted harassing headteacher Phil Jackson .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Russell Brand was left tongue-tied after being called to explain major flaws in his planned 'revolution'. The comedian plans to overthrow the Government as he claims 'parliamentary democracy doesn't work'. He also vows to legalise drugs by petitioning for a debate on the matter in the House of Commons. Scroll down for video . Irate: Russell Brand raised his voice and gestured wildly as Jon Snow suggested the comic accidentally supported politicians with a petition calling for a drug law debate in the House of Commons . But in a heated interview last night, he struggled to explain his strategy when Channel 4 News anchor Jon Snow accused the actor of accidentally supporting the government with his 'confused' manifesto. Snow, 66, suggested the petition for a debate on drug laws will stimulate politics, rather than block it. Visibly irate, Brand lashed out: 'I came on here to promote (the drug law campaign) and we don't even need to promote it. 'I don't even need to be here. I refuse to be drawn on this subject. 'You know that parliamentary democracy doesn't truly help people. Don't tell me that politics works. Just don't.' Snow went on to ask the Forgetting Sarah Marshall actor how he planned to change drug laws when he refuses to vote. Snow suggested Brand will not be able to bring about reform as he currently refuses to vote. Brand rebuffed the statement, restating that politicians are 'out of touch' The Forgetting Sarah Marshall actor admitted there are some discrepancies in the anti-drug laws petition . Eventually, the comic accused Snow of deliberately making him look foolish for entertainment . He added: 'There's confusion here . Russell. You say you don't vote, but you are asking people to sign a . petition so that politicians, that you don't want them to vote for, are . going to have to debate. 'In . effect you are doing the Government's work for them because the very . people you are saying don't vote are young people suffering from the . cuts.' Brand replied: 'That's not what I'm doing. I'm demonstrating that politicians are completely out of touch.' Snow shot a disparaging look, as Brand admitted: 'There may be some inconsistencies because I’m a man who doesn’t believe in parliamentary democracy – thinks it’s a charade – but what I want is change around this issue and I’m prepared to use the materials in front of me.' He then accused Snow of deliberately trying to make him look foolish: 'Look - listen, you. Let me talk. [Drug law reform] is more important than you, an entertainer, getting me, another entertainer, to cook up a wacky version of politics so you can make me look a bit daft.' Snow said: 'There's confusion here Russell... In effect you are doing the Government's work for them' The comedian, here performing his Messiah Complex tour last week, vows to overthrow the government . Backlash: He has been accused of using his celebrity status on shows like Question Time (pictured) to destabilise politicians . Asked if he still wanted a revolution, Brand replied: 'You know I do. That's the reason that I'm here. 'I want a revolution in the way we regard addiction as a disease, the way we treat drug addicts.' The funnyman-turned-activist sparked outrage when he revealed his anarchic intentions on Newsnight last year. He told the BBC: 'I'm angry, because for me it’s real. This is what I come from... there is going to be a revolution. 'Don't bother voting. Stop voting stop pretending, wake up, be in reality now. Why vote? We know it's not going to make any difference.' Politicians and fellow Left-wingers, including Peep Show actor Robert Webb, have blasted Brand for dangerously threatening to derail society by using his celebrity status.","Comedian, who doesn't vote, plans to overthrow the Government .

"By . Gerri Peev, Political Correspondent . and Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ukip leader Nigel Farage appeared in a video promoting ‘remarkable’ e-cigarettes after his party received £25,000 from a British manufacturer of the alternatives to tobacco, it emerged today. In the 90-second film, smoker Mr Farage is seen puffing on a large refillable e-cigarette, declaring ‘as a smoker, frankly I haven’t yet given up but I could do very easily’. It came just seven months after the makers of Totally Wicked e-cigarettes gave Ukip tens of thousands of pounds, but today the firm told MailOnline it wished it had made donations to other political parties instead. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage appeared in a video extolling the virtues of refillable e-cigarettes seven months after his party received £25,000 from a manufacturer of the devices . Describing the products as 'remarkable' Mr Farage's face is obscured by 'smoke' vapour in the 90-second film . Blackburn-based Pillbox38 Ltd, which makes Totally Wicked e-cigarettes, gave Ukip central party £25,000 on May 9, 2013. Jason Cropper, the founder of Pillbox38 who stepped down in June, also donated £11,000 as an individual on July 21, 2013. The company says it gave the money at the time because it thought Ukip was the only party making any attempt to oppose EU moves to ban refillable e-cigarettes outright. There was no connection between the donation and the video, Pillbox238 said. As the EU’s plans were being finalised . in mid-December, Mr Farage appeared in the video, posted on the YouTube . page of the EFD Group of the European Parliament. ‘Well, . there is no end to the interference,’ he says, complaining of a meeting . in Brussels between officials and MEPS on the subject of e-cigarettes. Puffing . on a smaller e-cigarette, he tells the camera: ‘They are going allow . these little ones, mostly made by the giant pharmaceutical lobby and by . big tobacco. ‘But into this . vacuum there have been a whole host of entrepreneurs producing these . kind of things with refillables,’ he adds, before picking up a larger . e-cigarette shaped like a cigar. ‘These things are remarkable,’ he . declares. ‘Let me show you.’ As his face is obscured by ‘smoke’ vapour, Mr Farage puffs away and tells viewers: ‘I have to say, as a . smoker, frankly I haven’t yet given up but I could do very easily. ‘And there are 1.8million people in Britain that are using these things. It is cutting down tobacco consumption massively. ‘It is spawning a whole new industry and yet these refillable, larger e-cigarettes are now due to be banned. ‘I want to see the British government stand up and say we under no circumstances will accept this. Will they? I am not so sure.’ The European Commission eventually agreed . that to cap the amount of nicotine in e-cigarettes, allowing a nicotine . level of 200mg in a 10ml refillable e-cigarette container, instead of . banning them outright. The . video has raised questions about links between the £25,000 donation – . its sixth largest of 2013 – and its policy on e-cigarettes. Pillbox 38, which manufactures Totally Wicked refillable e-cigarettes, gave Ukip £25,000 in May last year . Keith Taylor, a Green party MEP, told the FT: ‘While Mr Farage is free to promote any product he likes, it is worth bearing in mind that this video sees him marketing a product from an industry which gave his party £25,000 last year. ‘Considering Ukip’s dismal record in . actually turning up to the European Parliament, it’s astounding just how . much time and effort the party has put into opposing legislation on . e-cigarettes.’ Mr Farage also threw his weight behind e-cigarettes in a newspaper column on December 2. Writing . in The Independent, he said: ‘As I’m sure many people realise, I am . quite a keen smoker. I’ve always prized myself on being rather good at . it. Green MEP Keith Taylor raised questions about the donation . ‘But when a couple of old friends who have been smoking several packets a day for decades tell me that they haven’t touched a cigarette in a month because they’ve been using these new e-cigarette products it made even me want to try them out. ‘And I tell you what; they work much better than any of the stop-smoking products which have been on the market for years.’ Today Mr Farage defended the video: 'UKIP have supported the freedom to smoke E-cigarettes for a very long time. I have been extremely careful on the issue of donations and only accepted these because the public position of UKIP on E-cigs was already very clear.' A Ukip spokesman added: 'Nigel has always been campaigning on this type of thing. 'The only response we’re giving is that Nigel Farage is well known for his libertarian views on such matters.' Fraser Cropper, who took over from his brother Jason as chief executive of Pillbox38 last year, said there was no link between the donation and the video. At the time of the donation ‘the only party who seemed to be making any noise on this issue was Ukip’, he said. Mr Cropper told MailOnline: ‘Other parties and MEPs have done a sterling job since then. It was probably not the wisest thing to do.’ He said Conservative MEP Martin Callanan and Lib Dem Chris Davies had done more to stand up for users of e-cigarettes. ‘There are certainly MEPs of different political parties who I would have wanted to provide support to. ‘If I had £25,000 to donate today and I had to give it to a party it wouldn’t have been to Ukip. ‘It would have been to the Tories and Lib Dems, certain MEPs, in isolation, [who] have been acting independently.’ Pillbox38 has no plans to make future political donations, Mr Cropper added.","Ukip leader appeared in 90-second film attacking EU plans to ban devices .

A horrific murder suicide has left a town in shock after a doctor, 44, shot dead his ex-girlfriend, 22, before turning the gun on himself after she revealed on Facebook she had a new boyfriend. Dr Timothy Roses, a radiologist from Waterloo, Iowa, . fatally shot Lindsay Nichols, of Evansdale, Iowa, in the chest before . also shooting himself in the chest around 9pm on Wednesday night. They were found near an intersection in Jesup, where her new boyfriend lived. Roses was already dead and Lindsay died later in hospital. The pair were known to be in a relationship but it ended earlier this year. Friends say Lindsay was concerned about his behaviour since the breakup. Early on Wednesday, the pretty 22-year-old changed her relationship status to reveal she was in a new relationship with Chase Weber. Hours later, she was dead. According to KWWL, Roses followed Lindsay to her new boyfriend's home and shot her in the driveway when she wouldn't get into his car. Her boyfriend saw the whole thing and called 911. Lindsay was studying radiology at Covenant Medical Center in Waterloo, which is where she met Roses, according to her uncle. She was preparing to take her Iowa State Radiology Boards and, according to her family, wanted to make a difference in the lives of others. Postings on Facebook show that Roses became obsessed with the petite blonde after they broke up. She updated her status last month to reveal she had broken up with her boyfriend and that he was contacting her friends, trying to find out where she was and who she was with. On February 3 she posted: 'An invasion of privacy, it needs to stop.' Later that day she wrote: 'I . really don't think I should ever feel unsafe because I feel as if I'm . being watched.' Friends urged her to take action against him or go to the police. But she never did. According to recent appraisal district records, Roses lived in Rockwall with his wife and children.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A couple accused of murdering Vermont school teacher Melissa Jenkins lured her from her home by claiming that their vehicle had broken down, court documents revealed today. Allen Prue, 30, and his wife Patricia Prue, 33, allegedly called the 33-year-old mother out to help them on Sunday night before they strangled and beat her to death. Having killed her, they allegedly doused her in bleach and dumped her naked body into the Connecticut river. Allen Prue told police that he wanted to ‘get a girl’ on Sunday night and he had asked Jenkins out in the past, according to the court documents. Police began searching for the single mother when a friend found her unharmed two-year-old son abandoned in her idling SUV on a remote back road and raised the alarm. 'Extraordinary': Friends, family and former students paid tribute to Melissa Jenkins, who was found dead on Monday . Accused: Allen Prue and his wife, Patricia Prue were in court accused of murdering the beloved school teacher and then dumping her body in a river . The only motive suggested in the court documents was that Allen Prue told police he wanted to 'get a girl' on Sunday night, although 'they didn't plan to get one forcefully.' 'They knew Miss Jenkins and had snow plowed her driveway a couple of years ago,' Vermont State Police Major Ed Ledo said. Jenkins' former boyfriend told police she had told him she had gotten a call from a person who used to plow her driveway and she was going to help them, the documents say. The ex-boyfriend told police Allen Prue had once asked Jenkins out on a date, and she felt uncomfortable around him. In court: Allen Prue told police he wanted to 'get a girl' and had asked the victim out before . Charged: Patricia Prue, 33, and her husband face charges of 2nd degree murder and of improperly disposing of a body . Allen Prue later told police he and his wife were driving along the remote road when Patricia Prue called Jenkins and told her they had broken down. When 33-year-old Jenkins arrived to help, Allen Prue grabbed her and strangled her. They then put the body in the backseat of their car and drove to their home. At some point Patricia Prue strangled Jenkins as well, the documents said. Back at their home, they put Jenkins' body on a tarp, removed all her clothes and poured bleach on her body. The Prues also removed their clothes and put them on the tarp. They then drove to a boat access at the Connecticut River, which separates Vermont from New Hampshire, and put Jenkins' body in the water, weighing it down with blocks and concealing it with brush. They took the tarp and the clothes to New Hampshire where they burned it. Single mum: Melissa leaves behind her 2-year-old son, Ty, who was found alone in his mother's idling SUV the night she was killed . The . Caledonian-Record reported that Allen Prue also worked for the . newspaper as a deliveryman who turned up for work an hour late on the night of . Jenkins’ death. 'Allen Prue . completed his delivery route for the Caledonian Record on both Sunday . and Monday nights. Route drivers reported, however, that the Prues . arrived an hour late on Sunday night,' the newspaper said. The killing sent shudders of grief and . anxiety through the town's few thousand residents, with the community . desperate to find the killers of  the 33-year-old single mother. Community members will be relieved by the arrests of the married couple as they speculated earlier in the week who could have killed a single mother they . described as kind and helpful. Following the court appearance, Allen . Prue's mother, Donna Prue, said her son has never been in trouble with . the law before and she has faith he didn't commit the crime. 'I do not believe he would ever do . this because he didn't have it in him. I have nothing against her . (Patricia); I don't have nothing bad to say about either one,' Donna . Prue said. 'We are . deeply saddened by the tragic death of Ms. Jenkins, and our thoughts are . with her family and friends,' said the lead investigator, State Police . Maj Ed Ledo. A makeshift memorial of luminaries - white paper bags with individual . notes from students on them - lined the entry to a main building at the . prestigious St Johnsbury Academy, where Jenkins worked as a science . teacher. The boarding school also serves as the public high school for . St Johnsbury, a town of about 6,200 about 40 miles south of the . Canadian border.

'I'm done with the numbness and I'm done . with the confusion; there's a lot of sadness and a lot of anger starting . to arise.' Students were writing letters to Jenkins' two-year-old-son, Tyrell Javon . Robertson, known as Ty, so he could eventually know how she had changed . their lives, Mr Lovett said. Jenkins taught science and had served as the freshman girls basketball . coach at the academy, a school of about 970 students that was . established in the 1840s and whose alumni include President Calvin . Coolidge. Abandoned: Jenkins' two-year-old son was found inside the car with the engine running . Jenkins grew up in Danville, a tight-knit town west of St Johnsbury . where she attended the Danville School, which has about 300 students. 'All the kids go through K-12 school together.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Police in New Hampshire have the released pictures of the clothing Abigail Hernandez was wearing Sunday when she mysteriously reappeared nine months after she disappeared, though they have failed to shed any light on the strange case. The 15-year-old returned safely to her family after vanishing on the way home from school on October 9. Townspeople who searched and prayed that she would return are relieved but also looking for answers about where she's been and how she got home. State Attorney General Joseph Foster said Abigail Hernandez was reunited with her family Sunday. Authorities Tuesday released pictures of a striped sweater and black pants and a camouflage backpack, as well as a still from security footage showing the moment the teen returned to a train station this weekend. Scroll down for video . Returned: Abigail Hernandez is seen in security footage returning home Sunday. The tape has been released . Evidence: This photo shows the clothing Abigail Hernandez returned home in on Sunday . Bag: A photo of a drawstring bag in the Abigail Hernandez investigation was also released by police in an effort to decipher the mysterious case . So far, her return is cloaked in just as much mystery as her disappearance after she left Kennett High School in Conway. The family has asked for privacy, but . in a brief statement, Foster quoted Abigail's mother, Zenya Hernandez, . as saying, 'today we are the happiest people on earth.' 'I'm . glad to see she's home in one piece,' he said. 'Hopefully, her life . gets back to normal, she goes back to school and everything's good.' Police said Abigail left school at the normal time and walked the usual route toward her house that October day, sending several texts between 2:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. But she never made it home. Police revealed several months ago that she had written home to her mother. When the letter surfaced, FBI agent Kieran Ramsey said there was the possibility that Abigail, who turned 15 a week after disappearing, had run away but that someone could be coercing her into staying away. Police have not revealed the contents of the letter. Foster said the criminal investigation into Abigail's disappearance continues. After she vanished, police said they had no evidence to suggest anything suspicious and were treating her disappearance as a missing-person's case. In Conway, rescuers fanned out for days over the heavily forested terrain that surrounds the town house where Hernandez lives with her mother. Police also searched by air, stopped traffic and handed out fliers, and used boats on the Saco River and Pudding Pond. Investigators are now checking surveillance video from local businesses and asking residents if they saw Abigail or a woman wearing a striped sweater between 10 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Sunday. They said Tuesday that they, too, have many questions surrounding the disappearance and return of Hernandez. Found: A sign that had been posted on the storefront window of the Naked Bohemian boutique now reads that Abigail Hernandez has been found . Big search: A billboard on the road to Conway, New Hampshire, posts missing teen Abigail Hernandez, Tuesday . When questioned over the months about the scope of the search, law enforcement said it was appropriate to try to recover a missing child. Andrew Berg, 18, who works at a sporting goods store in North Conway, said he drove past a billboard bearing Abigail's picture and the word 'missing' on his way into Conway on Monday and lamented how discussion of her disappearance had 'blown over.' 'They I got a text from my mother saying, ""Oh my God, Abby's home!""' Berg's co-worker, Jameson Proko, said he has kept in his wallet a business card an FBI agent gave him ever since Abigail's disappearance. 'I want answers,' Proko said. 'The truth often clarifies a lot of things. And will prevent rumors.' Downs remembers the effect the disappearance had on the community. The thought that someone could snatch a child sent shudders down the spines of people in the northern New Hampshire town that relies heavily on family-oriented tourism. 'I don't know how much this cost the town but somebody should come clean about what happened,' he said of the heavy law enforcement effort. 'They didn't find her; she came home on her own, from what I know.' Abigail Hernandez, a New Hampshire teenager, has been safely reunited with her family after disappearing ten months ago . 'I want to know where she was, where . she's been for nine months,' Downs said. 'It should have been figured . out. Everybody wants to know the truth.' Police . Chief Edward Wagner said the search cost his department more than . $20,000, a third of his annual overtime budget, and that didn't include . hours worked by ranking officers who don't get overtime. At the school on Tuesday, Principal Neal Moylan pulled together summer school students to see how they were handling the news. 'These are young people who've gone through a whole range of emotions this past year,' Moylan said. 'Everybody . wonders what's going on,' Moylan said. 'We're patient. We're going to . stay out of the way and let the professionals do their job and when it's . time for us to do our job, we'll be here.' The family had received a glimmer of hope after Abby wrote and posted them a letter in the weeks after her October 9 disappearance. Authorities . revealed few details about the letter at the time out of fear copycats could hamper . the investigation and asked the family to do the same. Investigators had given no updates as to whether the letter has produced any leads. Mrs Hernandez told ABC in December that she believed her daughter was still alive. She said: 'If Abby comes back, she won't be the ''missing girl''. We can get our lives back to normal. 'I . would meet her anywhere she needs me to. She needs to know she is not . in trouble with anyone. I just love her and want her home safe.' Zenya Hernandez posted this heartbreaking letter begging her daughter to come for the holidays after she has been missing since October 9 . Abigail Hernandez's mother Zenya (pictured left) with the teenager's sister Sarah wrote a Christmas letter to her daughter begging her to come home in December. She has now safely returned . In a heartbreaking open letter with a . little sketch of a Christmas tree, the distraught mother wrote: 'I . thank God every day that you are alive! 'I miss hearing your voice and your sense of humor. Please let me know what I can do to help you. 'Please come home for Christmas.' Earlier . on December 12, she wrote on the family's site: 'I will ALWAYS love . you. I will ALWAYS have hope. i will NEVER stop looking. Love, MOM.' Abigail Hernandez wrote her mother a letter postmarked October 23 that was received by the family on November 6. Officials . delayed information about the letter so it could be thoroughly analyzed . in order to be certain that it was actually written by the teenager. Law enforcement officials say that although the letter has given them fresh hope, they fear deeply for Miss Hernandez's safety. Incentive: The FBI offered a $20,000 reward for information in the missing person case . One . FBI investigator had suggested that Abigail could face a similar danger to . the young women in Cleveland, Ohio who escaped after being held for ten . years by Ariel Castro. Authorities . also released a picture of necklace that the teenager often wore along . with a purse she was carrying at the time of her disappearance, in the . hope of jogging someone's memory. The missing girl has no source of income, so someone was . helping her 'whether that is a friend or what we fear is a foe,' police said at the time. FBI investigator Kieran Ramsey said that they feared although Abby may have left willingly, she was now being coerced or manipulated. Since . her disappearance, Miss Hernandez's parents have made repeated public . pleas for her safe return - even stating in a televised interview that . they believe she got in a car with someone and that they believe she is . in serious trouble. The last call . made on a missing New Hampshire girl’s cellphone was October 9 about . four hours after she was last seen, investigators said. The . last sighting of the girl, who ran on the track team for her school and . was described as quiet and bright, was around 2.30pm.","Abigail Hernandez, 15, disappeared October 9 in Conway, New Hampshire .

Jenkins' 2-year-old son was found unharmed in his mother's idling SUV the night she went missing. 'Extraordinary': Friends, family and former students paid tribute to Melissa Jenkins, who was found dead on Monday . The crowd of mourners wore pink, hundreds of pink balloons were put up and the whole community donned pink ribbons in tribute to the young mother who was described  as ‘extraordinary young woman’.

Victim: Students paid tribute to their former science teacher and have written letters to her 2-year-old son so he knows how much of a difference she made to them . Last weekend police began searching for the single mother when a friend found her unharmed two-year-old son abandoned in her idling SUV on a remote back road and raised the alarm. She was found in the Connecticut River on Monday and Allen Prue, 30, and his wife Patricia Prue, 33, face 2nd degree murder charges and . charges of improperly disposing of a body. They have pleaded not-guilty to the charges. The couple allegedly called the 33-year-old mother out to help them on Sunday night before they strangled and beat her to death. Having killed her, they allegedly doused her in bleach and dumped her naked body into the Connecticut river. Allen Prue told police that he wanted to ‘get a girl’ on Sunday night and he had asked Jenkins out in the past, according to the court documents. The only motive suggested in the court documents was that Allen Prue told police he wanted to 'get a girl' on Sunday night, although 'they didn't plan to get one forcefully.' Charged: Allen and Patricia Prue appeared in court this week charged with the school teacher's murder . 'They knew Miss Jenkins and had snow plowed her driveway a couple of years ago,' Vermont State Police Major Ed Ledo said. Jenkins' former boyfriend told police she had told him she had gotten a call . from a person who used to plow her driveway and she was going to help . them, the documents say. The ex-boyfriend told police Allen Prue had once asked Jenkins out on a date, and she felt uncomfortable around him. Allen . Prue later told police he and his wife were driving along the remote . road when Patricia Prue called Jenkins and told her they had broken . down.

"By . Jack Doyle . 'Fobbing off': Baroness Newlove, the Government's Victims' Commissioner criticised the police response to yobbish behaviour . Police are fobbing off sufferers of anti-social behaviour by asking them to write a diary of their experiences instead of taking action, the Government’s Victims’ Commissioner said last night. Helen Newlove said those targeted by yobs were ‘living in fear’ and needed officers to take action. She claimed police had not learned from the deaths of victims Fiona Pilkington and David Askew. Mrs Pilkington killed herself and her disabled daughter in 2007 by setting fire to their car after officers ignored a campaign of terror against them. The 38-year-old mother complained repeatedly about the abuse. Mr Askew, 64, had a mental age of ten and was ‘tormented to death’ in 2010 by youths who harassed him for more than a decade in Hattersley, Greater Manchester. Police had been called to his house ten times in the previous year over reports of anti-social behaviour. Baroness Newlove – whose husband Garry was killed by a drunken mob outside their home in Warrington, Cheshire, in 2007 – said she  struggled to make police understand that anti-social behaviour was serious and victims needed proper support. She added: ‘Don’t just give them a diary to fill in, because that’s an irritant in itself. If you’re being really traumatised you haven’t got the energy to fill it in. ‘We have to learn lessons of Fiona Pilkington, we have to learn the  lessons of David Askew. You don’t learn any more lessons by losing somebody else.’ She said that despite Government efforts to crack down, there were still 2.3million victims of yobbish behaviour every year. Baroness Newlove added: ‘We have got to recognise anti-social behaviour is a huge issue - 2.3million victims is a hell of a lot.’ She also dismissed a new law  known as . the ‘community trigger’ that forces police to respond after someone . makes three complaints in six months. 'Learn the lessons': Baroness Newlove said police must take into account examples like Fiona Pilkington, left, who killed herself after police ignored her plight, and David Askew, right, who was killed by youths he confronted over the havoc they caused outside his house . She said: ‘Actually it’s about the first call. You do not wait for three. Anti-social behaviour isn’t a low-level crime. Garry died from anti-social behaviour – and then it was a murder.’ Mr Newlove was set upon by a gang of up to 15 youths when he went to remonstrate with them for causing havoc outside the family’s home. He died two days later in hospital and three teenagers were convicted of his murder. Made a Tory peer by David Cameron and charged with representing victims, Baroness Newlove said many complainants were intimidated by the criminal justice system, adding: ‘It is very cold and clinical. We need to make it more human.’","Baroness Helen Newlove said police do not take victims seriously enough .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Do you get tearful when drunk? If you’re a woman, then your sex may be to blame. A recent study has found that young women get the booze blues after one too many glasses while men stay cheerful. Research was carried out on 151 Danish girls and 79 boys, aged 15 to 20, who attended high-school parties. A recent study has found that young women get the booze blues after one too many glasses while men stay cheerful . While drinking, the students visited an examination room near the party in one-hour intervals to have their Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) and levels of cheerfulness, focus distraction, and sluggishness measured. BACs were measured by means of a breath analyser, while the participants rated their level of cheerfulness from 0-16, focus distraction from 0-8 and sluggishness from 0-4. Professor Marie Eliasen, of the University of Southern Denmark, said: ‘We found that low to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with increased cheerfulness among adolescents attending high-school parties. ‘Extensive alcohol consumption leading to . high BACs was associated with decreased cheerfulness among girls, while . this was not found for boys.’ The lack of a dip in cheerfulness in men could be down to a higher alcohol tolerance among males as they binge drank more frequently . The finding may work as an argument for parents and clinicians trying to reduce excessive alcohol consumption among teens . The professor explained the lack of a dip in cheerfulness in higher BACs boys could be down to a higher alcohol tolerance among males as they binge drank more frequently and generally had a higher weekly alcohol intake than the girls. To combat this professor Eliasen recommended rather than employ scare tactics in public-health campaigns, alcohol prevention strategies targeting teens should instead focus on having fun without excessive boozing. She added: ‘Our findings of increased focus distraction at high BACs stress the importance of reducing excessive alcohol drinking, as increased focus distraction is strongly associated with higher risks of accidents. ‘This finding may also work as an argument for parents and clinicians trying to reduce excessive alcohol consumption among adolescents. ‘And the finding of a low to moderate BAC among the majority of the students may be used to challenge the idea that the majority of adolescents drink in excess and thus change adolescents' own perception of normality, which again may reduce their alcohol consumption.’ The findings will be published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. Alcohol tastes sweeter when loud music is playing and the noise could make it difficult for drinkers to judge how much they are consuming, new research has claimed. Dr Lorenzo Stafford, a psychologist from the University of Portsmouth, in a series of related studies, explored how environment affects perceptions of alcohol and drinking behavior. Dr Stafford said: 'Since humans have an innate preference for sweetness, these findings offer a plausible explanation as to why people consume more alcohol in noisy environments.' In Dr Stafford's research, 80 participants (69 females and 11 males aged between 18 and 28 and regular drinkers) had to rate a selection of drinks varying in alcohol content on the basis of alcohol strength, sweetness and bitterness. They were given one of four different levels of distraction, from no distraction to loud club-type music playing at the same time as reading a news report. The tests found that drinks were rated significantly sweeter overall when participants were listening to music alone.","Research was carried out on 151 Danish girls and 79 boys, aged 15 to 20 .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A fast-food worker in southern New Jersey has been caught on video viciously beating and kicking a mother in front of her young son as a group of people stood by and did nothing to help he. As bystanders watched and some recorded it on cell phones, the woman in a burgundy McDonald's uniform pummeled the mother and kicked her in the back along a trail in Salem on Tuesday night. The suspect is also heard threatening to attack the victim's 2-year-old son, who repeatedly kicked the suspect's legs to stop her from hurting his mother. Scroll down for video . Face-off: Police in New Jersey have obtained this cell phone video showing a female McDonald's worker dressed in a burgundy uniform confronting a young mother in a wooded area in Salem . Pummeled: The attacker, identified as Latia Harris, pulled the 27-year-old woman to the ground in front of her 2-year-old son and proceeded to punch her in the face about 20 times . Salem Police Chief John Pelura III said the attacker has been identified as 25-year-old Latia Harris. She remains at large. Wanted: Latia Harris, 25, is facing charges of assault and making terroristic threats . According to Pelura, the 27-year-old victim told officers a woman named 'Tia' who works at McDonald's accused her of spreading rumors about her and her manager. The victim has been treated at a hospital for her injuries. Police obtained a copy of the video depicting the attack before it was removed from Facebook. The graphic footage shows the McDonald's employee pounding another woman as a group of people stand around and watch in a wooded area behind the McDonald’s eatery on East Broadway in Salem. After the victim is thrown to the ground, the attacker proceeds to punch and kick her at least 20 times. The woman's toddler tries to intervene on his mother's behalf by kicking her assailant and yelling at her to stop. ‘Mommy!’ the little boy cries out. At one point, Harris threatens to beat up the 2-year-old. 'Monstrous': The victim's son tried to intervene by repeatedly kicking her attacker in the legs until Harris threatened to kick the 2-year-old in the face (right) No mercy: The assailant kicked the mother in the back as she lay on the grass in a fetal position with witnesses standing around her . ‘You better get your son before I kick him in the [expletive] face too,’ she screams. The beating ends with the McDonald's staffer spitting on the victim lying bleeding on the ground. Before . she walks away, the woman warns the brutalized young mother: 'It's not . over... you almost made me lose my job… stupid tramp.' Police officers were called to the scene just after 7pm after receiving reports of a woman covered in blood. They found the 27-year-old bleeding . profusely from her face and acting disoriented and confused. She was . taken to The Memorial Hospital of Salem County to be treated for injuries to her face. Chief Pelura said in a statement to . MailOnline Thursday that criminal complaints have been signed against . Harris for aggravated assault and two counts of terroristic threats, but . she could face additional charges after her arrest. Bail for Harris has been set at $35,000. One of the complaints stated that Harris threatened to shoot the 27-year-old mother. According to the police chief, Harris has not returned to work since the Tuesday assault. Ominous warning: The 25-year-old allegedly threatened to shoot the victim as payback for nearly getting her fired from McDonald's before she spat on her and walked away . Her last known address is currently vacant and police are working to identify family members and potential locations of Harris’ whereabouts. 'Police in this county deal with this type of violence everyday. Yet, this video is physically sickening to watch,' Pelura stated. 'There is a moral and social breakdown in the fabric of our society which is clearly evident when a woman gets pummeled in broad daylight in front of her child while a dozen people pull out their phones to record the incident instead of calling for help.' He added: 'There is so little regard for human life - by the actor and the bystanders.'","Video of the beating was recorded by a bystander Tuesday behind a McDonald's in Salem, New Jersey .

"By . Sam Webb . Accident: Jade Pemberton took anti-depressants and another prescription drug as she and a friend waited at a bus stop after skipping lessons . A schoolgirl of 15 accidentally killed herself after she and a classmate swallowed a lethal cocktail of prescription painkilling tablets 'for fun,' an inquest heard. Jade Pemberton took anti-depressants and another prescription drug as she and her friend waited at a bus stop   after skipping lessons. The youngsters then began to feel tired and Jade's lips 'turned blue' as she fell asleep on the bus during the trip home. She managed to get to the flat where she lived with father David Pemberton in Blackpool, Lancashire, but fell asleep again on the sofa after a brief   conversation. The following morning Mr Pemberton went to wake his daughter but got no response and called an ambulance. The youngster was pronounced dead at the   scene having died in her sleep. Tests showed her nervous system having slowly shut down due to the high amount of drugs in her system. Inquiries revealed the friend, 15, - who cannot be named for legal reasons - stole prescription  tablets from her mother's medicine   bag where they were kept to treat back pain. She was was taken to hospital to be checked by medics but was discharged. She later appeared before a youth court where she admitted supplying   drugs. At an inquest in Blackpool a coroner said the case served as a 'reminder' to parents who leave potentially dangerous medication within easy reach of   youngsters. The hearing was told Jade was described by her father as a child 'with her own mind from a very early age'. She had known her friend from the age of   four, but they were said to be 'bad influences' on each other. The tragedy occurred on November 12 2012 after Jade visited a house during the day while her friend waited around a corner and returned with what she   described as 'happy pills'. Overdose: Jade's lips 'turned blue' as she fell asleep on the bus during the trip home after taking the pills with her friend as they skipped school . Both began swallowing the tablets and as the girls waited for a bus the friend said Jade tried to run in front of a vehicle   but she pulled her back. Then during the bus journey around the resort town the friend said Jade fell asleep and when she awoke she was 'pale' with 'blue lips'. Another teenage friend, who had been in contact with Jade that evening via text, told the hearing the 15-year-old had told her she had 'taken an   overdose' and felt as if she might 'pass out'. Fatal: A post-mortem examination revealed Jade had fatal levels of the drug in her system which slowly shut down her nervous system . Jade made it home at 10.30pm and Mr Pemberton said in a statement: 'Within five or ten minutes of getting in the house she was asleep. 'We didn't have a   conversation about where she had been. 'She was making a snoring noise. It was very loud as if she was wheezy. I tried to wake her up at some point in the early hours. I asked if she was OK and she grunted. 'I didn't move the duvet or look at her. I thought she was OK. 'At some point I fell asleep and was woken by the phone ringing. It was the school family   liaison. 'We had a 10am meeting. He said he was outside the flat so I went to let him in. I went to Jade and tapped her leg and in due course realised she was   dead and called an ambulance.' Police inquiries led to Jade's friend and she was arrested. In her statement to police the girl, now 17, said: 'Jade asked me about the (drugs) and I   said they were for my mother's for back pain. 'She asked if she could have one. I said no but she took one. 'Before we went to the bus stop Jade went in someone's house and came back with happy pills. We both had some but Jade had more. I said yes to having them, I didn't   really like saying no to her. 'While on the bus I woke up and Jade looked pale and had blue lips. She said she was cold. I gave her my jacket to help her to warm up and   20 minutes later she had her colour back. 'She wasn't thinking straight and was worried about what might happen taking that many pills. We just took them for fun.' The pair went on a bus ride around Blackpool (pictured) after taking the pills and Jade fell asleep. She also told a friend she'd overdosed. The coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure . The hearing was told her friend escaped with an absolute discharge at a local youth court which means she will have no criminal record. The girl's mother said all her children knew where her medication was kept as she would ask them to get them for her when needed, but added she now   kept them locked away following Jade's death. The mother said: 'I was totally shocked by what happened. I never thought anything would happen. 'Now they're locked away.' Recording a conclusion of death by misadventure, Blackpool coroner Alan Wilson said: 'This inquest serves as a reminder to adults in terms of taking   particular care in where they store medication within the home and a reminder as to what may happen if young people have the opportunity to get access   to it. 'We have heard there was missing tramadol in the mother's property but how much is less clear. Why Jade took the medication needs to be addressed. It   seems she was having difficulties for one reason or another. 'But I am not in any way sure it was intended by her to take her life and I feel quite comfortable being satisfied to the standard. 'The definition of misadventure is the unintended consequence of a deliberate act. In my judgement what she hasn't intended is the consequence and she   didn't intend to die as a result. 'Jade voluntarily ingested a large quantity of medication. She intended to take the tablets but did not intend to die.'","Jade Pemberton died after taking the drugs her friend stole from mother .

"By . Jack Doyle . and Hugo Gye . Britain was today accused of being the most 'in your face' sexist country in the world by a UN expert from South Africa. Rashida Manjoo, who is compiling a report on violence against women in the UK, said that the country has a 'boys' club sexist culture'. Her evidence for that 'culture included women being wolf-whistled in the street and the popularity of social media, while she blamed the Government's cuts for increasing society's entrenched sexism. Critics ridiculed Ms Manjoo's comments, pointing out that gender inequality in Britain pales in comparison to countries such as Saudi Arabia where women face systematic repression. Sexism: Rashida Manjoo, the UN's special rapporteur on violence against women, today said the culture of gender inequality in Britain was 'more prevalent' than anywhere else . The UN special rapporteur on violence against women originally comes from South Africa, known as the 'rape capital of the world', where has been estimated that  40 per cent of women will be raped at some point in their lifetime. The other countries she has visited as part of her duties include Somalia, where women are routinely subjected to female genital mutilation, and Papua New Guinea, where polygamy is common. Ms Manjoo has been in Britain for two weeks investigating the prevalence of violence against women, and today announced her preliminary findings. She said: 'Have I seen this level of sexist culture in other countries? It hasn't been so in-your-face in other countries. I haven't seen that so pervasively in other countries. I'm sure it exists but it wasn't so much and so pervasive. 'I'm not sure what gives rise to a more visible presence of sexist portrayals of women and girls in this country in particular. What is clear from these indications of portrayals of women and girls is that there is a boys' club sexist culture. That exists and it does lead to perceptions about women and girls in this country.' The special rapporteur added: 'If I was walking down the street and there were whistles - which won't happen at this stage in my life - but that's sexist culture.' Ms Manjoo, a lawyer and academic, pointed to 'the easy availability of porn, the use of social media including influencing young children around images', as well as 'harassment on the Tube'. In the 2013 Global Gender Gap Report issued by the World Economic Forum, the UK was ranked the 18th most equal out of 136 countries surveyed. Former minister Edwina Currie dismissed the idea that Britain was uniquely plagued by sexism. She told the Telegraph: 'Why can't she go to a country where women can't drive cars, or have maternity leave? There are plenty of countries where women face serious problems. 'You can't say they have a big problem in the UK. Most of the women I know like living here and enjoy being in a diverse and interesting society.' Ms Manjoo - who visited London, Leicester, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast, Cookstown, Cardiff and Bristol - also suggested that cuts in public spending were increasing gender inequality. 'Access to trauma services, financial support and housing are crucial, yet current reforms to the funding and benefits system continue to adversely impact women's ability to address safety and other relevant issues,' she said. The special rapporteur claimed that she had been denied access to the controversial Yarl's Wood women's detention centre despite repeated requests to the Government. She said: 'Due to receiving information from the third sector, I was keen to speak to detainees in this facility to objectively seek information on violations being experienced.' Some of the countries Rashida Manjoo has visited as part of her UN duties include: . BANGLADESH: Miss Manjoo noted ‘the strong persistence of patriarchal attitudes towards women’. She said she had been prevented from visiting a refugee camp where she had received reports of ‘sexual and gender-based violence’. PAPUA NEW GUINEA: She said violence against women was pervasive, blaming a belief in sorcery. In 2012 she said she was shocked by the brutality of assaults against suspected sorcerers, including, rape, mutilations and murder. Polygamy also led to violence. KYRGYZSTAN: Miss Manjoo had concerns about bride kidnappings, sexual harassment and violence against lesbians. In 2009, she reported: ‘Unregistered religious marriages, early marriage and polygamy are increasingly undermining women’s rights.’ EL SALVADOR: Following her 2010 visit, Miss Manjoo said that ‘of particular concern is the alarming rise in the number of murders of women and girls and the brutality inflicted on their bodies, which is often accompanied by kidnapping and sexual assault’. JORDAN: Miss Manjoo expressed concern in 2011 over ‘laws that are discriminatory to women’. She said ‘women still do not enjoy equal rights and responsibilities with regard to marriage, divorce, custody issues and personal status’. SOMALIA: She was concerned by problems of female genital mutilation during her visit in 2011 and said ‘impunity for violence against women is the norm’. Danger? The UN expert warned that British women face harrassment on the Tube (file photo) A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'Violence against women and girls in any form is unacceptable and the Government has shown its commitment to ending it. 'A comprehensive programme was drawn up for the Special Rapporteur's visit, including meetings with the Home Secretary, the Minister for Crime Prevention, and the Chief Inspector of Prisons. 'Several other options, including a trip to a women's refuge, were turned down by the Special Rapporteur.' Ms Manjoo is only the latest in a string of UN special rapporteurs to lecture Britain over alleged social problems. Last year, Raquel Rolnik was denounced by MPs as a 'loopy Brazilian leftie' after she called for the abolition of the so-called bedroom tax. And in 2011, Yves Cabanne accused an Essex council of breaking human rights law by evicting a group of travellers from the illegal Dale Farm site.","UN special rapporteur Rashida Manjoo is compiling a report on violence against women .

"By . Dan Bloom . MP: Eric Joyce insisted he did not have a drinking problem today outside court, pictured . Falkirk MP Eric Joyce has said he is considering his future as a politician after he admitted calling an Afro-Caribbean baggage handler 'f****** fat and black'. The 53-year-old, who was thrown out of the Labour party after a brawl in a House of Commons bar, was drunk by the time he landed at Edinburgh Airport and hurled abuse at staff on May 19 last year. After he was fined £1,500 he insisted he did not have a drinking problem - but said he will 'reflect' on whether he will remain in Westminster. The MP will not be automatically disqualified from the Commons - that is only possible if MPs are jailed for a year or more. He had been drinking on an evening . flight from Heathrow to the Scottish capital last May, realising later . that he left his phone on board, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard today. He asked airport baggage handlers for help but became abusive when they asked for flight details. Police officers became involved, but he continued to hurl insults. Joyce repeatedly called a baggage handler and officers 'fat, f****** w*****s' and goaded officers to 'f****** arrest me'. He also referred to an officer of Afro-Caribbean origin as 'f****** fat and black'. Joyce . began to 'flail his arms' when one officer attempted to put him in . handcuffs, and he continued to resist until he was restrained on the . floor. Sheriff Frank Crowe described his actions as a 'deeply unfortunate, prolonged, drink-fuelled rant'. 'At least you have taken this opportunity to apologise,' the sheriff said. As . well as imposing a fine, the sheriff ordered Joyce to pay £100 . compensation to airport staff and £50 to the police officer he racially . insulted. Outside court the 53-year-old said he will now 'reflect' on whether to continue at Westminster until the election next year. Abuse: The MP called an Afro-Caribbean baggage handler at Edinburgh Airport 'f****** fat and black' 'My instinct is to stay but I don't know how I will feel in a few days,' he said outside court. 'I am very embarrassed that this has happened... My constituents have seen this before, so they might think other apologies are not meant, but they are.' Asked if he had a problem with alcohol, Joyce said: 'I think I am well past that now.' Defence lawyer Euan Gosney told the court Joyce was in a 'high state of anxiety' because of the recent death of his brother and previous trouble with police. 'He accepts that he allowed this baggage to get on top of him, to get the better of him,' he said. 'When he was faced with what he perceived to be a lack of assistance, he allowed himself to become emotional, to overreact, to become abusive.' Mr Gosney added: 'A conviction of this nature will inevitably make a return to any form of public life difficult, if not impossible.' Apology: The MP's lawyer told the court he was under strain at the time and was sorry for his actions . Joyce became an independent MP after he was expelled from the Labour Party following his conviction for assaulting politicians in a House of Commons bar in 2012. The former Army major was fined £3,000 and banned from pubs for three months following the brawl in the Strangers' Bar. Joyce's arrival at Westminster in 2000 came shortly after he quit the Army, making claims of snobbery, sexism and racism in the armed forces. He was elected to Parliament as Labour MP for Falkirk West in a by-election. He increased his majority in the general elections of 2001 and 2005 when the constituency was renamed Falkirk after constituency changes, and held on by a comfortable margin in 2010. The selection of his replacement as Labour candidate in Falkirk became emroiled in a major scandal amid claims of vote-rigging.

"By . Joel Christie . Police in Ontario had to call in officers from every division to break up a wild house party on Friday night, with 60 cop cars showing up to control the 2,000 people who turned up for the 'monster mansion party'. The raucous Brampton hoedown was discovered by police on Twitter, where it was being promoted under the hashtag #MansionParty. Officers had gone to the still-under-construction home on Stanley Carberry Dr. earlier in the night to warn the mother that her son's party was being touted on social media. She said: 'I told my son he could have some friends over.' Scroll down for video . 'Quiet night with a few friends': Social media snaps show an estimated 2,000 packed into a sprawling home in Brampton, Ontario, on Friday night after it was promoted on social media . The home, which is thought to have been under construction for years, was 'trashed', according to one reveler, with an estimated $70,000 worth of damage .

One reveler, who identified himself as Nick and said he was 16, said he heard about the party on social media and arrived to a line-up of about 200 cars and a tour bus packed with people. 'I have seen something like this in the movies, but never in real life,' he told The Record. 'There were hundreds of people here. Some people were climbing over ladders and smashing the windows.

"By . John Hall . A poor Indian couple have made a desperate appeal for financial help to save the life of their son who was born with his heart outside his body. Priyanka Pal, 24, was rushed to the labour room of the government-run Sultanpur Hospital in Uttar Pradesh state late last Wednesday where she gave birth to a baby boy. But the baby was born with the incredibly rare condition ectopia cordis, which left his heart protruding from his chest, and now needs expensive emergency surgery to prevent him from dying within days. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . In need: The as-yet-unnamed baby was born in Uttar Pradesh state on Wednesday. He is suffering from ectopia cordis - an incredibly rare heart condition . Gave birth: Priyanka Pal, 24, (pictured with baby) was rushed to the labour room of the government-run Sultanpur Hospital in Uttar Pradesh state late last Wednesday . The incredibly rare condition affects only eight in every one million births, with 90 per cent of these  babies either stillborn or dying within the first three days. Ectopia cordis is a congenital malformation in which the heart is abnormally located either partially or totally outside the thorax. The condition can cause the heart to be located anywhere from the neck to the lower abdomen, although in most cases it protrudes outside the chest through a split sternum. Incredibly rare, the condition only only eight in every one million births, with 90 per cent of these babies either stillborn or dying within the first three days - usually through infection, hypoxemia, or cardiac failure. Although the exact cause is unknown, ectopia cordis is thought to be related to problems with the development of the baby's lateral plate mesoderm in early pregnancy. The development of the muscles that hold the baby's organs in place fails, leading to them bursting through barely developed muscle and bone, and continuing to grow outside the skin. The fact this baby - who has not yet been named - has survived into his sixth day means he has already beaten odds of less than one in a million. But if he is to survive much longer, the baby boy needs to have emergency surgery at a private hospital, as none of the state-run facilities in the area are able to carry out the complex operation. The family are desperately poor, however, living on father Nirbhay Pal's income of less than £3 a day and there is no way they can fund the private healthcare without help. Mr Pal, 30, who works as a mason at construction sites, said staff at Sultanpur Hospital told him his son would not live long with his condition, and needs urgent treatment at a more sophisticated medical facility. 'The doctors said we should go to a private hospital and get surgery done,' Mr Pal said. 'But I am a poor man. We can barely afford two square meals a day. I don't know what to do. We are hoping that the government will help us,' he added. 'I have put everything at stake to save my child. We are feeling so helpless. We don't know where to go,' Mr Pal went on to say. Survivor: The fact this baby has lived into his sixth day means he has already beaten odds of less than one in a million. The condition affects only eight in every million births, with 90 per cent dying within three days . The baby has now been shifted from Sultanpur Hospital to a facility in the neighbouring city of Dehradun. It is not yet known how much the operation will cost, and the child is likely to have to move hospitals again if the treatment is going to be carried out. Mr and Mrs Pal married four years ago, with the baby boy their first child.","The as-yet-unnamed baby was born in Uttar Pradesh state on Wednesday .

"By . Jenny Hope . A new breast cancer drug which extends women's lives by almost six months is now available for patients . A new drug for breast cancer which extends women’s lives by almost six months while reducing toxic side effects including hair loss is now available for patients. Campaigners claim the drug Kadcyla offers a ‘precious lifeline’ for women with the most aggressive form of the disease who have tried other treatments. It is the first medicine of its kind for breast cancer and is designed to destroy cancerous cells while sparing healthy tissue from unnecessary damage. Kadcyla, also called T-DM1, combines the original ‘wonder’ drug Herceptin with a potent chemotherapy agent. It is expected up to 1,300 women a year in England could benefit from the drug, which costs £6,000 a month. Results from a major trial show it prolonged the lives of patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer by 30.9 months compared with 25.1 months on standard therapy. Patients had fewer, less severe side effects and reported a better quality of life. Around 10,000 British women have HER2-positive breast cancer diagnosed each year, about one in five of those affected. Paul Ellis, Professor of Cancer Medicine at King’s College London, said: ‘Kadcyla represents a new way of targeting HER2-positive breast cancer, which ultimately means that we could extend patients’ lives compared to existing chemotherapy treatment. ‘In addition, we should be able to reduce many of the symptomatic side effects associated with standard chemotherapy.’ Kadcyla seeks out and kills cancerous cells in a two-stage attack. It attaches to the tumour cell and blocks signals that encourage the cancer to grow and spread, then breaches the outer defences and releases a payload of chemotherapy to destroy it from within. Because its action is so precise, a normally toxic form of chemotherapy can be used but healthy tissue is spared from unnecessary damage. The cancer is delayed from returning and side effects from chemotherapy such as diarrhoea and hair loss are significantly reduced. Made by Roche, Kadcyla is administered intravenously once every three weeks. Professor Ellis, who also works at Guy’s Hospital, London, said at least 1,000 women a year would benefit from the drug after relapsing, but eventually it might be used before the disease spread, possibly replacing current treatment using Herceptin and chemotherapy as separate agents. It is expected up to 1,300 women a year in England could benefit from the drug, which costs £6,000 a month (stock picture) Trials at earlier stages are taking place, he added, and it was possible the technology could be effective in treating other types of tumour. Emma Pennery, of Breast Cancer Care, said: ‘The priority now must be that Kadcyla is made widely available across the UK as soon as possible for patients with advanced breast cancer whose lives could be extended from its use.’ Kadcyla will be available to patients in England through the Cancer Drugs Fund and requests for the treatment can also be made in other parts of Britain. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Scottish Medicines Consortium will decide whether the NHS should fund it in the longer term. Dr Caitlin Palframan, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘While we are very pleased that this new treatment will now be made available on the Cancer Drugs Fund throughout England, it’s important to point out that this fund is only guaranteed until 2016.’","Campaigners claim Kadcyla offers a 'precious lifeline' for sufferers .

"By . Jack Doyle . The former prime minister said it Ed Miliband must not win any votes by taking a tougher line on immigration and Europe. He said changing course now would only 'confuse' voters . Tony Blair was criticised last night for complaining about voters who elected Ukip MEPs opposed to rampant immigration – despite  running an ‘open door’ policy on migrants while in office. The former prime minister said it was wrong that the debate on the EU was dominated by ‘anti-immigrant feeling and a desire to get Britain out of Europe’. These, he added, were ‘not answers to what is happening in the world’. But critics pointed out that it was Mr Blair’s policies which caused the problems in the first place by allowing immigration to run rife over the last decade, creating the largest population explosion since Saxon times. In his comments, made to a Swedish television station, Mr Blair said: ‘Of course we should be worried when a party like Ukip comes first in the European election, it would be foolish not to be. ‘But on the other hand we also have to stand for what is correct and right for the future of Britain in the 21st century. ‘When the world is changing so fast, to end up having the debate dominated by anti-immigrant feeling and a desire to get Britain out of Europe, these are not solutions for the 21st century.’ But Douglas Carswell, the Tory MP for Clacton, said Mr Blair was a member of a ‘supranational, smug, anti-democratic elite’. He added: ‘Tony Blair was in charge of this country when the floodgates were opened. ‘He did nothing to control immigration. It is obnoxious and morally wrong for him to suggest that there is something illegitimate about people voting Ukip.’ Labour’s open-door migration policy led to the largest population explosion in Britain in more than a thousand years. Between 1997 and 2010, the foreign-born population of the UK increased by three million, while nearly a million British citizens left. In that period, the size of the foreign-born workforce nearly doubled. UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage poses for photographers at a pub ahead of a press conference in central London yesterday . In 1997, people born outside the UK held two million jobs – making up around 7.5 per cent of the total workforce. By 2009, that had swelled to 3.8million jobs, or 13 per cent of the total. Labour ministers predicted in 2004 that opening Britain’s labour market to millions of workers from former Eastern Bloc countries would result in only 13,000 new arrivals. By the end of 2009, more than a million workers had signed up to a Home Office registration scheme. In 2009 former Blairite aide Andrew Neather revealed that the increase in immigration under Labour was a deliberate policy designed to change Britain. He said the influx of foreign nationals was intended to socially engineer a ‘truly multicultural’ country. It was also a politically motivated attempt to ‘rub the Right’s nose in diversity’, he said. Mr Neather, a former speechwriter to Mr Blair, wrote that ‘the policy of ministers from late 2000 ... was to open up the UK to  mass migration.’","Blair says EU exit is not an answer to 'what is happening in the world'

A survey has confirmed what many chaps had always feared: That most women would rather give up sex than chocolate. Treat: Women would rather give up sex than chocolate according to a new study . A survey of 2,000 people found that alcohol, chocolate and sex were the most difficult things to forego, followed by caffeine and swearing. When it comes to giving things up for a month, one in five men – 22 per cent – said sex was one of the hardest things to live without, while only one in ten women – 9 per cent – agreed. Twenty-two per cent of women said chocolate would be the last thing they would forego. While 59 per cent of people thought women were more likely to be able to abstain from sex, only 5 per cent thought men could. Men were thought to have less willpower than women once they set their mind to a challenge, with 19 per cent of people saying men lacked the ability to control their urges compared with 31 per cent for women. The survey was carried out to mark the launch of Cancer Research UK’s fundraising campaign Dryathlon, encouraging people to test their willpower by staying off alcohol for January. Vices: Drinking alcohol and sex were ranked as among the most difficult things to give up (file pictures) When asked about how their willpower changed over the year, half of the UK admitted that the winter period - in particular Christmas and New Year - is when we are at our weakest. The study also found that men are still thought of as being commitment-shy, with more than half - 56 per cent - of those questioned saying women are more committed to relationships compared to 5 per cent of men. While people thought men are stronger willed in work and sport, 31 per cent thought that women were more likely to be able to stick to a diet than men. Robert West, professor of health psychology at the Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre said: 'When you take exposure to temptation and strength of desire out of the equation you are left with this thing called ""willpower"": the force that our plans have in controlling our actions. Addictive: Many people struggle to give up caffeine . 'Individuals with more willpower are probably more likely to achieve their objectives, whatever these might be. 'Some believe that willpower is like a muscle - it can get tired but it can also be strengthened with training. 'The idea is that getting people to practice doing something that requires self-control builds a general ability to do this. 'There are also studies showing that when people make their personal rules very clear with well-defined boundaries, they are more likely to stick to them.' Jessica Ennis topped a list of 30 of the UK’s willpower heroes, picking up more than 20 per cent of the public vote.

The research, carried out by the University of Pittsburgh, has negative implications for the mental and physical health of members of the bisexual community, according to the authors. Straight men are the least likely to . believe in bisexuals, but gay and lesbian participants also showed a . thread of negativity toward bisexuality, the survey found. New research from the University of Pittsburgh has found that bisexuals continue to be stigmatized by the wider public, with a new survey finding that 15 percent of people don¿t believe bisexuality to be a real sexual orientation . ‘Bisexual men and women face prejudice, stigma and discrimination from both heterosexual and homosexual people,’ said Mackey Friedman, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health and director of HIV prevention initiative Project Silk. The research was presented at the American Public Health Association in Boston on Tuesday. Nearly . 15 percent of an online sample of 1,500 people declared bisexuality . ‘not a legitimate sexual orientation,’ with straight men three times . more likely to categorize bisexuality as ‘not a thing.' Women, white people and people who identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual showed the least amount of anti-bisexual bias. Women, white people and people who identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual showed the least amount of anti-bisexual bias . However, . the researchers cautioned, gays and lesbians were more negative about . bisexuality than bisexuals themselves, suggesting that prejudice against . bisexuality still exists in the gay community. Male bisexuals were viewed more negatively than female bisexuals. Hiding one’s sexual . identity can lead to depression and substance abuse, and can . result in lower rates of HIV testing and treatment. ‘This can cause feelings of isolation and marginalization, which prior research has shown leads to higher substance use, depression and risky sexual behavior,' said Friendman. Bisexuality has traditionally been viewed as a stopover on the way to someone accepting their homosexuality, or a way for those confused about their attractions to define themselves. Record industry mogul Clive Davis and singer Ke$ha are two celebrities who've spoken publicly about their bisexuality this year . Stigma can make it hard for bisexual people to feel socially connected, Friedman said . 'Having hard data to back up why a bisexual person might feel the need to be secretive about sexual orientation, something that can lead to higher depression and many other negative health outcomes, is very useful to people trying to fight stigma and marginalization,' he said. 'For example, this information can guide social marketing interventions and outreach to reduce that stigma, and improve rates of HIV prevention, testing and treatment within the bisexual community.' There are approximately 1.2 million bisexual men in the U.S., of whom 121,800 are HIV-positive.","Male bisexuals were viewed more negatively than female bisexuals .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Medical director Sir Bruce Keogh is calling for new laws to overhaul the booming £2.3billion cosmetic surgery sector . Patients turning to cosmetic surgery must be protected from cowboy surgeons and dangerous treatments, said the head of the NHS. Medical director Sir Bruce Keogh is calling for new laws to overhaul the booming £2.3billion sector, with the first as early as next year. One procedure singled out for criticism was the use of fillers, which have soared in popularity. These injections plump up the skin, fill in wrinkles and crow’s feet to create younger-looking cheeks and lips. A review led by Sir Bruce warned that filler jabs were subject to ‘no more controls than a bottle of floor cleaner’. Some patients suffered  disfigurement, bruising and blindness. ‘The most striking thing is that anybody, at any time, anywhere, can give a filler to anybody else and that’s bizarre,’ said Sir Bruce. His report said the practice was a ‘crisis waiting to happen’. Dr Andrew Vallance-Owen, who sat on the review, said: ‘We want proper professional requirements. This is not “inject oranges and get a certificate”. This is proper training.’ The committee also called for a crackdown on the ‘hidden advertising’ of plastic surgery, including TV shows such as The Only Way is Essex which ‘trivialise’ the procedures. Celebrity culture: Health officials say programmes such as The Only way is Essex (pictured left, Amy Childs) had turned cosmetic surgery into an 'everyday product'. Model Katie Price (right) has had many procedures . A register of breast implant patients must be set up within the next 12 months, it added. This follows the PIP scandal in which thousands of women were given sub-standard products. The key demands of the review are: . Former glamour model Alicia Douvall, who has had 308 cosmetic treatments, believes there should be tighter regulation in the industry . Sir Bruce said: ‘At the heart of this report is the person who chooses to have a cosmetic procedure.We have heard terrible reports about a person who has trusted a cosmetic practitioner but, when things have gone wrong, have been left high and dry. These people have not had the safety net that those using the NHS have. This needs to change.’ His report said the rules have been outstripped by the booming sector, which increased five-fold in value from 2005-2010 to £2.3billion. Pat Dunion, of Transform, Britain’s biggest plastic surgery group, said the cost of training and registration would force some cowboy clinics to close. The Royal College of Surgeons called on ministers to implement the  proposals ‘without delay’. Rajiv Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic  Surgeons, said making fillers prescription-only would regulate which ones come onto the market, who can inject them and ban their advertising.","Review by Sir Bruce Keogh warns of lack of controls on certain procedures .

A Manhattan gynecologist has been charged with sexually abusing his patients, most of whom were pregnant. Gynecologist Dr Robert Hadden worked at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia Hospital when the alleged assaults took place in his office in 2012. According to prosecutors, Hadden also subjected the women to 'overly frequent and invasive breast exams' and asked them 'invasive questions about their sex lives'. The abuse is alleged to have occurred in the rooms of his private Manhattan offices and only after nurses left the doctor and his patient alone in the examination room, reports the New York Post. 'He was absolutely a predator,' said lawyer Anthony DiPietro, whose client filed a civil suit against Hadden last year alleging abuse. Hadden's lawyer, Isabelle Kishner, said her client would plead not guilty to all charges, calling him a 'physician with an impeccable reputation'. It's not the first time Hadden's conduct has been questioned by police. In 2013 two victims - identified only by their initials - L.K. and A.Y. - went to police claiming they had been sexually assaulted by Hadden, prompting him to stop seeing patients altogether. That lawsuit ended up being dismissed after the prosecution failed to deliver documents by the court's deadline. Hadden has since been released on a $21,253 bond.

"By . Leon Watson . Junk food and fatty treats are fuelling an obesity crisis for pets, experts say. Owners are giving more than 10 million animals high-calorie foods including take-aways, biscuits, chips and even alcohol, according to the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals charity. Around nine out of ten (87 per cent) give pets treats, despite the fact that 91 per cent realise the resulting obesity can reduce their pet's lifespan. Scroll down for video . People's Dispensary for Sick Animals head nurse Helen Darnell with Border overweight Collie Zed . It means that of the UK's estimated 18 million pets some 2.5 million dogs (one in three) and over two million cats (one in four) are currently overweight, the PDSA claimed. The charity said it was due to owners sharing their own unhealthy eating habits with their pets in a 'well-intentioned but misguided attempt to make them happy'. Elaine Pendlebury, PDSA senior veterinary surgeon, said: 'Sadly, seeing morbidly obese pets is now an everyday occurrence in vet practices across the UK; it is one of the biggest welfare concerns facing the nation's pets. 'It's effectively a silent killer leading to long term health issues for pets that can cut their lifespan by up to two years. 'Pet obesity significantly increases the danger of developing major health problems such as diabetes, arthritis and heart disease and can also bring about the onset of these chronic diseases much earlier.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Senegalese immigrant who claimed to be under an evil African spell has pleaded guilty to fatally stabbing an Italian college student in her New York City apartment. Bakary Camara, 42, admitted on Monday to raping and murdering 36-year-old Rita Morelli, his former lover, last November. The native of Italy's Spoltore region attended the Borough of Manhattan Community College and worked as a waitress. Her body was found by her boyfriend. Killed: Bakary Camara, the man accused of killing Rita Morelli (pictured) last year, has requested a witch doctor take the stand as an expert witness to prove he was under a curse that made him kill . Police say Camara was traced to his . Bronx home after he made a cryptic 911 call about the body. Authorities . say Camara stabbed himself in the stomach as police officers approached . and directed them to a note describing his failed relationship with Miss . Morelli. Camara faces 25 years to life in prison when he is sentenced October 30. During his trial, he attempted to . call a witch doctor to stand as an expert witness in the trial -- a . bizarre move that prosecutors have branded 'clearly irrelevant' as they . fight against it. 'It is difficult to imagine how a witch doctor could be qualified in a court of law,' lead prosecutor Evan Krutoy wrote to the judge last week, the New York Post reported. 'The defense cannot credibly argue that witchcraft is a profession [with] scientific knowledge or skill.' Camara was accused of slashing Miss Morelli's throat and stabbing her multiple times on November 23 last year. Her body was discovered by her live-in boyfriend. Victim: Morelli, 36, met Camara at a designer clothing store where they both worked in New York City and began a relationship. She was living with a new boyfriend when she was found murdered . Workplace: They met at this clothes shop, where Camara was a security guard and Morelli worked in sales . Miss Morelli, who was a student at Hunter College and a waitress at Caffee Buon Gusto in New York, had been living in the city for five years, pursuing 'the American Dream,' her family said. Camara had met his victim in 2010 while he worked as a security guard in a designer clothing store,  7 For All Mankind, where she worked in sales. In a rambling, four-page letter found in his pocket during his arrest in the days after the murder, Camara claimed a curse had pushed him to kill. 'They put a curse on me,' the father of two, who was born in the U.S. but raised in Senegal, wrote. 'They make you do . anythings. Could make you die fast or go to jail. You always be mad . and sad. This is a curs. 'There is something in my mind tell me . you have to do this you have to anything bad make thing bad thing hurt . people. I always think to make a suicide but I . can’t. I only think to get kill. I meet that girl Rita Morelli we was . very friend for nine months before we have a relationship.' Scene: She was found stabbed to death by her live-in boyfriend at their Harlem apartment, pictured . The letter explained that he went to her home around 8pm and then killed her. He reportedly called police from a phone box to tell them to check her apartment, and when they called contacts in her mobile phone, they recognised Camara's thick accent when he picked up. The victim's family are outraged that Camara, is blaming the killing on a 'curse'. 'It’s nonsense and ridiculous,' her cousin, Giorgio Morelli, told the Post. 'It's an insult for Rita’s parents, who have been suffering so much. And an insult for innocent women who, every day, face the acts of violent men like Mr. Bakary Camara.' Jury selection for the trial commences on Tuesday. If Camara is found guilty of first-degree murder, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.","Bakary Camara, originally from Senegal, goes on trial on Tuesday for murder .

When updating an iOS device there are two options – over the air, or via iTunes. When using OTA, the phone has to be plugged into a charger. However, a number of customers have had the same issue when updating over a cable. One person told MailOnline: 'Mine was on the cable all the time during the update and still it has crashed. 'I’ve tried restoring three times now and it fails with an ‘internal error’. Not sure where to go now, Apple are much less than helpful.' Meanwhile, another Apple phone owner explained that since updating his iPad, Apple's Safari app freezes and crashes 'for no reason'. There have also been reports of problems using the built-in email app with notes appearing randomly, for example. Although the majority of affected users have been complaining about the phone crashing during the update, on user told MailOnline her phone updated normally, but has since 'switched itself off and still won't turn on'. These complaints are a selection of those received. The problems appear to have affected a range of models, including the iPhone 4S, iPhone, iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S, when using the wireless option.

"By . Paul Thompson In Boston . Close call: The victim was able to jump out of the car and flee while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, pictured, looked to buy cans of Red Bull and chocolate bars . A man taken hostage by the alleged Boston bombers after he was car jacked was able to escape after they stopped to buy cans of Red Bull at a gas station, MailOnline can reveal. The carjacking victim, whose name has not been revealed, has told authorities that being Chinese almost certainly saved his life, saying that the brothers told him they would not kill him because he was 'not American.' The victim was able to jump out of the car and flee while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, looked to buy cans of the energy drink and chocolate bars. From interviews with the staff at . both gas stations and court records, MailOnline has been able to piece . together the frantic events of the early hours of last Friday. The terrifying sequence of events . began when Tamerlan carjacked a Mercedes SUV car at gun point barely 40 . minutes after MIT campus police officer Sean Collier was killed as he . sat in his patrol car. Tamerlan jumped into the passenger . seat of the Mercedes and told the driver: 'Did you hear about the . Boston explosion... I did that.' Dzhokhar was caught on a CCTV camera entering an all night garage with his face partially hidden by a grey hooded sweatshirt. But he left empty handed after his brother Tamerlan hammered on the glass front door of the gas station kiosk saying: 'We've got to go.' His intervention came after the victim of the car jacking managed to escape and run across to another all night gas station where he pleaded for help. After the shootout: Investigators take a look at the stolen car driven by the Boston Marathon bombing suspects after they exchanged gunfire on a residential street in Watertown . The victim, who is Chinese and his early 20s, was paralyzed with fear after bursting into the Mobil station where cashier Tarek Ahmed was working. The terrified victim said: 'Some men are trying to shoot me. They have a bomb and guns.' In . an exclusive interview with MailOnline Egyptian born Ahmed, 44, said . the victim was so scared he could barely stand and collapsed on the . floor. Witness: Mobil station cashier Tarek Ahmed was working when the terrified victim burst in after escaping his captors . Ahmed said that when the man went behind the counter to hide, he knew he was telling the truth. Ahmed dialed 911 and within minutes the area was flooded with police. The dramatic escape of the carjacking victim was the beginning of the end for the alleged bombers as they were found by police and involved in a fierce gun battle. Tamerlan was shot multiple times, while his brother was later found cowering in a covered-up boat and taken into custody. After encountering Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the terrified victim was shown a gun and forced into the passenger seat. After picking up his brother, and transferring guns and bombs into the trunk, the car spend off. Tamerlan was driving and his 19-year-old brother was in the rear passenger seat. The victim was in the front passenger seat. After being forced to hand over $45, they drove to an ATM where $800 was withdrawn from the victim's account. All three headed towards an all night Shell garage on Memorial Drive in Cambridge where Tamerlan pulled up alongside one of the gas pumps. Dzhokhar went inside - and was captured on the CCTV camera at the front of the store. The photograph was released by the FBI . hours after the impromptu stop and gave law enforcement and members of . the public a much clearer view of the alleged teen bomber. Last stand: A police officer points his rifle in Watertown, Massachusetts, as authorities hunt for the Boston bombing suspects . Deadly shootout: In a gun battle where over 200 shots were fired, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev was hit multiple times . The image with Dzhokhar wearing a hoodie was clearer than those released earlier by the FBI which been taken prior to the bombs going off at the finish line of the marathon. Mohammed Malah, 46, was working the night shift but paid little attention to the customer who head to the row of fridge where the drinks were stored. Moroccan born Malah, who speaks little English, told colleagues that he did not take any notice of Tsarnaev when he came into the all night store. He only realized he had been with the alleged bomber when the FBI swarmed into garage in the early hours of the morning last Friday. They had been alerted to the garage stop . by the carjacking victim who had managed to escape and run across the . road to a neighboring Mobil garage. Call of duty: Police from several different agencies responded after MIT police officer Sean Collier was gunned down as he sat in his cruiser . Cashier Tarek Ahmed described how the victim burst into kiosk. 'He was shaking, absolutely terrified and started shouting that some men had guns and they were trying to kill him,' he said. 'He said they had a bomb. He was so scared that he could not stand up. He fell over and at first I thought he was drunk. 'But then he got up and pushed his way to the back of the counter and said 'you have to hide me.' He kept saying there were men out there who wanted to kill him. I'ver never seen anyone so scared. Ahmed said the man hid behind a metal door in a back room and he again pleaded with him to call police. Hunt: The events in the early morning hours of April 19 set a massive police search in place that resulted in the capture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19 . 'I rang 911 and told them what happened. Within three minutes there were police cars here.' He added: I did not see who he was running from, but he was so scared.' Police spoke with the victim and were able to get a description of the car and it license plate. FBI agents recovered footage from the security camera at the entrance to the Shell garage. Owner Alan Mendick:'The police came and we went through the CCTV footage. 'Yes, one of them came in here, but I am told before he could buy anything his brother came and hammered on the window and told him they had to go. 'He had some stuff in his hands but he just put it down and left. There are reports that he was shoplifting, but that's not true.' Other plans: New information suggests that Tamerlan, right, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, may have been planning to attack New York next . 'His brother called him to come out before he could do anything. 'My cashier who was on duty is scared.He is really shaken up by it all.' Malah's colleague Brahim Asseban,37, said: 'The manager was called and they told him to close the station down. 'They took the CCTV footage .The picture of the Tsarnaev in the grey hoodie was from the camera at the front door. Everyone who comes in is filmed,it is part of the security you have when open all night. 'Mohammed is a bit shaken up by it all. He said it was very busy that night, and he does not really remember him coming in. Terror Attack: The two detonations went off near the finish line of the 117th Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 - returning the specter of terrorism to the United States for the first time since 9/11 . This image, taken from a surveillance camera shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev climbing out of the boat on Friday evening after the climatic police gun battle . 'Lots of people come in late at night but it has shaken him up.' Asseban said Mohammed did not see the victim of the car jacking. 'He said one of the brothers, the younger one came in and looked at the Red Bull and candy bars. The victim told FBI agents he managed to escape while Tamerlan became distracted as his brother was in the store shopping. Neither brother made any attempt to kill the carjacking victim. After speeding away along Memorial Drive the stolen car was spotted by police in Watertown having been given its licence plate and description. Wounded: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, seen here moments after he was pulled from the boat where he was hiding, suffered a throat wound and a leg wound . They gave chase and in an ensuing gun battle where over 200 shots were fired 26 year old Tamerlan was hit multiple times. He was run over by his brother who fled in the stolen SUV, later abandoning it and taking refuge in a covered up boat. Police have said the believed the brothers were planning to go to New York with US officials convinced they were planning further bloodshed. The pair had pressure cooker bomb, identical to those used in the marathon blasts, and home made grenades. They also had a mini arsenal of weapons, including a M4 assault rifle.","Man carjacked by Boston bombing suspects says he was able to escape after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev went into a store for Red Bull and chocolate bars .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A beautiful woman is said to inspire many things, but could the power of a pretty face or two propel a team to World Cup victory in 2014? On Wednesday the first ladies of France supported their boys by dressing up in a rather more snug version of their team's official World Cup kit. On this occasion the presence of the wives and the girlfriend's of the European team weren't able to ensure victory, as the team drew 0-0 in the Group E closer against Ecuador.

"By . Mark Prigg . For golfers who struggle to avoid the water hazards, it could be a challenging course. The Maldives has revealed plans for a radical £320m floating course, which players access by an undersea tunnel. The course is part of a massive plan to replace the sinking islands with a network of man made, floating islands. With an average elevation of just five feet above sea level the Maldives, with its 1,192 islands in the Indian Ocean, is the lowest country in the world. The floating golf course that could soon form the centerpiece of the Maldives, replacing its islands as they sink below the surface of the sea . Amid fears many of the islands will soon sink into the sea, the Maldivian government has started a . joint venture with the architectural firm Dutch Docklands International . to build the world’s largest series of artificial floating-islands. The Dutch firm has already built floating islands for prisons . and housing from slabs of concrete and polystyrene foam. The hotel and conference centre, which resemble a starfish from above, will be built within circular reefs to allow visitors to dive right from the beach . In the Maldives, the floating islands will be anchored to the seabed using cables . or telescopic mooring piles, making landforms that are stable even in . storms. The architects chose this approach to minimise damage to the seabed, and also chose to build lots of small islands to reduce the shadow on the seabed, which could affect wildlife. The islands will be constructed in . India or the Middle east to reduce costs, then simply towed to their . final destination in the Maldives. The real thing: The Huvafen Fushi resort in Maldives, which researchers say could soon be under water, along with the rest of the Maldives. The islands will also be designed for swimmers, divers and even private submarines to enter them from below, and the Dutch firm designing the scheme has said visitors will be able to rent private submarines that can surface right in the middle of their living rooms. Watch out for the water hazards: The plans include an 18 hole golf course designed by Troon, complete with clubhouse . The idea is the brainchild of Dutch firm Waterstudio who designed the project. It is being engineered by floating architecture specialists Dutch Docklands. CEO Paul van de Camp said: 'We told the president of the Maldives we can transform you from climate refugees to climate innovators. 'And we have a way of building and sustaining this project that is environmentally friendly too. 'This is going to be an exclusively green development in a marine-protected area.' The first part of the project to be built will be the golf course. 'This will be the first and only floating golf course in the world - and it comes complete with spectacular ocean views on every hole,' said van de Camp. 'And then there's the clubhouse. 'You get in an elevator and go underwater to get to it. 'It's like being Captain Nemo down there.' Players will access the floating course via a series of underwater tunnels so wide they can even accommodate a golf buggy . Designer Koen Olthuis said: 'We'll be . building the islands somewhere else, probably in the Middle East or in . India - that way there's no environmental cost to the Maldives. 'When . it comes to the golf course, the islands will be floated into position . first and then the grass will be seeded and the trees planted . afterwards.' Development on the course is expected to begin later . this year, and it should be ready for play by the end of 2013 ahead of . the full launch in 2015. The course will be split over different floating islands, while private cabins will also be located on some of the islands . The proposed site is just a five-minute . speedboat ride from the capital of Male, giving golfers the chance to . make quick journeys to the mainland. Amazingly, the course will even . be powered by solar energy which is a resource the Maldives has plenty . of - as it's located just north of the equator. The designers claim the entire resort will be carbon neutral. 43 private floating islands will be built, complete with a jetty to moor your yacht and a pool. The ambitious plans will also feature 43 private islands. Called Amillarah (the Maldivian word for Private Island). This unique project exists of 43 floating private Islands in a archipelago configuration. Each has its own jetty for yachts, along with a pool. Palm trees give each mini island its own secluded area. Even the low cost 'affordable' housing has a luxury feel, complete with waterside jettys. The 'workers islands' will be in their own area of the Maldives, allowing workers to commute by boat to other areas . The sea views of the Maldives most popular resorts are set to be kept - but on a floating island instead of a real one . Coral Atoll near Maldives Island. Researchers say it could soon be under water, so plans for a series of floating islands are being drawn up.","Floating islands will be moored to the seabed using cables to minimise environmental impact .

"By . Michael Seamark . and Arthur Martin . Prince Charles fears becoming king will condemn him to ‘imprisonment’ – denying him the freedom to pursue his favoured causes. Despite being seen as itching to ascend the throne, he is already feeling the weight of duty, according to an extraordinary profile published today. Aides say the prince is desperate to get as much of his charitable and environmental work done before ‘the prison shades’ close. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Profile of a prince: Friends and associates of Charles have provided a fascinating insight of his life for an article in TIME magazine . Royal duties: Prince Charles and his wife Camilla leave the baptism of his first grandchild Prince George yesterday at St James's Palace . The surprise insight into his thinking comes from interviews with more than 50 of his friends and associates. Catherine Mayer had extensive access . to Charles for her TIME Magazine front cover story, The Forgotten . Prince. She visited royal residences in England, Scotland and Wales and . followed him to meetings and on official visits. Charles, 64, is for the first time . deputising for the 87-year-old Queen at a Commonwealth summit in Sri . Lanka next month but Miss Mayer says he ‘accepts these additional duties . joylessly’. She writes: ‘He prefers not to focus on his accession, . which, after all, means losing his mother. And far from itching to . assume the crown, he is already feeling its weight and worrying about . its impact on the job he has long been doing.’ Close: Prince Charles shares a laugh with Emma Thompson at a film gala in aid of the Prince's Trust, one of several keen interests for the future king . Charles tells the US magazine he . intends to make the most of his inherited position: ‘I’ve had this . extraordinary feeling, for years and years, ever since I can remember . really, of wanting to heal and make things better. ‘I feel more than anything else it’s . my duty to worry about everybody and their lives in this country, to try . and find a way of improving things if I possibly can.’ The magazine highlights suggestions that the monarchy could skip a generation in favour of William. - Prince Charles in TIME interview . But Charles says: ‘If you chuck away too many things you end up discovering there was value in them.’ The article also reveals: . Speaking to the Mail yesterday, Miss . Mayer said: ‘I don’t think the prince sees becoming king as prison. It . is a loss of freedom and a loss of time. ‘It is not that the Crown is a shackle but what it does is eat up his time. ‘He is often described as being . impatient to be king but what he’s really impatient to do is to get as . much as he possibly can done before he is king.’ Assistance: Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, centre, helps employee Peter Wills, left, put the finishing touches to the poppy wreath that Prince Charles will lay on Armistice Day, in India, at the Poppy factory in London . Day job: Charles and his 'wonderful wife' Camilla meet Kandyan drummers . at a reception for members of British Indian and British Sri Lankan . communities at St James's Palace yesterday . She said it is clear that Charles will . increasingly take on more of his mother’s work but his passion lies . elsewhere and he is ‘incredibly eager to get as much done as he possibly . can’. Miss Mayer added: ‘The thing he is . really passionate about is the life he’s carved out for himself and . everything else he does as a sense of duty.’ In Time magazine she adds: ‘The Queen, . at 87, is scaling back her work and the prince is taking up the slack, . to the potential detriment of his network of charities, initiatives and . causes.’ On the dancefloor: Prince Charles doing a tango with Adriana Vasile in Buenos Aires, Argentina in the 1990s . Charles serves as patron of 428 . charities and has founded more than 25. Miss Mayer says he has been . pruning and merging his causes into the 16 strongest that he can be sure . will flourish with less of his attention. Charles says: ‘Obviously, these things have grown like Topsy over the years, as I’ve seen what I feel needs to be done. ‘I couldn’t do it all at once. I couldn’t at Highgrove just do the whole garden in one or two years. Bit by bit, you go round.’ At Birkhall, the prince’s royal . residence on the Balmoral estate, Charles told Miss Mayer: ‘We’re busily . wrecking the chances for future generations at a rapid rate of knots by . not recognising the damage we’re doing to the natural environment, . bearing in mind that this is the only planet that we know has any life . on it.’ William, Kate and their baby George . paid Charles and Camilla a visit that day and the prince told Miss Mayer . he now takes joy in his ‘wonderful wife’. ‘And of course now a grandson, which . is what this is all about. It’s everybody else’s grandchildren I’ve been . bothering about, but the trouble is if you take that long a view people . don’t always know what you’re on about.’ Miss Mayer says Charles has been . plagued by the perception that he is aloof and indulged but in reality . he is a ‘passionate philanthropist’. She says he is one of the world’s . most prolific charitable entrepreneurs and what one friend called ‘an . amplifier of messages and a conductor of ideas’. In the article Charles says of his . charity, the Prince’s Trust: ‘A few people are lucky enough to know . exactly what they want to do. ‘But there’s a hell of a lot of others . who don’t really know and may not be obviously academic.’ Miss Mayer . writes: ‘He seems unaware that he’s also describing his own struggle.’ A Clarence House spokesman said of the . suggestion that he viewed his future duties as ‘joyless’: ‘This is not . the Prince of Wales’s view and should not be attributed to him as he did . not say these words. ‘The prince has dutifully supported . the Queen all his life and his official duties and charitable work have . always run in parallel.’ Timeless classic: Prince Charles in a Silver Cross . They are considered a little too cumbersome by most 21st century parents. But William and Kate have stuck with royal tradition and ferry George around in a Silver Cross pram. Both the Queen and Prince Charles spent some of their early months in a Silver Cross pram. Invented in 1877 by William Wilson, the baby carriages became hugely popular by the 1960s. Television footage of the Queen pushing her children around royal estates in one helped turn them into a ‘must have’ baby accessory for the wealthy. The prams were often spotted being pushed by Norland Nannies wearing their distinctive brown uniforms. But as smaller and lighter prams and buggies came on the market, the tradition Silver Cross model faded in popularity. Buckingham Palace last night declined to revealed which model William and Kate opted for. They might have chosen the £1,450 Silver Cross Balmoral pram which is described as the ‘ultimate classic pram’ by its designers. Many families would struggle to afford one – let alone get it through their front door.","50 friends of the prince interviewed for revealing profile in TIME magazine .

"By . Ruth Styles . Dressed in a black bra and thong, Charley, 18, from Edinburgh, gyrates her way through a crowd of men, many drunk and leering. But this is one stripper who doesn't live up to the stereotype. Charley spends her evenings taking her clothes off to pay for a degree in sports science - her passport, she hopes, to a better life. 'Stripping is just an escape from everything,' she explains. 'I go in there and I'm a completely different person.' Scroll down for video . Big plans: Charley is using the proceeds of her stripping career to help fund herself through university . Charley, who grew up in one of the less salubrious parts of Edinburgh, adds: 'A . lot of people that I grew up with don't really care and just skive. 'I'm . totally the opposite. Because the place I live in isn't a very good . area, I want to be better and do my family proud. To do that, I am a . stripper.' With universities charging £9,000 a year or more in tuition fees, she's far from being the only student to turn to sex work to survive. A recent study published by the British Journal of Sociology of Education found that as many as one in three strippers are students and blamed the figure on the increasing costs of tuition fees. And it's not just strip clubs that have benefited from students who turn to sex work to pay their fees. Others fund their studies by turning to sugar daddy websites such as Sponsor A Scholar, where girls are paid up to £15,000 a year in exchange for 'companionship'. Determined: Charley says she will do whatever it takes to overcome her deprived upbringing . 'A . lot of people that I grew up with don't really care and just skive. I'm . totally the opposite. Because the place I live in isn't a very good . area, I want to be better and do my family proud. To do that, I am a . stripper.' Experts have also claimed that one of the reasons for the increase in student sex workers is that the work is becoming more socially acceptable. Speaking to the Times Higher Education magazine, sociologist Teela Sanders said that some student strippers saw themselves as 'dancers, not sex workers' because 'selling striptease had become more palatable and socially acceptable.' For Charley, who still lives at home with her father, stripping is the first job she's ever had and she admits she was thrilled when she was told she'd got it. 'I applied for a lot of jobs before and I . kept getting knocked back because I had no experience,' she explains. 'I have no idea . how I had the confidence to walk in here... It's crazy. It just sort of . happened really quickly. 'I was so excited afterwards. I was thinking . ""I'm 18 and I've got a job!"" I went and had icecream afterwards to celebrate.' She now spends six nights a week working at Baby Dolls, one of three strip clubs that make up Edinburgh's 'Pubic Triangle'. It's not always easy, although Charley, who makes around £100 a night, says the work has given her extra confidence. 'When I was at school, the boys found some girls . attractive but not once did they look at me,' she remembers. Different world: Charley is just 18-years-old and says stripping is the first and only job she's ever had . Relationship: Charley won't allow her boyfriend Connor to see her at work for fear of hurting him . 'They [the other girls] were all really skinny . with nice clothes, and nice hair, and I was a bit chubby. I got into . dancing to prove that I can be . beautiful, I can be sexy. She adds: 'A year ago, I couldn't get on buses without being . really anxious. I feel better about myself, even though dancing maybe . isn't the prettiest job in the world and I know some people would say it's sleazy. 'I walk out with my head held high and it's empowering.' Boyfriend Connor doesn't share her enthusiasm however and says he worries about Charley's safety when she's at work. 'I think [strip clubs] can be seedy places and I'm . worried for her wellbeing,' he reveals. 'I think I might get a bit jealous if I was . to see her doing sexy provocative stuff... I think ""that's just for me!"" but at the end of the day, I know it's just her job.' New life: Charley hopes to one day swap stripping for a job as a police woman after college . Charley herself has imposed a set of strict rules on Connor and refuses to let him go to the club where she works. 'I don't want him to see me doing this,' she admits. 'I . think it would hurt him too much. He just means too much to me for me . to do that to him.' Ultimately, for Charley, stripping, however distasteful, is a means to an end and a route out of the grim estate where she grew up and still lives. 'I really hate where I live,' she admits. 'It's a horrible, . horrible place. I wouldn't bring my children up here and I kind of hate that I . was brought up here.' Her goal, she says, is to use her sports science degree to become a policewoman. 'I like that you get to be a strong independent woman,' she smiles. 'I like the idea of helping the public and dealing with tough situations.' She's certainly no stranger to the latter.

"By . Sarah Harris . All teenagers should receive a school leaving certificate which details their extra-curricular activities and employability skills, according to a government-backed report. The certificate would show that pupils – rather than just graduating from ‘exam factories’ – have developed traits such as perseverance, self-control and the ability to bounce back from setbacks. The development of children’s ‘character and resilience’ is so crucial that teachers should be made to organise after school clubs. The recommendations are contained in a report from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Mobility and the CentreForum think-tank. Recommendations: Pupils should receive a certificate listing all their extra-curricular activities and employability skills, according to a new report . Its ‘character and resilience manifesto’ has been supported by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg as well as the Confederation of British Industry. It cites a network of public charter schools  – those which are publicly funded but operate independently – in the United States called KIPP (Knowledge Is Power Program) which gives pupils ‘character growth cards’. A certificate for teenagers in this . country – to sit alongside raw exam results – could ‘explicitly break . down and reference particular character and resilience competencies . drawing on the model of the KIPP report card’, according to the report. The majority of state schools are still failing to push disadvantaged bright students towards top universities, says a government commissioned report. Some teachers are reluctant to put too much emphasis on applying to the Russell Group  – which includes Oxford and Cambridge – because they do not want to be seen as elitist. Many students also view Oxbridge as ‘posh’, says the Institute for Policy Studies in Education and social research agency TNS BMRB. Taking part in extra-curricular activities, which help build pupils’ character, should also be made a more central aspect of a school’s purpose and a teacher’s job. The report adds: ‘This additional responsibility would either need to be met by a corresponding financial reward/incentive or by schools allowing more time for these activities within the regular school day.’ Ofsted should assess the ‘extent and quality’ of extra-curricular activities and how ‘soft skills’ are incorporated into lessons. In a foreword to the report, Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Claire Tyler said: ‘The APPG on Social Mobility believes that if our education system also focused more on these so-called soft skills, young people would leave school and university much better equipped to face life. ‘Indeed, even talking about “soft skills” is something of a misnomer because these aren’t fluffy or superficial skills we’re talking about – this is about having the fundamental drive, tenacity and perseverance needed to make the most of opportunities.’ John Cridland, director general of the CBI, said: ‘As this important report shows, alongside academic rigour, we also need schools to produce rounded and grounded young people who have the skills and behaviours that businesses want.’","New certificate has been recommended by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Mobility and the CentreForum think-tank .

"By . John Hall . A bouncer who left a handyman permanently brain damaged with a single punch to the head has been jailed for just 16 months. Scott Taylor, 42, was left disabled and in need of full-time care after a punch caused the father-of-three's skull to collapse inwards outside Bar Station in Wellington, Shropshire in August 2012. Mr Taylor's' family branded the 16 month prison sentence given to Neil Hotchkiss, 33, 'ridiculous' and an 'utter disgrace', after the bouncer admitted grievous bodily harm at Shrewsbury Crown Court. Injury: Scott Taylor, 42, was left disabled and in need of full-time care after a single punch caused his skull to collapse inwards. He suffered extensive brain damage and will be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life . Upset: Kirsty Taylor (pictured right with her father) branded the 16 month prison sentence given to Neil Hotchkiss an 'utter disgrace'. Mr Taylor (left) is now permanently disabled after being punched in the head . Mr Taylor had been out drinking at Bar Station in Wellington on a Friday night when father-of-eight Hotchkiss asked him to leave the establishment. After a brief exchange of words, Hotchkiss punched Mr Taylor, knocking him out cold with a single punch and causing him to collapse on the pavement. Mr Taylor was taken to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in a critical condition and placed on a life support machine. The grandfather-of-one had suffered a skull fracture and extensive brain damage from the fall, with the injuries leaving him in need of a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Mr Taylor was also left with a shocking dent in the side of his head caused by his skull collapsing, with the injury needing to be filled out with fat from his stomach. Wound: The grandfather-of-one had suffered a skull fracture and extensive brain damage from the fall, with the injuries leaving him in need of a wheelchair for the rest of his life . Jailed: Neil Hotchkiss admitted grievous bodily harm at Shrewsbury Crown Court . Speaking after Hotchkiss was jailed for 16 months at Shrewsbury Crown Court yesterday, Mr Taylor's daughter Kirsty, 19, branded the sentence an utter disgrace. 'It’s just ridiculous. There’s shoplifters that get longer than that... My dad’s life is ruined, he can’t get up, he can’t get out of bed himself, he can’t even sit up himself,' she said. 'I remember it like it was yesterday. The police knocked on the door at 4am and rushed me to hospital. He was in intensive carer and they didn’t think he was going to survive,' she added. Ms Taylor, who is now her father's full-time carer, said he was kept on a life support machine for a long time after the punch. She said that until her father's skull was reconstructed, it looked like half his head was missing. Mr Taylor has since had a stroke, although doctors can't be certain if that was linked to the injuries. 'I’m just so angry that it’s such a short sentence...He was using the sob story in court that he has got eight kids,' Ms Taylor said. 'Dad just says the same as me that it is ridiculous and he is angry too - it is an utter disgrace,' she added. Since the attack, Mr Taylor has had to move from his home to a warden-assisted bungalow. He is visited by professional carers four times a day, with Ms Taylor also spending eight hours at the property. Scene: Mr Taylor had been out drinking at Bar Station in Wellington (pictured) on a Friday night when father-of-eight Hotchkiss asked him to leave the establishment . 'His speech is affected, you probably wouldn’t be able to speak him and understand him if you didn’t know him,' she said. 'He can pick up the drink and have a drink but he can’t feed himself and he can’t move around himself,' Ms Taylor added. 'My dad has a life sentence and will always be like this and it affects his three children too,' she said. Prosecutor Andrew Wilkins told the court Hotchkiss paced up and down after the blow and made no effort to help Mr Taylor. He also said the bouncer initially lied to police and said he had not touched Mr Taylor. Kirsty Taylor said that until her father's skull was reconstructed (pictured), it looked like half his head was missing . Mr Wilkins added: 'Mr Taylor was clearly not doing what he had been told to do but, on the other hand, he was not being violent or aggressive.' 'Hotchkiss dramatically overreacted and the consequences were very dramatic. 'Mr Taylor collided heavily with the pavement and suffered a skull fracture and extensive brain damage.' Sentencing Recorder Adrian Jack told him: 'As far as the Taylor family are concerned, any sentence I pass on you will be grievously inadequate for the very serious injuries suffered by Mr Taylor.' 'He will never make a full recovery. I have to accept, however, that you did not intend to cause this sort of injury.'","Scott Taylor, 42, was left disabled and in need of full-time care after punch .

"By . Sarah Harris . Headteacher Morian Morgan has written to parents following concerns that children as young as six are re-enacting scenes from Grand Theft Auto . Children as young as six are re-enacting brutal and sexually explicit scenes from Grand Theft Auto, a headmaster has warned. They are playing games involving ‘simulating rape and sexual intercourse’ and having playground chats about drugs and prostitution. Primary school youngsters are also using the ‘strongest of sexual swear words’ and discussing sex acts as a result of exposure to the controversial 18-rated computer game. Morian Morgan, head of Coed-y-Brain Primary in the village of Llanbradach, South Wales, said some pupils even injure themselves after copying aggressive scenes. In the latest Grand Theft Auto game, players must choose various torture methods to use on a victim, such as pulling out teeth with pliers, electrocution, beating with a heavy wrench or water-boarding. Mr Morgan, 57, has fired off a warning letter to parents about pupils’ ‘extremely concerning behaviour’, which he blames on their ‘first-hand experience of video games totally inappropriate to their age’. He said: ‘One game in particular causes me concern more than any other and this is Grand Theft Auto.’ Mr Morgan provided a detailed description of it – highlighting violent sex scenes and drug use. He urged parents to ensure their child has ‘no contact with this or any other age-inappropriate games’.The father of two added that if pupils continue to be exposed to them, he may have to ‘instigate child protection procedures’. Horrified teachers had asked children what games they were playing at break and lunch time. The pupils, aged six to 11, told them they had been watching Grand Theft Auto V – the newest release, in which three criminals plot their chances of ‘survival and success’ in a fictional American city called Los Santos.

'The . youngest child showing this kind of behaviour was a six-year-old but . that is unusual. It was very much a minority re-enacting these acts.' Dear Parent/Carer. I have recently encountered some extremely concerning behaviour including the use of very bad language by children (some as young as 6 years old). Investigation of these incident has usually led to the same place: the children involved had first hand experience of video games totally inappropriate to their age. There are a number of games involved but the common factor is that they are clearly labelled with age certificates of 16 or 18. One game in particular causes me concern more than any other and this is Grand Theft Auto.Exposure to the game has resulted the following: . Many of you may be unaware of the content of this game - until recently I was. With this in mind I have included a product description of Grand Theft Auto at the end of this letter.I am sure, that now you are aware of the shocking content of this game, you will ensure that your child will have no contact with this or any other age inappropriate games. I am sure you will appreciate that behaviour of the kind described above cannot be tolerated within our school and I am sure that none of us would want our children exposed to it. I appreciate that sometimes exposure to these games may happen without parents' knowledge; children may play games at friends' homes or with older family members. May I ask you to be alert to this possibility. As a school we have a duty of care to all our children. Should I become aware that pupils continue to be exposed to these games, I will contact individual parents and ultimately may have to instigate child protection procedures. Yours sincerely . M.

"By . Sarah Harris . The head of one of the Coalition’s first free schools has been arrested by police investigating allegations of fraud. Sajid Raza was held in connection with a probe into the Kings Science Academy in Bradford which has been accused of ‘serious’ financial mismanagement. The 41-year-old, who set up the school in 2011, was bailed pending further inquiries. Poster boy: A file photo shows Prime Minister David Cameron meeting Kings Science Academy headteacher Sajid Raza in March 2012. Raza has been arrested and bailed amid allegations of 'serious' financial mismanagement . Last year, it was revealed that Kings Science Academy claimed tens of thousands of pounds in public money which was not used for its intended purposes amid allegations of financial irregularities and nepotism. An investigation by the Education Funding Agency found that the school had been given £86,335 in funding which had ‘not been used for its intended purpose’. It charged for first class travel, parties, buying furniture for staff and allegedly submitted ‘fabricated invoices’ to the Department for Education for rent it did not actually pay. The revelation was a huge embarrassment for the Government and followed a series of controversies about free schools - state funded institutions set up independently of local authorities. Kings Science Academy - which boasts Tory vice chair, Alan Lewis, as its executive patron - was among the first wave of free schools. It was visited and praised by Prime Minister, David Cameron, in 2012. Detective Superintendent Lisa Griffin, head of crime for Bradford district, said yesterday: ‘As part of West Yorkshire Police’s ongoing investigation into matters at Kings Science Academy, Bradford, a 41-year-old man has today been arrested at premises in Bradford and is currently being questioned in relation to suspected fraud offences.’ The Department for Education said it sparked the police probe by referring the school to the UK’s national fraud reporting centre, Action Fraud, after receiving allegations of wrongdoing. A DfE spokesman said: ‘The department acted as soon as it received allegations of wrongdoing at Kings Science Academy. We formally investigated and referred the case to Action Fraud. ‘This resulted in a police investigation which is ongoing. Separately we are recovering appropriate funds. ‘All free schools are held to rigorous account. The vast majority are performing well with three-quarters rated good or outstanding. But where there is failure we will not hesitate to intervene.’ Pupils leave Kings Science Academy, Bradford, yesterday: An investigation by the Education Funding Agency found that the school had been given £86,335 in funding which had 'not been used for its intended purpose' Liberal Democrat Bradford East MP David Ward welcomed yesterday’s developments in the police investigation. Mr Ward has raised a series of questions about the management of the academy and the role of Tory vice chair, Mr Lewis, who also owns the land the school is built on. Last week, in the Commons, Mr Ward asked Education Secretary Michael Gove what steps his department was taking. Mr Gove said he had to careful not the prejudice the police investigation . Mr Ward replied: ‘That is disappointing, because of course the head of a maintained school would have been on his bike long ago.’ Labour MP Kevin Brennan asked the Secretary of State: ‘Mr Lewis is not just a benefactor; he is a landlord who will receive £12million in rent in years to come from the school, as well as a vice-chair of the Conservative Party and a major Tory donor. ‘Is that anything to do with the fact that the Secretary of State has refused to take any action whatsoever against anyone since this scandal broke?’ Mr Gove replied: ‘It is important to place on the record the fact that Mr Lewis is receiving for the property an appropriately guaranteed market rent - less than he was receiving for it beforehand.’ The Secretary of State defended his department’s handling of the case and said: ‘The law must follow its course.’ Last October, the Al-Madinah free school in Derby was threatened with closure after Ofsted criticised it as ‘dysfunctional’. In December, the Discovery New School in Crawley, West Sussex, was axed amid ‘continued inadequate teaching’.

Chris Allington, 26, from Crofton, Nebraska, braves the elements and drives many miles in pursuit of the most dramatic storms.

Menacing: A huge storm fills the sky as a bolt lightning emerges from the darkness. 26-year-old Chris Allington, from Crofton, Nebraska, braves the elements and drives many miles in pursuit of the most dramatic weather systems . Intimidating: Chris Allington uses radar and GPS to trace the best routes to stay out of the rain and hail while trying to keep up with the fast-moving storms . Stunning: This photograph, titled 'Dodge', captures the moment a sunset illuminates a sudden lightning bolt - creating an orange rainbow. 'This is my favourite image', Allington said. 'We had been chasing an intense line of thunderstorms... and as sunset approached we decided to let a weakening storm overtake us' Allington uses radar and GPS to trace the best routes to stay out of the rain and hail while trying to keep up with the fast-moving storms. 'Nothing is more fascinating to me than . photographing the displays in the sky that Mother Nature puts on... Standing with these warm, moist winds at your back flowing towards a . beautiful storm is unique and exhilarating,' he said. 'There are often constant rumbles of thunder from high in the clouds, punctuated by louder bursts from close, vibrant lightning strikes,' he added. Allington said there are still occasions when he gets frightened while chasing a storm, with lightning scaring him the most 'just because it is so random and can happen anywhere without warning'. Despite his fear however, the storm chaser insists that most of the time he is 'simply mesmerized by the display that's going on in the sky in front of me'. Tornado: Chris Allington uses radar and GPS to trace the best routes to stay out of the rain and hail while trying to keep up with the fast-moving storms . Breathtaking: In strong winds and warm, humid conditions, Chris Allington aims to capture the exact point of a rotating thunderstorm where the clouds change both speed and direction to create spectacular formations . Otherworldly: Chris Allington's images often show giant clouds looming across the sky to form UFO-like weather structures . Growing up in the American Midwest Allington experienced a variety of extreme weather, which prompted his interest in photographing storms. 'One day after school, a tornado warning was issued for our area and the updraft of the storm went right over my neighbourhood,' he said. 'I was completely awestruck that the sky could produce something so incredibly beautiful and so destructive at the same time. I started learning about weather and looking at other photographers' images online and eventually learnt some forecasting techniques and how to read weather models,' Allington added. 'Then I started to chase. It seemed natural to pick up a camera to start to document the things I saw. I haven't looked back since,' he went on. Braving the unpredictability of the weather, Allington positions himself in the 'inflow' of the storm - the air feeding its updraft which helps to sustain it.

Inspiration: Growing up in the American Midwest Allington experienced a variety of extreme weather, which prompted his interest in photographing storms. 'One day after school, a tornado warning was issued for our area and the updraft of the storm went right over my neighbourhood,' he said . Fear: Allington said there are still occasions when he gets frightened while chasing a storm, with lightning scaring him the most 'just because it is so random and can happen anywhere without warning' The excitement of photographing the storm combines with the stress to stay ahead of it, and Allington has often driven dozens of miles to see nothing but blue skies as a 'cap' of warm air stops the storm developing. Only occasionally is his dedication rewarded. One image, titled 'Dodge', captures the moment a sunset illuminates a sudden lightning bolt - creating an orange rainbow. 'This is my favourite image', Allington said. 'We had been chasing an intense line of thunderstorms across areas of Western Kansas, and as sunset approached we decided to let a weakening storm overtake us.' 'It passed us by right as the sun set and as we looked east, we saw the rain and clouds lit up by the sun producing an amazing rainbow. The colours were unreal,' he said. 'It's always been a goal of mine to get lightning and a rainbow together - add in a crazy orange sunset and I was pretty pleased with how the day played out,' he went on to say.","Storm chaser Chris Allington, 26, braves the elements to take photographs of extreme weather conditions .

"By . Will Stewart . Jailed: Vyacheslav Vesnin, 47, was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in prison for being a cult leader and 'depraving' young people . The leader of a 'sect of perverts' which encouraged orgies and striptease in front of children was jailed in Russia for nine years after being found guilty of indoctrinating dozens of minors to worship sexual promiscuity. Members of the so-called Self Improvement Foundation 'were encouraged with psychological pressure to have uncontrolled sexual relations with each other, including in the presence of minors', disclosed investigators. Psychiatrist Vyacheslav Vesnin - who called himself the 'master' and 'guru' of the sinister group - held a magnetic attraction for women, it was claimed. He is believed to have had friends in high places in the city of Orenburg where his sinister sect operated for around 20 years. It had several hundred members. Four female acolytes of the burly and bearded 47-year-old cult leader were jailed for a total of 30 years, and Vesnin, who was arrested three years ago, will serve nine years and nine months, a judge ruled this week. The father of two was described as 'charismatic' and 'powerful'. Members of the 'depraved' sect included government officials, bankers, teachers, lawyers, and security officers in the far-flung southern Russian region, more than 900 miles south-east of Moscow. 'The worst thing was that they brought their under-age children with them,' reported one newspaper. Children were encouraged to watch orgies involving adults, it was claimed. One shocking picture shows a scared-looking girl aged three during a striptease performance by a near-naked female Vesnin follower. Sect: Vesnin poses surrounded by scantily-clad 'adepts' in his order . Smirking: Vesnin appears to wave as he leaves the court room. During his trial photographs showing children around naked adults were used as evidence . He was convicted after an accomplice - Marina Abrosimova - co-operated with prosecutors to expose his sinister cult. She received a five year suspended sentence. 'Children were taught anti-social and depraved behaviour, and accustomed to early sexual relations,' said one newspaper which branded his organisation a 'sect of perverts'. 'Minors were forced to engage in sexual promiscuity.' A total of 15 children required psychiatric help from a top Moscow clinic. More than two dozen were released from the sect. They were aged between seven and 16, and had suffered from 'premature sexualisation', though no adults were charged with having sex with children. Leader: Vesnin was described as 'powerful', 'charismatic' and somebody who held a magnetic attraction for women . Vesnin, shown smirking in pictures from court in Orenburg, was convicted this week of 'the creation of a religious association that infringes on the individual and the rights of citizens', 'actions aimed at inciting hatred or enmity', and 'depraving minors committed as part of an organised group.' Some surprise in Russia was expressed at the 'leniency' of his sentence, given the way children were brainwashed by his 'perverted beliefs'. When police and the security services moved in on the group, 110 members were 'completely naked' at a campsite near Orenburg, it was reported. A dozen children were present at the time. Hundreds of photographs showing children in the presence of naked adults were recovered from Vesnin's plush country home.","Vyacheslav Vesnin, 47, was the 'guru' of a sinister cult that met for orgies .

"By . Martin Robinson . This is the moment a drunk passenger stripped naked on the airport tarmac and begged the captain for a fight before he had to be tasered by police. The 52-year-old holidaymaker, who had arrived in Manchester on an easyJet flight from Malta, also urinated up the side of the Terminal One building in front of a shocked crowd. To add insult to injury the burly, bald man was slapped across the face by his fuming girlfriend before police officers fired 50,000 volts into him after he refused to calm down. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . 'Come on then!' A passenger had to be tasered after he stripped naked when he left a plane and then challenged an easyJet captain to a fight . Had enough: This sequence shows how after his bizarre behaviour his companion stood up to him and smacked him round the face in an incident caught on camera . Trouble began mid-flight when the traveller, who appeared drunk, became abusive and started swearing at fellow passengers. A witness who asked not to be named said: 'He'd had an altercation with other passengers and the captain had come down the plane to calm him down.' But on landing at Manchester at 1.28pm, the passenger's bizarre behaviour continued. After coming off the plane, down the steps and on to the tarmac, he stripped to his black underpants and gestured towards the pilot. Video shows him then stripping completely naked before getting a slap across the face from a woman. The witness added: 'He must have been drunk because when he came off the plane, he took his top off and shouted ""come on then"" in a Manchester accent and was trying to get the captain to fight him. 'Then he carried on taking all his clothes off. I have no idea why. The woman he was with gave him a slap for it.' In trouble: Witnesses described how the 52-year-old had been abusive on board the flight before standing in only his pants yelling up to the cockpit . Set to: The man speaks to air staff on the ground with his clothes on this time but then he started taking them off and yelling . The man put his clothes back on before entering Terminal One, where police arrived at 1.40pm. They tried to control him but resorted to using a 'dry' Taser - where the gun is held against the target to cause shock and pain - when he refused to co-operate. He was then arrested and escorted from the airport. Police confirmed they received a call on the morning of September 26. A spokesman added: 'Police were called to Terminal One arrivals of Manchester Airport following reports a man was drunk and being abusive to passengers on a flight from Malta. 'As he left the plane, he took his clothes off and urinated against a wall. 'A 52-year-old man was dry tasered and arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in a public place. He was issued with a Fixed Penalty Notice.' Incident: The passenger even urinated on the outer wall of Manchester Airport's terminal building (pictured) before he was arrested . An easyJet spokesman said: 'The passenger had arrived into Manchester on flight EZY1328 from Malta. 'The safety and security of its passengers and crew is easyJet's highest priority and, like all airlines, disruptive behaviour is taken seriously. 'The passenger was met by the police as a result of his behaviour.'","Witnesses said man, 52, stripped and yelled 'come on then' to captain .

"Kelly McGrevey purchased tanning package at Aloha Tanning after a quick tour of the salon . Returning the following day she was turned away after being told about a maximum 230 pound weight policy . Upon requesting a refund owner refused to cooperate . Report has now been filed with Ohio police . By . James Daniel . A woman was told she was 'too fat to tan' at a tanning salon. Kelly McGrevey said she purchased a tanning package at Aloha Tanning in Norton, Ohio on Monday after a quick tour of the facility. When she returned to tan on Tuesday, Ms McGrevey says the man working at Aloha at the time turned her away. Scroll down for video... Browned off: Kelly McGrevey outside the Aloha tanning salon that deemed her to be 'too fat to tan' Not welcome: The tanning salon that refused to say 'Aloha' to Kelly McGrevey and then refused to give her a $70 refund . He said, 'Sorry, but I'm not going to let you tan today because we've just implemented a new policy where anyone over 230 pounds can't go in one of our beds. I was just so shocked and embarrassed and humiliated,' she told WKYC news. The previous day she had been tanning in a standup bed but the following day was informed that it was broken and that traditional beds were off-limits to heavy customers. Policy: An employee at the Aloha tanning salon said there was a 230-pound weight limit on acrylic beds. Ms McGrevey then asked for a refund of her $70 month-long tanning package but the salon refused saying they did not give refunds. It was at this point Ms McGrevey called the police and filed a report against the owner of Aloha Tanning, Justin Hileman. Concerns: The tanning salon was worried that Ms McGrevey's weight could crack the acrylic tubes and plastic on which people lay down . Happier: Ms McGrevey is pleased that more people are getting to hear her story. She says she was discriminated against because of her size and has filed a police repot . She demanded to see the salon's policy on tanning and weight but the owner refused. A worker at the salon called Nicole said although the policy wasn't written down there was indeed a 230-pound weight limit on acrylic beds that is normally discussed with customers. 'We do have a lot of bigger people that came in here and they know that they can't go into the laydown beds because they are so, you know, they are bigger,' she said. Fat policy: Nicole (pictured) from the salon says they do have a policy for people weighing more than 230 pounds which is told to people before they pay . Ms McGrevey has been told that she will not receive a refund and has been advised instead to dispute the charge with her credit card company. 'I'm humiliated. I'm embarrassed. I don't want to face this guy for 30 days. I just want my money back,' she said.","Kelly McGrevey purchased tanning package at Aloha Tanning after a quick tour of the salon .

"By . Sarah Harris . Classic: Maya Angelou's autobiography is being taken off the syllabus by Welsh board WJEC . Maya Angelou’s autobiography has been culled by an exam board as a row over English Literature GCSEs deepened yesterday. WJEC revealed plans to drop foreign prose from its new qualification, along with AQA, the biggest exam provider in Britain, and OCR. Pupils will no longer study Angelou’s I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings with WJEC, the Welsh-based examiner, from next year. The acclaimed African-American author, poet and civil rights activist died on Wednesday aged 86. WJEC’s proposed new syllabus removes a section on ‘different cultures prose’ which covered the 1969 autobiography as well as John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men; Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mockingbird and Chanda’s Secrets by Canadian Allan Stratton. However, the American writer is included among a long list of poets pupils should cover to prepare for an ‘unseen poetry’ exam. The news came as AQA confirmed it was ditching an ‘exploring cultures’ section from its new English Literature GCSE. This means the loss of texts including Of Mice And Men; To Kill A Mockingbird; Doris Pilkington’s Rabbit-Proof Fence; Lloyd Jones’ Mister Pip and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus. OCR, a third exam board, has axed its ‘prose from different cultures’ section. This also covered Of Mice and Men and To Kill A Mockingbird as well as Amy Tan’ s The Joy Luck Club; Roddy Doyle’s Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha and Athol Fugard’s Tsotsi. The new specifications threaten to undermine Education Secretary Michael Gove’s claims that the government has not put pressure on examiners to ban non-British novels. More than 55,000 people have signed a petition against his English Literature GCSE reforms. The Department for Education has insisted that its document about content for the subject, published last year, ‘doesn’t ban any authors, books or genres’. New GCSEs must include at least one play by Shakespeare, at least one nineteenth century novel, a selection of poetry since 1789 including representative Romantic poetry and ‘fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards’. Removed: Angelou's autobiography I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings (book pictured left) and Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird (right) will no longer be studied by pupils as they are both 'prose from different cultures' Mr Gove has argued that all exam boards have the freedom to ‘include any number of other texts from which teachers can then choose’. But an AQA spokeswoman said yesterday: ‘Whilst technically it would not be impossible to add additional texts beyond the essential requirements, to do so would place an unacceptable assessment burden on teachers and students, which we are clearly not prepared to do.’ And Paul Dodd, OCR’s head of GCSE and A-level reform, has personally blamed Mr Gove for the ‘restrictions’, saying that the Education Secretary ‘really dislikes’ Of Mice And Men. OCR proposed new content features Meera Syal’s Anita and Me; Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go; George Orwell’s Animal Farm, Dennis Kelly’s DNA and J.B.Priestley’s An Inspector Calls. AQA lists these texts as well as Stephen Kelman’s Pigeon English; William Golding’s Lord of the Flies and AQA Anthology, Telling Tales, under modern prose. 'Everyone will have an opinion about which texts should be studied. We can't please everyone' - AQA spokesman . In modern drama, pupils will be able to study Alan Bennett’s The History Boys; Willy Russell’s Blood Brothers; Shelagh Delaney’s A Taste of Honey and Simon Stephens’ The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (script). Under the ‘19th century novel’ teenagers will study texts including Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Sign of Four. The AQA poetry selection has a strong emphasis on British and Irish writers. It includes Byron, Shelley, Tennyson, Seamus Heaney, Thomas Hardy and Ted Hughes. AQA’s chief executive, Andrew Hall, said yesterday: ‘We know that everyone will have an opinion about which texts should be studied and that we can’t please everyone.' On Wednesday, Nobel Prize-winning American writer, Toni Morrison, told the Hay Festival that it was wrong to divide literature into ‘nationalistic categories’. She said Mr Gove would regret the decision. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘In the past, English Literature GCSEs were not rigorous enough and their content was often far too narrow.’ Michael Gove has come under fire for the changes but insists exam boards have the freedom to choose texts . The proposals from AQA, OCR and WJEC have been submitted to Ofqual for accreditation, for first teaching from next year. Edexcel will publish its specifications today. A DfE spokesman: ‘The new GCSEs in English Literature will be broader and more challenging for pupils than those available at the moment. They will give pupils the chance to study some this country’s fantastic literary heritage, including works by Jane Austen, George Orwell, Kazuo Ishiguro and Meera Syal. ‘We have not banned any authors, books or genres. The exam boards have decided what literature to include, subject to the minimum requirements we set out. GCSE specifications are only a starting point.’ He added: ‘Our new secondary curriculum also explicitly sets out that children must learn about ‘seminal world literature’ between 11 and 14. American classics are precisely the sorts of books we would expect to be taught at this age.’","Welsh board WJEC removing 'different cultures prose' from syllabus .

"By . Wills Robinson . A reconstruction of the moments leading up to Madeleine McCann's disappearance is to be aired tonight in a renewed bid to find her six years after she went missing. A full re-enactment lasting 25 minutes will be  shown during the special episode of BBC Crimewatch, including a game of tennis she played with her parents. Pictures of men seen in and around the Portuguese town of Praia da Luz on the night of Maddie's disappearance on May 3, 2007, will also be shown as part of a new appeal to find the girl. Scroll down for video . Nightmare: The reconstruction of the events leading up to Madeleine McCann's disappearance includes a reenactment of a game of tennis she played with her parents . Video: A short clip has been released ahead of the broadcast showing a reconstructed scene of Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry playing tennis. The girl is circled . A number of e-fits, including two of . German-speaking men, have been released by British detectives  in an . effort to identify potential suspects and eliminate innocent sightings. Other e-fits have been released in the past to no avail. Their daughter, dressed in pink shorts, a light pink T-shirt and pink hat, will be seen running across the court, clutching a batch of tennis balls just days before she vanished from the Algarve. An interview with the McCanns will also be shown, where they were asked how often they think of their daughter, who went missing when she was three years old on May 3 2007. Her parents were dining at a nearby tapas restaurant when she disappeared from their holiday apartment. Mr McCann says: 'When it's a special occasion, when you should be your happiest and Madeleine's not there, that's when it really hits home. Suspect: The two e-fit images of the same man seen in Praia da Luz on the night Madeleine disappeared . Disappeared: A bed similar to the one Madeline was last seen in will be shown . Abduction: The moment Madeline was abducted has also been recreated in a renewed bid to find her five years after she went missing . 'Obviously, Madeleine's birthday goes without saying.' Mrs McCann adds: 'It's when you have big family occasions really. That's it isn't it? 'Family occasion' and you haven't got your complete family."" Crimewatch presenter Kirsty Young will speak to the McCanns live in the studio during the programme, while presenter Matthew Amroliwala explores the new focus of the police investigation in the resort where she disappeared. Senior investigating officer, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, will also discuss how the police have approached the inquiry. He says: 'Primarily what we sought to do from the beginning is to try and draw everything back to zero if you like. 'Try and take everything back to the beginning and re-analyse and reassess everything, accepting nothing.' Parents: An interview with Kate and Gerry McCann will also feature in the special episode of BBC Crimewatch . Abducted: The image of Madeline before she disappeared which became synonymous with efforts to find her . He adds: 'The careful and critical analysis of the timeline has been absolutely key. 'Primarily, we're focused on the area between 8.30 and 10. 'We know at 8.30 that was the time Mr and Mrs McCann went down to the tapas area for their dinner and we know that around at 10pm that was when Mrs McCann found that Madeleine was missing."" An incident room will be staffed during tomorrow's appeal and the days that follow, when the appeal moves to Holland and Germany, where dedicated TV programmes will also be shown. A dedicated call centre will also be opened at Hendon, in north-west London. Mr Redwood and his team recently revealed a vast log of mobile phone traffic could be the key to finding out what happened to Madeleine. Scotland Yard detectives have interviewed 442 people as part of their review-turned-investigation and hope to track down as many people present in the Portuguese town at the time. Since launching its own investigation, 41 people of interest have been identified by the Metropolitan Police, including 15 UK nationals. Scene: Presenter Matthew Amroliwala has been to Praia da Luz to explore the new focus of the police investigation . Review: DCI Andy Redwood will say the careful and critical analysis of the timeline has been absolutely key to the new investigation . Detectives have issued 31 international letters of request (ILOR) to mostly European countries in relation to the persons of interest as well as seeking permission to access phone records. A large but 'manageable' list of phone numbers identified as being present in Praia da Luz has been drawn up by detectives with a 'significant' number unattributed to any named person. Ahead of the programme, Mr Redwood, said: 'The timeline we have now established has given new significance to sightings and movements of people in and around Praia da Luz at the time of Madeleine's disappearance. 'Our work to date has significantly changed the timeline and the accepted version of events that has been in the public domain to date. 'It has allowed us to work with Crimewatch to build the most detailed reconstruction as yet, and highlight very specific appeal points. 'I hope that when the public see our investigative strands drawn together within the overall context of that appeal, it will bring in new information that moves our investigation forward.' The Portuguese investigation officially closed but authorities there are backing the Scotland Yard inquiry and officers from both countries will work together in pursuing new leads. The Metropolitan Police now has a team of six Portuguese detectives based in Faro, who are carrying out inquiries on its behalf. The McCanns are currently suing former police chief Goncalo Amaral for libel over claims in the book The Truth Of The Lie.","Footage to be aired on episode of BBC Crimewatch tonight at 9pm .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Forget the crisis in A&E, GPs refusing to work out of hours or the need to save billions from the NHS budget. Health ministers have declared war on an unlikely enemy: the builder’s bum. In a bizarre attempt to nanny the nation’s construction workers, the government has ordered them to ‘say bye bye to baring bottoms’. Target: The new public health minister has made targeting builders' bums the first priority of her job . Getting builders ‘into shape’ is the first priority unveiled by new health minister Jane Ellison. Critics immediately branded the plan ‘absolutely ridiculous’ and warned ministers to stop ‘sticking their noses into how people decide to live their lives’. Labour said ministers should focus on 'the cracks in the NHS instead'. The Department for Health has even enlisted TV presenter Tommy Walsh – dubbed ‘Britain’s favourite builder’ – to front the campaign to improve the health of bricklayers, carpenters and plumbers. ‘The image of the bottom baring, overweight builder is being replaced by workers who are hands-on well-oiled machines who operate building sites up and down the country,’ a press release said. ‘To build on this, today’s new pledge outlines how the construction industry will further help its workforce to lead healthier lives.’ Message: Public Health Minister Jane Ellison joined TV presenter Tommy Walsh (right) and two builders on a construction site to launch the campaign . Construction firms are being told . organise regular health checks for staff, offer stop-smoking clubs and . provide healthier staff canteens. Miss . Ellison, appointed Public Health minister in this week’s reshuffle, . said: ‘The construction industry is a vital part of the UK economy and . it is important we do all that we can to sustain a healthy workforce. ‘Builders often work in difficult and demanding environments and we must support them to ensure their health is not put at risk. 'It’s great that so many firms are making the health of their staff a priority on their sites.' TV builder Walsh said: 'As a builder I’ve seen attitudes towards health in the trade massively improve since I first picked up a trowel. 'Today’s builders are just as likely to go down to the gym as they are to go to the pub after work. 'But there’s loads more that workers and their companies can do, so I want every construction firm in Britain to sign up to the pledge and promise to do their bit to make building sites healthier places to work.' But a Labour source said: 'Days into the . new job, the Minister should concern herself with the cracks in the NHS . instead. David Cameron's left A&Es in crisis and hospitals without . enough staff. 'You couldn't make it up. Minsters need to get their priorities sorted.' Campaign: The government has enlisted builder and TV presenter Tommy Walsh to front the drive to lecture construction workers about their health . In total 34 companies signed up to a Responsibility Deal Construction Pledge to encourage their staff to adopt healthier lifestyles. But Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘It’s absolutely ridiculous that the Government are once again sticking their noses into how people decide to live their lives with this condescending campaign. ‘Of course it’s important people are fit and health especially when they are doing physical work, but this is the Nanny State gone mad. ‘Ministers should focus on cutting wasteful spending in the NHS rather than worrying about what builders are eating for breakfast.’","First announcement from health minister Jane Ellison is on builders' bums .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A British Airways jet crashed into an airport building in South Africa after the pilot ignored an instruction and took the wrong taxiway, it was claimed last night. The right wingtip of the Boeing 747-400 hit an office at OR Tambo airport in Johannesburg on Sunday as it was preparing to take off with 185 passengers on board.

"By . James  Nye . Four of the eight circus performers injured last month after a platform collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt made their first public appearance on Tuesday to reveal the mental and physical effects of the fall. At an emotional press conference the four women revealed they are to sue the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus for the 40-feet fall and revealed they are plagued by flashbacks of the horrifying incident. 'We have nightmares about this,' said Svitlana Balanchieva, 22, one of the girls badly hurt in the May 4 accident in Providence, Rhode Island, which unfolded in front of nearly 4,000 parents and their shocked children. Scroll down for video (Warning Graphic Content) Emotional: Circus acrobats Julissa Segrera, (second from left, of the United States, and Dayana Costa, right, of Brazil,) are tearful as Costa reads a statement to members of the media at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, Tuesday, June 17, 2014, in Boston . The four girls said that they are planning their lawsuit and  are coming to terms with the idea their lives might never be the same, they said Tuesday from the hospital where they're recovering. 'My dream was to be a star performer,' Julissa Segrera, a 20-year-old American, said from her wheelchair. 'Now my dream is to get up and walk.' A total of eight acrobats from the US, Brazil, Bulgaria and Ukraine were injured May 4 when investigators say a carabiner clip snapped, sending them plummeting about 20 feet to the floor at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus show in Providence, Rhode Island. Four of the women spoke Tuesday at a news conference at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston, where a number are still undergoing physical therapy. For some, it was their first public appearance since the accident.

They declined to detail the extent of their individual injuries, citing the potential legal action, but their lawyers said the performers had collectively experienced about two dozen surgeries. Viktoriya Medeiros, 34, of Bulgaria, who designed the hair-hanging ""human chandelier"" act with her husband, said the women know they are lucky to be alive. 'We are all terribly injured. Some of us require many surgeries,' she said, wearing a neck brace and seated in a wheelchair. 'We are learning to use our arms, hands and necks again (in) hours and hours of daily physical therapy. We are hoping we can (heal) enough that we can live our lives without this pain.' Dayana Costa, a 26-year-old from Brazil, said her family put their lives on hold to be with her during the long recovery. She wore a neck brace, had pins in her arms and was in a motorized chair.

Clifford Law Offices in Chicago is representing seven of the eight women injured in the accident, including the four that spoke Tuesday. The eighth is being represented by another firm. The lawyers declined to say who would be the focus of a lawsuit and did not rule out pursuing legal action against the carabiner-maker or even the venue, the Dunkin' Donuts Center. Attorney Michael Krzak said the women want to get to the 'root cause' of the accident, as it affects a number of aerial acts. 'They want to make sure this never happens again in another circus act,' he said. Investigators from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in Rhode Island are also probing the accident. Immediately before and immediately after: Performers hang during an aerial hair-hanging stunt at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus in Providence, Rhode Island, while first responders work at the center ring after it collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus . Performance gone wrong: An injured female performer is lifted onto a stretcher after the platform collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus in Providence in May . The women's medical treatment is being covered through workers compensation, Krzak said. Balanchieva and fellow acrobat Viktoria Medeiros said they missed performing. 'We always liked it to entertain families and mostly small kids,' said Balanchieva, who wore a neck brace and support around her torso. 'We took great joy in making others happy,' Medeiros said. 'That will no longer come to be,' said Medeiros, seated in a wheelchair with her arm bandaged. 'Always it will make us sad to know that we will never go back to do what we want to do, what we love to do."" Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare stopped short last month of saying the carabiner caused Sunday's accident at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus, witnessed by about 3,900 people, many of them children. Serious injuries: As many as 20 performers were hurt when the scaffolding collapsed, dropping them between 25 and 40 feet (8 and 12 meters) to the ground . No show: Stacey Tracy, of Cranston, R.I., comforts her daughter Emily Tracy, 4, after she found out the 3:00 p.m. show of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus had been canceled because of the accident in May . The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration is trying to make a final determination. 'We don't know if it was metal fatigue, if it wasn't properly positioned or something else,' Pare said. 'We just don't know.' All eight of the acrobats were still hospitalized with injuries including a pierced liver and neck and back fractures, as well as head injuries. None of the injuries were life-threatening, said Stephen Payne, a spokesman for Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company said in the immediate aftermath. Smart phone footage captured by a member of the audience shows a curtain fall to reveal a platform from which the performers were suspended, then suddenly the platform crashes to the ground and a loud gasp of horror can be heard from the audience.

Eleven people were admitted to hospital after the platform collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt, sending eight acrobats plummeting to the ground . Sydney Bragg, 14, of North Kingstown, said the platform began to fall as it neared the rafters of the arena. At first, she said, she thought it was part of the act. ‘It just went crashing down,’ Sydney said. ‘Everyone was freaking out. We heard this huge clatter and then we just heard the girls scream.’ She said spotlights were on the performers at the time, but all the lights went out after the fall. Rosa Viveiros of Seekonk, Massachusetts, said the act was covered by a curtain. Shortly after the curtain was pulled away, she said, the performers fell on top of at least one other performer, a man who stood up with his face bloodied. The other performers remained still, she said. ‘We thought it was part of the circus,’ said Rosa Viveiros' husband, Joe.","A total of eight acrobats were seriously injured on May 4 in Rhode Island when their circus platform collapsed and fell 40-feet .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . People who admitted eating large amounts of chocolate had, on average, far lower levels of fat over their bodies . It seems like news that really is too good to be true. Rather than being a major factor in piling on the pounds, eating large amounts of chocolate is one of the best ways to lose weight, a study has found. Spanish researchers examined the diets and healthy activities . of 1,500 teenagers aged between 12 and 17 in nine European countries, . including Spain and the UK. They found that people who . admitted eating large amounts of chocolate had, on average, far lower . levels of fat over their bodies. In particular, they were trimmer around the stomach area - regardless of whether they had an active lifestyle or were on a diet. Chocolate was also found to have a positive effect on circulation, blood pressure and heart health. The . study, from the University of Granada, backs up earlier findings from the University of California that suggested regular chocolate eaters have . less body fat. This may be because while chocolate contains more calories than many other . foods, it appears to make the metabolism work harder, offsetting the fat . that otherwise might hang around. There's also the issue of denial. A recent poll found that 86 per cent of slimmers who carried on enjoying their favourite treats successfully lost weight. Janet Aylott, a nutrition scientist for Nutracheck, which commissioned the survey, said: ‘Extensive research has proven that diets centred around food elimination are much more likely to fail. ‘The key is to take a more relaxed approach and to have a little of what you like.’ Previous research has shown that dieters . who completely eliminate treats such as chocolate, wine and biscuits . are often more likely to put on weight as they ‘compensate’ by eating . more of  other foods. Regular chocolate eaters were also were trimmer around the stomach area - regardless of whether they were active or on a diet . One study even showed that as many as 65 per cent of those who give up all treats actually end up ballooning in weight. Another recent study from the University of Cambridge found people who enjoyed . chocolate every day were 29 per cent less likely to have a stroke and 37 per cent less . likely to suffer with heart disease than those who avoided it most of . the time. It is the flavonoids . in cocoa beans - a key ingredient in chocolate - that seem responsible . for the health benefits of chocolate. These flavonoids (also found in . tea and red wine) act as antioxidants, which help mop up an excess of . cell-damaging free radicals. As . a rule, the higher the cocoa content, the more flavonoids and the . greater the health benefits - dark chocolate with 40 per cent cocoa solids . contains five times more flavonoids than white chocolate and twice as . many as milk chocolate.","People who .

"By . James  Nye . Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is to return home to the United States early on Friday morning after more than five years in captivity spent with the Taliban. The deeply controversial POW will land at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio after midnight according to two senior military sources. He will not make any public appearances ahead of what is being referred to as Phase 3 of his reintegration process and no media will be allowed to witness the former Taliban prisoner's return. The news that Bergdahl will be returning to the United States was announced at the same time as a pair of letters written by the soldier were leaked to the Daily Beast which offer some explanation why the soldier vanished. Scroll Down for Video . Home ground: Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, pictured moments before being freed by the Taliban, has arrived at a medical center in San Antonio . Since his prisoner exchange for five Taliban prisoners held in Guantanamo, Bergdahl has been recuperating under supervision in the US military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany. Indeed, according to NBC News, Bergdahl was in sufficiently 'good enough physical condition' to return to the United States before today, but was 'not ready psychologically or emotionally'. Furthermore, he has still not spoken to his family back in Hailey, Idaho, which canceled a homecoming party for the captured soldier after huge question marks about his desertion and wisdom of the exchange raged. His fellow soldiers have painted a picture of a comrade who walked away from his post in eastern Afghanistan and the Taliban has alleged that it did not kidnap him - rather they found him wandering aimlessly along a road. Bergdahl was taken directly to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio . Army life: Bergdahl, left, was a member of Blackfoot Company, 1st Battalion 501st infantry Regiment . The Pentagon has promised that they will be exhaustive in discovering why he was held for the best part of five years by the Taliban and the Obama administration has defended the decision to free him. Officials have kept a lid on details of Bergdahl's condition and his travel plans out of concern that he not be rushed back into the public spotlight after a lengthy period in captivity and amid a public uproar over the circumstances of his capture and release. Bergdahl was released from Taliban captivity on May 31 and has been at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany since June 1. He was deployed in eastern Afghanistan when he disappeared in June 2009. Watch Video Here: . Background: The investigation will look at what led to Bergdahl, pictured with a Taliban fighter before he was freed last month, leaving his base in Afghanistan and being held captive for five years . Steps to recovery: After being rescued, above, Bergdahl was taken to a hospital on a US Air Base in Germany . In the letters provided to The Daily Beast, Bergdahl writes from a Taliban 'prison', urging his family and the government to postpone judgement regarding the circumstances of his desertion. He then goes onto explain, in small amounts of detail why he walked away from his base in 2009. 'Leadership was lacking, if not non-existent. The conditions were bad and looked to be getting worse for the men that where actuly (sic) the ones risking thier (sic) lives from attack,' he writes in a letter dated March 23, 2013. It is one of two letters sent by Bergdahl to his parents and obtained by The Daily Beast. 'If this letter makes it to the U.S.A., tell those involved in the investigation that there are more sides to the cittuwation (sic),' he adds. 'Please tell D.C. to wait for all evadince (sic) to come in.' According to the publication, The Daily Beast obtained the letters from sources in contact with the Taliban and they have been confirmed to be the same letters delivered by the International Red Cross to Bergdahl's family. They are the first personal response from Bergdahl himself on the circumstances surrounding his captivity. The Pentagon declined to comment on the letters or why the soldier left his base. Taliban Dream Team: Abdul Waq-Hasiq, top left and suspected war criminal Mohammad Fazi, top right, Khirullah Khairkhwa, bottom left, and Mohammed Nabi, center, and Norullah Nori, bottom right, were released under the deal brokered with the Taliban and the Qataris . It said that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has 'already made clear that the Army is going to review the circumstances surrounding his disappearance and captivity,' adding that 'we need to reserve judgment until that process is complete.' While the handwriting in the letters, one from 2013 and one from 2012 is different, officials who have seen the letters have deemed them to be from the pen of Sgt. Bergdahl. These sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private correspondence. The International Red Cross would also not confirm that the letters released to The Daily Beast were the same ones in content that they delivered. 'We do this in a strictly humanitarian capacity and the messages only include family news,' a spokesman said on Tuesday. The first letter is dated, November 27 and is addressed in care of 'Geneve Red Cross' and claims the sender is 'POW Bowe Bergdahl, US Army Afghanistan War Prison. The letter is addressed to 'Father Robert Bergdahl, USA'. 'To my friends & family, in regards to the circomestance (sic) here, I am as well as can be here,' he writes. 'I am given food and drink.' Overjoyed: Bergdahl's parents, Jani and Bob, pictured with Obama, have not been reunited with their son . Too soon: A sign celebrating the release from captivity of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl stands on a street in the soldier's hometown of Hailey, Idaho, Wednesday, June 4, 2014 - a celebration in the town in his honor was canceled soon after . Bergdahl mentions recent rain in Afghanistan and muses about spring back home in Idaho. Some of the letter is redacted and he continues, 'I pray everyone is well. I think about you all every day. And all the things that happened in my life. I miss you all, but as papa says, God’s will be done. All things happen for a reason.' He then discusses religion and philosophy, saying, 'All things happen for a reason. Mathematics is full evidence of this. Just because we cannot understand the master equation does not mean it is not there,' he writes. 'Math is God’s code for this Universe and beyond. I miss you all.' According to sources familiar with the POW's captivity, Bergdahl was held in a cage for weeks at a time by the Taliban, with a hood over his head after two escape attempts in 2011 and 2012. Bergdahl ends the 2012 letter. 'I pray that you are all safe.' He then adds a drawing of an animal paw—something officials say his family pointed to as a code sign it was him. In the 2013 letter, Bergdahl acknowledges he knows he is suspected of being a deserter and tries to explain. Minority: Supporters of freed prisoner of war US Army soldier Bowe Bergdahl rally in front of the White House in Washington, DC, on June 10 . 'The cercomstance from the begaining of my time in Afghanistan from immedet top to bottom (sic for all errors), where bad for troopers espeshly in my PLT. (Platoon.) 'Orders showed a high disconcer for safty of troopers in the field, and lacking clear minded, logical and commonsense thinking and understanding from the topsides,' he writes. 'The cercomstance showed signs of going from bad into a nightmare for the men in the field. Unexeptable conditions for the men working and risking life every moment outside the wire,' Bergdahl adds. 'There are some risks that are forced to be taken, however it was made clear more than once that clear minded understanding from leadership was lacking, if not non-existent. The conditions were bad and looked to be getting worse for the men that where actuly the ones risking thier lives from attack as well as Afghan ellements.' Other letters seen by The Daily Beast include those sent by Robert Bergdahl, Bowe's father, in Arabic to his Taliban captors. Attached to the letter was a photograph of Bergdahl's father Robert and mother Jani. Robert wears a yellow ribbon on his shirt with his infamous long beard and his mother is veiled out of respect for his captors. 'Of course, we worry about his health and well being,' they write in a 26 November 2012 letter. Debate: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel listens to a question as he testifies before the House Armed Services Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, June 11, 2014. The committee is investigating the deal that secured the end of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's five-year captivity . 'It has been almost 4 years since we embraced him. Is it possible to see him once again on video?' The Taliban did release another video to them in 2013. Many have criticized the Obama administration for agreeing to release five Taliban prisoners from detention at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in exchange for Bergdahl. Some of Bergdahl's former Army colleagues have accused him of deserting his post. Republicans and Democrats questioned the wisdom of releasing the five Taliban members, saying they could return to the battlefield. Administration officials have told Congress that four of the five Taliban officials will likely rejoin the fight. In congressional testimony Wednesday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called the former Taliban government officials 'enemy belligerents' but said they hadn't been implicated in any attacks against the United States. He said Qatar, which has promised to keep the five inside the country for a year, promised sufficient security measures to warrant making the swap for Bergdahl. Hagel also said Bergdahl was early in the process of recovering from the trauma of captivity. He said that process began with his arrival at Landstuhl on June 1. 'He's being held there because our medical professionals don't believe he's ready. ... This isn't just about a physical situation,' Hagel said. 'This guy was held for almost five years in God knows what kind of conditions. ... This is not just about can he get on his feet and walk and get to a plane.' Bergdahl has not made any public comment since his release, and Pentagon officials say there is no timeline for arranging his initial contact with the news media.","Sgt.

"By . Joshua Gardner . Detroit’s newly-appointed emergency financial manager won’t rule out bankruptcy for the city and says the step might be one he’ll be forced to take. Kevyn Orr assumes the newly created job post March 25, but he told the Detroit Free Press Friday that he’s comfortable orchestrating what would be the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. The ailing Midwestern city holds around $14 billion in debts and Orr was chosen for the job by Michigan's Governor Rick Snyder. Big problems: Lawyer Kevyn Orr was chosen by Mich. Governor Rick Snyder to be Detroit's first Emergency Financial Manager and tackle the ailing city's massive debt problems . Ahead of his first day, Orr—a veteran in corporate bankruptcy—dropped hints that it might be in the interest of the strapped city’s creditors to help cut a deal. ‘The one thing everyone needs to know: If you go into bankruptcy,’ said the hard-hitting Washington, DC attorney, ‘Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code is weighted toward the municipality.’ Orr was careful to stress his desire to find other solutions to the city’s extreme money woes. ‘I prefer to pursue a consensual resolution,’ Orr said. Regardless of Orr’s preference, however, he acknowledges the threat of bankruptcy court is powerful leverage in his negotiations with creditors. Dire straights: Detroit's decline has been fast and steep and the city now owes its creditors around $14 billion after years of over-borrowing . ‘I think it can be done because the issue of the crisis is...so significant,’ he said. ‘I would think it would be reasonable within their authority to make a negotiated solution.’ If the city and Orr do proceed with the bankruptcy, reports the Free Press, it would likely take the form of a prepackaged bankruptcy. In such a deal, Orr would work out the terms of the deal with all Detroit’s creditors and present them alongside his bankruptcy petition. Those parties include vendors of goods and services, municipal bondholders, unions, pensioners, and others. Members of such groups, many of whom are left to assume that benefits like union-level wages are on the chopping block by Orr, are now protesting the emergency financial manager's appointment. High hopes: Orr, on right with Detroit Mayor David Bing at left and Mich. Governor Rick Snyder in center, says 'everything's on the table' to save the city, including Chapter 9 bankruptcy . Not all good: Though Orr might help the city as a whole, groups like city workers fear cuts he'll make will take away benefits they now enjoy . Orr will be doing a great deal of negotiating whether or not bankruptcy enters the picture, it seems. Though he might be Detroit’s best hope out of a tough situation, he doesn’t see himself as a savior for the city, but rather as a man working to show Detroit how to save itself. ‘I view my role as providing some architecture for a sustainable model for the city going forward.’ How he’ll build such an architecture, in a city that struggles to provide its residents with basic municipal services, remains to be seen. But, Orr says 'everything's on the table.'","Kevyn Orr, a corporate bankruptcy specialist based in Washington, DC, says 'everything's on the table' in his quest to save the strapped city .
Orr was tapped by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder last week and though he doesn't officially start until March 25, he's already facing huge obstacles and opposition ."
"By . Lucy Waterlow . In 2014 many people will be seeking a date for Valentine's Day via dating websites and smart phone apps. Gone are the days when women had to wait to be asked to dance at a stately hall ball or seek their father's approval on whether a man was rich enough to take their hand in marriage. Back when Jane Austen was penning her novels in 19th century England, a woman's reputation was everything and finding a husband was imperative. But while many of the traditions from that time have changed, there's still a lot that modern day daters can learn from their literary heroines... Timeless: Modern women can still learn from Jane Austen's stories which are no longer just books but films and TV series too . We all know that first impressions count on a first date but don't be too quick to judge. In Pride and Prejudice Mr Darcy dismisses Lizzie Bennett as 'barely tolerable' and 'not handsome enough to tempt me' after their first meeting but soon realises the error of his ways once he gets to know her. Our friends may have our best interests at heart but they don't always make the ideal matchmakers. A man they deem to be your perfect match could actually be the opposite. This is proved in the novel, Emma, when the book's heroine Emma Woodhouse convinces her friend Harriet Smith that farmer Robert Martin isn't the man for her and she should reject his proposal. She instead encourages her to pursue the gentleman  Mr Elton but this ends in tears when he reveals he doesn't have feelings for her. If only Harriet had followed her heart. As Austen writes: 'You must be the best judge of your own happiness.' But keep your friends close as you will certainly need them as you negotiate the dating scene as Austen observes in Northanger Abbey: 'Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.' Wasn't love at first sight: But the path of true love ran smoothly for Mr Darcy and Lizzy Bennett in the end in Pride and Prejudice . Too good to be true: Online daters have to be wary of boastful profiles . When online dating, it's not easy to know if you can believe someone is who they really say they are when they boast of their riches and good-looks on their profile. Unfortunately, it was the same in Austen's day and men who seemed too good to be true usually were. She illustrates this in the character of Mr Wickham in Pride and Prejudice, a charming soldier who makes a wonderful impression on everyone he meets and seems like the perfect catch. However, he turns out to be untrustworthy after it is revealed he gambled away his inheritance and nearly ruins the reputation of Lydia Bennett by convincing her to elope with him. He had no intention of making her an 'honest woman' by marrying her but is forced to do so by Mr Darcy. Wise words: Author Jane Austen . Hands up if you've been guilty of rejecting someone just because they weren't an inch taller, didn't earn enough money or shared your love of your favourite film. While it's fine to have standards, being too fussy could prevent you from finding true love. Mr Darcy shows he was being a bit too picky when he declares in Pride and Prejudice that he is looking for an 'accomplished woman' who 'must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.' Marianne Dashwood also fears she will never meet a man to meet her high standards in Sense and Sensibility when she declares: 'Mama, the more I know of the world, the more I am convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much!' She adds: 'I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own. He must enter in all my feelings; the same books, the same music must charm us both.' Looking for such a Mr Right could leave you single for a long time. In Sense and Sensibility, the wise Elinor cautions her younger sister Marianne not to get carried away with her feelings for Mr Willoughby after he comes to her rescue. Elinor advises her to be more prudent: 'Pray, pray be composed, and do not betray what you feel to every body present.' But Marianne doesn't listen and gets caught up in a whirlwind romance before having her heart broken. Fools rush in: Marianne in Sense and Sensibility, played by Kate Winslet in the film, listened to her heart over her head . In Mansfield Park, after being rejected by Mr Crawford, Maria Bertram marries for money. Later she is reunited with her first love and they have an affair which leads to her fall from grace. Playing cupid: But that meant Emma, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, almost missed out on love her herself . Emma is so busy involving herself in other people's business she completely misses the fact that her one and only is her life-long friend Mr Knightley - until another woman expresses an interest in him. Austen writes of her Eureka moment: 'A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers, once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress; she touched, she admitted, she acknowledged the whole truth... Mr Knightley must marry no one but herself!' Could your true love be staring you in the face? In Sense and Sensibility Marianne's relatives are concerned when Mr Willoughby insists their relationship must be kept secret - and it turns out he is engaged to someone else. Meanwhile, Elinor's intended beau Edward Ferrars has been secretly engaged to Lucy Steel for four years and regrets his proposal. So if a new man refuses to introduce you to his friends and family, won't acknowledge being in a relationship with you on Facebook or otherwise and insists your dates remain secret, consider why. If he loves you (and if he's really single), he shouldn't hide you. Happily ever after: But women today don't need a man for financial security . In Pride and Prejudice, poor Charlotte Lucas becomes engaged to Mr Collins. 'There is no earthly reason why I shouldn't be as happy with him as any other', she tells Lizzy, to which she responds: 'But he's ridiculous!' Charlotte tells her friend she 'can't afford to be romantic' because at 'I'm twenty-seven years old, I've no money and no prospects. I'm already a burden to my parents and I'm frightened. So don't you judge me, Lizzy.' Thankfully women today don't have to be dependent on their parents and then a husband for money and a roof over their heads (and 27 is no longer considered an age which it's old to be unmarried). Austenland, a film about a woman obsessed with Pride and Prejudice who travels to a Jane Austen theme park in search for her perfect gentleman is out now on DVD .","Times and technology have changed since Jane Austen's day .

"By . Emine Sinmaz . and Ben Spencer . Jeremy Hunt was fiercely critical of the service he controls in a speech, saying in some institutions there was a 'normalisation of cruelty' Patients are faced with ‘coldness, resentment, indifference and contempt’ in some of the country’s hospitals and care homes, the Health Secretary admitted yesterday. In a speech fiercely critical of the services he controls, Jeremy Hunt said that in the worst institutions there was a ‘normalisation of cruelty’ where appalling treatment was ignored by senior managers. He spoke of a ‘crisis in standards of care’, adding that hospital and care home bosses who allowed poor care should be sacked. ‘Accountability must be stretched to the top,’ Mr Hunt said in a speech to health professionals in central London. He said recent extreme cases such as those at Winterbourne View and Stafford Hospital were not isolated incidents, adding: ‘As well as the depressing regularity of these stories, the most worrying thing is the fact that in certain institutions this kind of care seems to have become normal.’ Mr Hunt, who made the impassioned speech almost three months into his tenure as Health Secretary, referred to a catalogue of shameful cases, in which low standards at British hospitals had led to appalling conditions and cruelty. He said: ‘In places that should be devoted to patients, where compassion should be uppermost, we find its very opposite: a coldness, resentment, indifference, even contempt. Go deeper, and look at the worst cases – like Mid-Staffs and Winterbourne View – then there is something even darker. ‘A kind of normalisation of cruelty, where the unacceptable is legitimised and the callous becomes mundane.’ Mr Hunt said some managers ‘buried in spreadsheets’ became ‘blind to the realities’. He mentioned Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust, where families had to take home soiled bed sheets to wash because they had not been changed by staff. He also cited Winterbourne View private hospital in Gloucestershire, where 11 care workers admitted 38 charges of neglect and ill-treatment of people with severe learning difficulties. A judge condemned the ‘scandalous culture of cruelty’ at the care home after an expose by an undercover reporter. Mr Hunt said some managers 'buried in spreadsheets' became 'blind to the realities' Six members of staff were jailed last month for their part in the institutional abuse. Mr Hunt also referred to Alzheimer’s patient Ronald Bowman, 74, who should have been checked every 15 minutes but escaped from Panteg County Hospital in Pontypool, South Wales, in July. It was an hour before nurses raised the alarm, by which time Mr Bowman had drowned in a river. Mr Hunt said: ‘Just look at what has come to light in the last few years: patients left to lie in their own excrement in Stafford Hospital, with members of the public taking soiled sheets home to wash because they didn’t believe the hospital would do it. Hunt cited Winterbourne View private hospital in Gloucestershire, where 11 care workers admitted 38 charges of neglect and ill-treatment of people with severe learning difficulties, pictured . Hunt said recent extreme cases such as those at Winterbourne View, pictured, and Stafford Hospital were not isolated incidents . ‘The man with dementia who was supposed to be monitored every 15 minutes who managed to leave a Pontypool hospital and drown. ‘The residents kicked punched, humiliated, dragged by their hair and forced through cold showers at Winterbourne View. The elderly woman with dementia repeatedly punched and slapped at Ash Court Care Home. ‘The cancer patient at St George’s, Tooting, who lost a third of his body fluid, desperately ringing the police for help, because staff didn’t listen or check his medical records.’ Mr Hunt also spoke about his plans to examine the effectiveness of ‘Ofsted-style’ inspections for hospitals and care homes.","Patients faced with 'coldness, resentment, indifference and contempt'

"By . James  Nye . Police in Dallas are investigating after a woman shot her US Navy officer ex-boyfriend dead on Sunday before turning the gun on herself. Amanda Todhunter, 29, was found dead in the Rowlett home of Brandon McClain, 34, after both suffered gunshot wounds to the head. The Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office announced on Monday that Todhunter died from a self-inflicted injury and McClain's death was ruled to be a murder after he was shot in the head and the back. Scroll down for video . Murder suicide: Brandon McClain was shot dead by his ex-girlfriend Amanda Todhunter (both pictured) Dallas Police said that they believe they both perished around 3pm on the kitchen of McClain's home - which Todhunter apparently had a key to. Authorities revealed that the couple had split two weeks before and that they had been called out twice to McClain's rented home twice before for domestic disturbances. Friends said she was having a hard time coping with the split. Todhunter had also recently started carrying a handgun, which police believe is the murder weapon . When McClain’s family learned of the murder-suicide, his father, Russell McClain said he knew his son didn't shoot anyone. US Navy: Brandon McClain served as a Chief Petty Officer in the armed forces and lived in Dallas recruiting special operations personnel . Scene: This is the home in the Dallas suburb of Rowlett where McClain and Todhunter were found dead on Sunday . 'I knew it wasn't him,' said Russell. 'It wasn't his character; he would walk away…that was the only thing I could think, was that she surprised him. She had to have surprised him.' According to Dallasnews, McClain was a chief petty officer with the US Navy and was listed as on active duty. He enlisted in January 2001 and was working for the Navy Recruiting District, Dallas - for special ops. Todhunter was studying at Eastfield College in Mesquite and police said that the couple had no children together, but did have their own from previous relationships. McClain's mother raised the alarm when he son missed his son's baseball game on Saturday. Grief: Brandon McClain's family break down in tears on hearing that he has been killed . When she went to his house and he didn't answer she went around the back and saw the body of Todhunter on the kitchen floor. Neighbors expressed their shock and said that the area does not usually suffer murder-suicides. 'The gentleman that lives there was supposed to attend a ball game of his son yesterday,' said Lt. David Nabors with the Rowlett Police Department. 'He didn’t show up for the ball game. His mother tried to get in contact with him and she wasn’t able to get him by the phone. She came over here to the house today to try to get a hold of him and he didn’t answer the door. 'She walked around the back of the house and saw the deceased female through the rear door.'","Amanda Todhunter, 29, shot dead her ex-boyfriend Brandon McClain, 34, on Sunday in Dallas .

"By . Associated Press . German prosecutors have opened an investigation into the alleged monitoring of Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone by the U.S. National Security Agency, officials said Wednesday, in a move that could again complicate diplomatic relations between the two allies. It wasn't immediately clear what the new investigation might mean in terms of possible prosecutions of Americans. Documents provided by National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden indicated in October the U.S. was monitoring Merkel's cellphone conversations, as well as those of 35 other foreign leaders. Merkel expressed outrage and accused Washington of a grave breach of trust. German prosecutors have opened an investigation into the alleged monitoring of Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone by the U.S. National Security Agency . In the ensuing diplomatic fallout, President Barack Obama acknowledged Germany's anger and promised that new guidelines would cut back on such monitoring, except in the case of a national security interest. 'The leaders of our close friends and allies deserve to know that if I want to learn what they think about an issue, I will pick up the phone and call them rather than turning to surveillance,' Obama said at the time. Following the news of the German probe, Obama's deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, said the U.S. believes direct dialogue between the two countries rather than an investigation is the best way to address Germany's concerns. 'We believe we have an open line and good communication' with Merkel and her team, Rhodes told reporters aboard Air Force One as Obama flew to Brussels for a meeting of the Group of Seven nations. After mulling for months whether to open a formal probe, Chief Federal Prosecutor Harald Range determined 'that sufficient factual evidence exists that unknown members of U.S. intelligence services spied on the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel,' his office said. President Barack Obama acknowledged Germany's anger and promised that new guidelines would cut back on such monitoring, except in the case of a national security interest . 'The operation of a foreign intelligence service's secret agents is a criminal offense in Germany,' Range told reporters after the decision was announced. 'And that's not dependent on whether it is the intelligence agency of a friend or of another nation.' Range refused to say how he would interrogate witnesses, saying he couldn't comment on any specifics about the investigation. In a similarly thorny diplomatic case, Germany got as far as issuing warrants for 13 unidentified CIA agents suspected of kidnapping a German terrorism suspect and taking him to a detention center in Afghanistan. The case was shelved in 2007 after the U.S. Justice Department said extraditing the agents would harm 'American national interests.' In his Wednesday announcement, Range's . office said he was not opening a formal investigation of wider . allegations of blanket surveillance of telecommunications data in . Germany by U.S. and British intelligence, saying that there was not yet . sufficient factual evidence of concrete crimes. His office said that will remain under consideration. German Parliament earlier this year set up a committee to investigate the scope of spying by the U.S. and its allies in the 'Five Eyes' network ¿ which also includes Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand ¿ in Germany that may have monitored Merkel . Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, declined to comment on Range's decision or on whether the government fears it will weigh on relations with the U.S. The government didn't exert any influence on the prosecutor, Seibert told reporters. 'I am not going to evaluate here the decision he has made,' he said. Separately, the German Parliament earlier this year set up a committee to investigate the scope of spying by the U.S. and its allies in the 'Five Eyes' network — which also includes Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand — in Germany. It is seeking testimony from Snowden. Opposition parties want him brought to Berlin to testify, but the government argues that that would hurt trans-Atlantic relations and security cooperation with the U.S. Snowden is currently in Russia.","Documents from NSA leaker Edward Snowden indicated the U.S. was monitoring the Chancellor's conversations .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Aged 13, she was given her first journal by her mother in the summer of 1832. Now, more than 180 years later, the early diaries of the future Queen Victoria are to go on show at Windsor Castle. In the books, the then-Princess speaks of the 'friendliness' of locals in the 'desolate, blasted and black' Midlands following the Industrial Revolution. First journal: Queen Victoria (pictured, right, as a teenager), was given her first journal (left) by her mother, the Duchess of Kent, in August 1832. It is among an array of royal treasures to go on show at Windsor Castle . She also comments on her school timetable, which saw her undertake lessons in history, geography, Latin and general knowledge. The diaries are among an array of royal treasures to go on display in an exhibition celebrating 100 years of the Royal Archives. Queen Victoria, who is Britain's longest serving monarch, was given her first journal by her mother, the Duchess of Kent, in August 1832 as they visited Powis Castle in Wales. The Duchess encouraged her daughter to record her impressions of the places they saw as they attended a series of educational tours across the country. Keeping a record: In her early diaries, the then-Princess speaks of the 'friendliness' of locals in the 'desolate, blasted and black' Midlands following the Industrial Revolution.  Above, an extract from her first journal . Passionate writer: During her lifetime, the Queen even kept brief diaries in Hindustani - 13 of which survive in the Royal Archives today. She began to learn the language with the help of Mohammed Abdul Karim (pictured) During the tours, the Princess was met with an unfamiliar sight of the newly industrialised Midlands, prompting her to write: 'The men woemen (sic), children, country and houses are all black. 'But I can not by any description give an idea of its strange and extraordinary appearance. 'The country is very desolate every where; there are coals about, and the grass is quite blasted and black. I just now see an extraordinary building flaming with fire.' However, despite her bleak surroundings, the future Queen was apparently charmed by the people she met, writing, 'We have just changed horses at Wolverhampton a large and dirty town but we were received with great friendliness and pleasure.' Amazing: Queen Victoria was made Empress of India in 1877. Above, an extract from her Hindustani diary . In 1832, the Princess recorded her school timetable in her journals, revealing she would spend half an hour at 9 o'clock each morning writing in her diary before undertaking a variety of lessons. The monarch's early diaries mark the beginning of a passion for writing that would last a lifetime, seeing the production of more than 43,000 pages within 141 journals, as well as vast amount of personal and official correspondence. It was the Queen's legacy that in 1914 prompted the creation of a permanent home for all documents relating to the Royal Family and Royal Household. Dedicated: Britain's longest-serving monarch continued to keep a diary until her death in 1901 . As well as recording her thoughts and observations of daily life in her personal journals, Queen Victoria corresponded frequently with members of her family in Britain and throughout Europe. She also communicated with ministers, ambassadors, heads of state and the Church. The monarch even kept brief diaries in Hindustani - 13 of which survive in the Royal Archives today. She began to learn the language ten years later after being made Empress of India in 1877. She was taught by one of her Indian servants, Abdul Karim, who later became her Indian Secretary and Munshi. Queen Victoria continued to keep a diary until her death death in 1901. Only 13 of the original volumes survive, dating from 1832 to 1836. Upon the Queen’s instructions, her daughter, Princess Beatrice, produced abridged copies of the remaining volumes, destroying the originals. In 1912, Queen Victoria’s grandson King George V decreed that ‘All the Royal Archives shall be kept...in the Round Tower’, and in 1914 the transfer of the records to their new home in the Round Tower at Windsor Castle began. The monarch's first journal is among more than 100 items featured in the book Treasures from the Royal Archives, which is being published by Royal Collection Trust on Saturday, May 17. It is also one of 25 documents being exhibited at Windsor Castle until January 25 next year.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A stunning castle nestled in the Scottish highlands is going on sale for a bargain £1.2million - but prospective buyers will have to shell out to complete vital refurbishment. Carbisdale Castle, near the village of Culrain, boasts 40 bedrooms and was for decades used as a youth hostel which attracted thousands of holidaymakers. The grand residence - completed in 1917 - sits on a picturesque hillside not far from the Kyle of Sutherland, a body of water famous for its salmon fishing. Up for sale: Cardisdale Castle, near the Highland village of Culrain, is on the market for £1.2million . Prospective buyers will have to shell out to complete vital refurbishment to the stunning building . Interior: The 40-bedroom castle was finished in 1917 and was once a bustling youth hostel. But it was ravaged by water damage in 2010 and 2011. The statues pictured have now been removed . Prospective guests would have to make their way up a single-track road to reach the castle's stone-built gates and broad courtyards. Carl Warden, an estate agent with Savills said: 'I've seen a lot of fine buildings in my time, but this one really makes an impression.  The size of it and the detail in some of the rooms just takes your breath away. 'There are six main rooms and the decorations are beautiful. And it's biggest saving grace is that the train stops at the end of the drive. You can walk the half a mile or so from the station.' Inside, as well the 40 bedrooms, the . castle boasts a ballroom, a grand hall, a billiards room, a dining room . and a drawing room - all of which were not harmed by the water damage . and boast intricate masonry. Remote: The large castle, bottom, is perched on a hillside in the Highlands, not far from the Kyle of Sutherland . The building was once a thriving tourist attraction, which entertained some 20,000 guests a year . The building was once a thriving tourist attraction, which entertained some 20,000 guests a year, but it was forced to close in 2011 after a spate of bad weather and water damage. A rough winter saw feet of snow pile up on the castle's roof. When the warmer weather returned and the snow and ice melted, it rushed into the house, causing millions of pounds of damage. The Scottish Youth Hostel Association (SYHA) - which is now trying to sell the property - spent more than £2million attempting to repair the damage. Architecture: The 40-bedroom property (pictured . left from the front) was damaged by water, but many of the grander rooms . have escaped harm . But financial pressures mean that the organisation is looking to dispose of the castle to spend its money elsewhere. In the wake of the repairs, beds, furniture and the kitchens were all stripped out. But Mr Warden says it would be essential to sell the property to somebody who wished to keep making commercial use out of it. Remaining repairs and refurbishment are likely to extend into the millions, he told MailOnline, but the castle could once again be viable as a Highlands hotel. Indeed, a Scottish government body has hinted that it may award a grant to anybody who wishes to pay out for further repairs. Remote: Carbisdale castle is in a distant part of the Scottish Highalnds - but has train links to Inverness and the rest of the country . In his statement, SYHA boss Keith Legge said the organisation was selling the castle 'with regret' because it could not find the funding to finish the refurbishment. Mr Legge said the castle had not generated enough surplus income to allow for reinvestment. He continued: 'The recent partial refurbishment and ongoing running costs already incurred, coupled with the extensive funds necessary to complete the refurbishment of the castle, makes it financially unsustainable to operate the property as a youth hostel in the long term. 'As a not-for-profit and self funding charitable organisation, SYHA has a duty to make best use of scarce resources.' In exile: King Haakon VII of Norway, pictured, took refuge in Carbisdale Castle while Hitler was occupying his country . The grand Highland residence was built between 1905 and 1917 for Mary Caroline, Duchess of Sutherland, the second wife of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 3rd Duke of Sutherland. The two married in 1889, six years after the Duchess’s first husband died in a hunting accident. But the marriage incensed the Duke’s family – and when he died his heirs contested the will, which left much of the family’s property to the new Duchess. The acrimonious battle saw the Duchess of Sutherland thrown in prison for six weeks for destroying evidence. As part of the settlement the Duke’s sons were forced to build the Duchess a home – and rumour has it she picked the prominent hillside location to make it as visible as possible to her disgruntled relatives. In a further twist of the knife, she told the builders to only install clocks on three of the four faces of the castle. The aspect pointing towards her estranged family in Sutherland has no visible clock – as she didn’t want to give them to time of day. Carbisdale changed hands in the 1930s when it was bought by a Scottish army colonel with Norwegian ancestry. He offered his home up as a safe haven to Haakon VII of Norway and Crown Prince Olav – later Olav V – when they were exiled in the Second World War. From Carbisdale the exiled rulers struck a deal with Stalinist Russia, allowing them to enter the country to rout Hitler’s forces, but demanding that they leave afterwards. In October 1944 the agreement came true when the Red Army stormed through Norway, but later withdrew and allowed the country to flourish. After the last remaining owner died in the mid-1940s, at which point it was given to the Scottish Youth Hostels Association, who ran it until its 2011 closure.","Carbisdale Castle near Culrain is nestled on picturesque hillside .

"By . Charlotte Griffiths . and Flora Bradley-watson . Swell: The Duchess of Cambridge showing her baby bump last month . It has been the most closely guarded secret surrounding the Duchess of Cambridge’s pregnancy –  the day on which the Royal baby is expected to be born. But now The Mail on Sunday can disclose that Kate has been given an official due date of July 13. Mystery has shrouded the expected date of birth ever since Kate was rushed into the King Edward VII hospital with severe morning sickness in December, early in the pregnancy. Because of her illness, the Palace was forced to announce she was expecting before she had undergone her 12-week scan. It meant no one outside Kate and William’s close circle knew exactly how far the pregnancy had progressed. A friend of the pair revealed: ‘Some of Kate and William’s closest pals were at a barbecue hosted by a family friend of the Royals recently. 'They were all discussing the fact that Kate’s baby is due to be born on July 13. Everyone was very excited.’ Unfortunately, the birth due date falls in the middle of the Coronation Festival, a four-day celebration to mark 60 years since the Queen was crowned, 16 months after being proclaimed Monarch on her father’s death. The festival, expected to rival last year’s jubilee revelries, runs from July 11 to July 14 – meaning William and Kate are almost sure to miss out. Opera singer Laura Wright, who will perform in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, joked: ‘I had better not sing too many high notes .  .  . what if my singing made her go into labour?’ The baby is expected to be delivered in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington – the same place William was born – under the supervision of Royal gynaecologists Alan Farthing and Marcus Setchell. Blossoming: Kate makes a speech at The Willows Primary School, Wythenshawe, Manchester on April 23 (left) and waving as she arrive for a visit to the Emirates Arena in Glasgow, Scotland on April 4 . Just after the pregnancy was announced in December, bookmakers were taking bets on whether the baby might share a birthday with Princess Diana, July 1. Now it appears the child will have a . birthday closer to the Duchess of Cornwall’s, on July 17.  Unless the . baby is more than nine days late, it will be born under the same cancer . star sign as Diana, an avid astrology follower. July . 13 is also the birthday of satirist Ian Hislop, actor Harrison Ford, . painter Frida Kahlo and  even Julius Caesar – although some historians . argue that he may have been born the day before. Good company: (L-R) Actor Harrison Ford, Private Eye editor Ian Hislop and Mexican artist Frida Kahlo were all born on July 13 . Proposed changes to the rules of succession will mean that if the baby is a Princess, she will be third in line to the throne, regardless of whether she has a younger brother. But The Mail on Sunday recently revealed Kate had purchased a pale blue Bugaboo buggy, fuelling speculation the child will be a boy. A Palace spokesman said last night: ‘We have only said that the Duchess is due in July. Anything further would be speculation.’","Birth due date clashes with Coronation Festival, a four-day celebration to mark 60 years since .

Philip wore a bandage  on his right hand, but it did not cast a damper . on his mischievous spirits. He later appeared at a  Buckingham Palace . garden party, in excellent shape. Musician Rick Wakeman said: ‘He shook . my hand as normal. I’ve been lucky enough to meet him a few times, and . he’s always been on fine form. I just find the pair of them amazing. I’m . openly a huge royalist.’ Later, he was seen greeting guests at the first garden party of the season in the grounds of Buckingham Palace . Despite the procedure, he offered his right hand around, refusing to let an operation get in the way of protocol . Write caption here . As the prince supported himself on his umbrella, he joked with guests about the bag-sized ones on the grass . The .

Four . years ago he had an operation on his left hand for carpal tunnel . syndrome, which causes pain and numbness. He has suffered from a . rheumatoid condition called synovitis, and gave up polo aged 50 due to . arthritis in his wrist. He plans to mark his 93rd birthday on June 10 at a garden party.

Princess Beatrice (centre) also attended the party and mingled with her grandparents' guests . Energetic: The Duke was in good spirits and joked with staff as he opened the Margaret Pyke Centre today . In recent years, the prince has suffered several bouts of ill-health, however, the most serious of which was over Christmas 2011 when he was rushed into hospital for emergency heart surgery after suffering a blocked artery, which involved him having a stent fitted . He was also forced to pull out of several key engagements to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012 having developed a severe bladder infection after being forced to stand for hours in driving wind and rain during a celebratory river pageant. He also spent his birthday - June 10 - last year in hospital after undergoing an ‘exploratory’ operation for unexplained abdominal pain. The results of the tests have never been released. Yet aides have admitted it is difficult to persuade Philip to slow down, with one saying: ‘No one would ever dare tell him to take it easy - you might as well take your life in your hands.’ ‘The Duke cannot bear anyone making a fuss'.","Prince Philip, 92, was treated yesterday morning at Buckingham Palace .

"By . Jonathan Petre . Trail blazer: Charles, pictured in Lake District, is stepping up his campaign for wool . In one of his most controversial campaigns since he championed organic food before it was fashionable, Prince Charles will set fire to duvets, jackets and carpets in his back garden – to highlight the value of wool. The Prince is to conduct the experiment at Clarence House this week to show that the natural fabric is much safer in a blaze than synthetic fibres like acrylic, nylon and polyester. It is part of a drive by Charles to revive Britain’s love affair with wool, which he sees as a chic, eco-friendly and long-lasting alternative to cheap ‘throwaway’ garments. Charles has been alarmed by the number of sheep farmers committing suicide – their livelihoods dwindled during the foot and mouth crisis. He is concerned that synthetic materials are jeopardising wool sales and that unsafe products, some from factories abroad using cheap child labour, appear in shops. Falling prices meant farmers were paying more to have their sheep sheared than they got for the fleece – but the Prince’s efforts are already turning their fortunes around. The Prince’s experiment aims to stress wool’s natural fire retardant quality. While man-made fibres can go up in flames if a cigarette is dropped on them, wool will smoulder and burn out. London Fire Brigade said it fully supported the Prince’s initiative, pointing out that at least eight people died last year after their clothes or bedding caught fire. However, critics of the campaign say woollen clothes are much more expensive than mass-produced synthetic fabric, and out of the reach of ordinary, cash-strapped families. The Prince’s demonstration is to take place on a fire-proof metal stage at his London home on Thursday. He will use a flaming taper to set light to a wool jacket and then a synthetic one. There will be similar tests on carpets, one wool and the other synthetic which is expected to flare up alarmingly. A duvet stuffed with wool and one with a man-made filling will be set alight to illustrate the dangers of smoking in bed. Later, to prove that wool is also kinder to the environment, the Prince, wielding a ceremonial spade once used by King George VI, will bury a woollen jersey in a flower bed, alongside one made of synthetic material. After four months the items will be dug up to reveal the wool version rotting into the soil while the synthetic one will be largely intact. Flocks: The Prince keeps Lleyn ewes, pictured, at Highgrove . His aim is to encourage the use of wool as a first choice, especially in public buildings, with woollen blankets in hospitals and carpets in schools. He also hopes to see more wool used as insulation. One courtier explained: ‘He  is convinced that wool must become an affordable alternative and will lead the argument – however unfashionable and against economic trends – for  a better use of our natural resources using a better product and hopefully saving an entire agricultural community.’ As part of the international Campaign For Wool, of which he is the patron, the Prince has enlisted fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and High Street stores such as Jigsaw and Marks & Spencer – who will be there to witness the plastic pyre. Five years after the campaign launched, it has seen significant successes. The long-term decline in the number of sheep in Britain has been reversed – there are well over a million more now than in 2010 – and prices have more than tripled. The Prince, who keeps a flock of Welsh Lleyn sheep at his home at Highgrove in Gloucestershire, said: ‘In the past five years, my Campaign for Wool, which aims to increase the demand for this remarkable fibre and assist the sheep farming community, has expanded into 19 countries. ‘I am so pleased that it has enjoyed some level of success. Wool has significant fire-resistant and fire-retardant qualities, and it is so important that manufacturers and consumers alike understand its sustainable and eco-efficient benefits. ‘When the campaign launched in 2008 the average price of the wool clip in Britain had fallen to 33p per kilo; it is currently above £1 per kilo. ‘While wool itself is still affordable, the impact down the line on farmers and wool-growers, and thus on the British and global sheep-farming industry, is immense. ‘If the farmers receive a  little more for their wool,  they are perhaps enabled  to remain doing what they  do so well, as opposed to  being driven away from the sector because of harsh economic realities.’","Prince will conduct an 'experiment' at Clarence House in London this week .

"By . Mark Prigg . If you've ever wanted to change your nail varnish but don't have the time, help could be at hand. A new concept puts tiny screens with a wireless connection on each nail - allowing patterns to be instantly changed from an app. The 'bloom your nails'; concept today won a prestigious Intel contest for wearable computers, raising hopes it would one day become a reality. Scroll down for video . the concept designs shown off by Lee: Each nail is a small screen that can be wirelessly updated form a phone app . Each nail is a small screen, complete with power source and wireless communication system. The screen has a days power, and must be recharged overnight. Designed are selected via an app, and then synced to the nail. Users can choose from designer nails, or create their own - and even then sell them to other users of the system. 'Bloom your nails is a set of wearable devices that are nails,' said Gin Lee, the Taiwanese student who developed the concept. Users can replace the patterns and design via a mobile application. 'Users can upload their own designers, and even sell them to other users,' Lee said. 'Through the syncing between the app and nail, you can enrich your fingernail patters and make sure you stand out.' The nails include wireless chips allowing them to communicate. At night, the nails are simply removed and recharge for another full day's wear. An app is used to choose a pattern, which is then sent to the nail, changing it instantly. The battery powered nails have enough power for an entire day's wear, Lee said. At night, they are simoply removed and placed on a special recharging stand. The concept was part of chipmaker Intel's Make it Wearable project, a global year-long initiative sponsored by Intel to support the evolution of wearables. Students (ages 13 and up, except where prohibited), designers, engineers, and makers can get involved in the contest.","Tiny screens  have built in wireless chip that can show any pattern or image .

"By . Gerard Couzens . Review: Madeleine McCann vanished in 2007 . Police in Portugal have put together a new team of detectives to assist Scotland Yard in the hunt for Madeleine McCann. They have been told to help officers from the Met and have been given a long list of people British police want them to interview about Madeleine’s disappearance in 2007 while on holiday with her parents in the Algarve. None of the detectives involved in the shambolic initial Portuguese investigation is thought  to have been chosen. The new team is expected to start work in the next few weeks. It will question more than 30 ‘people of interest’, thought to include a taxi driver who thinks he may have picked up Madeleine, then aged three, the night after she vanished from her hotel while her parents were at a tapas bar 50 yards away. Cabbie Antonio Castela, 73, said he picked up three men, a woman and a child resembling Madeleine about an hour’s drive from the resort and dropped them off at a hotel. He gave a statement to Portuguese police but was never questioned afterwards. British detectives are hoping to be allowed to participate in the interviews, although the Portuguese have made it clear that if they are given permission public prosecutors will be with them at all times. Disappearance: Gerry McCann, father of Madeleine, in Praia da Luz, Portugal where she was last seen . The formation of the Portuguese police team will be seen as a major step forward by British authorities pushing for a renewed effort in  the investigation. Home Secretary Theresa May sent an official request for assistance last month to Portugal’s attorney general. The document containing the request is thought to have included the names of the 38 people across Europe identified as ‘of interest’ by a Home Office-funded Met Police review team. The vast majority are thought to be in Portugal. Ongoing investigation: Kate and Gerry McCann hold a news conference to mark the 5th anniversary of the disappearance . Several witnesses, believed to be British tourists, have already been interviewed again in the UK. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading the Met’s review into the case, called Operation Grange, has said he believes Madeleine is still alive. The initial Portuguese inquiry was shelved in 2008 and the authorities there have insisted that providing assistance to the British review does not equate to a reopening of their  own investigation.","New Portuguese police team are on the hunt for Madeleine McCann .

"By . Kimberley Dadds . Simon Cowell reportedly dumped Lauren Silverman before he knew she was pregnant. The 53-year-old music mogul is said to have ended his romance with the 36-year-old socialite - the wife of his close friend Andrew Silverman - six weeks ago, only to later discover she is expecting his baby. He is said to have told a friend: 'It's over with Lauren - it has been since before anyone knew she was pregnant. I want matters resolved but in a sensitive way. I have to respect a lot of people's feelings. There's a lot of people's feelings here.' New revelations: Simon Cowell is said to have ended his relationship with Lauren before he knew she was pregnant . Simon is said to be feeling ""confused"" about Lauren's pregnancy but has vowed to stand by her. The source added to the Sunday Mirror newspaper: 'Simon feels like he's been done up like a kipper in all of this. 'He and Lauren split up six weeks ago but the next thing we know he gets a phone call from her saying, 'Guess what?' Since then he has been feeling very confused about everything.' Lauren's mother, Carole Saland, meanwhile has slammed claims her daughter deliberately got pregnant to ""trap"" the 'X Factor' boss. And she's calling for him to do the ""right thing"" and marry her pregnant daughter. 'Over': Reports are claiming Simon finished with Lauren, only to then be told she was pregnant with his child . She told The Sun newspaper: 'Lauren is not a gold-digger. She came from a very comfortable family and never lacked for anything. 'Her and Simon are very fond of each other. She tells me great things about him and has always spoken very highly of him... ""I trust Simon to do the right thing by my daughter.' Lauren - who is 10 weeks pregnant - has a seven-year-old son, Adam, with Andrew. 'Marry her': Lauren's mother, pictured centre is urging Cowell to 'do the right thing' by her daughter and walk her down the aisle . The casino boss has filed for divorce. Cowell, meanwhile, jetted out of Los Angeles on a private plane on Friday night - leaving all the furore over his married, pregnant lover behind. The X Factor supremo, 53, left California from a private airport and will join friends on board the Slipstream yacht in St Tropez, in the South of France, for what is expected to be a month-long vacation. He will tour Europe and take time to evaluate how exactly to proceed after it was revealed last week that New York socialite Lauren Silverman - married to his friend Andrew - is expecting his baby. Laying low: Simon Cowell left his Los Angeles home on Friday night for a month-long trip to Europe . Members of Cowell's harem including his ex-girlfriend and 80s popstar Sinitta, and even possibly his former fiancee Mezghan Hussainy, are expected to join him. Both are standing by him and have given him their full support. Ironically, it was on board the $458,000-a-week Slipstream that Cowell was pictured sharing a tender embrace with Lauren last August, in images that came to light earlier this week. But as Cowell soaks up the sun, his lover is spending the weekend in the Hamptons with her estranged husband as they attempt to come to an 'amicable resolution' over their divorce, according to one source. The couple want to make their seven-year-old son Adam their main priority, the source said. Break: Cowell was spotted leaving Los Angeles on his private jet on Friday night . Happy days: Cowell and Silverman vacationing in France last August. He left for St Tropez last night . And it seems Simon will need to use his time on holiday to come to terms with the expense of his latest scandal. Cowell is reportedly set to pay out £63 million in child support. The 53-year-old music mogul is said to have pledged to give her £3 million a year until the youngster turns 21 after taking legal and financial advice over the ""messy"" situation. A source told the Daily Star Sunday newspaper: 'He wants to ensure he does the right thing for her and their baby as well as resolving this mess. 'Simon wanted to know exactly where he stands and to minimise the damage this will do to his bank balance. Close: Simon Cowell appearing to kiss Lauren Silverman on a yacht off the coast of St Tropez in August 2012 . 'He has a good relationship with Lauren at the moment but when you're as wealthy as Simon, you can't take any chances. Money changes people.' Simon has been named in divorce papers filed by Andrew and it is claimed the X Factor boss has ""happily agreed"" to cover his former friend's legal costs if he drops an adultery claim in favour of a no contest divorce. Andrew has been spotted at the lavish New York home he shared with Lauren - who stands to receive between $3 and $4 million in the divorce under the terms of their pre-nuptial agreement - and their son over the last few days, but friends insist there has been minimal communication between the estranged couple. One pal told the New York Post newspaper: 'Andrew stayed at the house to create some normalcy for their son. 'There was no talk about the divorce settlement. That is being handled by the lawyers. There was minimal conversation between them. It was done purely for their child.'","Simon Cowell reportedly dumped Lauren Silverman six weeks ago, only to then be told she is pregnant with his baby .

"By . Associated Press . The Peace Corps is suspending its programs in Kenya because of security concerns and is pulling more than 50 volunteers out of the country until threat levels decrease, the Peace Corps and State Department said on Thursday. A statement to The Associated Press from the State Department said that the Peace Corps 'has been closely monitoring the security environment in Kenya ... and has decided to officially suspend the program in Kenya.' The Peace Corps will monitor the security situation and determine when volunteers can return, it said. The decision comes amid a tightening of security by the U.S. Embassy in Kenya, which has seen dozens of grenade and gunfire attacks the last two years. Earlier this year the U.S. increased the number of security personnel at the embassy and put armed Marines behind sandbag bunkers on the embassy roof. Too dangerous: Peace Corps volunteers in Kenya are being told to leave the country as gun violence is on the rise . The State Department also reduced the number of U.S. personnel here by moving a regional USAID office out of the country. The decision to suspend the Peace Corps program has been in the works for a while but was not announced publicly. U.S. warnings about the high risk of terror attacks in Kenya always ruffle the feathers of Kenyan leaders, and the State Department and Peace Corps statements underscored the long U.S.-Kenya relationship and the hundreds of millions of dollars the U.S. pours into Kenya every year. But it was clear that given the grenade and gunfire assaults, as well as the massive attack on Westgate Mall last year that killed at least 67 people, the government felt that its Peace Corps volunteers — who live in far-flung villages with little security protection — were vulnerable. Underscoring the danger of random violence, a police officer in the coastal town of Mombasa confirmed that a foreign woman had been shot and killed Thursday while walking the city streets, the second foreigner killed this month in the area. Recent Peace Corps volunteers in Kenya said they felt the U.S. government program did a good job of keeping them updated about security, including the sending of security text messages, but they acknowledged that security was deteriorating. There to help: The Peace Corps   hopes the volunteers can return 'to support the country in meeting its development goals' 'Some volunteers weren't very pleased with the level of security they provided, but I'm not sure what they were expecting. We don't have security guards to protect us, and it's Kenya, so sometimes bad things happen regardless of any preventative measures,' said Nik Schuetz, a 28-year-old volunteer in Kenya from 2009-11 now studying at the University of Kansas. The Peace Corps, which was founded in 1961 after the suggestion of then-Sen. John Kennedy, has some 7,000 volunteers in 65 countries working on education, health and environmental issues. Nearly 50 percent of the program's volunteers are in Africa. The program has had to pull volunteers out of dangerous situations before, including in Nepal in 2004 and in Kenya after the 2007-08 election violence. The Peace Corps also suspended its program in Ukraine in April. Schuetz was initially placed in western Kenya with a public health program but his house was broken into and his belongings stolen, so the program moved him to another province, where he stayed for two years. Sad to leave: Peace Corps volunteers feel as though the US has done well protecting them thus far but that dangers are on the rise and it's in their best interest to leave . 'They taught us to be smart about our surroundings and to trust the hairs on the back of our necks to sense whether it was a safe situation or not. And some things like bombings or grenade attacks, you just can't prepare for other than leaving the country,'he said . Anna Martin a Peace Corps volunteer in Busia, Kenya from 2010-12 who still lives in the country, said she always felt safe as a Peace Corps volunteer because the U.S. mission was 'always making the best decisions regarding our safety and well-being.' 'My opinion ... is that things just weren't getting better,' said Martin. 'Peace Corps had already taken measures to protect volunteers but had to ultimately make a bigger decision. And it a wise one.' At full strength the Peace Corps has had more than 125 volunteers in Kenya in recent years, and the pull-outs will hurt communities receiving American assistance. Shira Kramer, the spokeswoman for the Peace Corps, said the program hopes the volunteers can return 'to support the country in meeting its development goals.' A third recent Peace Corps volunteer in Kenya, Travis Axe, said there was no doubt that aid groups, schools and pharmacies would be negatively affected by the pull-out. 'Kenya is spearheading the growth and trends of so many sectors in East Africa; it is a shame to see such a wonderful program be cut from a country that has so much potential,' he said.","The Peace Corps is pulling more than 50 volunteers out of Kenya until threat levels decrease .

"By . Associated Press . The Social Security Administration has blown through nearly $300 million to create a new computer system to handle disability claims -- and the Lockheed Martin-led project still doesn't work. Six years ago the Social Security Administration embarked on an aggressive plan to replace outdated computer systems overwhelmed by a growing flood of disability claims. Today, the new system is nowhere near ready and agency officials are struggling to salvage a project racked by delays and mismanagement, according to an internal report commissioned by the agency. In 2008, Social Security said the project was about two to three years from completion. Five years later, it was still two to three years from being done, according to the report by McKinsey and Co., a management consulting firm. Today, with the project still in the testing phase, the agency can't say when it will be completed or how much it will cost. Hot seat: Acting Social Security Commissioner Carolyn Colver's agency has failed to implement a new computer system to handle disability claims - despite spending $288million . In the meantime, people filing for . disability claims face long delays at nearly every step of the process — . delays that were supposed to be reduced by the new processing system. 'The . program has invested $288 million over six years, delivered limited . functionality, and faced schedule delays as well as increasing . stakeholder concerns,' the report said. As . a result, agency leaders have decided to 'reset' the program in an . effort to save it, the report said. As part of that effort, Social . Security brought in the outside consultants from McKinsey to figure out . what went wrong. They . found a massive technology initiative with no one in charge — no single . person responsible for completing the project. They issued their report . in June, though it was not publicly released. As . part of McKinsey's recommendations, acting Social Security Commissioner . Carolyn Colvin appointed Terrie Gruber to oversee the project last . month. Gruber had been an assistant deputy commissioner. 'We . asked for this, this independent look, and we weren't afraid to hear . what the results are,' Gruber said in an interview Wednesday. 'We are . absolutely committed to deliver this initiative and by implementing the . recommendations we obtained independently, we think we have a very good . prospect on doing just that.' Fail! After some six years, Social Security officials still don't know how much longer their beleaguered new software will take to be finished . The revelations come at an awkward time for Colvin. President Barack Obama nominated Colvin to a full six-year term in June, and she now faces confirmation by the Senate. Colvin was deputy commissioner for 3½ years before becoming acting commissioner in February 2013. The House Oversight Committee is also looking into the program, and whether Social Security officials tried to bury the McKinsey report. In a letter to Colvin on Wednesday, committee leaders requested all documents and communications about the computer project since March 1. The letter was signed by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the Oversight committee, and Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and James Lankford, R-Okla. They called the project 'an IT boondoggle.' The troubled computer project is known . at the Disability Case Processing System, or DCPS. It was supposed to . replace 54 separate, antiquated computer systems used by state Social . Security offices to process disability claims. As envisioned, workers . across the country would be able to use the system to process claims and . track them as benefits are awarded or denied, and claims are appealed. But . as of April, the system couldn't even process all new claims, let alone . accurately track them as they wound their way through the system, the . report said. In all, more than 380 problems were still outstanding, and . users hadn't even started testing the ability of the system to handle . applications from children. Boondoggle: Congressman Darrell Issa is investigating whether Social Security officials tried to bury the audit outlining the agency's crippling problems . 'The DCPS project is adrift, the scope of the project is ambiguous, the project has been poorly executed, and the project's development lacks leadership,' the three lawmakers said in their letter to Colvin. Maryland-based Lockheed Martin was . selected in 2011 as the prime contractor on the project. At the time, . the company valued the contract at up to $200 million, according to a . press release. McKinsey's . report does not specifically fault Lockheed but raises the possibility . of changing vendors, and says Social Security officials need to better . manage the project. Gruber . said Social Security will continue to work with Lockheed 'to make sure . that we are successful in the delivery of this program.' Steve Field, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin, would only say that the company is committed to delivering the program. Money guzzlers: CEO Marylin Hewson's Lockheed Martin is the main contractor behind the failing Social Security project, which was valued at $200 million . The report comes as the disability program edges toward the brink of insolvency. The trust fund that supports Social Security's disability program is projected to run out of money in 2016. At that point, the system will collect only enough money in payroll taxes to pay 80 percent of benefits, triggering an automatic 20 percent cut in benefits. Congress could redirect money from Social Security's much bigger retirement program to shore up the disability program, as it did in 1994. But that would worsen the finances of the retirement program, which is facing its own long-term financial problems. Social Security disability claims are first processed through a network of field offices and state agencies called Disability Determination Services. There are 54 of these offices, and they all use different computer systems, Gruber said. If your claim is rejected, you can ask the state agency to reconsider. If your claim is rejected again, you can appeal to an administrative law judge, who is employed by Social Security. It takes more than 100 days, on average, to processing initial applications, according to agency data. The average processing time for a hearing before an administrative law judge is more than 400 days. The new processing system is supposed to help alleviate some of these delays.","Agency struggles to salvage aggressive plan to replace outdated disability software system .

"By . Binky Felstead . Hello from New York! As you may know, I'm currently Stateside to film a very special series of Made in Chelsea. So far it's been a whirlwind of gorgeous weather, shopping and cocktails, and I'm loving every minute. But don't worry, I haven't forgotten you all back in Blighty! Earlier this year I found out the exciting news that the annual Victoria's Secret Fashion Show will be taking place in London this year, and I'm determined to get hold of a golden ticket. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Binky loves the glitz and glamour of the Victoria's Secret show and has been inspired to create a beauty look to match the Angel's glowing skin . I can't help but love the glitz and glamour of Victoria's Secret - not to mention the divine beauty looks on the models. So this week - as I'm in the true home of Victoria's Secret - I thought I'd show you a wearable daytime twist on the signature glamorous look of the Angels, with a flawless, glowing complexion and shimmering smokey eye. Step 1 - Gorgeously Glowing . First, I applied bareMinerals Prime Time face primer all over my face for a velvety smooth base to work from. A flawless, glowing complexion is imperative if you want to look like a Victoria's Secret Angel, so to recreate this I used Daniel Sandler Invisible Radiance Foundation, gently buffing it into my skin with a foundation brush. The great thing about this foundation is it has a really buildable coverage, camouflaging pesky blemishes whilst still maintaining a dewy finish. The nifty matching concealer in the lid can also be used to add extra coverage to any problem areas. I then set my glowy base in place with a sweep of Vichy Dermablend Setting Powder. Step 2 - Bedroom Eyes . Now for the eyes - the Victoria's Secret Angels are renowned for their smouldering, sexy eye make-up, so for this look I've opted for a golden smokey eye. I first applied a touch of bareMinerals Brightening Eye Primer over my lids, which provides a smooth base for eyeshadow as well as increasing its longevity. The bareMinerals Ready Eyeshadow Palette in The Rare Find offers a gorgeous selection of shimmery golden shades - plus I can't fault the buttery texture of the shadows. Inspiration: Lily Aldridge gets prepped for the catwalk backstage at last year's Victoria's Secret show . I first swept the champagne shade all over my lid, before taking the gold shade to define my crease and emphasise the outer corners of my eyes. Using a smaller brush, I went on to define my upper and lower lashes with the same shade. To give my peepers that added va va voom, I dabbed a touch of bareMinerals High Shine Eye Colour in Bronzed to the outer and inner corners. The colour payoff with this pigment is phenomenal, so a little does go a long way! I then coated my lashes with Too Faced Lash Injection Mascara to make them full and flirty - wiggling the brush up from the root to define each lash. Binky has gone for a golden smokey eye to echo the signature smoldering look of the Victoria's Secret Angels . Step 3 - Sculpted and Sexy . It wouldn't be Victoria's Secret without bronzer - and you all know Binky loves bronzer! For this look I used Daniel Sandler's Spice Twice bronzer to contour and sculpt my face, sweeping the colour under my cheekbones, across my temples and under my jawline. Then, to give my face that effortless Angel glow I dabbed a touch of Clarins Instant Light Radiance Boosting Base across the tops of my cheekbones, under my brow bones and down my nose. For an ethereal shimmer I followed this up with a sweep of Too Faced Candlelight Highlighter across the tops of my cheekbones. Binky kept her lips quite neutral in order to achieve a daytime look . I wanted to keep my lips quite neutral, so slicked on a layer of pink lipgloss from bareMinerals. I also recommend the Clarins Instant Light Lip Perfectors to give your pout a similar pinky sheen. If you wanted to turn this into more of a party look, simply smoke up your eyes with a darker shadow and team this with a foolproof nude lip - Michael Kors' Lip Lacquer in Diva would be my shade of choice! And there you have it - Victoria's Secret style glamour made easy. If you'd like to try out this look, you can get all the products I used from online beauty boutique Escentual.com. Binky was able to incorporate her signature bronzer into her Victoria's Secret look . Now, any discerning beauty addict will know that first and foremost, you need to sort your skincare routine out before you can think about make-up. Mummy Felstead and I are both huge fans of French pharmacy products, so we're very excited that Escentual.com have up to 1/3 off a plethora of skincare goodies from Caudalie, Vichy, Bioderma and many more! If skincare confuses you and you're not sure what to choose, take a look at my skincare routine post, which will hopefully shed some light on the steps your regime should include: www.escentual.com/blog/2014/01/24/binkys-skincare-favourites/ .

"By . Bianca London . When it comes to a beloved child's birthday, parents have long gone all out to ensure that their day is as special as possible. But it seems that pleasing the little darlings is setting parents back more than ever, as the typical cost of a children’s birthday party rises to more than £214. On average, a parent will fork out an average of £214.54 per party, while 64 per cent say they want to ensure their child enjoys a ‘super sweet 16’ style bash every single birthday. Extravagant: Parents are so desperate to please their children and outdo their friends that they spend, on average, £214 per party . Research found a third of mothers and fathers splash out on their children's birthday bash to guarantee it is ‘better than their friend's’. And the pressure is so great for one in 11 parents (nine per cent) that they would spend a staggering £800 - at least - on a party for their child. The study looked at the growing trend of hugely extravagant celebrations thrown by parents for their children's birthdays. So fancy are some birthday parties that two per cent of the 1,000 parents surveyed said their child has received an iPod in their party bag. Furthermore, 16 per cent said their child had found make-up in their party bag, while four per cent had received gift vouchers. And as part of the research, children aged between 5-13 were also polled to find out the criteria for the perfect party. Competitive: Research found a third of mothers and fathers splash out on their . children's birthday bash to guarantee it is 'better than their friend's' According to the young respondents, the ideal party would be held at a theme park and last five hours eight minutes, with 30 guests invited. Meanwhile, the bash should also involve them receiving 17 presents, lunch at Nando’s and even a guest appearance from footballer David Beckham. Interestingly though, children would rather their grandparents, 47 per cent, and school friends, 67 per cent, attend their party than One Direction. In contrast, the study also asked the parents polled how their children’s parties differ to the ones they had when they were growing up. Perfect combination: Children voted their top birthday party would see David Beckham in attendance and be held at a theme park with lunch at Nando's . One in five, 21 per cent, admitted they didn’t even have a birthday party while growing up. And those who did said on their gift list were items such as clothes, board games and outdoor activity games - not televisions and games consoles. Gary Kibble, from Littlewoods.com, who carried out the survey, said: 'Though the blueprint for the ideal party is quite staggering, parents needn’t feel under pressure to make these parties become reality. 'It’s great if parents can include some elements of the blueprint in their kids’ parties but it’s not essential to have them all, like David Beckham attending. 'What is refreshing from this research, is children put immediate family and close friends higher up on their guest list than their favourite celebs.' The only way is pop: The children would also love to see One Direction at their party and have Justin Bieber's music on repeat . Where: A trip to the theme parkWith: 19 friends, seven family members and four neighboursDuration: five hours and eight minutesEntertainers: Illusionist and make-up artistLunch: Nando’s, followed by a chocolate fountain with fruit and sweets to dunkMusic: Justin Bieber and The Saturday’s latest chart topping CDs on repeatGifts: 17 presents, including an iPad, Flatscreen TV, money and a petCake: Huge and with more candles than their yearsParty bags: At least nine gifts including a gadget (such as a Nintendo DS) or a giant toyCelebrity guest wish list: One Direction and David Beckham top the poll by quite a way .","Third of parents splash out to guarantee party is better than friend's party .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . John Travolta's former pilot is allowed to make a case that he has no confidentiality agreement covering his employment with the actor, an appeals court ruled. Douglas Gotterba, who wants to give a revealing account of his time working for Travolta's airline company Alto, was given approval by a California court on Tuesday to make his case. Gotterba, who claims to have had more than just a business relationship with the star, has been trying to prove the agreement is invalid, after Travolta's attorney made a cease-and-desist order. Scroll down for video . Dispute: John Travolta's former pilot will be allowed to make a legal case to try to prove he is not bound by a confidentiality agreement . Claims: Former pilot Douglas Gotterba, who wants to write a book about his life, alleges that he did not sign a confidentiality agreement . The attorney, Martin Singer, threatened legal action after learning that the former employee had spoken to the National Enquirer. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Gotterba decided to 'tell the story of his life' including his dealings with Travolta, after being 'unwillingly thrust' into the spotlight by revelations from another former employee of the star. He spoke to the National Enquirer and also planned to write a book about his experiences with Travolta, who also has a pilot's license. Warning Gotterba 'you proceed at your peril,' Singer wrote: 'We demand that you immediately cease and desist from your wrongful course of conduct which has subjected you to enormous liability and entitles my client to seek tens of millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages,' the Wrap reported. Gotterba had worked for Travolta's Alto airlines for six years at the start of the 1980s, and when he left the company he had a written termination notice with Alto. However, the former employee and the . company are now disputing which termination agreement is valid, with . Gotterbra claiming that the final one, dated March 17, 1987, did not . contain a confidentiality clause. Tell all: Gotterba is trying to prove he is free to discuss the six years he spent working with Travolta in the 80s . Boss: Travolta, pictured in 1983, hired Gotterba for his airline company Alto . Alto, however, has said that the correct version of the agreement was a longer version signed April 3, 1987, which included clauses preventing Gotterba from discussing his time with the company. The later agreement allegedly stated: 'You hereby represent that you have not and will not disclose, communicate, use, nor permit the use of, in any fashion, any personal (i.e., those matters not customarily disclosed by Employer other than to insiders, in the case of [Atlo], or close friends in the case of Travolta), confidential or proprietary information about Employer or any principals of Employer that you obtained during your employment with Employer.' To try to prove his point, Gotterba sued Travolta and Alto to get a . judicial declaration about which agreement was valid and whether the confidentiality clause was valid. Travolta pictured at Sydney Airport in 2010. The actor is a qualified pilot who has flown Qantas jets . Lawyers for Travolta have tried to apply for legal motions to stop Gotterba . Alto has twice tried, unsuccessful, to apply for an anti-SLAPP motion to stop Gotterba's complaint. When the case was heard by the appeals court Tuesday, presiding justice Arthur Gilbert said the case was not based on Singer's 'sabre-rattling [but] the validity of the asserted termination agreements'. He added: 'Although the prelitigation letters may have triggered Gotterba's complaint and may be evidence in support of the complaint, they are not the basis of the complaint.' He ruled that to say otherwise 'would lead to the absurd result . that a person receiving a demand letter threatening legal action for . breach of contract would be precluded from seeking declaratory relief to . determine the validity of the contract.' An attorney for Travolta told The Hollywood Reporter: 'While . we believe the court should have thrown out Gotterba’s lawsuit at the . outset, ultimately, he will not prevail on his claim. 'Gotterba points to an unsigned draft agreement, which he now . claims is the controlling document in the case, yet he attached as an . exhibit to his own complaint the final version of the contract that he . signed barring his claim. We are very confident that in the end we will . prevail in the action.'","Douglas Gotterba claims he is not bound by confidentiality agreement .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A desperate father whose little girl died after he left her in a hot car by accident in 2010 has spoken out to warn other parents from making the same tragic mistake. 'This pain can sometimes pull you right to your knees with no warning,' Reggie McKinnon said on Tuesday, describing the scars left following the death of his 17-month-old daughter Payton Lyn. 'It's still a question that remains unanswered: how did I forget my child?' McKinnon, who lives in Cape Coral, Florida, had taken Payton to an appointment on that fateful March day four years ago, then strapped her back into her car seat and went to work as a supervisor at Centurylink, forgetting he hadn't returned her.

Amongst the people featured in forthcoming first episode is a retired soldier who has built a military-style command and control center in his home to protect himself from apocalyptic superstorms. He believes communication is key and has a collection of 20-plus different radios. Later in the series viewers will get to meet a man who is confident that an economic collapse is imminent and owns a warren of rabbits that he believes will give him all the food, fuel and fertilizer he needs to survive. He's currently developing a system to grow vegetables from the waste of his rabbits and even built a rabbit-powered flame thrower to protect himself.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A six-year-old who has endured more than 30 operations has been given a new lease of life, saved by her grandmother who donated a kidney. Ella Chadwick was born with the rare congenital nephrotic syndrome, and had both of her kidneys removed when she was 19 months old. The youngster has had 38 operations and was facing having dialysis treatment for the rest of her life. When a kidney transplant from her father Martin failed in October 2010, Ella's parents gave up hope. Ella Chadwick was born with the rare condition congenital nephrotic syndrome, which caused her to suffer kidney failure at 19 months. Both her kidneys were removed and she was put on dialysis until her father Martin donated one of his kidneys . When the organ donated by Mr Chadwick failed, Ella's parents gave up hope. But her grandmother Christine Chadwick (pictured with Ella) stepped forward offering to donate one of her kidneys to help the six-year-old . But Ella's grandmother, Christine Chadwick, stepped in and offered to be a donor. The 58-year-old was found to be a match for her young granddaughter and the operation took place at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. Ella's mother Karen Hughes, 33, from Manchester, said: 'It's been an incredibly difficult time for us as a family but it's such a relief to see her up and about. 'We didn't know if she would be strong enough for the operation right up until they cut her open. 'Ella was on dialysis at home until she was strong enough, but after the first transplant failed we barely dared hope this time round. 'Christina was so brave volunteering to give her a kidney - as soon as they said it she was happy to get tested there and then. 'I didn't dare dream we would ever get to this point, never mind how well she has done. Ella is definitely one amazing little girl.' The concerned parents first took Ella to the doctors with her condition when she was just three weeks old, when they noticed she had a red 'outie' belly button. But they were told unless it got worse or became painful it was nothing to worry about. Miss Hughes said: 'We had another check up when she was six weeks old and she had lost some weight. Ella, who is from Manchester, was admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, where she has had her transplant operation . The youngster, who had been on dialysis treatment, is recovering well in the hospital, and her parents Karen Hughes and Martin Chadwick hope she will be allowed home soon . Since she was 19 months old, Ella, pictured with her parents, has had 38 different operations . The kidneys of people with nephrotic syndrome do not work properly, causing large amounts of protein to leak into their urine. It can affect people of any age, but it is often first detected in children aged between two and five years old. The loss of protein can cause a range of problems, including swelling of body tissues and increase a person's chance of catching infections. Symptoms can be controlled by medication.Children with the condition have times where their condition is under control, when they are in remission. ion can flare up, when symptoms return in times of relapse. A small number of children have congenital nephrotic syndrome, which means it is inherited. These children tend not to do as well.They may, as in Ella's case, experience kidney failure and need a transplant. Congenital nephrotic syndrome is caused by an inherited faulty gene. For the condition to be passed on, both parents must have a healthy copy of the gene and a faulty one. They then have a one in four chance that any children will develop the condition. Nephrotic syndrome can affect people of any age, but it is commonly seen in young children.It affects more boys than girls. Only about one in every 50,000 children are diagnosed with the condition each year. Source: NHS Choices . 'After that we were in and out of hospital trying to find out what was wrong with her. 'In my head I never thought it would be anything serious - if she was poorly she would not be eating or sleeping, but she was behaving like a perfectly normal baby girl.' Eventually a blood test diagnosed Ella with congenital nephritic syndrome. The condition means the proteins and fats that are meant to be absorbed and excreted in the urine are not. The result is that fluids in the blood stream leak into the body's tissues, flooding the kidneys. Miss Hughes said: 'As a parent after hearing those words it consumes your life day and night. 'You can never unhear them no matter how much you try and push them to the back of your head. 'It would keep me awake at night and then when I finally got to sleep I would wake up with a sudden urge to check on her.' Ella is currently recovering at Great Ormond Street Hospital, and it is hoped she will be out in six weeks. Miss Hughes, added: 'It's been a rollercoaster for us. 'We don't want her to go home until she is better but it's so hard being away from our family and friends. 'Her illness has led to complications - she now can't walk unaided and needs a wheelchair. 'Ella has been on life support five times - it's amazing how much work the kidneys actually do and the knock on affect on her whole body. 'We are so proud of Ella - we have the bravest, strongest little girl.'","Ella Chadwick was born with the rare congenital nephrotic syndrome .

"By . Ian Drury, Home Affairs Correspondent . Lives will be put at risk if the Government pushes ahead with controversial plans to force emergency services to share airwaves with the public, it was claimed last night. Ministers want to put calls by the emergency services on commercial mobile phone networks, with Vodafone and Motorola invited to tender for the new super-fast 4G system. The Home Office insists 999 crews will have priority over other phone users on the system, which replaces its taxpayer-built Airwaves network for fire, police and ambulance crews in 2016. Ministers want to put calls by the emergency services on commercial mobile phone networks (file picture) Officials say emergency workers will receive faster internet connections to download data available using the latest smartphones. But critics are concerned that moving the emergency services on to the commercial network – largely untested in major emergencies – increases the risk of call blackouts. They say that during the 2011 riots and the London bombings in 2005, mobile services across the capital crashed under the sheer volume of use. Currently, emergency services have their own masts so even when commercial networks collapse their calls can continue. Inspector Alan Ogg, of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said: ‘There are two major issues which are still of concern. 'How the transition to the new network will take place and be managed, and what provision has been made to ensure the emergency services are prioritised during periods of heavy user traffic and events. The Home Office insists 999 crews will have priority over other phone users on the system (file picture) ‘Public and officer safety must remain the priority for any advancements and changes to the emergency service network.’ A West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service briefing paper said: ‘The capacity of a commercial network, particularly if an incident occurred during a large event, is a concern… Question marks still exist over the technological solution. ‘There are significant health and safety implications. Delivery of a solution that simply results in lower cost for Government without fully considering the effectiveness and ongoing efficiency for individual services could have significant implications for public and fire-fighter safety.’ The Home Office insists the consortium which wins the contract, worth more than £400million a year, will be ordered to prioritise the police, fire and ambulance services in an emergency. Declan Ganley, chief executive of Rivada Networks, whose firm was not shortlisted by the Home Office, said: ‘People’s lives will be put at risk by the Government’s plan to put calls by the emergency services on commercial mobile phone networks. ‘The system simply cannot cope with a major incident.’ A Home Office spokesman said the plan remains on track and ‘the tendering process marks another step towards the emergency services having the modern communications network they need to protect the public’.","Plans in place to force emergency services to share airwaves with public .

And in the 45 to 64-year-old group there was an overall increase in diagnoses of 7 per cent from 2012 to 2013 - a total of 16,411 cases. In total there were 446,253 STIs diagnosed in England last year, a slight decrease from the 448,775 cases diagnosed in 2012. New figures released by Public Health England reveal the overall number of cases of STIs fell last year from 448,775 cases diagnosed in 2012 to  446,253 cases in 2013. Experts warned of an 'undeniable growth' in cases among the over-60 age group . Chlamydia, pictured under the microscope, was the most common STI, making up 47 per cent of all diagnoses - a total of 208,755 cases in 2013 . Chlamydia was the most common STI, making up 47 per cent of all diagnoses - a total of 208,755 cases. Meanwhile there was a large rise in cases of gonorrhoea, up 15 per cent from 2012, with a total of 29,291 cases recorded in 2013. Public Health England said young people aged 15 to 24 years still experience the highest rates of STIs, accounting for 63 per cent of chlamydia cases, 54 per cent of genital warts, 42 per cent of genital herpes and 56 per cent of gonorrhoea cases. However experts at the Family Planning Association warned of the 'undeniable growth' of STIs in older people. FPA’s Policy and Parliamentary . Manager, Harry Walker, said while many of the 'baby boom' generation, growing up in the 1960s when the contraceptive pill was introduced may have never, or rarely used a condom. With a rise in the number of older people using dating websites, and enjoying sex later in life, he urged older people to be aware of the dangers of unprotected sex. He said: 'While increases in STI diagnoses can in . part be attributed to greater awareness and better testing programmes, . there has been an undeniable growth of STIs among older age groups. 'Some . of these people will be from the ‘baby boom’ generation who grew up in . the 1960s when the contraceptive pill was introduced and may have never . or rarely used condoms. 'And . with sexual health messaging often targeted at young people, men and . women who come out of long-term relationships might find themselves with . very little information and knowledge about STIs. 'We . know that many are enjoying a new lease of life through internet . dating, and enjoying sex is by no means the preserve of the young. 'While . they might not need to worry about the risks of becoming pregnant . anymore, they might not think about the other type of protection which . is offered by condoms. The highest number of cases of all STIs was among the 15-24 age group . 'What . is particularly worrying is the fact that people over 45 now will have . been sexually active around the time of the high-profile and effective . condom-use messages of the 1980s and 90s, but perhaps these have been . forgotten.' Dr Catherine Lowndes, consultant scientist in PHE’s STI surveillance team, said: 'Sustained efforts to encourage people to regularly get checked for STIs means we are now finding and treating more infections – which is good news. 'Nevertheless these data show too many people are still getting STIs each year, especially young adults and gay men. 'Investment in promoting good sexual health awareness, contraception and condom use, and STI testing is vital, as is ongoing investment in easy to access sexual health services that meet the needs of local populations. 'Not only will this help bring down STI rates but abortion rates and under 18 conceptions as well.' National guidance recommends local services routinely offer chlamydia screening to young adults but only 15 per cent of young men and 35 per cent of young women were tested in 2013. Wide variations were seen across the country in the rates of chlamydia testing and diagnoses – with only around a third of local authorities reaching the recommended chlamydia screening levels (2,300 diagnoses per 100,000 young adults per year). Clamydia in males was most prevalent in the 20 to 24 age group, while in women the highest number of cases was among those aged 15 to 19 . Dr Lowndes, added: 'Chlamydia can have serious consequences, including infertility, if it’s not treated. 'These data show we need to do more to encourage young adults to ask for testing every year when they attend health services. 'Local areas can look at embedding screening into a variety of settings to make it as easy as possible for this group to get tested. 'Offering a young adult a chlamydia test opens the door to conversations about other important aspects of good sexual health, such as contraception and condom use.' People can significantly reduce their risk of catching or passing on an STI by consistently and correctly using condoms until all partners have had a sexual health screen, by reducing the number of sexual partners, and by avoiding overlapping sexual relationships.","Total number of STIs fell from 448,775 in 2012 to 446,253 cases in 2013 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Almost 60 families have been left without school places for their children after a council scrapped a new primary school just six weeks before it was due to open. Furious families blasted ‘shambolic’ Bromley Council after offering them places at the brand new Harris Primary Academy in Beckenham, south-east London, in April - only for councillors to block the school from opening last week. The school, which was hoped to meet the strong demand for primary places in the area, was due to be built on the site of an existing senior school in an exclusive residential street where the average house price is nearly £2million. Class dismissed: Some of the parents and pupils now without a school stand alongside Siobhan Adams (centre) who was due to be head teacher of the new school . Two temporary classrooms were to be placed on the site for September, allowing reception classes for children aged four and five, who would enter a newly-built permanent school constructed on the site the following year. But local residents had complained the school’s temporary single-storey classrooms, which would be situated behind high hedges and at least 65ft (20m) from the nearest house, would create ‘light pollution’. One parent, who asked not to be named, said: ‘The situation is shambolic. Peter Dean, one of the councillors who denied planning permission, has already admitted to parents in an email that he didn’t know the council had offered us places there. And this man is vice-chairman of the committee. ‘And despite admitting he doesn’t know what he’s talking about, he’s still deemed able to make a decision that has ruined these kids’ start in life.’ Furious: Mothers Polly Sell (left) and Nadia O'Hare (right) are among those whose children are now without a school place . Mother Polly Sell added: ‘It was Bromley Council that offered us the places, there was no caveat that the school would not go ahead on the admissions form - which there were for some schools. 'How can the council give with one hand and take away with another? At the very least it makes Bromley Council look - for want of a much stronger word – disjointed' Polly Snell, mother . ‘How can the council give with one hand and take away with another? At the very least it makes Bromley Council look - for want of a much stronger word - disjointed.’ Another parent said: ‘I would like to know why councillors feel the interests of a few wealthy residents are more important than the education of the children of 60 families who they also have a responsibility towards.’ The families, many of whom had already spent almost £100 on new Harris Academy uniforms, including official school bags and coats, have been told they will not find out where their children will be placed until September – days before the new term begins. Closed: The entrance to the Harris Academy School which is currently in use as a senior school . Councillor Richard Scoates, Chairman of the Planning Sub-Committee said: ‘As permission was being sought for 120 pupils and over 80 additional parking spaces, the Committee noted that the application would have represented a cramped and substantial intensification of use of the site. 'The Committee rejected the application because of this and the increased traffic generation and parking pressure.’ A Bromley Council spokeswoman said they would be looking to relocate all of the children, but admitted there were no spaces left in any Beckenham schools. The councillors who voted against the school – Russell Mellor, Michael Turner, Simon Fawthrop, Peter Dean, Samaris Huntington-Thresher, Melanie Stevens and Vanessa Allen – all declined to respond to a MailOnline request for comment.","School set to be built along exclusive residential street in SE London .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Hundreds of padlocks left by couples as love tokens are to be removed from a metal bridge – in case it becomes unsafe. In a craze taking hold in cities across the world, lovers attach a lock to a bridge’s railings and throw away the key as a symbol of their love. Over the years, couples have put more than 330 'love locks' - bearing their names and romantic messages - on the Queen's Park Suspension Bridge in Chester. More than 330 'love locks' have been attached to Queen's Park Suspension Bridge in Chester in recent years . But the council’s structural engineers say it is now 'close to its theoretical capacity for wind loading' and the locks must be removed to protect the public. The news comes after an incident in Paris which saw tourists evacuated from the Pont des Arts across the Seine after pieces of the parapet crumbled away under the weight of metal love tokens. The bridge was immediately closed to the public and was quickly repaired and reopened. A five-feet long section of metal mesh fell inwards onto the bridge itself and officials said the design of the bridge made it impossible for debris to fall onto pleasure boats and barges on the River Seine. Workers at Cheshire West and Chester Council (CWaC) will begin removing the locks next month, when the newly-refurbished bridge is also due to be resurfaced. Councillor Lynn Riley, executive member for localities, said: 'We’ve taken the logical decision to act before there’s any danger to the public. 'At the same time, we’re doing the best that circumstances allow to respect the sensitivities of those who attached the locks and may want to have them back as a keepsake.' The news comes after an incident in Paris which saw tourists evacuated from the Pont des Arts across the Seine (pictured) after pieces of the parapet crumbled away under the weight of the padlock 'love tokens' Queen's Park councillor Neil Sullivan added: 'The Queen's Park Suspension Bridge is a handsome structure in its own right which, to be fair, has just cost our council taxpayers a tidy sum to refurbish. 'While appreciating the romantic significance of the locks, many residents don’t believe they enhance the appearance of the bridge, particularly when they damage its new paintwork when moved around by the wind.' Owners who still have keys will have at least three weeks to reclaim them. After removal by the council, the remainder will be stored locally until the end of the year. Tokens of everlasting love and commitment, 'love locks' have appeared in cities around the world - particularly Europe - with lovers locking their love and throwing away the key. The craze is such that companies manufacture them in especially bright colours and even gold or silver plate. Their true origin is uncertain but is thought to be either China or Serbia.","More than 330 'love locks' on Queen's Park Suspension Bridge in Chester .

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent . Parents  in Kent say their children's school has become a 'living hell' since controversial 'super head' Jane Porter (pictured) was brought in to raise standards . Parents are protesting and teachers quitting their jobs over a controversial new primary school 'super head' who once banned children from mentioning Christmas or David Beckham. King’s Farm Primary in Gravesend, Kent is ‘in crisis’ after more than half its teaching staff resigned and parents holding signs and placards staged a protest outside the school. It follows the appointment of headmistress Jane Porter in January as part of attempts by Kent Council to raise standards at the school. Mrs Porter made headlines last year after she ‘banned’ all 515 at another Kent primary from mentioning Christmas before December 1 in case it distracted them from their work. She said that children would lose their ‘golden time’ if festivities were talked about before December. She said the same would apply to mentions of Beckham. A group of 20 parents convened outside King’s Farm last week to protest that the head had turned the school into a ‘living hell’. They said the school was ‘in crisis’ amid a mass departure of staff and children were missing out on school trips, PE lessons, sports days and other activities. The school has 15 teachers and 27 teaching assistants but 25 of them have announced they will not be returning after the summer holidays. Emma Friend, 28, who has four children at the school aged three to eight, said: ‘Since Mrs Porter came in all communication has broken down. ‘Sports days and trips have been cancelled, since she took over the school has been hell. My children cannot cope with the changes. ‘The two Year 5 and 6 classes have been combined and my boy is chewing his jumper because he is worried about the instability.’ Around half of the staff at King’s Farm Primary in Gravesend, Kent are believed to be leaving over the summer . Ruth Serwotka, a National Union of Teachers representative, said the ‘exodus’ of teachers and teaching staff was an ‘incredible and catastrophic crisis’, telling the local paper: ‘It is obviously a very challenging school. ‘I have put forward a formal complaint from teachers and teaching staff to Kent County Council. ‘There are significant issues and there is a huge amount of insecurity with so many staff leaving the children have no stability.’ Another parent, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Since January it has been all change and you can see by the number of teaching staff leaving that everyone thinks the same - the teachers, the parents and the children, they all want out.’ But other parents gave a different perspective. Tony Hughes, 42, said: ‘They (protesters) are all scared of change. ‘I don’t quite know what they’re hoping for. Do they want the head out because she’s making changes? If it’s not her it will be someone else. ‘From what we’ve seen of her she’s been brilliant and helpful, and the kids love her.’ According to a 2012 Ofsted report the school is ‘satisfactory’, which means it is deemed to ‘require improvement’ under new Ofsted categories. Ms Porter has caused controversy in the past by threatening to punish children for talking about David Beckham or Christmas, claiming pupils were getting distracted from their work . In November last year, Mrs Porter was branded a ‘Scrooge’ after banning children at nearby Whitehill Primary from mentioning Christmas before December 1. She said at the time: ‘I’m not joking when I say this started 2,000 years ago. ‘The long and short of it is that one of the golden rules is to work hard, so if children are not working hard, talking about Christmas for instance, then they will lose their golden time. ‘That would be the case with anything not related to school; they shouldn’t be talking about David Beckham either. ‘If they are talking about something they shouldn’t be, they’re not working hard; we are a school, we’re about education, not retail.’ Mrs Porter remains in charge of Whitehill as well as King’s Farm. A Kent County Council spokesman said: ‘Jane Porter was brought in at the request of the local authority to raise academic standards and the quality of teaching - as she had done at Whitehill Primary School in Gravesend. ‘KCC takes complaints seriously and the governing body at King’s Farm Primary School will make sure they are properly investigated and that any response is appropriate.'","Trouble-shooting headteacher Jane Porter brought in by local council .

The entertainer tweeted a message of thanks to his fans today - saying he was 'so happy right now' following the positive response to his kiss . His words came as Glasgow 2014 chief executive David Grevemberg called the kiss a 'confident' move which emphasised the equality of Scotland. Mr Grevemberg, who confirmed the kiss was planned, said: 'We thought this accentuated the values of Scotland and the diversity of Scotland. 'Some people may say (it was) bold, but I think confident. Gretna Green is a place where people elope. 'That moment was about people getting married. It's all about love.' So far, the dancer who received the performer's kiss can not been named . One Twitter user spoke out in support at the embrace - saying 'every time a kiss between gay people is captured on camera, a little piece of homophobia dies' Another user said the kiss would help gay children who faced discrimination in their home countries . Two more write their praise on the social media site - with one saying it was 'important beyond symbolism' Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive Mike Hooper said: 'There should be no discrimination on any grounds whatsoever. 'I thought the whole thing was a fantastic show.' Mr Grevemberg said the ceremony had been universally well-received by the athletes. 'I really hope it expressed the warmth of Glasgow and Scotland's welcome,' he said. 'The feedback that we received from the athletes was very, very positive. They felt the welcome was jubilant and engaging. 'I was delighted with that response.' The kiss involving John Barrowman received plenty of backing on Twitter .

Glasgow-born Barrowman reached out . to kiss the man before holding his hand during a sequence to celebrate the village of Gretna Green on the Scottish/English border that is . celebrated as a destination for eloping couples. Positive response on Twitter was almost immediate. Graham . Love tweeted: ‘Nice touch with this kiss there by John Barrowman. Taking aim at 42 of the 53 competing nations that criminalise . homosexuality.’ One Twitter user said: ‘Awesome Gay Kiss’, while another said ‘gay kiss yes john barrowman’. Craig Drummond tweeted: ‘It makes me strangely proud to be Scottish that to John Barrowman can kiss a man on live tv.’ The entertainer put on a colourful show - and at one point could be seen singing from a platform while surrounded by giant teacakes and tartan-clad dancers . The singer and his band were also driver round atop a tartan Land Rover . Another wrote: ‘I just want john barrowman to kiss more dudes.’ Some even attacked those who spoke out against the kiss. Fashion editor Tessa Hartmann condemned the embrace while appearing on BBC Breakfast this morning - saying it was inappropriate. Some reacted in horror at her words - with one saying: 'I don't think your opinions are ""appropriate for children"" - BBCBreakfast is not the place to push your ""political message""' The columnist has since denied her words were homophobic - instead saying her words have been 'taken out of context'. But there was expected to be criticism too – the Commonwealth Games, like the Olympics, is not meant to be used for political purposes. Mr Barrowman's show was set at Gretna Green - a village celebrated as a destination for eloping couples . The singer stands atop a large craine while fireworks are set off around him and scores of dancers . There were also some social media brick bats, too, for the ceremony itself with one user called Bob declaring: ‘Scots Commonwealth Games = worst opening ceremony in history’. ‘Commonwealth games opening ceremony feels a tad Eurovision’, tweeted one, while another observer said:’ Just turned on the commonwealth games opening ceremony, and there was some old people dancing round some chairs, embarrassing.’ Barrowman, who is himself gay, played a key role in the ceremony’s opening minutes, singing from the top of an open top vehicle.","John Barrowman kissed man during Glasgow 2014 Opening Ceremony .

In 2010, David Cameron’s party got 10.7 million votes but won 307 seats, leaving them short of a Commons majority. Under Tony Blair in 2005, Labour only gained 9.5 million votes but won 413 seats, giving the party a comfortable majority. This is because the average Labour seat is much smaller than the typical Conservative one. The coalition agreed to redrawn the boundaries of Commons constituencies to make general elections fairer, while saving taxpayers large sums by cutting the number of MPs by 50. But when Tory backbenchers conspired with Labour to block plans to introduce a limited degree of democracy to the House of Lords, a key Lib Dem proposal, Mr Clegg responded by killing off the boundary changes. That means the Conservatives will fight next year’s election with a significant inbuilt disadvantage, with pollsters estimating that they need to be at least six points ahead of Labour to hope for a small majority. In 2010, David Cameron's party got 10.7 million votes but won 307 seats, leaving them short of a Commons majority, whereas under Tony Blair the party won 413 seats . Although the Lib Dems are flatlining in terms of national opinion polls, most pollsters believe they have every chance of hanging onto enough seats to hold the balance of power once more. The private pressure for another Lib-Con coalition next year flies in the face of the public arguments of many senior Lib Dems. Earlier this week, Energy Secretary Ed Davey, who is on the right of his party, said he believes Labour will be the largest party after 2015 and that the Lib Dems were likely to enter power-sharing talks with them. Labour and the Lib Dems have also quietly aligned policy pledges in more than a dozen areas, apparently in readiness for a potential power-sharing deal after next year’s general election. These include cutting pensioner benefits, scrapping Tory tax breaks for marriage, new green taxes, reducing the voting age to 16 and a new mansion tax on expensive homes.","Lib Dems argue voters would take dim view if they switched after five years .

"A man told repeatedly by doctors he was suffering food poisoning has been diagnosed with cancer, and given just months to live. Joseph McKinnon said he visited his GP and local A&E eight times in six weeks, but was reassured his symptoms were nothing more than an upset stomach. But after losing six stone, doctors performed a series of tests, revealing the 50-year-old, from Inverness, has terminal oesophageal cancer and has just two months to live. Joseph McKinnon has been given two months to live after doctors revealed he had oesophageal cancer. The 50-year-old said he visited doctors and A&E eight times in six weeks, only to be told he was suffering food poisoning. He is pictured in hospital with his mother Pamela . His brother Tony, 54, has flown from his home in the U.S. to be at his brother's bedside, along with Mr McKinnon's mother Pamela. The 75-year-old, who lives in London, said: 'Joseph couldn't keep anything down. He had terrible diarrhoea and vomiting. 'For six weeks the doctor told him it was food poisoning and, when he kept going back, prescribed different antibiotics and gave him injections. 'I think he had three or four different types of tablets. 'On several occasions, Joseph took himself to A&E and pleaded for tests, but was just sent home with more pills. 'Between his GP and hospital, he must have seen a doctor eight times. 'The last time, Joseph said he was desperately ill and was eventually taken seriously.' Cancer of the oesophagus is an uncommon by serious type of cancer that affects the gullet. The oesophagus is the medical name for the gullet, which is part of the digestive system. It is the long tube which carries food from the throat to the stomach. Symptoms of the disease include: . There . are two main types of the disease, one affecting the upper oesophagus . and the other forming in the lower tract of the gullet. It is uncommon but not rare, and is the ninth most common type of cancer in the UK. There are more than 8,500 new cases diagnosed each year. Oesophageal cancer most commonly affects people over the age of 60, with the average age at diagnosis being 72. Smoking and drinking increase a person's risk of developing the disease, particularly if both activities are combined. Doctors carried out an endoscopy - placing a camera down the patient's throat - and discovered a tumour in his oesophagus. They gave Mr McKinnon the devastating diagnosis, telling him he was unlikely to survive beyond two months. 'It's so upsetting - and I'm angry that Joseph wasn't sent for tests sooner - especially as his father, Neil, died from oesophageal cancer 10 years ago,' Mrs McKinnon. 'That was even more reason to investigate further.' Mr McKinnon, who moved to Scotland 10 years ago, has resigned himself to a bleak prognosis. He opted not to have chemotherapy, remembering what his father went through. Doctors want to move him to a hospice for palliative care, but Mr McKinnon said he wishes to die in the comfort of his home in Inverness. 'If Joseph had been sent for tests initially, I have no doubt that the cancer wouldn't be as aggressive as it is now,' his mother said. 'But he didn't get that opportunity so we'll never know if he could have been treated successfully.' As many as 10,000 people in the UK die every year as a result of a late cancer diagnosis. Survival rates for almost all common cancers in Britain fall below the European average. The situation is of concern to the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who recently called for GPs who repeatedly fail to spot crucial symptoms, to be named and shamed. The latest figures from the National Cancer Intelligence Network has found one in four cancer patients are diagnosed only after visiting A&E. Certain cancers are harder to spot, unti they are in their advanced stages. Sixty-two per cent of cancers of the brain and central nervous system were first diagnosed after an emergency admission, as well as more than half of pancreatic and liver cancers. The figure was 32 per cent for ovarian cancer. Linda Gordon, 55, from Aberdeen begged doctors to investigate her symptoms. Three months later a scan revealed she had lung cancer . When Linda Gordon suspected she had cancer, she begged her GP to send her to hospital. But the 55-year-old had to wait three months for a scan, which showed the mother-of-three had lung cancer. The disease had spread, causing tumours to grow all over her body. Mrs Gordon, from Aberdeen, first complained to her doctor of a sore shoulder and was prescribed painkillers at the end of 2012. But when she lost her appetite and was doubled over with excruciating stomach pain she returned to the doctors. There, the former hospital domestic worker, was told she couldn't eat because she was depressed. Despite repeated pleas, Mrs Gordon's GP failed to refer her for tests. 'My youngest son John had looked up my symptoms on the internet and said it looked like I had cancer,' she said. 'I told the doctor this and he said he wouldn't rule it out - but still wouldn't send me for tests. Apparently I wasn't a priority.' When her eldest son Graeme Moir realised the severity of his mother's condition, he took her straight to hospital. Tests revealed Mrs Gordon had lung cancer, two tumours in her pituitary gland and two in her neck. A fortnight later, a further two masses were discovered in her spine. After radiotherapy and chemotherapy, Mrs Gordon's tumours shrank - but weeks ago she learned that the cancer had returned and spread to her kidneys. 'It makes me angry that I had a genuine concern and that my GP didn't seem interested in referring me to investigate the possibility of cancer,' she added.","Joseph McKinnon visited his doctor and A&E eight times in six weeks .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A 'true West Country boy' who could drink up to 15 pints of cider on a typical night out has shed 11 stone by ditching alcohol. Facing divorce at the same time as he was made redundant from his job, Mitch Jones turned to food and alcohol for comfort. But the gorging on takeaways and his favourite tipple took its toll, and in three months Mr Jones's weight spiralled from 16 stone to his heaviest point, 22 stone 6lb. The turning point came in 2011 when he was out shopping for new clothes to wear to his new girlfriend's 30th birthday party. Mitch Jones, from Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset, lost a staggering 11 stone after ditching his 15 pints of cider a night binge drinking habit. Mr Jones, pictured left at his heaviest holding a pint of cider, and right, now . Mr Jones hit rock bottom in 2006 when his marriage ended and he discovered he was to be made redundant from his job. Turning to food and alcohol for comfort, his weight spiralled from 16 stone to 22 stone 6lbs in just three months . Catching a glimpse of himself in the changing room mirror, Mr Jones vowed to make a change to his lifestyle. He ditched the fatty foods, abandoning his habitual trips to the pub and takeaway, in favour of a calorie-controlled diet and active lifestyle. Today the 39-year-old said he wants to change perceptions of dieting, which can discourage men from taking responsibility for their weight and health. Mr Jones, from Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset, said: 'It’s not ""cool"" to diet, unfortunately. For some reason it’s seen as unmanly. 'But it’s alright for guys to step forward and take control of their weight. 'Struggles with being overweight can have just as much of an emotional impact for men as they do for women.' Mr Jones hit rock bottom in the autumn of 2006. He said: 'My marriage came to end and I was made redundant, which was a huge double blow. It was a very painful time. 'I was around 16 stone and had been told that the fact I was unattractive had led to the end of the marriage. 'In my mind, I decided that I would continue to be unhealthy. If I was unattractive, then I would be less likely to find a new partner, which would protect me from the possibility of going through the end of another relationship. But in 2011 the turning point came when Mr Jones was shopping for new clothes and caught sight of himself in the mirror. He vowed to shed the weight and take control of his lifestyle . 'A lot of people lose weight when their relationships come to an end, but for me it was the opposite.' Three months later Mr Jones hit his heaviest weight , tipping the scales at 22st 6lb - and measuring 52 inches around his waist. He said: 'Drink was a big thing for me. I never drank alone - it was always social thing. 'As a teenager I’d got it into my head that the lads would be impressed if I could down a big bottle of White Lightning and still stand at the end. 'Being a true Westcountry boy, I would drink 15 pints of cider without even thinking... I must have been consuming more than 5,000 calories a day' - Mitch Jones . 'The binge drinking continued until my 30s. My daily diet would be a fry up for breakfast, fried chicken for lunch, and then I’d get straight out on the lash. 'Being a true West Country boy, I would drink 15 pints of cider on a night out without even thinking about it. I must have been consuming more than 5,000 calories a day.' Mr Jones said a turning point came in 2011, a day before a 30th birthday party for his current partner, Georgina Wilkie, 33, a personal assistant working in the NHS. He said: 'I wanted to buy a decent outfit for the party but could barely find anything in the shop which fitted around me. 'I went into the changing room, saw myself in the mirror and, barely recognising myself, I couldn’t stop crying. I knew I had to make a change.' Mr Jones began on the Cambridge . Weight Plan, which offers meal replacement as a route to a balanced diet, promoting weight control. In just over five months he lost an incredible 11st 4lb. The 39-year-old now weighs a healthy 11 stone after ditching his binge drinking and abandoning his habitual trips to the pub and takeaway . Mr Jones has now become a wellbeing consultant, weighs 12 stone and has started playing football again . Today he weighs a stable 12 stone, has a 30 inch waist and has begun playing football again for the first time since his youth. He said: 'People were amazed that I lost so much weight so quickly, and there are still some who expect me to put it back on. But I’m two years slim now and I feel like a completely different person. 'I can still have a cider and enjoy a takeaway from time to time, but the reasons behind why I eat and drink are different to when I was larger. I’m in control now.' In January 2013, Mr Jones decided to become a wellbeing consultant and has since established the Revolution Health and Wellbeing Centre in Burnham-on-Sea, where he has a growing base of clients keen to emulate his success. He is also looking to release an album of songs he has written about his transformation, entitled Great Expectations. He said: 'I keep a picture of me when I was larger in my office, which I use to reassure my clients when they feel challenged. 'I know exactly how they’re feeling, but now I feel as if there’s nothing I can’t do.'

"By . Constance Craig-smith . The general consensus is that this year's Chelsea Flower Show was one of the best ever, with a clutch of talented young designers injecting extra energy and brio into the 101-year-old event. Purple, magenta and claret were the dominant colours, closely followed by blue, while softly swaying grasses and umbellifers were interspersed with perennials to gorgeous effect. If you've been inspired to recreate some of that Chelsea magic in your own garden, here are some of the key plants from this year's show. Tall, graceful Iris sibirica (see main picture; available from www.woottens plants.com) cropped up in many of the show gardens, most strikingly in the immaculate gold-medal-winning Italian-inspired garden by Tommaso del Buono and Paul Gazerwitz, where the blue flowers contrasted beautifully with lime-green euphorbias and box hedging. Iris sibirica thrive in sun or shade, need no staking, and also come in luscious shades of purple, white or yellow. Iris siberica thrive in sun or shade so are fairly low maintenance . Their garden also used Anchusa azurea 'Loddon Royalist', which has one of the most intense blues of any summer-flowering plant. The flowers, rather similar to forget-me-nots, are held on upright stems and set off by coarse, rather hairy leaves. This perennial, which needs free-draining soil and is fairly short-lived, is available from www.hardys-plants.co.uk. The youngest ever winner of a show garden gold medal, 27-year-old  Hugo Bugg, made a big impression with the Royal Bank of Canada garden. He used plenty of the deep-crimson loosestrife, Lysimachia atropurpurea 'Beaujolais', and with its silvery foliage and very small, pineapple-shaped flowers, this perennial is an absolute stunner. Lysimachia is available from www.crocus.co.uk, or it can be grown from seed in spring. The Laurent Perrier garden, which won Best in Show, featured graceful planting of foxgloves, verbascums and aconites interspersed with the buttery-yellow lupin, Lupinus 'Chandelier' (available from www.claire austin-hardyplants.co.uk). Lupins – magenta ones this time – also popped up in the exuberant Stoke-on-Trent show garden, confirming that this humble cottage garden favourite is now the height of fashion. Orlaya grandiflora, or white laceflower, is a hardy annual with ferny flowers and flat umbels of pure white flowers throughout the summer. It's a great plant to use in a romantic, airy design and it was used to great effect in the Cloudy Bay garden, which won a silver-gilt medal. Seeds are available from www.chilternseeds.co.uk. The graceful Gladiolus communis subsp. byzantinus was used in several show gardens and on the Avon Bulbs stand in the marquee, which won a gold medal. This gladiolus is a world away from the familiar florist's gladiolus; it's a slender plant with sword-shaped leaves and reddish-purple, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom throughout summer. Available from www.avonbulbs.co.uk. Although several new roses were launched at Chelsea, one of the most striking varieties on show is actually a couple of years old. Rosa 'Boscobel', bred by David Austin (www.david austinroses.co.uk) has buds that start off as red before opening to a rich salmon colour. The unusual colour made it a hit with designers, and it looks set to become a classic.

"By . James Gordon . A teenager from Kentucky was shot and killed by the dumped boyfriend of her aunt. Robert Harmon, 48, ended up taking his own life after killing 16-year-old Carlin Davis and shooting at his former girlfriend, the girls' aunt Nikki Davis, with whom they had both been living. Davis and Harmon had been dating for about three years before they broke up earlier this month. State police say Davis moved out of the home after the break-up, but went back on Saturday and argued with his ex . Shot: 16-year-old Carlin Davis from Kentucky was shot and killed in a shootout at her aunt's house . State police say 16-year-old Carlin Davis was gunned down by 48-year-old Robert Harmon (right) after he shot Nikki Davis (left), 33, in the face . Harmon shot Carlin and his former girlfriend Nikki, 33, before killing himself around 2 a.m. on Sunday. Carlin Davis and Harmon were pronounced dead at the scene. Nikki Davis was taken to the University of Louisville hospital with two gunshot wounds to the face. She was conscious and talking when police arrived at the scene. She remains in serious condition but her injuries are not considered to be life threatening. Kentucky State Police believe Carlin had recently moved into the home on Garriott Court, a quiet cul-de-sac neighborhood where her aunt lived. Police say the couple shared the home on Gariott Court. Davis' niece had been staying with the couple for several months. Authorities aren't sure why or how the teen was caught up in the shooting. Deadly: Carlin Davis, 16, was shot and killed by Robert Harmon, 48. Harmon also shot his ex (Carlin's aunt) Nikki Davis, 33, in the face - however she is expected to survive . Gone too soon: Carlin Davis, according to her mother, was a little girl with big dreams. She was a typical teenager who was into fashion and loved to take selfies . Paul Moceika worked with Davis at a local gas station. He said Harmon came to the store Saturday evening, before the shooting, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. 'There was no signs anything like this was going to happen,' said Moceika to WDRB. 'He was in here, he was normal, he was fine.' Troopers have never responded to any domestic or violence-related calls to the house. 'You can't predict something like this,' Trooper Brad Arterburn said. 'Just want to tell people - get away from each other and cool down. That's the best advice you can give, but obviously it doesn't happen sometimes.' A funeral is being held for Carlin on Thursday. The family didn't have any insurance and are looking for financial help to cover the cost. Trimble County Sheriff's Deputy Tom Starks says that plans are being made for a local memorial service to allow students to remember their classmate. Carlin had several friends at the high school even though she had just transferred to the district. She would have been a junior at the high school this fall.","Robert Harmon, 48, shot Carlin Davis 16, who was staying at her aunts house .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . and Jonathan O'Callaghan . Using modern dating techniques, a Cambridge historian found Henry VIII (pictured) was largely incompatible with any of his wives . Despite chopping off her head after just three years of marriage, Anne Boleyn was the best match for King Henry VIII. Using modern dating techniques, British historian Elizabeth Norton found the Tudor king was largely incompatible with all of his wives due to his aggressive personality, high levels of neuroticism and lack of compassion. But second wife Anne Boleyn was best suited to the monarch as they were open with one another, shared similar libidos and both had high levels of energy and ambition. The second most compatible wife was Anne of Cleves, whose marriage with Henry ended within six months. Henry and his fourth wife shared a similar level of intelligence and diligence, and remained amicable despite their divorce. In third place was first wife Catherine of Aragon whose profiling indicates that her relative lack of interest in appearance and athleticism may have caused friction with the sporty king. Yet their marriage lasted for 23 years before Henry split with the Roman Catholic Church in order to divorce her. Matchmakers put third wife Jane Seymour in fourth place deeming her not bold and outgoing enough, despite the King saying he felt her his ‘first true wife.’ She died following child birth and a year of marriage, and is the only wife to be buried with Henry VIII. Fifth wife Kathryn Howard’s mismatched . libido led to her losing her head, after two years of marriage and she . was the fifth most incompatible. And last wife Katherine Parr was considered too intellectual for the king’s tastes and was seen as the least suitable of all six - although she outlived Henry. The research was carried out by Tudor historian Elizabeth Norton who used the matching profiles of online dating provider eHarmony to rank the compatibility of all the wives. The historian and author carried out a psychological study of all six wives and Henry VIII himself. Then compatibility experts scored them on the 29 key personality dimensions needed for a successful relationship, including emotional temperament, social style and relationship skills. Divorced, beheaded, died: Second wife Anne Boleyn was best suited to the monarch as they were open with one another, shared similar libidos and both had high levels of energy and ambition, according to the research. In third place was first wife Catherine of Aragon, while Jane Seymour was fourth . Divorced, beheaded, survived: The second most compatible wife was Anne of Cleves, whose marriage with Henry ended within six months. Fifth wife Kathryn Howard was the fifth most incompatible, and last wife Katherine Parr was seen as too intellectual for the king's tastes and was seen as the least suitable of all . ‘More than 500 years after the birth of Henry VIII historians know more than ever about his complex, larger than life personality, to the point that we’ve been able to investigate his compatibility - or more his lack of compatibility - with each of his wives,' said eHarmony’s Jemima Wade. ‘It’s a shame that there was no eHarmony back in the 16th Century, as we’re confident we could have saved Henry a lot of time and heartache by helping him find long-lasting love with a truly compatible partner who shared his beliefs and outlook on life.’ Oxford and Cambridge graduate Elizabeth Norton added: ‘The results of the study have been fascinating. Henry VIII was a complex character and found lasting love difficult to achieve. ‘It was with Anne Boleyn that he enjoyed his most passionate relationship, with him even writing love letters to her - despite not being a fan of letter writing. ‘The results of the study suggest that he should have given their relationship longer.’ King Henry VIII was known for his six marriages, all of which ended in some sort of tragedy, divorce, or death, but he was also known for other, stranger things. He was known to self-medicate, even going as far as making his own medicines. A record on a prescription for ulcer treatment in the British Museum reads: 'An Oyntment devised by the kinges Majesty made at Westminster, and devised at Grenwich to take away inflammations and to cease payne and heale ulcers called gray plaster'. The king was also a musician and composer, owning 78 flutes, 78 recorders, five bagpipes, and has since had his songs covered by Jethro Tull. He died while heavily in debt, after having such a lavish lifestyle that he spent far, far more than taxes would earn him. He possessed the largest tapestry collection ever documented, and 6,500 pistols. While most portraits show him as a slight man, he was actually very large, with one observer calling him 'an absolute monster'.","Using modern dating techniques, .

"By . Associated Press . Condemned: Despite his execution being halted by a last minute appeal, Arizona double murderer Joseph Rudolph Wood's execution was allowed to go forward Wednesday . Arizona's highest court on Wednesday temporarily halted the execution of a condemned inmate Wednesday morning so it could consider a last-minute appeal before soon turning back around and allowing it to proceed. The appeal focused on arguments that Joseph Rudolph Wood, 55, received inadequate legal representation at his sentencing, along with a challenge about the secrecy of the lethal injection drugs. The Arizona Supreme Court temporarily halted Wood's execution scheduled for Wednesday morning, but then rejected the appeal and said the execution could proceed. Officials at the state prison in Florence have told witnesses to return to the execution chamber at 1 p.m. Pacific. The planned execution is occurring amid new scrutiny nationwide over lethal injections after several controversial executions. The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday cleared the way for Arizona to carry out its third execution in the last year following a closely watched First Amendment fight over the secrecy issue. Wood's lawyers used a new legal tactic in which defense attorneys claim their clients' First Amendment rights are being violated by the government's refusal to reveal details about lethal injection drugs. Wood's lawyers were seeking information about the two-drug combination that will be used to kill him, including the makers of the drugs. A federal appeals court ruled in Wood's favor before the U.S. Supreme Court put the execution back on track. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision marked the first time an appeals court has acted to delay an execution based on the issue of drug secrecy, said Richard Dieter, director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, D.C. The 9th Circuit gave new hope to death penalty opponents. While many death row inmates have made the same First Amendment argument as Wood, the Supreme Court has not been receptive to the tactic. The court has ruled against them each time the transparency issue has come before the justices. Praying: Robert Hungerford, of Phoenix, prays as he and a group of about a dozen death penalty opponents protest the execution of Joseph Rudolph Wood at the state prison in Florence, Arizona on Wednesday . States have refused to reveal details such as which pharmacies are supplying lethal injection drugs and who is administering them because of concerns over harassment. Wood also lost a different, last-ditch appeal in the Supreme Court early Wednesday. Wood was sentenced to death for killing Debra Dietz and her father, Eugene Dietz, in 1989 at the family's automotive shop in Tucson. Wood and Dietz had a tumultuous relationship in which he periodically assaulted her. Dietz tried to end their relationship and got an order of protection against Wood. On the day of the shooting, Wood went to the auto shop and waited for Dietz's father, who disapproved of his daughter's relationship with Wood, to get off the phone. Once the father hung up, Wood pulled out a revolver, shot him in the chest and then smiled. Wood then turned his attention toward Debra Dietz, who was trying to telephone for help. Wood grabbed her by the neck and put his gun to her chest. She pleaded with him to spare her life. An employee heard Wood say, ‘I told you I was going to do it, I have to kill you.’ He then called her an expletive and fired two shots in her chest. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for the Arizona attorney general's office, said the agency had no comment on the Supreme Court ruling but would issue a statement after Wood's execution. Desperate: Arizona's highest court on Wednesday temporarily halted the execution of the condemned inmate so it could consider a last-minute appea . Wood's attorney Dale Baich said, ‘The secrecy which Arizona fought tooth and nail to protect is harmful to our democracy because it prevents the public, the courts and the condemned from knowing if executions are carried out in compliance with all state and federal laws.’ Arizona has executed 36 inmates since 1992. The two most recent executions occurred in October. Two recent executions in other parts of the country have helped revive the death penalty debate in the U.S. An Ohio inmate in January snorted and gasped during the 26 minutes it took him to die. In Oklahoma, an inmate died of a heart attack minutes after prison officials halted the process of his execution because the drugs weren't being administered properly. The fight over the Arizona execution has also attracted attention because of a dissenting judge's comments that made a case for a firing squad as a more humane method of execution. ‘The guillotine is probably best but seems inconsistent with our national ethos. And the electric chair, hanging and the gas chamber are each subject to occasional mishaps. The firing squad strikes me as the most promising,’ wrote Alex Kozinski, the 9th Circuit's chief judge. ‘Using drugs meant for individuals with medical needs to carry out executions is a misguided effort to mask the brutality of executions by making them look serene and peaceful - like something any one of us might experience in our final moment.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Officials at the University of Maryland announced Wednesday that a data breach has compromised more than 300,000 records for any faculty members, staff or students who have received a university ID card. It's not only current students and employees who need to worry - according to the university, the breach has compromised records dating back to 1998. The attack occurred about 4 a.m. Tuesday when an outside hacker gained access to a secure records database that holds Social Security numbers, dates of birth and university . identification numbers for 309,079 people affiliated with the school at . its College Park and Shady Grove campuses. Hacked: The University of Maryland announced Wednesday that a hacker breached their computer system . In a statement issued Wednesday, university President Wallace D. Loh said university officials currently are investigating how such a breach was possible, and what the plan is going forward to make sure that it doesn't happen again. 'Appropriate state and federal law enforcement authorities are currently . investigating this incident,' Loh said in the statement. 'Computer forensic . investigators are examining the breached files and logs to determine how . our sophisticated, multi-layered security defenses were bypassed.' Vast: The university says the hacker gained access to private information of more than 300,000 people . Brian Voss, vice president and chief information officer for the university, told the Washington Post that the hackers didn't change anything within the university's computer systems. However, he says, they essentially 'made a Xerox of it and took off.' Voss says that what concerns him the most is the level of sophistication the hacker - or hackers - used to gain access to the university's private records. Voss says that the breach isn't like most cyber attacks, where 'someone left the door open' allowing an easy way in for any average hacker. Damage control: University President Wallace D. Loh says the university will provide credit monitoring for anyone whose information was compromised . 'That’s not what happened here,' Voss said. 'There’s no open door. These . people picked through several locks to get to this data.' In his statement, Loh apologized for the breach, noting that 'computer and data security are a very high priority of our University.' Additionally, Loh says the university will provide free credit monitoring for a year for anyone whose information was hacked.","The breach occurred Tuesday morning .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Flying robots that can ‘think’ for themselves are already being developed, which some people fear will be able to snoop on and attack people living below. And now a team of Hungarian scientists have managed to engineer the first ‘flock’ of drones that can fly as a coordinated group. The collection of 10 copters can fly in formation, follow a leader and change flight patterns without human input, to act a little like migratory birds. Scroll down for video . High flyers: A team of Hungarian scientists have managed to engineer the first 'flock' of drones that can fly as a coordinated group (pictured). The collection of 10 copters can fly in formation, follow a leader and change flight patterns without human input . They are the first ‘flock’ of drones that can fly autonomously as a coordinated group. The collection of 10 copters can fly in formation, follow a leader and change flight patterns without human input. They can be instructed to form a circle and they each find a position along it and rotate slowly in the same direction. Their autonomous decisions avoid collisions in the air. The drones are commercially available quadcopters – with four rotor blades – but have specially designed hardware on board that allow them to act as a swarm. Created by scientists at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, the drones navigate using signals from GPS receivers and let each other know their positions via radio, Nature reported. The researchers' breakthrough could mean that flocks of autonomous flying robots could take to the skies sooner than previously thought. Experts created their own computer simulation after fitting tiny GPS trackers to pigeons (stock image pictured) to see how the birds fly as a flock and used the knowledge to inform the behaviour of their drones . Tamás Vicsek, a physics professor at the university, explained that the group of 10 drones can coordinate their movements to form circles or lines, which could be useful if one day the technology is used to create swarms of surveillance drones. He and his team was inspired to create the robots after seeing a 1986 computer game called Boids that simulated flying objects according to three rules – alignment, attraction and repulsion - so that robots could fly in formation without crashing into each other. The scientists created their own computer simulation (pictured) after fitting tiny GPS trackers to pigeons. While some people might fear that swarms of thinking drones could prove a surveillance menace, the scientists said they could be used for many peaceful applications, such as delivering food . They created their own computer simulation using the same ideas after fitting tiny GPS trackers to pigeons to see how they fly as a flock and used the knowledge to inform the behaviour of their drones. ‘We fed flocking algorithms to them so the copters can fly autonomously – totally eliminating the need for manual control,’ Professor Vicsek said. ‘Each has a little brain in the form . of an on-board computer and is completely autonomous. All decisions, . directions, flight positions are decided by them,’ he explained. The . drones can be instructed to form a circle and they each find a position . along it and rotate slowly in the same direction. Their autonomous . decisions avoid collisions in the air. The group of 10 drones can coordinate their movements to form circles (pictured) or lines, which could be useful if one day the technology is used to create swarms of surveillance drones . The researchers had to overcome the . challenges of noise and delay, which it hard for copters to ‘see’ each . other’s positions and sped up their reaction times. They plan on . replacing radio signals with cameras to help the drones ‘see’ one . another more easily in the future. They will present their research at the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, to be held in Chicago, Illinois in September. While some people might fear that swarms of thinking drones could prove a surveillance menace, the scientists said they could be used for many peaceful applications, such as delivering food and parcels. Commenting on the study, Iain Couzin, an expert on collective animal behaviour at Princeton University in New Jersey, told Nature: ‘This is remarkable work. It is the first outdoor demonstration of how biologically inspired rules can be used to create resilient yet dynamic flocks.’ The research suggests that ‘we will be able to achieve large, coordinated robot flocks much sooner than many would have anticipated,’ he added.","Scientists in Budapest created the first 'flock' of flying robots .

"By . John Stevens . Ever since she lost 14st three years ago, Ashley Weller had been unhappy about the size of her breasts. But as a single mother with three children, she couldn’t afford plastic surgery. So when the 26-year-old heard about a hypnotherapist who said she could make her bust bigger simply by thinking about it, she decided to give it a go – even though it seemed too good to be true. Getting a boost: Ashley Weller, 26, claims that three hypnotherapy sessions with Felix Economakis have caused her breasts to grow by three cup sizes . BEFORE: Ashley was uncomfortable with the size of her breasts, saying they were too small and out of proportion with her figure. AFTER: Ashley is 'delighted' with her breasts - and the fact she has avoided the knife . Unlikely as it sounds, Miss Weller claims the treatment worked, boosting her bra size by three cups from a 36C to a 36E. Her hypnotherapist, Felix Economakis, claims he cleared psychological blocks in her mind that were stopping her breasts from growing. Mr Economakis, a chartered psychologist, said: ‘The mind basically controls the body and if you know how to work with the mind you can get it to make changes in the body. ‘We know emotions affect the body. When people get stressed they get headaches, for example. ‘Using hypnosis, I can work directly with the mind. I speak to the part that controls hormones to encourage growth. ‘There are many reasons for these blocks, for instance, during puberty women associate big breasts with unwanted male attention when they were not emotionally ready.’ 'I was thinking of having a boob job operation but it looks like I won't be needing one now': Ashley says she has gone from a 36C to a 36E following Felix's sessions . Three years ago, Miss Weller, a full-time mother from Horley, Surrey, had an operation to have a gastric sleeve fitted, and lost 14st – but her breasts got smaller, too. She said: ‘When I lost all the weight, my boobs went saggy and horrible. Having three children has ruined them too. ‘When I heard about the hypno boob job I felt excited and wanted to give it a go. I was sceptical about it at first and it took me a while to get my head around it.’ Miss Weller had three hynotherapy sessions at Mr Economakis’s office in London. The sessions, each lasting an hour and a half, cost £900. Her cup runneth over: Ashley says she has had to buy new bras to accommodate her new assets . Satisfied customer: Ashley with hypnotherapist Felix Economakis who says he is the only practitioner in Britain offering this service . Having the 'hypno boob job': Ashley says the sessions, where Felix claims to unblock the growth hormones responsible for enlarging breasts, were 'relaxing' Unique: Felix researched the treatment two years ago after a colleague asked if hypnotherapy would work on her breasts. Unsatisfied with the treatments on offer he decided to devise his own . She said: ‘I sat in a chair and then I felt really relaxed. 'The next thing I knew Felix was telling me to wake up. I felt really refreshed – like I’d just had a long sleep. ‘I didn’t notice any change straight away. It wasn’t until the second session when I noticed my bra felt tight.’ She added: ‘I feel a lot more  confident about my boobs now. 'A boob job can cost around £4,000 but I’d never have been able to afford that. 'It goes to show there’s something out there other than surgery. 'It does work. People should give it a go.’ But medical experts were rather more sceptical. Dr Ian Campbell, a GP from Nottingham, said: ‘Breasts can change for lots of reasons. 'It can be as simple as being down to weight gain or hormonal changes. ‘The possibility that it is as a direct result of hypnotherapy is remote or impossible.’","Felix Economakis is a chartered psychologist and hypnotherapist .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A dog left behind when his owners moved from their Los Angeles home has undergone a dramatic transformation after being rescued by animal welfare workers and is almost unrecognizable from the pitiful pup he was just weeks ago. Eldad Hagar and Annie Hart of Hope for Paws were on their way back from rescuing three pit bulls when they spotted a small dog hiding under a trailer in Los Angeles rough Compton area. The pair stopped to pick up the dog, which had long fur tangled into matted dreadlocks and was terrified of people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hidden: Always scanning the streets for abandoned animals, Eldad Hagar came across a dog in a pitiful state in Compton . Neglected: Little Theo ran from his would-be rescuers, terrified of people - probably due to past experiences with them . Abandoned: After Theo is finally captured, the extent of his neglect becomes clear . Neighbors told Hagar that the owners of the dog had moved a year earlier, abandoning their dog to the streets. He had clearly not been cared for since, and his terror of people indicates at best, neglect and at worst, abuse. In a rescue captured on camera, Hagar tries to tempt the dog, who has since been named Theo, with a hamburger but such is his terror, Theo runs from his rescuer, leading him on a chase around the neighborhood. 'Annie Hart and I jumped out of the car, and a couple of minutes later I got a leash around him (I did take a couple of bites which is pretty rare for me), but the poor guy was just so scared,' wrote Hagar in a Facebook post about Theo. Accepting his fate: Theo allows himself to be patted in the car on the way to the shelter . Haircut: Carers had to shave off the huge knotted dreadlocks Theo's fur had become . Broken: Theo was shaking, sickly and refused to eat when he arrived at the shelter . His yelps of terror as Hagar captures him with a dog catcher's pole are heartbreaking, but as Hagar gently pats his little head, Theo's plaintive cries subside, and soon Hart is able to nurse him on her lap in the car. Once they arrive back at Hope for Paws headquarters, the team has quite a job on their hands to groom the pup and choose to shave all of his fur off and start afresh. The newly shorn Theo looks nothing like the mangy, dirty dog from earlier, but he hangs his head and presses his little body into the wall, his spirit still broken. New friends: Now Theo has been taken in by a foster carer and he's become playful and care-free . Two bigger dogs have taken him under their wing, and Theo is looking and acting like a new dog . All he needs is love: Theo is being cared for by a foster family, but he is still looking for a forever home . He was shaking, sickly and refused to eat. The video cuts to Theo a few weeks later, though, when he has been taken in by a foster carer with two other dogs - and he has become a bouncing, playing, tail-wagging dog. His two new friends - pit bull mixes a lot bigger than him - seem enamored of their new little pal and with their help, Theo seems to be coming to the understanding that his old life is over. He's currently looking for a forever home to make his transformation into happy, beloved pet complete.

"By . Martin Beckford . and Alex Hawkes . and Jon Rees . Sacha Baron Cohen, pictured with his wife Isla Fisher, is allegedly one of many who face calls to pay back tax . Tory peers, celebrated comedians and a Treasury quango chief are among the latest big names who could receive hefty bills from the taxman for investing in potential tax avoidance schemes. Four of England’s Ashes-winning cricketers can also be revealed as among the backers of film and property financing funds that appeared to be legitimate investments but may now be challenged by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Over the next few weeks up to 33,000 people who invested in the tax-saving schemes could receive letters warning them they may have to settle unpaid bills within 90 days – or risk being taken to court. HMRC refuses to discuss individual cases but analysis of Companies House files suggests that  those who potentially face paying back thousands because of investments in contested schemes include: . • Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, the Tory peer and president of the supermarket chain. • Lord Edmiston, the motor industry tycoon and Tory party donor. • Banker Robin Budenberg who advised ministers in the credit crunch. • Comedy stars Sacha Baron Cohen, David Baddiel and Neil Morrissey. • BBC broadcaster Kate Adie. • Former England cricket captains Michael Vaughan and David Gower, and 2005 Ashes heroes Paul Collingwood, Matthew Hoggard and Marcus Trescothick. All were encouraged by financial advisers to put money into schemes that would pay for movies to be made and buildings to be developed, giving them big tax breaks. But HMRC now believes dozens of the investment vehicles were really just sophisticated tax dodges, as they allowed investors to get large refunds the year after they invested. Also involved? Cricketer Michael Vaughan and Lord Sainsbury are said to have used tax-avoidance schemes . Last week HMRC published a list of 1,200 investment partnerships under scrutiny and said it would use new powers to claw back an estimated £7.1 billion of tax from the individuals and businesses that invested. But the revelation that Tory peers and donors are among those facing repayment orders will embarrass David Cameron after he declared he was opposed to all ‘aggressive tax avoidance’. Several of the contested schemes are known to be linked to film and games giant Ingenious Media, which claims to have helped fund blockbuster films such as Avatar and The Life Of Pi. Lord Sainsbury, Sacha Baron Cohen, Kate Adie and David Gower all invested in a scheme called Ingenious Film Partners 2, which also attracted David Beckham, TV stars Ant and Dec, and ex-Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell. Lord Edmiston, who is worth an estimated £440m, is said to be on HMRC's list . LORD SAINSBURY . Career: Chairman of Sainsbury’s supermarkets from 1969 to 1992, overseeing its flotation. Lord Sainsbury has been a Tory peer since 1989 and donated £1.2million to the party in the past decade. Finances: The Sainsbury family as a whole control 15 per cent of Sainsbury’s and are worth an estimated £1.97billion. He and his brothers used the family’s fortune to build a new £50million wing of the National Gallery. ROBIN BUDENBERG . Career: After a career in banking, became chief of UK Financial Investments, which was set up to manage the taxpayer’s stake in Lloyds and RBS. Finances: He earned £155,000 a year at the quango from 2010 until January 2014 but earned millions more in 25 years at UBS bank. LORD EDMISTON .
