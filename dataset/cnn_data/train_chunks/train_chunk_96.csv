"(CNN) -- As the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) winds to a close, here are five takeaways from the event, which traditionally features lots of premieres, star power and schmoozing. 1. Alexander Skarsgard isn't good in bed -- or so quipped Kirsten Dunst when asked how her character, Justine, could walk out on him on their wedding night in Lars von Trier's ""Melancholia."" Judging by the ecstatic reaction he received from the TIFF audience, Skarsgard has no reason to worry. If Dunst doesn't want him, there are plenty of eager replacements waiting in the wings. 2. Woody Harrelson could be a serious Oscar contender. Harrelson has shown his mettle before of course, in Milos Forman's ""The People vs Larry Flynt,"" when he was nominated for Best Actor; in Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers""; as well as in last year's Iraq vet drama ""The Messenger"" (when he was nominated in the Supporting slot). But he's never given such a commanding and well-rounded performance as he shows us in ""Rampart,"" a second collaboration with ""Messenger"" director Oren Moverman, a no-holds-barred portrait of a corrupt cop penned by James Ellroy. Harrelson doesn't just dare to show us this dinosaur's very dark side, he also dares us not to care. 3. The classics are going multicultural. The Brits have always been famed for their literary adaptations and costume dramas, but they never used to look like this. In the past, Emily Bronte's romantic hero (or anti-hero) Heathcliff has been played by Laurence Olivier, Timothy Dalton and Ralph Fiennes. But Andrea Arnold is the first director to cast a black actor in the part -- in fact two black actors, as she also tackles the full scope of the story, from Heathcliff's arrival on the moors as a child to his return as a grown man (played by newcomer James Howson). While literary purists may see the sense in that casting, they will have to take a deeper breath before sizing up Michael Winterbottom's updated version of Thomas Hardy's ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles"" (previously filmed by Roman Polanski with Nastassja Kinski). Winterbottom -- who once relocated ""The Mayor of Casterbridge"" to the Yukon Gold Rush -- has switched the action to modern-day India, and cast the luminous ""Slumdog Millionaire"" Freida Pinto as Tess, or rather ""Trishna."" Hardy would probably also be surprised by the lashings of sex Winterbottom has worked into this provocative drama. 4. Michael Fassbender can't get enough of it. Sex, that is. First, the ""X-Men: First Class"" star played Sigmund Freud's heir apparent, Carl Jung, in David Cronenberg's witty history of the early years of psychoanalytic theory, ""A Dangerous Method,"" in which Jung embarks on a reckless affair with a masochistic patient played by Keira Knightley. Then he showed up as a contemporary sex addict in Steve McQueen's hardcore drama ""Shame,"" a stunning performance that won him the Best Actor award at the recent Venice Film Festival. Asked how he researched this role, Fassbender insisted he spent quality time in bed -- with his script. 5. Ryan Gosling will never live down his past. At least, not in his native Canada, where a generation apparently grew up on the young Gosling's adventures in ""Breaker High"" and ""Young Hercules"" and won't let him forget it. ""Breaker High"" was the first thing he was asked about after the premiere of ""Drive."" Somehow, the show had passed by his ""Drive"" co-star, Albert Brooks, who needed filling in on how it fitted in before Gosling's ""Mickey Mouse Club"" days. Gosling took it on the chin. Asked at the end of the session if there was any message he hoped unified his diverse acting roles, he deadpanned: ""Basically, I'm just trying to relive 'Young Hercules' every time. That was the high point for me.""","There was lots to learn at the Toronto International Film Festival .

"(CNN) -- A compromised levee in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, failed Tuesday, forcing authorities to order more evacuations in the region. The levee failed in at least four locations along a two-mile stretch along the Black River, City Manager Doug Bagby said. The failure was sending floodwaters from the Black River into a populated but rural area of Butler County, sparing the city of Poplar Bluff, said the city's deputy police chief, Jeff Rolland. Authorities were worried about another one to three inches of rain in the forecast. It was unclear how many people might eventually be affected by the flooding, Butler County Sheriff's Detective Scott Phelps said. As of midafternoon Tuesday, several hundred homes had been evacuated in the county, he said. The breaks occurred between Poplar Bluff and the community of Qulin, about 12 miles to the southeast. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said 59 water rescues were conducted and nearly 7,000 people had to be moved in Butler County. Bagby said about 1,000 of them are city residents, with more than 200 being sheltered at Black River Coliseum. Flood levels are dropping slowly, Bagby said, and people may be able to return to their homes Wednesday afternoon if the trend continues. ""It's sunny in Poplar Bluff right now,"" Bagby said on Tuesday afternoon. The city has received 15 inches of rain in the last four days, Rolland said -- five of them in just one storm Monday. ""It's just extraordinary,"" Rolland said. Nixon deployed about 200 members of the Missouri National Guard to Poplar Bluff and the southeastern corner of the state for what the National Weather Service said could be record flooding. Nixon ordered troops to help with efforts to shore up levees near Poplar Bluff and other river communities, among other duties. ""A lot of people are getting very worried that they're going to see higher levels than they've ever seen before,"" said Aaron Luke, a Nashville resident, who visited family in the Poplar Bluff area over the weekend. Luke left his car at an aunt's house north of Poplar Bluff when rising waters prevented him from leaving the area. ""I had to grab a rental car to get out and return to Nashville,"" he said, after using a boat to get across a swollen creek. Authorities ordered residents most at risk to evacuate immediately. Other residents near the river were asked to closely monitor developments and water levels in their neighborhoods, the police department said. Daryl Nelson helped evacuate his father and sister from the south end of the city. ""You don't know when it's going to be over and you can get back in,"" he told CNN affiliate KFVS. ""It's better than getting everything ruined."" Poplar Bluff resident Alleesha Gloyd, 29, said many streets were flooded Monday night. ""They're not driving wisely at all,"" she said of area motorists. CNN's Ed Payne, Phil Gast, Marlena Baldacci, Michael Pearson and Kara Devlin contributed to this report.","59 people rescued in Poplar Bluff area .

"(CNN) -- Jam band Phish broke attendance records and raised more than $1.2 million for victims of flooding this week in their home state of Vermont. The show took place at the Champlain Valley Expo in Essex Junction on Wednesday night -- nearly three weeks after Vermont experienced deadly, damaging floods caused by the remnants of Hurricane Irene. ""It was amazing and inspiring to see so many people come together through music to aid the great state of Vermont,"" Phish guitarist and singer Trey Anastasio said. Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin was among those attending the show, thanking Phish for coming back to Vermont, a state they hadn't played since 2004. ""There's nothing better than the state of Vermont, nothing better than Phish fans,"" Shumlin said. ""It's been seven years... It was worth the wait!"" The proceeds -- the final tally announced in a press release from the band -- will help Vermont, ""rebuild better than the way Irene found us,"" the governor said. Vermont was one of the hardest-hit states as Irene made its way up the East Coast. Many communities in the small state were cut off as floodwaters washed away roads and bridges. Phish's decision to get involved in the recovery effort wasn't a difficult one. ""We think it's a really nice way to come back and give back to a state that has given us so much,"" keyboardist Page McConnell said when the band announced its intention to hold the concert. Phish partners with local charities in an effort to make positive impact in each of the towns they visit while out on tour, and in 1997 the band created the WaterWheel foundation to oversee its charitable activities. That includes fundraisers following disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck Japan earlier this year. When it came to Vermont, the state where Phish was formed in 1983, however, the band concluded, ""We have to do something bigger,"" said Beth Montuori Rowles from the WaterWheel Foundation. Despite having little time to plan, the concert came together, ""quite easily,"" Montuori-Rowles said . The band, on its website, thanked numerous major donors who underwrote the concert's production expenses. Proceeds of the concert -- from ticket sales, merchandise sales, download and webcast sales -- will be directed to the WaterWheel Foundation and to the Vermont Community Foundation. Both organizations continue to raise money online for the Vermont recovery effort. And police in Essex Junction, located in western Vermont just outside Burlington, said the event also went ""better than expected"" from their end. There were no arrests or serious injuries, with only a slight traffic back-up for an hour as the gates opened. ""I can't remember a group as large and as pleasant to deal with as this one,"" Essex Junction Police Capt. Brad LaRose said. The police department even got in on the philanthropy, with some officers donating their time back to the cause. Rich Lewis, the Champlain Valley Expo's public relations director, described the fans that came out Wednesday night as ""upbeat"" and ""appreciative."" The concert, while a tiring event for Lewis and his staff who had just closed the state's fair at the same venue last week, was ""substantial on all levels."" ""I can't tell you how much we appreciate being a part of this groundbreaking historic event,"" Lewis said.","The show broke attendance records at the Champlain Valley Expo in Essex Junction .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been ruled out of a return to his former club Barcelona when the group stage of the European Champions League kicks off on Tuesday. The Sweden international, who spent just one season in Spain following his big-money move from Milan's city rivals Internazionale in 2009, suffered a thigh injury in training on Monday. ""The tests carried out showed that the player has a strain in his thigh muscle and will not be leaving for Barcelona with the rest of the squad. He will rest for a few days and then start his treatment towards the end of the week,"" the Italian club's website reported. Ibrahimovic's absence could mean a reprieve for Italy international Antonio Cassano, who was expected to make way for Brazil star Alexandre Pato despite scoring in the club's Serie A opener on Friday. Ibrahimovic also netted in that game, a 2-2 draw with Lazio. AC Milan fight back to draw with Lazio . Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta said he was disappointed that his former teammate would not be lining up at the Camp Nou against the tournament's defending champions. ""It's a pity that he can't play -- he's a great player and you always want to play against good players. He really wanted to come and play, and it's a shame he can't make it. However, I don't think that takes anything away from the game, which should be fantastic,"" Iniesta told reporters at a pre-match press conference. Iniesta will renew his rivalry with Milan's Dutch midfielder Mark van Bommel, with whom he clashed during the 2010 World Cup final. ""It's true that during the final there was some rough play, but I prefer to think there was no malicious intent. He's an opponent, but above all we are professional companions and I respect him in all respects,"" said Iniesta, who scored the only goal of the match in Johannesburg in extra-time. Barca coach Pep Guardiola is expected to recall two-time world player of the year Lionel Messi, who was rested for Saturday's shock 2-2 draw with Real Sociedad. The Argentina forward will make his first competitive outing against the seven-time European champions, as he bids to be the competition's top scorer for the fourth season in a row. Barca will be without new signing Alexis Sanchez, with the Chile midfielder expected to be sidelined for two months after tearing a thigh muscle against Sociedad as the Catalan team dropped their first points of the La Liga season. The match is the pick of Tuesday's ties, with Viktoria Plzen of the Czech Republic hosting BATE Borisov of Belarus in the other Group H fixture. In Group E, English club Chelsea host Germany's Bayer Leverkusen, while Spanish side Valencia travel to Belgium to play Genk. Chelsea's build-up has been marred by a controversy over $80 million striker Fernando Torres, who supposedly criticized ""older"" teammates in an interview with Spain's Primera Liga website which was translated to English on his personal Internet page. ""We are going in-depth to regain the tape of that interview. We'll see if things play exactly as they are in that interview,"" said the London team's manager Andre Villas-Boas. Torres was dropped for Saturday's win at Sunderland, having earlier lost his place in the Spain squad for the Euro 2012 qualifier against Liechtenstein. Group F sees another England-Germany clash as Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund host Arsenal, while French runners-up Marseille visit Greece's Olympiakos. In Group G, Portuguese champions Porto welcome Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk, and Apoel of Cyprus host Russia's Zenit St. Petersburg.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic suffers injury ahead of Champions League trip to Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- Activists speaking at a Syrian government-sponsored ""national dialogue"" meeting Sunday criticized recent crackdowns by the country's security forces, calling for an end to violence against protesters. Syria's vice president hailed the Damascus University meeting between officials and members of the opposition as a step toward creating a ""democratic nation."" ""We hope that at the end of this comprehensive meeting to announce the transition of Syria to a pluralistic democratic nation where all citizens are guided by equality and participate in the modeling of the future of their country,"" Vice President Faruq al-Shara said in opening remarks at the meeting, which was broadcast live on state television. Syrian activists say that security personnel have assaulted unarmed protesters during months of anti-government demonstrations that erupted nationwide in mid-March. The Syrian government has claimed armed groups are responsible for the violence at the demonstrations. Several speakers at Sunday's meeting called on Syria's government to change its tactics. ""The bloodshed needs to stop. Yes, there are unauthorized protests, but is it a reason to use unjustified and excessive violence? The use of all types of excessive force is unjustified,"" said Qadri Jameel of the opposition Front of Change and Liberation. Syrian researcher Al-Tayyeb Tizzina also criticized the use of force and asked for violence to stop in order for the dialogue to succeed. ""The establishment of a political society requires the immediate start of a process dismantling the police state that is dominating Syria,"" he said. Al-Shara acknowledged that a surge of violence in Syria precipitated Sunday's meeting. ""We have to admit that without the big sacrifices that were presented by the Syrian people, from the blood of their sons, civilians or military in more than one province, city and town, this meeting wouldn't have happened,"" he said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said the meeting included members of the opposition, independent activists, youth leaders and academics. However, some opponents of President Bashar al-Assad's regime have criticized the meeting, saying the government is trying to quiet widespread unrest without making meaningful changes. Demonstrators protested the meeting in nationwide ""no dialogue"" marches Friday. ""Any dialogue must be based on the base of (al-Assad's) stepping down from power,"" said a statement from the Change in Syria Conference, an opposition group that called for al-Assad to hand over power to the vice president at a meeting in Turkey last month. Sunday's dialogue meeting began as Syria's foreign ministry summoned the U.S. and French ambassadors and accused them of interfering in internal affairs when they visited Syria's fourth-largest city without permission last week, state media reported. The ministry told the diplomats that their visit to the city of Hama violated the Vienna Convention, according to SANA. That 1961 accord, brokered through the United Nations, sets ground rules as to how diplomats can operate in other countries. However, a senior U.S. State Department official said U.S. Ambassador Robert Ford was not summoned by Syrian officials on Sunday; his meeting with Syria's foreign minister was previously scheduled by the U.S. Embassy in Damascus last Thursday. The official declined to speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation. In the meeting, Ford said his visit to Hama was meant to gather information and support freedom of expression. He also accused the Syrian government of inciting Syrians against the United States, including organizing a protest outside the U.S. Embassy Friday and Saturday, the senior State Department official said. Protesters threw tomatoes, eggs, glass and rocks at the embassy as they called for the ambassador to leave during the 31-hour demonstration, according to the senior State Department official, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the situation. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland issued a blunt rebuttal to similar Syrian government accusations Friday, calling claims that Ford's visit was inciting protesters ""absolute rubbish"" and saying she was ""dismayed"" by the Syrian government's reaction. Nuland said the U.S. Embassy had notified the Syrian Defense Ministry before the visit and that Ford's car was waved through a security checkpoint. The French foreign ministry issued a statement Sunday saying that its embassy had also been besieged by demonstrators, faulting Syrian authorities for failing to stop the destruction of vehicles, burning of French flags and other damage. The French government summoned Syria's ambassador to France on Sunday to issue a formal protest on this matter, and to hold Syrian authorities responsible for the security of French diplomats in the Middle Eastern country. It also challenged the Damascus government's decision to summon Eric Chevallier, France's own ambassador to Syria. Like the U.S. ambassador, Chevallier visited Hama on Thursday and spent the night, the French government said, meeting with wounded people and their families and medical staffers at a hospital. Al-Assad issued a decree appointing a Hama provincial governor Sunday, a day after firing the existing leader after a series of peaceful demonstrations there, including a massive anti-government protest last Friday. Activists and Human Rights Watch have reported many arrests and deaths in a fierce government crackdown in the area. Citizens have called a general strike in the city. Diplomatic tensions over Syria also flared in Washington last week, with the State Department summoning Syrian Ambassador Imad Mustapha Friday. The State Department said Mustapha was called ""to express a number of our concerns with the reported actions of certain Syrian embassy staff in the United States."" The statement, issued in response to a question taken at Friday's daily briefing, said the State Department had received reports that Syrian mission personnel had been conducting video surveillance of people participating in peaceful demonstrations in the United States. ""We are also investigating reports that the Syrian government has sought retribution against Syrian family members for the actions of their relatives in the United States exercising their lawful rights in this country and will respond accordingly,"" the statement said.

"New York (CNN) -- Everyone remembers the iconic image of Brandi Chastain on her knees after the U.S. women's soccer team won the 1999 World Cup Championship. Hope Solo was only 17 then, inspired by the American women on the field. Now, Solo, the goalie of the 2011 team, is poised with her teammates to repeat the drama of all those years ago. After winning several games in dramatic fashion, the U.S. women face Japan Sunday for the championship in Frankfurt, Germany. The 1999 team set the bar high, Solo told CNN Friday. But she wanted to set the record straight: her team wants its own bragging rights. ""Twelve years later, this team wants to write their own storybook ending,"" Solo said. ""We want to end with our legacy and we are a very different team from the '99 team. So, you know, we do hope that looking forward, people remember the 2011 U.S. women's soccer team."" Sunday's game will determine what kind of lasting memories Solo's team will be able to etch, but it was hard not to know Solo's name Friday. She became somewhat of an instant celebrity, especially on Twitter, where a trending topic was ""marrymehope."" She dodged the question about the topic on CNN's ""American Morning,"" instead focusing on the team spirit that catapulted America to the finals. Others may find it surprising that the United States emerged as the new darling of 2011 soccer, she said, but not the team. ""We came into this tournament with one goal,"" Solo said. ""It wasn't to beat Brazil in the quarterfinal. It wasn't to make it to the final. Our only goal of this tournament was to win the whole thing. I think when you get this close, you would have a lot of regrets if you walked away and you didn't win it all."" Japan may have world's collective sympathy after the devastating earthquake and tsunami, but America is not going down to the sentimentality, Solo said. ""This team is truly a team, and, as cliche as that is in sports these days, this team will fight until the bitter end to find a way to win,"" she said. ""It's not always pretty but everybody on the field is trying to find a way to win,"" she said. ""I think it's the American way. It's the American spirit. I think America is so behind us because you can feel that spirit and you can feel the fight in our team. And people kind of grab on to that."" If they win Sunday, the U.S. women would become the first team to win the Women's World Cup three times, after taking titles in 1991 and 1999. Just as she was inspired by the 1999 team, Solo hopes to awaken the thrill of soccer among the next generation of American women. ""You can't not think about it when you see the kids come to our games, when you see all of the inspirational signs that are at the training fields, at the playing fields,"" Solo said. ""I do my best to be a good role model and I do my best to inspire people, especially the youth of America."" She wants to give back, she said, because the fans instill confidence, give her joy. And that's what will make her thrive come the all-important game Sunday.","Hope Solo was only 17 when the U.S. women won the 1999 World Cup .
She says she was inspired by her predecessors .
But the 2011 team wants to leave its own legacy .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Eight people were killed Monday after a suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the home of a senior police official, Karachi police said. Six officers who were stationed as guards were killed in the attack, along with a mother and a girl as they were walking to the girl's school, said Shoukat Ali, a senior Karachi police official. The house was badly damaged, but the intended target of the attack -- Chaudhry Aslam -- is safe, said Jamil Khan, a Karachi police official. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Ihsanullah Ihsan, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, told CNN by phone that Aslam was the target of the explosion. ""Aslam has killed and arrested lots of our mujahidin and will have to face the consequences,"" Ihsan said. ""Mujahidin"" refers to militants fighting against the Pakistani state and who are often affiliated with radical Islam. Ihsan said the explosion is also a message to officials who work against the Taliban and alongside the United States. ""All pro-U.S. security officials are ... our target,"" Ihsan said. But Aslam said he was ""not afraid of this coward attack by Taliban,"" appearing on national news channels and vowing to continue the fight against the militants. ""I have been receiving threats from the Taliban for a long time,"" the police official said. ""I have been defeating Taliban (militants) by arresting them, and will continue until I have last drop of blood in my body.""

"(CNN) -- Some big-name clubs were in action in European football's second-tier competition on Thursday, but most attention was focused on Istanbul for the visit of little-fancied Maccabi Tel-Aviv. In a match played against a backdrop of escalating tensions between Turkey and Israel, the home team Besiktas triumphed 5-1 in the opening round of the Europa League tournament. With Turkey having announced the expulsion of Israel's ambassador last week and the suspension of military agreements following a naval incident in May, there were fears the match might not go ahead. But despite some anti-Israel protests outside Inonu Stadium, the match passed relatively peacefully after Besiktas took the lead in the third minute through Portuguese striker Hugo Almeida, who doubled the advantage before half an hour had been played. Maccabi, 18-time Israeli champions but third in the league last season, pulled a goal back through Roi Kehat's header four minutes after halftime but could not manage a first victory in the club's fifth meeting with Turkish opposition. Besiktas -- fifth in last season's Turkish Super Lig and winners of the domestic cup before club officials were arrested in a match-fixing investigation -- hit back immediately through Mehmet Aurelio and Egemen Korkmaz, while Brazilian substitute Edu added the fifth goal two minutes from time. In the other Group E tie, Dinamo Kiev had to come from behind to draw 1-1 with English side Stoke City. Ognjen Vukojevic's late goal canceled out Cameron Jerome's 55th-minute opener in Ukraine to deny the visitors victory in the club's first European outing in 37 years. Last season's losing finalists Braga beat English debutants Birmingham 3-1 away in Group H, while Belgium's Bruges won 2-0 at home to Slovenia's Maribor. Atletico Madrid, who won the 2009-10 title, cruised to a 2-0 win at home to Scottish side Celtic -- playing after Swiss club Sion lost an appeal after fielding ineligible players. Striker Falcao scored a record 17 goals in the competition last season as Porto won the title, and he opened the scoring with an early header for his new Spanish club. Brazilian midfielder Diego sealed victory in the second half. In the other Group I match, Italy's Udinese won 2-1 at home Rennes. In Group A, English club Tottenham drew 0-0 away to Greece's PAOK Salonika, who missed a first-half penalty which had to be retaken. Russia's Rubin Kazan won 3-0 away to Irish minnows Shamrock. Danish titleholders Copenhagen lead Group B, winning 1-0 at home to Ukraine's Vorskla Poltava after dropping down from the Champions League qualifiers. Germany's Hannover drew 0-0 at home with Belgian runners-up Standard Liege. PSV Eindhoven, European champions in 1988, won 1-0 at home Poland's Legia Warsaw while Romania's Rapid Bucharest triumphed by the same score away to Hapoel Tel-Aviv of Israel in the other Group C tie. Italian side Lazio were surprisingly held 2-2 at home by Romania's Vaslui in Group D, while Portugal's Sporting Lisbon won 2-0 away to Swiss club Zurich. Big-spending French club Paris St. Germain won 3-1 at home to Austria's Salzburg in Group F, while Spanish side Athletic Bilbao won 2-1 away to Slovakia's Slovan Bratislava. In Group G, Dutch club AZ Alkmaar beat Sweden's Malmo 4-1 and Ukraine's Metalist Kharkiv came from behind to win 2-1 away to Austria Vienna. Maccabi Haifa gave Israel some joy with a 1-0 win at home to AEK Larnaca of Cyprus in Group J, while Steaua Bucharest and Germany's Schalke battled to a stalemate in Romania. English club Fulham, losing finalists in 2010, drew 1-1 at home with that season's Dutch champions Twente in Group K -- where Denmark's Odense head the standings after winning 3-1 away to Poland's Wisla Krakow. In Group L, Belgian side Anderlecht trounced AEK Athens 4-1 as Argentine striker Matias Suarez scored a hat-trick, while Russia's Locomotiv Moscow won 2-1 in Austria against Sturm Graz.","Maccabi Tel Aviv lose 5-1 in trip to face Turkish club Besiktas in Europa League .

"(CNN) -- Two of Malaga's big-name pre-season signings engineered the Spanish club's first win of the new La Liga season on Monday. Spain internationals Santi Cazorla and Joaquin Sanchez both scored twice in the 4-0 victory at promoted Granada, relieving the pressure on coach Manuel Pellegrini after the opening-day defeat by Sevilla. The former Real Madrid boss was given a big transfer kitty by Qatari owner Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nassar Al-Thani after Malaga flirted with relegation last season before finishing 11th. Cazorla, who cost $27 million when he joined from Villarreal in August, netted the opening goal four minutes into his home debut in the Andalusian derby. Fellow winger Joaquin, who signed for $5.5 million from Valencia, doubled the lead on 25 with a header from a cross by Jesus Gamez, and Cazorla made it 3-0 with a free-kick two minutes after the halftime break. Cazorla set up Joaquin for the fourth in the 72nd minute to leave Granada bottom of the table below Sporting Gijon, with both clubs losing their first two matches. In England's Premier League, unbeaten Newcastle moved up to fourth place despite being held 0-0 away to promoted Queen's Park Rangers. The home side ended a run of three defeats after manager Neil Warnock gave midfielder Joey Barton the captain's armband against his former club.","New signings Santi Cazorla and Joaquin Sanchez score twice in Malaga's 4-0 win .

"(CNN) -- Former Asian football president Mohammed bin Hammam has failed to overturn his life ban in an appeal to world ruling body FIFA. The Qatari had hoped to be reinstated after being accused of bribing officials for votes in June's FIFA presidential election, but the Appeal Committee announced on Thursday that the suspension will stand. ""The appeal made by Mohammed bin Hammam has been rejected and the decision of the FIFA Ethics Committee confirmed,"" FIFA's website reported. ""The sanction of being banned from taking part in any kind of football-related activity (administrative, sports or any other) at national and international level for life has therefore been maintained."" Ecuador's Francisco Acosta chaired a panel also comprising Argentina's Fernando Mitjans and Augustin Senghor of Senegal to hear the case. Bin Hammam said he now intended to pursue the matter with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, where he feels he has a better chance of success. ""Of course, today's outcome from the Appeal Committee was not unexpected or surprising. To be fair to the Appeal Committee members though, as a consequence of our experiences with the Ethics Committee, we didn't make serious efforts to prove my innocence this time around,"" he said on his website. ""I can now see, at last, light at the end of the tunnel and I am heading confidently towards it. My next step is to go to CAS, where from now on I will be equal to my rival."" Bin Hammam was provisionally found guilty of breaching FIFA's ethics code just days before the June 1 election, in which he was to be incumbent Sepp Blatter's only opponent. The 62-year-old withdrew from contention and was subsequently banned for life in July. He has maintained his innocence, despite being found guilty of offering money to Caribbean delegates. FIFA vice-president Jack Warner was also provisionally suspended for his part in the affair, but decided to resign rather than appear in front of the Ethics Committee. Bin Hammam, a former FIFA Executive Committee member, was chairman of the Qatar Football Association from 1992-96 and president of the Asian Football Confederation from 2002-11. He was a key figure as Qatar won the right to host the 2022 World Cup, despite accusations of corruption in the build-up to the FIFA delegates' vote on that tournament and the 2018 event, which went to Russia.","FIFA rejects Mohammed Bin Hammam's appeal against his life ban from football .

"(CNN) -- A 93rd minute Thiago Silva goal salvaged a late draw for AC Milan as they held Barcelona in their opening European Champions League Group H match on Tuesday. It was the least Milan deserved after taking the game to the European champions, even going ahead within the first minute thanks to a piece of individual brilliance. Brazilian international Pato slalomed through Barcelona's surprisingly porous defense before slotting home to give the home side an early, and unexpected, bloody nose. Barcelona pressed for an inevitable equalizer with Lionel Messi again central. After clipping the post a few minutes earlier, his mazy run found him enough space to stroke a ball across the penalty box that was gleefully tapped in by Pedro. And when David Villa scored with a brilliant second half free kick, it looked like Barcelona would start their defense of the crown with an impressive win against one of the strongest teams in European football. But Thiago Silva's late, late header shared the points. Elsewhere in Europe goals were in short supply. It took Chelsea 72 minutes to break the deadlock against German side Bayer Leverkusen in Group E, Brazilian defender David Luiz curling in a right foot shot from Fernando Torres' lay off. Spain international Torres was again the provider when he unselfishly squared the ball to compatriot Juan Mata with the match going into injury time, sealing a 2-0 victory. Arsenal had their hopes of an early away victory against Borussia Dortmund in Group F dashed late on when an incredible Ivan Perisic volley cancelled out Robin van Persie's first half strike. The result of the night, however, came from Cyprus where Apoel Nicosia came from a goal down against Russian champions Zenit St Petersburg with under 20 minutes left to win 2-1 in Group G. Konstatin Zyryanov's second half strike looked to have sealed victory for Zenit, but two goals in three minutes from Apoel's Brazilian duo of Gustavo Manduca and Ailton turned the tie on its head. Elsewhere in Group G Porto got their campaign off to a winning start by beating nine-man Shakhtar Donetsk 2-1 in Portugal. Striker Kleber made it a good night for Brazilians playing in Europe after scoring the winning goal in the second half. Belgian side Genk fought a creditable 0-0 draw against Spain's Valencia in Group E, whilst Czech debutantes Viktoria Plzen also won their first ever Champions League point in Group H with a 1-1 home draw against BATE Borisov from Belarus. In Group F Didier Deschamps' Marseilles got their Champions League challenge off to the best possible start against Greek side Olympiakos. Argentina midfielder Lucho González' scored the only goal of a game that saw Olympiakos reduced to ten men after substitute Rod Fanni was shown a straight red card for a reckless challenge.","AC Milan score an injury-time equalizer against Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- Players in the top two tiers of the Spanish league have announced they are to go on strike for the first two weekends of the season. Over 100 players, including Barcelona captain Carles Puyol and Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas, voted for action in a long-running financial dispute with the league (LFP). Spanish champions Barcelona are due to begin the defence of their title at Malaga on August 21 with their nearest challengers, and fierce rivals Real Madrid, hosting Athletic Bilbao. In a statement on their web site the president of the players' union (AFE) Luis Manuel Rubiales confirmed the strike action would go ahead. The disagreement centers on the union's demand for an increase to the emergency fund that helps protects players' wages if their clubs experience financial difficulties. The league said in their own statement that they did not understand the strike action as they had recently introduced two ""historic"" changes in relation to the players' requests. A new financial self-regulation code for clubs has been introduced as well as a guarantee to cover a chunk of wages for players at clubs who go into administration. ""For this reason, the calling of a strike at a moment when fundamental steps forward are being taken is incomprehensible for the LFP,"" they said. At a press conference on Wednesday Rubiales, flanked by Puyol and Casillas, attacked the league. ""It is lamentable. As it stands we are at the bottom of the pile in Europe,"" Rubiales said. ""We don't want more money we want the clubs to honor the contracts they sign with their players. ""We have put forward proposals which exist in Holland, Germany, France and England which are preventative. In these countries if a club shows it can't pay its players the club doesn't compete. ""We have asked that players who are owed more than three months (wages) can break their contracts. It seemed like we had an agreement but it was left out."" The LFP continued in their statement: ""The position of the LFP is at all times to advance the negotiations, to continue working and to reach early agreement satisfactory to all.""","Spanish soccer players vote to strike for the first two weekends of upcoming league season .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A ""surprisingly healthy"" population of rare snow leopards has been discovered in the remote northeastern stretches of Afghanistan, one of the few areas largely unaffected by the near decade-long war in the country. Researchers photographed the elusive big cat using camera traps at 16 different locations across Afghanistan's mountainous Wakhan Corridor, according to a recent report from the Wildlife Conservation Society. The images are the first camera trap records of snow leopards in Afghanistan, the organization noted. ""This is a wonderful discovery -- it shows that there is real hope for snow leopards in Afghanistan,"" said Peter Zahler, the group's deputy director. ""Now our goal is to ensure that these magnificent animals have a secure future as a key part of Afghanistan's natural heritage."" The organization said the discovery ""gives hope to the world's most elusive big cat, which calls home to some of the world's tallest mountains."" But the endangered animal also faces threats from poachers, shepherds and those who capture the cats for illegal trade. Their populations have declined by as much as 20% over the past 16 years, the group reported. Researchers estimate between 4,500 and 7,500 snow leopards are left in the wild, scattered across Central Asia.","A population of rare snow leopards has been discovered in Afghanistan .

"Antalya, Turkey (CNN) -- Hundreds of activists at a meeting in Turkey titled ""Conference for Change in Syria"" issued a declaration Thursday calling on President Bashar al-Assad to step down and hand power to his vice president, with the goal of then organizing democratic elections. The opposition gathering also declared its support for the ""Revolution in Syria,"" and elected a 31-member council aimed at assisting the protest movement in Syria. For the last two days, the activists from Syria and international diaspora have gathered in the conference rooms and lobbies of a hotel in this Turkish beach resort, to plot ways to support the bloody revolution in Syria. There are signs the gathering is worrying the regime in Damascus, which has deployed tanks and soldiers in a bloody attempt to crush a tenacious protest movement. On Thursday, as activists busied themselves in workshops on social networking and the drafting of a final declaration, dozens of pro-regime supporters gathered outside the hotel wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the portrait of Syrian al-Assad. ""We love Bashar,"" they chanted. Tareq Salhab, a dentist who traveled from the coastal Syrian city of Latikiya to Antalya on Thursday, accused anti-regime demonstrators in Syria and the activists in the opposition conference in Turkey of being ""terrorists"" and ""traitors."" ""You have to go to Damascus and Homs and Latakiya to see the democracy in Syria,"" Salhab said, listing Syrian cities. Syrian authorities have denied all CNN requests for journalist visas since last February. Meanwhile, human rights groups report more than 800 people have been killed in the government crackdown and more than 10,000 people detained. Turkish police were out in force in Antalya, ensuring that several hundred pro-government demonstrators could not reach the opposition conference venue. ""This conference is a hard message to the Syrian regime,"" said Omar al Muqdad, a human rights activist from the Syrian town of Dara'a, which has become the symbol of defiance against the al-Assad family, which has ruled Syria for four decades. ""They (the Syrian regime) sent these people here to protest outside this hotel. That means our message, they got it,"" al Muqdad said. ""What would post-Assad Syria look like? That's the $50 million question,"" said Amr Al-Azm, a Syrian-American history professor from Shawnee State University in Ohio. ""We've been able to begin to address what the alternative would like like...we've provided a road map,"" Al-Azm said. Al-Azm helped draft the conference's final communique, which has yet to be released. He is an unlikely revolutionary though. Until last March, Al-Azm was a senior consultant on a project headed by Bashar al-Assad's wife, Asma, aimed at reforming Syria's culture ministry. ""What changed for me was the violence, the unprecedented level of violence that seemed random and almost uncontrolled,"" Al-Azm said. ""There are people that I actually know that have had their fingernails pulled out."" Conference organizers say their main goals are to organize committees aimed at supporting protesters inside Syria, communicating with the media, and lobbying foreign governments. Their aim, they say, is to help unite the opposition both inside and outside Syria.","NEW: Syrian activists issue a declaration telling President Bashar al-Assad to step down .

"(CNN) -- Edward ""Ned"" Kelly packed a lot of living, stealing and killing in his scant 25 years. So much so that Mick Jagger portrayed him in a movie. As did Heath Ledger. Australian artist Sidney Nolan made Ned Kelly the subject of a series of paintings. The cattle rustler, robber and cop killer was hanged in November 1880 after a string of crimes, including the deaths of three police officers in one incident. His reputed last words: ""Such is life."" Australia's best-known outlaw, or bushranger, was buried in the Old Melbourne Gaol. But his remains became ""lost"" after they were transferred to another prison near Melbourne. On Thursday Victoria Attorney General Robert Clark announced the search for the remains was over. Through DNA analysis, Kelly's headless skeleton has been positively identified. ""To think a group of scientists could identify the body of a man who was executed more than 130 years ago, moved and buried in a haphazard fashion among 33 other prisoners -- most of whom are not identified -- is amazing,"" Clark said in a prepared statement. The official credited doctors and scientists at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine. A DNA sample taken from Melbourne schoolteacher Leigh Olver, great-grandson of Kelly's sister, was instrumental. Opinions on the infamous Kelly and his gang are decidedly mixed, according to the Australian Dictionary of Biography. Some scholars and observers have described the outlaw as cold-blooded and egotistical. Author Clive Turnbull said the son of an Irish immigrant showed courage, independence and sympathy for the underdog. Kelly is an integral part of Australian cultural history, with his defiance of the oppressive British authority of the time striking a chord for many Australians. Kelly was captured and hanged after a shootout with police in the Victorian town of Glenrowan. In the shootout, the gang was wearing suits of homemade armor that had been fashioned from farming implements. In 2001, the State Library of Victoria purchased a piece of it for $100,000 (AU $200,000). The library's collection includes the outlaw's helmet and breastplate. According to Clark, the outlaw's remains were among those transferred from the Old Melbourne Gaol to Pentridge Prison in 1929. The skeletons were exhumed again in 2009. ""The project required examination of the remains of 34 individuals in total, many of which were co-mingled and incomplete, making the successful identification even more remarkable,"" according to Clark. The investigation began when a skull believed to be Kelly's was given by an individual to officials in 2009. The skull ""had been taken from the Old Melbourne Gaol in December 1978 where it had been on display next to the death mask of Ned Kelly. An ink inscription 'E. Kelly' was written on the side."" The skull analysis prompted forensic experts to try to identify Kelly's skeleton. ""Ned Kelly's remains turned out to be an almost complete skeleton found buried in a wooden ax box, although most of the skull was missing,"" Australian officials said. ""Consultations will commence shortly with Ned Kelly's family and other parties involved, regarding the appropriate future resting place for Ned Kelly's remains."" One problem emerged in the process of identifying the remains, however: The skull from the Old Melbourne Gaol wasn't a match. That mystery continues.","Ned Kelly is considered by many in Australia to be a folk hero .
Others have called him a cold-blooded killer .
His remains have been positively identified; most of the skull is missing ."
"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- A businessman and his wife were arrested on charges of blackmailing Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Italian police said Thursday. The blackmail allegations are linked to a sex scandal surrounding Berlusconi for months. Gianpaolo Tarantini, 36, and Angela Devenuto, 34, were arrested at their Rome home and brought to Naples to be questioned by prosecutors. A judge issued an arrest warrant for a third person, Valter Lavitola, who authorities said was the link between Berlusconi and Tarantini. Lavitola is believed to be out of the country. Tarantini, who is accused of paying escorts to go to parties with Berlusconi, has said the leader was not aware of the payments. But, according to the Naples's prosecutors, Berlusconi was a victim of ""veiled and implied threats"" and paid 500,000 euros ($714,250) to Tarantini. Berlusconi told the Panorama newspaper, owned by his media group, that he gave the money to Tarantini as an act of charity. ""Through Lavitola,"" Berlusconi told Panorama, ""I helped a person (Tarantini) with a family and kids, which is now in very bad economic situation. I have nothing to repent of. I didn't do anything illicit; I just helped a desperate man without pretending nothing (anything) in exchange."" Tarantini said he will cooperate with authorities. He denied he blackmailed Berlusconi, to whom he expressed his ""gratitude for all what he did for he and for my family."" In a separate case, Berlusconi is presently on trial in Milan for allegedly paying for sex with a then-17-year-old Moroccan belly dancer named Karima el Mahroug, nicknamed ""Ruby the Heart-stealer."" The Berlusconi sex scandal explained . He is charged with abuse of power because prosecutors say he phoned a police station -- where she was being held on theft charges -- to have her released. Berlusconi has repeatedly denied all of the allegations, even joking about how unlikely it is that a man his age would be capable of the sexual feats some have claimed. ""I'm 74 years old and even though I may be a bit of a rascal, 33 girls in two months seems to me too much even for a 30-year-old."" In 2009, his wife of 19 years, Veronica Lario, filed for divorce and publicly accused her husband of ""consorting with minors"" after he attended the 18th birthday party of an aspiring TV actress and model called Noemi Letizia. Berlusconi said the young woman was the daughter of a friend and that he had done nothing inappropriate. Noemi Letizia and her family also said there was nothing improper. That same year, another young woman, Patrizia D'Addario, alleged she and other girls were paid to attend parties at Berlusconi's residence. Berlusconi denied the claim, telling his weekly magazine Chi: ""I never understood where the satisfaction is when you're missing the pleasure of conquest."" El Mahroug has denied having sex with the premier. Both admit that he gave her money, although they say it was an act of kindness to help the young girl. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","Couple arrested at their Rome home .

"Washington (CNN) -- With U.S.-Pakistan relations in the deep freeze, former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf and American officials called Thursday for a thaw. ""Blame games, rigidity, arrogance, insensitivity to each other's national interests is certainly very counter-productive,"" Musharraf said in Washington. ""It definitely saddens me to see the deteriorating Pakistan-United States relations,"" he said in a speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center. Twelve weeks have passed since American commandos killed Osama bin Laden inside Pakistan, an event that dramatically widened the rift between the two countries. Musharraf denied he knew during his time as president or later that bin Laden was hiding out in Pakistan. ""Whether one believes it or not, let me say with confidence, I did not know,"" he declared. He suggested that it was negligence and not complicity of the Pakistan government that allowed bin Laden to stay there undetected. ""If there was complicity this is very, very serious indeed,"" Musharraf said. ""I think the UN and the United States have all the right to be against Pakistan if it ultimately comes to believe that ... people were hiding him, people were complicit in it,"" Musharraf said. The former president and general, who has been living in London, pledged to return to Pakistan next March for a political comeback in 2013, in what he called ""the mother of all elections."" David Petraeus, making his way home from Afghanistan where he was commanding general and soon to start his new job as CIA director, reportedly told a Paris audience yesterday he also is worried about relations with Pakistan. He just completed a visit there and said the relationship is at a difficult stage but the U.S. must continue efforts to work with Pakistan, recognizing what it has done in the fight against terror. Meanwhile in Washington, top U.S. military leaders told senators of their concerns about Pakistan. The soldier poised to take over as chief of staff of the Army, Gen. Ray Odierno, said militants hiding out in Pakistan along the Afghanistan border are a major security challenge facing the United States. Adm. James Winnefeld, tapped as the next vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Pakistan must do more to crack down on insurgents like the Haqqani network. ""Pakistan is a very, very difficult partner and we all know that. We don't always share the same world view or the same opinions or the same national interests,"" Winnefeld told the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""I think we need to continued pressure on Pakistan using all elements of pressure that we're able to apply to what really should be a friend to get them to realize that the Haqqani network poses a threat to their own country and to take the steps that we've asked them to take."" Former congresswoman and Wilson Center director Jane Harmon said both the United States and Pakistan have made mistakes and miscalculations. ""Nothing is irreparable and this relationship has got to be fixed,"" Harmon said after Musharraf's speech. ""I think some tough love is required, I think there needs to be a more honest and straight relationship,"" Harmon said. ""The Pakistanis have grievances, but we clearly have grievances too.""","The former president of Pakistan says he did not know Osama bin Laden was hiding there .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Home to some 70 million Muslims, Nigeria is stepping up efforts to capitalize on the growing popularity of the one of the world's fastest-growing financial sectors: Islamic banking. Earlier this year the Central Bank of Nigeria announced a final set of regulations which introduced Islamic banking to the country. CNN's Christian Purefoy discussed the sector's potential with Hajara Adeola, managing director of Lotus Capital, one of the groups helping to pave the way for Islamic finance in Nigeria. Adeola says there is a growing appetite for this form of banking. ""It is working in Nigeria and there is a lot of interest in doing Islamic banking, in West Africa in particular,"" she says. Spread across the Middle East and other parts of the world, a slew of Islamic financial institutions have been offering interest-free services that advocates say can provide a more sustainable alternative to conventional banking practices. The industry, which exists in more than 50 countries, is estimated to be worth around $1 trillion and has the potential to eventually be worth $5 trillion, according to ratings agency Moody's. Charging and paying interest is not allowed in Islamic finance because it is prohibited under Sharia law. Instead, if a bank is providing finance for an infrastructure project, for example, the bank and customer agree to share the risk of investment and divide any earnings. ""One of the most well known (principles) is the lack of interest or usury, so you can't own a return simply for having money -- which is what interest is,"" Adeola says. ""You would have to somehow employ that money into productive use and then you can earn a return on that money."" Islamic banks are not allowed to trade in financial risk areas or deal in mortgage-backed securities or credit-default swaps. Investing in Islamically unacceptable businesses such as alcohol and cigarette makers, casinos and adult-entertainment companies is also forbidden. In June, Jaiz Bank International became the first group to be allowed to open a Shariah-compliant bank in Nigeria after gaining an approval in principal from the country's Central Bank. Adeola believes Nigeria has the potential to become one of the largest Islamic banking sectors in the world. ""It is a huge market,"" she says. ""There's about 70 million Muslims in Nigeria. Research shows approximately 30% of the Muslim population typically would be interested in Islamic finance and if you look at the projection they made for the size of the market, it is really quite tremendous -- and that's just the domestic."" But the Central Bank's decision has met opposition from some Christian leaders in Nigeria, who argue that the move could increase religious violence in a country whose population is almost evenly divided between Muslims and Christians. According to a VOA news report in mid-July, the Christian Association of Nigeria said the introduction of Islamic banking could stir up religious tensions at a time when security forces are fighting Islamic fundamentalists who want an independent state in northern Nigeria ruled by Islamic law. But Adeola says that Islamic finance is not a threat and can appeal to the country's Christian community as well its Muslims. ""Islamic finance is universal,"" she says. ""There is nothing about it that offends anyone or offends their faith or their principles. If anything, there are many Christians who like to invest with us because it's also in line with their own ethical values."" Christian Purefoy and Teo Kermeliotis contributed to this report .","Nigerian authorities have introduced regulations introducing Islamic banking .

"Hebron, West Bank (CNN) -- Standing under a large poster of Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock, Nabil Saeed lays out large rolls of red, green, white and black cloth on his workshop table. These are the colors of his homeland, one he hopes will soon become a fully recognized state. The flag-maker marks the cloth in precise shapes before cutting different colored layers as the hum of a sewing machine is heard from a small room next door. The Saeed family home in the West Bank city of Hebron has been bustling with activity lately, as they seek to meet the increased demand for Palestinian flags ahead of an expected move by the Palestinian Authority to seek statehood at the United Nations next week. Having cut the cloth, Saeed and his wife, together with his nephew Mahmoud, sit in a small room, filled with textiles, threads of different colors, and three small tables. Perched upon each table is an old sewing machine, like a relic of a bygone era. Like clockwork, the pieces of cloth here are passed between them. First, Nabil's nephew, Mahmoud, sews the pieces together, passes them to Saeed's wife, who passes the flag-in-making on to him, who quickly adds the finishing touches and lays it on a pile of flags on the table next to him. During the past few weeks the three of them have sewn over fifteen thousand flags says Nabil, who has been doing this for over 40 years. His profession has even landed him behind bars in an Israeli prison. ""During the first Intifada we were only producing a very small quantity of flags because it was forbidden, but when the Palestinian Authority arrived we started producing huge quantities,"" he explains. At a time when business is slow, Saeed welcomes the Palestinian authority's U.N. initiative and the public relations campaign behind it. He says it has brought him fresh business, at a time when the global economy and foreign competition has made his job more difficult than ever. ""During the second Intifada we also produced large quantities of flags, but when people started importing the flags from outside with cheaper prices, it was not that good business,"" Nabil says, remembering that he used to be able to charge the equivalent of about seven dollars for a flag. He says he would be lucky to get four dollars today. ""We used to do thousands of flags before people start importing the flags from China, it's something that affected the prices dramatically. It caused us to stop producing,"" he says. But money is not the driving factor for the flag maker, rather he is driven by the dream of finally having a Palestinian State. ""This flag that we sew and will continue to sew, we hope we will see it raised at the United Nations with the rest of the world. This is our hope, and we are sure that one day our flags will be raised in the United Nations and on every international occasion. It is a dream that is coming true, and we hope that our brothers, the Arabs, will support us,"" the flag makers say. Mahmoud, Saeed's nephew, agrees. ""Money is not the issue here, what is important is to have a state where we can live in dignity, where we can go wherever we want, where we can visit our holy places and walk our streets without having soldiers stopping us and asking for ID. This would be much better than any quantity of money. Business is important, but living in freedom and dignity is much more important,"" Mahmoud says. Yaeem Al-Heleh has been running a printing business just down the road from Saeed's flag factory since the 1980's. Cardboard boxes full of flyers, posters, and small printed flags are stacked in the corner of the room. Nearby, workers use a hot press to flatten the freshly printed flags and others print large posters adorned with the picture of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat standing next to current Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Like his friend Nabil Saeed, Al-Heleh welcomes the extra income the Palestinian statehood campaign has brought, and he too believes the dream it carries is important. ""We have been dreaming of having a state since the beginning of occupation. People were very positive towards this campaign. Here in Palestine everybody is supporting this idea. We hope to have the support from the Arab states and the whole world,"" he says. Although he, like many, sees the likelihood of Palestinian Authority success at the United Nations Security Council as very low, AL-Heleh says he is hopeful that the Palestinian push for statehood will bring change. Read what Israel's prime minister thinks about the Palestinian bid . ""The flag today has a special meaning, before we used to fight in order to raise it. The flag used to be raised and then the Israeli soldiers used to take it down and now the flag is in a way of getting sovereignty and recognition. Now 130 countries recognize us and are ready to support us, I think it's a dream that could come true,"" he says. Sitting behind his sewing machine Nabil Saeed sighs when asked whether he thinks the Palestinian Authority will succeed with its effort this month. ""If we don't succeed in September, it won't be the end and we will continue the resistance until our flag is raised everywhere. I will continue sewing the flag and I will never get bored of it. This is our flag, this is our pride and we will continue raising it all of our lives,"" he said.","Flagmaker family sees more demand for Palestinian flags .

"(CNN) -- More than 250,000 secret U.S. diplomatic cables are now available in full and unfiltered online, exposing scores of U.S. diplomatic sources and informants that were meant to be protected often for their own safety, according to the website WikiLeaks. But this is not an official WikiLeaks release. Rather, what appears to be a string of errors has lead to both the raw file and the password that unlocks that file to be released into the public domain, without WikiLeaks control. In a statement posted on Twitter, WikiLeaks said, ""Guardian investigations editor, David Leigh, recklessly, and without gaining our approval, knowingly disclosed the decryption passwords in a book published by the Guardian."" In February, Leigh released the book ""WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy."" In it, he describes in detail how WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange gave him the password to unlock the massive archive of diplomatic cables. The London-based Guardian newspaper responded to the WikiLeaks tweet with its own statement: ""It's nonsense to suggest the Guardian's WikiLeaks book has compromised security in any way. Our book about WikiLeaks was published last February. It contained a password, but no details of the location of the files, and we were told it was a temporary password which would expire and be deleted in a matter of hours. ""It was a meaningless piece of information to anyone except the person(s) who created the database. No concerns were expressed when the book was published and if anyone at WikiLeaks had thought this compromised security they have had seven months to remove the files. That they didn't do so clearly shows the problem was not caused by the Guardian's book."" So how did it happen? In November, WikiLeaks announced that it would begin releasing the diplomatic cables together with select media partners, including the Guardian, Germany's Der Spiegel, France's Le Monde and Spain's El Pais, among others. WikiLeaks now says it has more than 90 participating media and human rights partners. WikiLeaks shared both the raw file containing the cables and the password with its partners in order for them to jointly comb through the files and research their contents. Most media, including WikiLeaks, redacted the material before publishing their findings. WikiLeaks itself promised to publish all of the diplomatic cables on its website but only after vetting the documents and conducting its own ""harm minimization"" policy of removing any information that might endanger diplomatic sources and informants. However, in that process, the raw file was unwittingly posted online by WikiLeaks supporters and available for anyone to download, according to former WikiLeaks insider Daniel Domscheit-Berg. WikiLeaks often asks its supporters to help back up its website by downloading and sometimes mirroring the material it has already released. ""The people releasing the file were not aware of the password issue, and vice versa. At least that is how it appears to me,"" Domscheit-Berg told CNN. ""That's the precise sort of miscommunication that must not happen when dealing with such serious information, and one of the problems that made me and others leave the project."" The file was encrypted, so anyone downloading it would not have been able to open it without the password. Several month later however, according to WikiLeaks, the Guardian released that password. Now, anyone with access to the downloaded file and the password can see all of the unfiltered information from these cables, including protected sources. It's not clear exactly when WikiLeaks discovered the security breach. But in the last week, WikiLeaks has dramatically sped up the publication of the diplomatic cables. Before last week, the website had released less than 10% of the entire cache. As of Wednesday evening, more than 140,000 had been released, more than half of the entire cache. In a statement explaining the sudden rush to publish, WikiLeaks said it was part of its ""commitment to maximizing impact, and making information available to all"" -- inviting the public to ""crowdsource"" the files and post their findings on Twitter as a form of public journalism. WikiLeaks said Wednesday it took ""emergency action"" two weeks ago in the hopes of preventing the password from being spread. That included accelerating its publication schedule ""to get as much of the material as possible into the hands of journalists and human rights lawyers who need it."" WikiLeaks also says it contacted the U.S. State Department to warn the department of the breach. According to the statement, WikiLeaks personnel spoke for 75 minutes with a State Department legal advisor by phone, in the hope that the U.S. government would be able to warn any sources that may be put in danger by the now-public cables. State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said Thursday that ""WikiLeaks did advise us of the impending release of information and of its intention to continue to release classified documents."" ""We have made clear our views and concerns about illegally disclosed classified information and the continuing risk to individuals and national security that such releases cause,"" Nuland said. ""WikiLeaks has, however, ignored our requests not to release or disseminate any U.S. documents it may possess and has continued its well-established pattern of irresponsible, reckless, and frankly dangerous actions. We are not cooperating with them."" WikiLeaks denies it is responsible for the security breach. In an earlier Twitter posting, WikiLeaks said: ""There has been no 'leak at WikiLeaks'. The issue relates to a mainstream media partner and a malicious individual."" That was a thinly veiled referenced to the Guardian newspaper and Domscheit-Berg, the former WikiLeaks insider who now runs Openleaks, another whistle-blowing site, and who is currently embroiled in a war of words with Assange. Domscheit-Berg told CNN that he discovered the security breach ""by chance"" and alerted his media partner, the German newspaper Die Freitag. WikiLeaks blames Domscheit-Berg for directing attention to the breach and the Guardian for leaking the password. Domscheit-Berg counters that ultimate responsibility lies with WikiLeaks. ""The password should never have been shared with anyone at all,"" he said. ""This was a fixed agreement within WikiLeaks. It was not meant to be given to anyone at all. Ironically, not even I knew the password or had any access to the data. Why it had been passed on, only Julian (Assange) knows.""

"(CNN) -- Dan Wallrath was honored as a Top 10 CNN Hero last year for his efforts to build mortgage-free homes for U.S. troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. He and his group, Operation Finally Home, recently partnered with the television show ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition"" to build a house for Army Staff Sgt. Patrick Zeigler, who survived the 2009 shooting spree at Fort Hood, Texas. CNN Heroes producer Kathleen Toner recently spoke to Wallrath about the experience, which will air on ABC on Sunday night. Kathleen Toner: How was working with ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition"" different from one of your typical builds? Dan Wallrath: The biggest difference was just the magnitude of it. The first day when we had the Braveheart March, where volunteers and builders march in, that was very exciting -- getting things kicked off, just feeling the energy of all the volunteers and the folks. Video: Watch volunteers arrive at the build site . And then this house was built in about 100 hours, where normally we take about six months. When you do it in a week, you see the impact of the whole community. We had so many volunteers. It was amazing how smooth everything went. Of course on our other projects, we get to interact with the family a lot more during the construction. So we missed that. But the good part about working with the show is that the family has this amazing week where everything changes. So it's pretty exciting. Toner: Building a house in 100 hours sounds almost impossible. How did it really work? Wallrath: There were probably 4,000 or 5,000 volunteers involved, and it was a 24-hour work site. They set up floodlights and worked 'round the clock. They had to talk to the neighbors and let them know it's going to be going on 24/7, but the community was all for it. What amazed me was that meant that people were volunteering at all hours. To volunteer from midnight until 4, 5 o'clock in the morning -- when the cameras and the celebrities are not there -- that's pretty special. I'd built homes for 30 years and never seen anything like that. And we stayed ahead of schedule. I was impressed. They said that if we didn't exceed the record (for their shortest build time), we came real close. Toner: What was the moment like when the family saw the home for the first time? Did you really say the show's signature line? Wallrath: (laughs) We really did say, ""Move that bus!"" It was special. There were so many people there that day who'd helped out. It was very exciting to see the look on the faces of the young couple. It's the same look I've seen so many times when we've given away homes before -- when the young man realizes that no matter what happens to them, his family is going to be taken care of. For him, going through everything he has, to see that burden being lifted off him, it was such a joy. Toner: I hear you have plans for the empty lot next door to that home? Wallrath: We had such a good response from the community (Salado, Texas, about 30 minutes from Fort Hood), so we felt like it was the right place to put another family. We spoke to the developer that we worked with, and he gave us that lot at a very discounted price. And we've found a great couple that's going to be in this house: another wounded veteran. It'll just be great for them to have another veteran nearby. You and I can't relate to what they went through, but all of the guys tell me that when they have tough times, there's no substitute for talking to someone who's been through the same thing. Toner: And you've established a fund where people can donate to help others wounded in the Fort Hood attack. Wallrath: We're going to reach out to the other families that are all over the United States now. We're not going to be able to build homes for every one of them. But if they need wheelchair ramps, doors widened, a room added on -- that's the kind of thing that, as homebuilders, we're going to be able to do. It's so exciting to be part of it, because now all these families are not going to be forgotten. America's going to step up, and we're going to be able to help them.

"(CNN) -- Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini has said the English FA Cup winners could move for Atletico Madrid's Sergio Aguero. But Mancini suggested any move for the Argentina forward could depend on whether or not his compatriot Carlos Tevez completes a switch to Brazilian outfit Corinthians. The Italian coach said on Monday that City had agreed a fee with Corinthians for Tevez, 27, claims which were later denied by the Sao Paulo club. Any deal to take Tevez back to the team he played for between 2004-06 would need to be completed before the Brazilian transfer window closes on July 20. Copa America flops: Who is to blame? When asked about the latest on Tevez's proposed transfer, Mancini told a press conference: ""I don't know ... but they are continuing to talk about the deal."" Former Inter Milan boss Mancini moved on to discuss a potential bid for Aguero, who scored 20 league goals for Atletico last season, and he said an offer from the Etihad Stadium side could be imminent. ""At the moment I don't know,"" said Mancini when asked if a bid had already been made for the former Independiente striker. ""Maybe in the next days. At the moment I haven't spoken to Gary Cook [City's CEO] or the chairman, I don't know what has happened."" And when asked if any move for Aguero was dependent on Tevez leaving the club, the 46-year-old replied: ""Yes, I think so."" Both Tevez and Aguero were part of Sergio Batista's Argentina squad which was eliminated from the 2011 Copa America on Saturday, beaten on penalties by Uruguay at the quarterfinal stage. One player who will definitely not be at City next season is Shay Given, after the 35-year-old goalkeeper completed a move to Aston Villa. Given, who formerly spent 11 years with Newcastle United and is the Republic of Ireland's most-capped player, has signed a five-year deal with the Birmingham-based team.","Roberto Mancini has suggested Manchester City could move for striker Sergio Aguero .

"(CNN) -- Japan won the Women's World Cup for the first time on Sunday, denying the United States a record third title after twice coming from behind in the final and then winning a penalty shootout in Germany. Japan had come into the tournament as sentimental favorites, helping rally a nation that had been devastated by a March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami and nuclear disaster. For the United States, it was more a disappointment -- especially considering that the team twice relinquished leads. The U.S. conceded equalizers at the end of the regulation and extra-time periods, then Japan had a player sent off before the Americans missed their first three spot-kicks. Japan missed their third, but Saki Kumagai blasted the winner high into the net for an unassailable 3-1 lead to make her team the first from Asia to win the four-yearly soccer event. ""We lost to a great team, we really did,"" U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo told ESPN, which broadcast the game. ""I truly believe that something bigger was pulling for this team."" Japanese residents were glued to their televisions, despite the game starting around 4 a.m. local time. In one Tokyo eatery, for instances, scores adorned in the team's colors burst out in joy once their team beat the U.S. squad for the first time in 26 tries. The Japanese had won only three matches in five previous tournaments, and have never won the Asian title. Women's soccer a 'beautiful flower' for post-disaster Japan . But, despite their preparations being affected by the earthquake and tsunami that devastated their homeland in March, Japan qualified second in Group B with two wins from three matches. They then denied the hosts a third success by winning the quarterfinal 1-0 in extra-time before beating Sweden 3-1 in the semis. The U.S. had last reached the final at home in 1999, winning the tournament for the second time after triumphing in the inaugural event in China eight years before then. And Pia Sundhage's team had looked set to end that long wait wait for another trophy, dominating the first half in Frankfurt as top scorer Abby Wambach hit the underside of the crossbar with a scorching left-foot shot and Lauren Cheney headed over when unmarked. Cheney was replaced at halftime by Alex Morgan, who broke the deadlock in the 69th minute when she latched on to a long pass from Megan Rapinoe and fired in a left-foot shot that gave Japan goalkeeper Ayumi Kaihori no chance. But Japan equalized with nine minutes of regulation time left through Aya Miyama following some disastrous defending by the Americans. Wambach having a ball as she heads to World Cup final . The midfielder scored her second goal of the tournament after U.S. captain Christie Rampone uncharacteristically gave the ball away and teammates Alex Krieger and Rachel Buehler were unable to clear the resulting cross. Wambach put the U.S. in front again in the 104th minute, collecting her fourth goal in six matches at the tournament to put her second on the alltime World Cup scoring list with 13. The striker, whose extra-time equalizer against Brazil took their quarterfinal to a penalty shootout, nodded home from close range after Morgan found space down the left and provided a perfect cross. But Japan refused to give up, and Homare Sawa leveled again with a near-post flick-on from Miyama's left-wing corner that deflected into the net off Wambach. That strike was the midfielder's fifth of the tournament, earning her the golden boot award. The drama continued as Japan defender Azusa Iwashimizu was harshly sent off for fouling Morgan on the edge of the area in the final minute, but her teammates scrambled the resulting free-kick clear. The U.S. made the worst possible start to the shootout when Kaihori blocked Shannon Boxx's attempt with her trailing leg, then Miyama put Japan 1-0 ahead. Carli Lloyd skied her shot over the bar, but Hope Solo gave the Americans a chance when she saved Yuki Nagasoko's weak effort. However, Kaihori then denied Tobin Heath before Solo got her hand to Mizuho Sakaguchi's low shot but could not keep it out -- 2-0 to Japan. Wambach coolly slotted in her attempt, as she did in the shootout win over Brazil, but Kumagai clinched a famous victory. ""We made just a couple of mistakes. We let them back in the game but I still think we did well,"" Sundhage said in quotes reported by AFP. ""We had a lot of possession and played some good soccer. It's hard to lose on penalties, some go in and some go out. It's a small difference between winning and losing. We just didn't take our chances."" Japan's hero Kaihori said the whole team deserved the credit for their success. ""We have some very good players on the team and that is why we won the final. It is all down to the players in front of me, it was a team effort,"" she said. ""I got support during the shootouts because the Americans missed a couple. In a shootout, I just have to believe in myself, and I was very self-confident in that situation. I just wanted to save all those shots coming at me."" The U.S. team, meanwhile, captured the hearts of Americans for its creativity, dazzling plays and free spirit. Their white-knuckle wins kept fans engrossed and revamped interest years after the team's last win in 1999, before a packed house at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke by phone with the U.S. team Sunday before the game, wishing the players good luck and telling them that America is proud of how well they've done. ""I just got the highest hopes that this great team, which has shown such resilience, will be coming back and winning for the U.S.,"" Clinton told reporters, adding that she plans to watch the game from Greece. While the U.S. team played for bragging rights and to boost the sport's profile in their home country, Japanese players were hoping to give their citizens something to smile about after this spring's massive earthquake and tsunami. ""To be in the final is, to be honest, like a dream,"" Japanese player Homare Sawa told FIFA before the game. ""We know USA are a great and strong team, but they have weak points, too, and there's always a chance to score."" The Japanese players had won over their share of fans, with Solo of the U.S. team calling them ""the sentimental favorites"" for helping to lift the spirits of their devastated nation. ""They're playing for something bigger and better than the game,"" the American goalkeeper said in a conference call prior to the match. ""When you are playing with so much heart, that's hard to play against.""","Japan beat U.S. 3-1 in penalty shootout after Women's World Cup final ends in 2-2 draw .

"(CNN) -- It wasn't until Melissa Reese's husband allegedly put a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her that she says she decided it was time to leave her abusive relationship. She could take her belongings and kids, but her dogs were a different story. Dropping Capone and Sophie, her Alaskan Malamute and Miniature Doberman, at an animal shelter where they could be euthanized or adopted by another family was not an option. ""I couldn't give them up,"" Reese said. ""That would be like putting my children out in the cold, and I couldn't do that."" Reese said whenever her husband threatened her, Capone would squeeze in the middle and try to push him away. Her pets had protected her, and she couldn't leave them behind to become victims of her husband's wrath. So she called Ahimsa House, which placed the dogs with foster families until Reese got settled in a new home. Reese's husband later pleaded no contest to charges of simple assualt and battery. Ahimsa House -- which stands for ""nonviolence"" in Sanskrit -- is the only animal shelter in Georgia that specifically cares for pets from homes of domestic violence. In the last year, dogs, cats, birds, reptiles, livestock and horses took refuge for a combined total of 20,000 nights. In one case, the shelter took in 18 chickens. The Atlanta shelter will house a pet for as long as the owner needs. Every animal also receives a medical examination from a veterinarian. As Ahimsa House Executive Director Maya Gupta explained, pets in households with an incidence of domestic violence often have hidden injuries themselves. ""Abusers tend to be very good with their human victims in knowing exactly where to hit so that the bruises don't show -- so she can put on a long sleeve shirt or some makeup and cover them -- and to some extent, they also do that with animals,"" she said. Domestic violence against women: Recognize patterns, seek help . Perpetrators of domestic violence often harm or threaten a family pet in order to manipulate a partner and coerce him or her to stay in a relationship. As a result, 18% to 45% of battered women remain with their abuser in fear of what he may do to a pet or livestock upon leaving, according to a study by the American Bar Association. Tanya Mcleod,  an advocate against domestic violence who alleges a close relative abused her and their dog Brownie, explained that abusers realize pets provide a type of comfort for victims and use that to their advantage. ""The abuser will often make threats and say, 'If you leave I'll kill Fluffy, or I'll flush the goldfish down the toilet' -- whatever it is that will make that person stay in that relationship,"" she said. Brownie was considered a part of the family to Mcleod and her three kids. When it became clear she was giving more attention to the dog, Mcleod says the relative got jealous and abused Brownie as a way to take control. ""He would hit him, kick him, sometimes choke him,"" Mcleod recalls. ""He would tell us that we couldn't see Brownie."" The relative was never charged for abusing Brownie or Mcleod. In every state, pets are considered property under the law, and judges cannot order a person to not harm, injure or interfere with the care of a family pet. But that is changing as 21 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have enacted laws to include pets in domestic violence protection orders. MNN.com: When you have to give your pet away . Texas is the most recent state to pass a bill that will punish family violence perpetrators under protective orders who torture pets. Democratic Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis, who sponsored the bill that will go into effect September 1, said the legislation provides the opportunity for law enforcement to bring federal prosecution against abusive partners who threaten pets. Protective orders protect women against further abuse by a partner, but the same doesn't hold true for pets, Davis explained. Now that pets are included in orders, abusers will receive a misdemeanor for the first violation and felony charges upon two or more violations. Every day, thousands of pets and humans are at risk in abusive relationships, according to Phil Arkow, coordinator of the National Link Coalition, which seeks to prevent violence toward people and animals. A study by the  National Coalition Against Domestic Violence found that 71% of women entering shelters report that their batterer had injured, killed or threatened a pet to exert control over them. For many women, fleeing with their dog or cat isn't an option when only one in eight domestic violence shelters accept pets, according to the NCADV. The Houston Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Texas recognized this problem and started PetSafe -- a program to provide temporary boarding, medical care and food for pets of families escaping domestic violence. This year, the program cared for 20 pets, but the organization investigated 14,642 cases of animal abuse, neglect and cruelty in 2010, according to HSPCA spokeswoman Stacy Fox. Tips for adopting the best shelter dog . In the past few years, state representatives have been debating bills that would include pets in domestic violence protective orders. David Favre, a law professor of animal cruelty at Michigan State University, said the majority of these bills eventually pass because ""everybody can agree with the principle."" ""Who's going to stand up and say, 'No, the husband should be able to abuse the pet'?"" he said. However, Favre explained adding pets in protective order laws may not be effective since pet abusers already violate the state's animal cruelty law. ""If a man wants to inflict harm, he's not going to really be stopped by this protective order,"" he said. But after hearing stories -- in one case, a man cut off a dog's ears and sent them to his partner to get her to return -- Davis says she believes the new law will help keep women safe. ""The bill isn't about protecting the pet nearly as much as it is about protecting women, who unfortunately can be convinced to say in an abusive situation where a pet is used as basically a pawn against her emotions,"" she said. Domestic violence against men: Know the signs . What to do if your pet is being abused: . 1) First, if he's threatening the pets, you are next. Don't assume that he's bluffing. Don't make excuses. Don't think things will get better. They won't, says Phil Arkow, coordinator of the National Link Coalition. The lives of you and your children are in danger. Get out -- now! 2) Avoid bitter custody battles by making sure all of your pet's records are in your name: rabies and other shots, pet food purchases, dog or cat licenses, pedigree papers, receipts for vet bills, etc. These should all be in your name to establish that you are the caregiver. 3) Make sure your pets are current on all their licenses and vaccinations. This makes it easier to house them in an emergency shelter. 4) Pets should have an identification tag that does not have your name or home number. Use the number of a friend or the animal's veterinarian. 5) Have an emergency plan that includes your pets. If you're able to prepare for your pet's departure, try to have pet items -- including vaccination and medical records, medications, licenses, blankets, leashes, collars and pet carriers -- in a safe place where your abuser won't be able to find them. 6) Have a safe place for your pet lined up in advance such as a women's shelter that offers on-site housing or off-site foster care for pets, a trusted friend, veterinarian, kennel or animal shelter. Keep this location secret in case your abuser tries to take control of the pet in order to take control of you and your children.","18% to 45% of women remain with an abuser in fear of what he may do to a pet upon leaving .

"(CNN) -- His nickname is ""The Fever."" Mexican officials say Jose Carlos Moreno Flores was a major drug lord in charge of trafficking and operations for a large Mexican cartel in the coastal state of Guerrero, where the beach resort of Acapulco is located. According to Mexico's Ministry of Defense, Moreno Flores was caught Sunday in Mexico City's Tlalpan District. His capture is particularly important because Moreno is allegedly tied to the Sinaloa Cartel led by Joaquin ""El Chapo"" (Shorty) Guzman, Mexico's most wanted man. Guzman, who remains a fugitive, commands such a vast international drug trafficking network and his profits from the illicit trade are so big that he made Forbes Magazine's list of the world's most powerful. He appeared at number 60 on last year's list with an estimated fortune of $1 billion. The magazine calls him ""the biggest drug lord ever."" The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to the capture of Guzman. Mexico's top drug kingpin lord, who's reportedly 54, was captured in Guatemala in 1993, but escaped eight years later. Officials say Moreno Flores, who was considered one of Guzman's lieutenants, did business with drug traffickers from Costa Rica and Guatemala from his base of operations in Chilpancingo, capital of the state of Guerrero. From Chilpancingo, Moreno Flores shipped the drugs (mainly cocaine) to the United States by land. ""The Fever"" was also allegedly in charge of the cultivation, harvesting and distribution of marijuana in the fertile mountain region of Guerrero state. Violence in Chilpancingo had recently increased because a group of Sinaloa Cartel operatives led by Moreno Flores have been fighting a turf war with a rival group known as ""Los Rojos"" (The Red Ones). When he was caught, Moreno Flores was in possession of three high-caliber weapons, communication equipment and one unspecified vehicle.","Jose Carlos Moreno Flores works for a large drug cartel, Mexican officials say .

The creator, executive producer, and judge on the new vocal competition series is a guest on Tuesday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight.""

""When I watched it back at this screening we did, I got a real buzz."" Cowell, who also created ""America's Got Talent"" -- for which Morgan serves as a judge -- told Morgan that the talent on ""X Factor"" is ""crazily good.""

But so far, I'm happy."" When he left ""American Idol"" in 2010 after nine seasons as a judge, Cowell also walked away from over $100 million he could have been paid for staying put. He also invested a great deal of his own money into ""X Factor."" In addition, the ""X Factor"" prize money is an unprecedented $5 million recording contract. ""There's a lot at stake here, isn't there, for you?"" asked Morgan. ""You don't go into anything contemplating failure,"" said Cowell, ""because if you did, you wouldn't make it. If it didn't work out well, I would be really, really upset, disappointed, because I believe in it. I believe in the show, I've done the show for a long time, I do think it's the best one. I actually do. And when it works, it's fantastic. But you have to be a big boy about these things, you know? And you've got to take risks. And part of what I've loved about doing this is the risk I've taken."" Cowell told Morgan that put his ""heart and soul"" into ""X Factor,"" and pointed out some of the program's other distinguishing characteristics. ""I like the fact that there isn't an age limit,"" said Cowell. ""You're going to see a very different type of contestant."" Cowell told Morgan that when the rules for ""X Factor"" were created, they made the minimum audition age 12 and set no upper age limit whatsoever. ""Or you could be in a group,"" Cowell pointed out. ""We also kind of said it has to reflect what is happening in the music business, this show. And in the music business, a lot of people who are having hit records, they've gone through similar issues. They've had drug problems, alcohol problems, home problems -- you name it, they've had them. ""And they've normally used this to sort themselves out. And so I absolutely felt the same way. I didn't want to start putting too many rules on it. It was all about talent. Somebody wants to make their life better, they own up to what they did; I don't have an issue with that.

The attack occurred in downtown Conakry, the capital city of the West African nation early Tuesday morning and the battle lasted two hours. Authorities believe the attackers may have been soldiers with the Guinean army, said Durus Yale Dore, a government spokesman. Local reports were calling it a failed coup attempt. Conde has been the president of Guinea for less than a year. His election last year ended a two-year transition to civilian rule after a military junta took power in December 2008. Journalist Amadou Tam Camara said the attackers were heavily armed and the group had a rocket launcher.

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Seven people were killed in a series of clashes between police and suspected Kurdish militants in southeastern Turkey that sent guests at a wedding party scrambling for cover, an official said Monday. The fighting started Sunday night when suspected militants attacked four locations in the town of Semdinli, an official from the governor's office in Hakkari province told CNN. The attacks targeted the local police and military headquarters, a mountain commando unit and residences of military personnel, said the official, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak with the media. A wedding celebration nearby was caught in the crossfire. As heavy gunfire and explosions rang out, guests cried and screamed, a video from Dogan News Agency shows. Women and children in colorful dresses ran away from the dance floor, scrambling to take cover. The bride and groom also fled. Some wedding guests were wounded, the official from the governor's office said. One soldier, one police officer, three civilians and two suspected militants were killed during the clashes, the official said. Six security forces and six civilians were injured during the firefight, he said. The bloody, 26-year war between guerrilla fighters from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the Turkish state has escalated over the last month. The Kurdish separatist movement has claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks throughout the summer that have claimed the lives of more than a dozen Turkish soldiers. In August, the Turkish military retaliated, launching a wave of airstrikes and artillery barrages across the border against suspected PKK camps in the mountains of northern Iraq. The Turkish armed forces claimed to have killed more than 100 rebels in the cross-border attacks. Turkey has been fighting against the PKK since 1984. More than 30,000 people, mostly ethnic Kurds, have been killed in the conflict.","A video shows a wedding celebration caught in the crossfire .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- An Indian politician accused in U.S. diplomatic cables of sending a private jet to fetch a pair of sandals denied the allegations on Tuesday and said WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had gone ""mad."" ""I would request the government of his country to send him (Assange) to a mental asylum and if they have no space for him in his country we can put him in our mental hospital,"" Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Mayawati, who goes by one name, said at a rare news conference. Mayawati's blistering response comes a day after a U.S. cable released on WikiLeaks alleged she was a ""paranoid dictator"" and that ""when she needed new sandals, her private jet flew empty to Mumbai to retrieve her preferred brand."" ""I have no information on when the plane was sent to Mumbai for bringing sandals as has been stated by a BJP (opposition party) leader, and it looks like he and the WikiLeaks owner had gone in the same plane,"" Mayawati said. The Dalit (formerly ""untouchable"") leader is an icon for millions of low-caste Indians who were oppressed by upper caste Hindus for centuries. As the U.S. diplomatic cable explained, ""Dalits will remain with Mayawati regardless of poor governance, simply because the fact that one of their own is chief minister provides them heretofore unimaginable pride."" A member of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Mayawati became the first Dalit woman chief minister in 2007, winning elections in the country's most populous state by a majority. The controversial leader has often been criticized for her extravagance in what is one of India's poorest states. She has erected numerous enormous statues of herself across her state of Uttar Pradesh, spending more than a $1 billion dollars as a symbol of Dalit empowerment. She is often congratulated with garlands made out of 1000 rupee or $20 bank notes at her political rallies. And she's known to have a penchant for designer handbags. But according to senior political journalist and co-author of Mayawati's autobiography Ajoy Bose, the self-glorification works for her constituency. ""That's the irony. In many ways, you find victim communities tend to look at larger-than-life leaders. Dalits are a particularly oppressed community, they were never even allowed to worship the same gods, so they never had their own icons. So she has very cleverly used this to her advantage. This is not just megalomania, it also plays well with her audience. And she is not just a whimsical autocrat, she is far too successful in politics to be dismissed as that."" On Tuesday, Mayawati rejected the allegations that she was ""obsessed with becoming Prime Minister"" saying they were ""baseless"" and indicative of ""anti-Dalit mentality."" The scathing report titled ""Portrait of a Lady"" sent by U.S. diplomats in New Delhi quoted a local journalist's account of the ""Dalit Queen"" making a state minister do sit-ups as punishment for a minor error. In a paragraph titled ""Eccentric Paranoia,"" the U.S. cable reported Mayawati employs nine cooks (two to cook, the others to watch over them) and two food tasters. The U.S cables cite ""local journalists"" and Mayawati's aide Satish Mishra as sources. Mishra, a Parliament member who is also known as Mayawati's right hand man, is quoted in the cables of allegedly saying Mayawati has a ""penchant for personal corruption"" and a ""strong authoritarian streak."" Mishra denied ever meeting a U.S. official in May 2007 (the time mentioned in the cables) and threatened to take legal action. He told reporters on Tuesday, ""there is definitely some conspiracy behind it because a 2007 event is being talked about ahead of the 2012 Uttar Pradesh elections."" Bose was also surprised by the cables. ""We all know she is pretty eccentric and pretty dictatorial and she can splurge, but as far as these specific allegations are concerned, the sourcing seems to be suspect,"" Bose said. According to Bose, Mayawati has always been a very controversial leader, and for the urban middle classes who ""dislike her intensely,"" the WikiLeaks reports just confirm what they already think. As for whether these cables will affect Mayawati's political pull, Bose said: ""She hasn't done that much for the Dalits, but when your leader is attacked by a class and caste which has been seen as the oppressor, then you automatically cling to your leader even more strongly, so all of this may actually be doing Mayawati a favor.""","Mayawati denies allegations, says Assange is ""mad""

"Moscow (CNN) -- The Russian space agency on Monday postponed the launch of a new manned mission to the International Space Station due to last week's accident in which an unmanned cargo craft was lost, the state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Alexei Krasnov of the space agency, Roscosmos, said the next manned mission, originally planned to launch on September 22, now would occur in late October or early November, according to the RIA Novosti report. In the United States, NASA's space station program manager told reporters Monday that the timing of the rescheduled mission could force the temporary de-manning of the space station later this year. However, the NASA official, Mike Suffredini, said no decisions can be made until a commission appointed by Russia completes its investigation of the August 24 crash involving a Soyuz rocket -- the same kind used to power the flights of crew members to the space station. With a planned rotation of the six crew members aboard the space station scheduled to begin next month, a delay in using the Soyuz could prevent the ability to bring replacements, Suffredini said. ""If we don't have Soyuz flying by the middle of November -- the 16th or so, the normal landing time for the last crew -- we would have to de-man ISS at that point,"" Suffredini said. The six astronauts at the space station are three from Russia, two from the United States and one from Japan. Due to the schedule change announced Monday, the three Russian astronauts on board will return to Earth eight days later than originally planned, on September 16 instead of September 8, Krasnov said. They will fly a Soyuz vehicle already at the space station. Suffredini said another Soyuz vehicle at the space station, which is set to fly back the other three crew members, will have its certification for the return mission expire by mid-November. If there can't be a new manned mission from Earth by then, administrators will have to decide whether to take extensive steps to extend the vehicle's certification for the return flight, proceed on a return flight without certification, or de-man the space station by flying back the remaining crew members within the certification period, he said. ""We're going to do what's safest for the crew and for the space station,"" Suffredini said. He acknowledged that leaving the space station without any crew members increased the risk for trouble. ""There is a greater risk of losing the ISS when it's unmanned than if it were manned,"" Suffredini said, adding that the risk increase ""is not insignificant."" The commission in Russia investigating last week's accident will determine the new launch date for the next manned mission, Krasnov said, according to the RIA Novosti report. Prior to that mission, Roscosmos will make two unmanned Soyuz launches, ""either an automated one or a freighter or both,"" he said. On August 24, a Progress M-12M space freighter carrying food and other items to the space station broke up over southern Siberia after failing to separate from its Soyuz-U carrier rocket, RIA Novosti reported. It was the first loss of a Progress freighter in more than 30 years of operation, according to the report, which said the cause was believed to be a rocket engine failure. However, it was the second failed space launch in Russia in less than 10 days. On August 18, Russia lost a sophisticated Express-AM4 telecommunications satellite when the launch vehicle put it into the wrong orbit. The Progress M-12M that went down last week was to deliver more than 3.8  tons of cargo to the space station crew, including food supplies, medical equipment, personal hygiene items and scientific equipment needed for experiments, according to Roscosmos and space officials. Suffredini said Monday that space station crew is well-supplied due to the delivery of goods by the final U.S. shuttle mission carried out by Atlantis last month. NASA is now reliant on the Russian space agency to ferry U.S. astronauts to orbit, since the grounding of the U.S. shuttle fleet has left the United States with no way to lift humans into space. Plans are in the works for private companies to begin shipping cargo to the station, and eventually to carry astronauts as well.

"(CNN) -- Pakistan has been an unreliable ally of the United States in the war against al Qaeda and other extremist organizations, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden told CNN in an interview set to air in full Monday night. Biden, who spoke to CNN's John King on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, said Pakistan has failed ""on occasion"" when forced to choose between the United States and al Qaeda. The price of Pakistan's choices has been the ""loss of life of American soldiers in Afghanistan,"" the vice president said. Islamabad has ""been very helpful in other times,"" he added. ""But it's not sufficient. They have to get better. We need a relationship that is born out of mutual interest. And it's in their interest that they be more cooperative with us."" ""We are demanding it,"" he said. Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in May. Pakistan's government -- which has struggled with significant pro-al Qaeda sentiment within its borders -- was not informed of the attack beforehand. Pakistani authorities insist they did not know bin Laden's location. Despite troubles in Pakistan and elsewhere, the United States is ""getting close"" to bringing about an end to organized, legitimized terrorist activities, Biden said. ""We have done great damage to ... al Qaeda,"" he said. ""Satellite organizations"" have emerged in Somalia and elsewhere, he said, but ""they are less coordinated"" and ""less capable."" ""And we're relentless in pursuing them,"" he added. As a result, Americans are safer today than they were a decade ago, Biden asserted. Regardless, the vice president cautioned that ""there is always a possibility of a lone wolf"" attack within the United States or elsewhere. ""There's always a possibility of an incident occurring, but I do not believe there's anyone right now capable of putting together the kind of extremely complicated planned operation that took place on 9/11,"" he said. Biden said he believes that in 25 years, Americans will ""read about this period of terror as ... a part of a chapter in the history of this country."" The vice president denied former Vice President Dick Cheney's assertion that controversial interrogation techniques such as waterboarding -- stopped by the Obama administration -- would help generate useful intelligence in the war against al Qaeda and other organizations. ""I've seen zero evidence that it works, and I think there's abundant evidence that it hurts us internationally. It hurts our security,"" Biden said. It does so, he said, ""by making a mockery of who we say we are and giving rationale for those who want to do us harm to recruit people.""","U.S. Vice President Joe Biden tells CNN Pakistan has not been a reliable ally .

"(CNN) -- A trip to Iran to learn more about her family's ancestry became a nightmare for American journalist Roxana Saberi. In January 2009, several men showed up at the Iranian-American's door and carted her off to Evin Prison, the notoriously brutal lockup outside Tehran where three American hikers were recently imprisoned. Like Josh Fattal, Sarah Shourd and Shane Bauer, Saberi was accused of being a spy for the U.S. Like them, she denied the accusation. Iran tried, convicted and sentenced Saberi to eight years. But, to her shock, she was freed after 100 days. She returned to the U.S. in May 2009. On Wednesday, Fattal and Bauer were freed after two years at Evin. Shourd was released last year. CNN talked with Saberi about the advice she would give the hikers and about her experience at Evin. CNN: Did you ever hope that you might be set free, even after your sentence? Roxana Saberi: I didn't think I was going to be set free after being sentenced to eight years. When they said I was going to be freed, I was in disbelief, very happy disbelief. CNN: You wrote in your book that about gaining a unique kind of mental clarity and toughness. Saberi: I learned over time, especially from my cellmates, that things happen to you, and you can't control them. All you can control is your response to them. In prison, you cannot control your physical environment. CNN: You can say that, but to actually live that way under those circumstances is another thing. You were interrogated for days on end. Saberi: (The interrogators) were mostly harsh and threatening, but then they would say, ""Oh, are you hungry? Do you want us to make comfortable? Do you want some tea or some water?"" I think it was partly to mess with the person's mind. My cellmates, the women who were prisoners, they are the strong ones. There were times when I was angry and told myself that I hate the sin and not the sinner. I had to learn from my cellmates, who were in prison much longer. I asked them, ""How do you not hate these people for doing this to you?"" (Saberi says she nurtured relationships with other prisoners by teaching them English. Many were at Evin for believing in Baha'i, a monotheistic faith believers are persecuted for in Iran.) Saberi: These prisoners told me, ""We don't hate (the guards), but we forgive them,"" which was incredible to me. I tried hard to hate the sin and not the sinner. ... I realized we are all human beings, and (the prison workers) do their jobs to have job security. They get paid for it. Some of them do believe in the ideology, and some don't. If our captors, I believe, were raised in a different environment, they wouldn't do what they do. But I really got a lot of strength from other prisoners. We taught each other jokes in our different languages. I taught them vocabulary that had to do with shopping and English curse words. We exercised. CNN: How did you exercise? Saberi: Sit-ups, push-ups in our cell. We were allowed to go outside four times a day, escorted by guards who pushed and tugged at the chadors we had to wear. The guards would take us to a cement cage -- the walls, all cement and bars. Overhead them, at least you could see sky. CNN: When the guards were marching you back and forth, did you say anything to them? Did they speak to you? Saberi: They mostly didn't say anything. (But) a female guard -- she was older -- reached under my chador and grabbed my hand and squeezed it. CNN: Did you see any other humanity like that in your guards? Saberi: There was humanity in some of them, in this female guard. She seemed to be trying to tell me that everyone would be OK. Toward me, the guards were mostly civil. I did see them yelling at other prisoners. I assume that because I was a foreigner, and Iranians say they are kind to foreigners. We tried to learn more about the women guards, because they would stop by our cells when they were giving us food. They were very tight-lipped and were instructed not to say much about themselves. We got tidbits about their lives. One had kids, and one had a nose job; this kind of plastic surgery is very popular in Iran. They had the same values -- caring about how they looked -- like other women would have. But I didn't get that close with any of them. They don't allow it. CNN: Tell me more about how you kept sane, especially in solitary confinement. How did you even keep track of time? Saberi: Well, I thought I was going crazy. I was in solitary for more than two weeks; then I was sent to a cell that had state-run TV playing so I could see the time. I could hear the call to prayer and see sun rays cast on the cell walls and floors. CNN: Can you describe what solitary confinement was like? Saberi: It was dark. I could hold my hands out and touch two walls. There was ratty brown carpet. There was a broke toilet. A military blanket. A sign on the wall quoted (founder and supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran Ayatollah) Khomeini said, ""Prisons must be colleges for human improvement."" There was a window on the ceiling out of reach that was covered with metal mesh and bars. On the other side of my wall, I heard a prisoner whimpering. I was very worried, because no one knew where I was. (Saberi wrote in her memoir ""Between Two Worlds: My Life and Captivity in Iran"" that only after many days did Iranian authorities allow her to call her father. They forced her to lie to him in saying that she didn't know where she was and that she was in trouble for drinking alcohol.) I tried to keep my sanity by singing songs like Christmas carols and ""We Will Rock you,"" and I played notes with my fingers on the wall. I kept saying things that gave me courage like Gandhi's ""I do believe I am seeking only God's truth and have lost all fear of man."" CNN: When you were let out of solitary, what happened? Saberi: They put me in another cell. CNN: And you were held for four months. What did you think when news came last week when the Iranian president said that Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer were going to be released? And what did you think when they were freed Wednesday? Saberi: In Iran, you never believe it until you see it. I thought about their families. CNN: You've talked to their families before. Saberi: I could relate to how worried they were. My parents were in a similar situation. I wanted to comfort them and to explain what prison was like for me. CNN: What would you say to Josh and Shane now? Saberi: I'd like to hear from them how their situation was. I hope that they are able to adapt well in this new part of their life and perhaps learned lessons in prison that can help them when they're free. I would tell them to take their time and not feel pressured to make decisions. This is their time. It's theirs again.","Iranian-American Roxana Saberi was detained in January 2009 .

"(CNN) -- An international human rights monitor urged Haitian authorities to bring former dictator Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier to justice for alleged human rights abuses committed during his 15-year rule. Amnesty International published a new report Thursday with evidence of arbitrary detentions, torture, deaths in custody, killings and disappearances of Haitians from 1971 to 1985 when Duvalier was in power. Amnesty said the abuse was systematic and widespread under Duvalier's iron-fisted rule. ""Neither the passage of time nor immunity from prosecution can be used as excuses for not investigating or prosecuting those responsible for such crimes, including Jean-Claude Duvalier himself,"" the report said. Duvalier stunned the world by returning to Haiti in January. He had been living in exile in France. After Duvalier's return to Port-au-Prince, Haitian authorities reopened a 2008 corruption and embezzlement case against him based on allegations that he stole hundreds of millions of dollars from the national treasury. Amnesty International as well as other human rights groups want Haitian authorities to also bring Duvalier to trial for his alleged brutality. Amnesty gave the Port-au-Prince public prosecutor 100 documents that it said detailed cases of human rights violations. ""What is needed is political will from Haiti's new administration to comply with their international obligations and their duty to the survivors and victims of abuses,"" said Javier Zuniga, a special advisor at Amnesty International. ""The cases of human rights abuses we documented in Haiti are likely to be only a small proportion of what really happened during Duvalier's rule,"" Zuniga said. ""We will probably never know the true extent of the horror, but carrying out effective investigations will go a long way towards delivering justice."" Amnesty International's documents tell the experiences of cobblers, taxi drivers, filmmakers, mechanics, distillers and even hairdressers, all of whom, they say, were arrested for anti-government activity. Among the testimonies is that of Evans Paul, a journalist who was arrested in October 1980 at the Port-au-Prince airport. He was returning from New York after interviewing the exiled former Haitian President Paul Eugene Magloire. He was several journalists arrested for subversion, according to Amnesty International. ""Several people with sticks ... gave me a severe beating,"" Paul told the organization. ""A man ... pushed a long stick behind my legs and arms. I was like a ball. I felt as my body was going to break everywhere. At that point I was beaten with sticks. At one point I felt as though I were going to die. They gave me something to drink. Then they started again even worse. The skin on my buttocks had been torn away. The blood was running down. They weren't put off. On the contrary, you could say that the sight of my blood excited them even more. When I was on the point of dying, they untied me and dragged me to a dark cell. You couldn't see anything."" He was later released without charge. Gerard Duclerville, a Catholic lay activist, was arrested in December 1982. Duclerville told Amnesty that he was interrogated about his radio show. ""They jacked me up and started raining blows on me with a baton ... I must have been hit 70 times with the baton. At some point I felt it was too much for me and I couldn't stand any more. I said to them, 'You guys, instead of torturing me like that, it would be better if you just killed me and get it over with...'"" He was released without charge and needed treatment in a hospital, including skin grafts. He was lucky. Others died in custody, Amnesty said. Still others ""disappeared,"" never to be seen again. Michele Montas, a journalist and former spokeswoman for the United Nations secretary-general, said she endured threats and detention and survived an assassination attempt for her journalism. The staff at the independent radio station of her husband, Jean Dominique, was harassed and the station was shut down during Duvalier's rule, she said. She was expelled from the country in 1980 and returned only after Duvalier's ouster. ""We have enough proof,"" she told CNN in January. ""There are enough people who can testify."" Dominique was slain in 2000. His daughter Nadine Dominique is one of the organizers of a Duvalier victims' group in Quebec, Canada. ""We were shocked when we heard the news that he had returned to Haiti,"" said Nadine Dominique. ""We all felt so strongly that we had to help bring him to justice, because without that, the Haitian people will never fully heal. You cannot move on without that closure."" With the release of its report, Amnesty International urged Haiti's new president, Michel Martelly, to take swift action. ""Haiti's current government led by President Michel Martelly has an obligation under international law to bring to justice those responsible for the crimes against humanity committed during Duvalier's years,"" Zuniga said. CNN attempts to reach Martelly for comment were unsuccessful. Duvalier told reporters in January that he returned to Haiti to help with rebuilding the country after last year's devastating earthquake. In May, he was living with his companion Veronique Roy in a friend's hilltop home in a plush Port-au-Prince neighborhood. He took over Haiti at the young age of 19 -- then the youngest leader in the world -- but at 59, looked infirm beyond his years. He has since turned 60. He agreed to speak about all the allegations against him but in the end, CNN never heard back from him.","Amnesty International documents cases of abuse under Jean-Claude Duvalier's rule .

"(CNN)  -- Cycling superstar Mark Cavendish will be riding for a new team next year after the collapse of HTC-Highroad, but gave no clues Friday to his eventual destination. The sprinter took his tally of Tour de France stage victories to 20 with five wins on this year's race amid continued speculation he was going to jump ship to British-based Team Sky. He said this week that he would make public his decision within a month, but then HTC-Highroad owner Bob Stapleton announced Thursday that the team would fold because they could not find a sponsor for 2012. Cavendish, who has been with the team for five years, was quick to pay tribute to them on his personal website. ""I am obviously very disappointed that HTC-Highroad will no longer be a team at the end of this season,"" he said. ""I am hugely indebted and incredibly grateful to my teammates and all the staff for their support over the last five years and I am immensely proud of what we have achieved together."" But the Manxman, who claimed the green jersey for the first time in this year's Tour de France, would still not reveal where he was headed. ""A number of teams have expressed interest in me riding for them in 2012,"" he added. ""I have now made a decision I am happy with and will be in a position to discuss my intentions once everything has been finalized."" Team Sky, who boast his fellow British Olympic teammates Bradley Wiggins and Geraint Thomas, remain the favorites to get his coveted signature, but Cavendish has also been linked with new Australian team GreenEdge. They announced Friday the signing of world pursuit record holder Jack Bobridge and brothers Cameron and Travis Meyer, three of the most promising riders in cycling as they add to their 2012 roster. But they will do well to match the achievements of the soon to be defunct HTC-Highroad, who have been the most successful team in the professional peloton with their men's and women's teams achieving nearly 500 victories over five years.","Mark Cavendish heading for new team after HTC-Highroad fold .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Fighting that raged for hours in Kabul Tuesday afternoon after a dramatic Taliban attack on the U.S. Embassy and NATO's command calmed down greatly during the evening hours, a military spokesman told CNN . But the strike in central Kabul and two other brazen assaults across the city left residents unnerved, and security forces braced for more. Gunfire continued to ring out. Three police officers have died and others have been injured in the violence across Kabul, police said. The Afghan Public Health ministry said one civilian was killed and at least 18 were wounded, but none seriously. The central Kabul strike occurred amid intelligence that insurgents might launch a high-profile attack in the capital around the 10th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States, a coalition officer and a senior official of NATO's International Security Assistance Force confirmed to CNN. The strike directed at the ISAF headquarters and the embassy was the most dramatic. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told CNN that his group targeted ""the U.S. Embassy, governmental organizations and other foreign organizations."" Militants stormed a building under construction and set up positions there to launch the attack, U.S., ISAF and Afghan officials said. ISAF said the insurgents attacked the ""vicinity"" of the embassy and the ISAF headquarters using small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. An ISAF official said there were initial reports that some rounds hit the NATO base and caused minor damage. Brig. Gen. Carsten Jacobson, spokesman for ISAF, said a small number of ""terrorists"" used high-elevated positions around the area to strike with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms. He said the group failed to inflict ISAF and U.S. casualties but he noted the strike was ""carefully planned."" A senior ISAF official said the attacks were launched from an area outside the secure zone surrounding both areas. ISAF said Afghan National Security Forces and coalition forces immediately were sent to the scene. Coalition forces were providing air support. The Afghan Interior Ministry said four suicide attackers entered the building site from which the attack was being carried out. Three of them have been killed, it said. CIA Director David Petraeus, testifying at a congressional hearing in Washington Tuesday, said Afghan forces were clearing the building. The building is next to Abdul Haq Square, a few blocks from the U.S. Embassy, an intelligence officer told CNN. An embassy spokeswoman said staff at the U.S. facility had been told to take cover. ""The U.S. Embassy can confirm an attack has occurred in the area of the U.S. Embassy"" by people armed with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms, spokeswoman Kerri Hannan said. She said four Afghans -- three visa applicants and a local contract guard -- were hurt in the attack on the embassy compound, but none had life-threatening injuries. ""Our thoughts are with these individuals and the other victims of the terrorist attacks that happened today in Kabul. We appreciate the response of the Afghan National Security Forces whose operations stopped the attack on the embassy compound,"" Hannan said. A U.S. Embassy worker, who asked not to be named for security reasons, called the assault ""well-coordinated"" and said there was incoming fire around every corner of the building. After a few hours of loud and intense fire, he said, the situation appeared to calm down. He said the people at the embassy were well-protected by the guards there. ISAF's Jacobson also said the situation calmed down by early evening. Pentagon spokesman George Little said the attacks were ""less than spectacular"" and despite their high-profile nature ""one of the things we're seeing this fighting season is a less effective insurgency."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said there were no reports of U.S. casualties and the country ""will take all necessary steps"" to secure the area and keep personnel safe. She said the ""dedicated, brave men and women"" from the United States who work for the Afghan people ""will not be intimidated"" by this cowardly act. Central Kabul is considered a high-security area, and it is protected by police and other security forces. ISAF said that it doesn't appear insurgents breached the sector around the sites. ISAF personnel currently were told to stay indoors and take cover but there are no casualties, the official said. Gen. John Allen, ISAF commander, remains on the compound, ISAF said. The Afghan National Directorate of Security and the Interior Ministry spokesman said the insurgents were using rocket-propelled grenades and light weapons. A hospital official said two injured civilians were being treated and the hospital expected to handle more casualties. The area was cordoned off, according to Gen. Mohammed Zahir, the head of criminal investigation for the Afghan police. The coalition and ISAF officials pointed out that while this attack is considered to be high-profile because of the U.S. Embassy and ISAF targets, it so far is not considered a ""spectacular"" attack because of the small number of gunmen and limited weapons involved. Other violence also was reported. In a Twitter message, ISAF said a ""suicide attacker was identified & killed by ANP before reaching target near Kabul airport,"" making reference to the Afghan National Police. There were no further details. The Taliban said a suicide attack targeted a police compound in the western part of the city, but the Interior Ministry said the attacker -- clad in an explosives vest -- was shot before he entered the compound. Another attacker set off a bomb in front of a high school, the ministry said. Casualties were reported in both incidents. The U.S. Embassy issued an emergency message about the series of attacks across Kabul Tuesday, saying ""the situation is uncertain and ongoing. There are media reports that many roads are closed in Kabul."" It said appointments for visas or U.S. citizen services have been canceled for now and it said Americans in Afghanistan should monitor the websites of the embassy and the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs for the latest information. ""We urge U.S. citizens to shelter in place, avoid unnecessary movement, and to avoid the neighborhood around the U.S. Embassy: Wazir Akbar Khan, Microrayon, and Massoud Circle,"" it said. ""The Embassy also urges U.S. citizens to remain vigilant and avoid areas where Westerners congregate. Do not discuss travel plans or other personal matters with strangers, or in public. Be alert and aware of your surroundings, and always travel with mobile phones or appropriate communication equipment."" The attacks by the Taliban continue what has been a violent period. Over the weekend, two Afghan laborers were killed while 77 U.S. troops and 25 Afghan workers were wounded in a Taliban truck bombing on an ISAF base in Afghanistan's Wardak province. Last month, Taliban suicide bombers killed at least eight people in Kabul when they attacked the British Council, a British-government-affiliated body that fosters cultural and academic exchanges. The Taliban harbored the al Qaeda network that launched the 9/11 strike. A U.S.-led coalition toppled the Taliban and has been fighting militants in Afghanistan for nearly 10 years. NATO is drawing down and handing over security control to national forces. Some 10,000 U.S. troops are scheduled to depart by year's end, with all U.S. military personnel out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Vygaudas Usackas, head of the European Union mission in Afghanistan, were among those who condemned the attacks. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the Taliban attacks in Kabul Tuesday were an attempt to derail plans to hand over security responsibility to Afghan forces in Afghanistan. ""We are witnessing that the Taliban try to test (the) transition but they can't stop it. Transition is on track and it will continue,"" Rasmussen said. CNN's Joe Sterling in Atlanta, Barbara Starr, Adam Levine and Elise Labott in Washington and Tim Schwarz, Matiullah Mati, Ruhullah Khaplakwak and Suzanne Malveaux in Kabul contributed to this report.","NEW: Four Afghans are injured at the embassy, a spokeswoman says .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea this week returned to London as newly-crowned champions of the fifth Barclay's Asia Cup in Hong Kong. Taking on two other English teams as well as Kitchee, the Hong Kong champions, the English Premier League's runners-up last season used the competition to put the finishing touch on a summer of preparation, and to raise the club's profile in this part of the world. In truth, the outcome was never seriously in doubt, despite the presence of Premier League opponents Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers. Such is the financial muscle of a moneyed group of clubs, who include Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City, the rest of England's top flight increasingly seem to exist to make up the numbers. Manchester City used to be in this latter group, before a massive cash injection from billionaire Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of Abu Dhabi's ruling family, catapulted City into football's big time. However, the club is hemorrhaging money, as a sky-high wage bill coupled with the payment of exorbitant transfer fees exceeds what it actually earns in ticket sales, sponsorship and other commercial deals. But as long as their wealthy benefactor's largesse continues and success accompanies it, neither the owners nor the fans particularly mind. Chelsea also has a rich owner, Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who made headlines in 2003 by purchasing the club outright and declaring that they would immediately be a force to be reckoned with. The London club certainly look like contenders this season if last weekend's performance is any indication -- no goals conceded in four matches held across three countries - but their impact off the field is most eye-catching. Chelsea played in front of 85,000 fans in Malaysia, while another packed stadium greeted them in Hong Kong when they faced Villa in the Asia Cup final. That's tens of thousands of Asian-based fans buying tickets and merchandise such as replica shirts as they lapped up a rare opportunity to watch their heroes in the flesh. Not a bad little earner. Gate receipts for the Barclay's Asia Trophy totaled almost HK$20 million over the two days, according to the Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA), but local organizer ProEvents Management says that the tournament's use is much wider -- as a vehicle for promoting the Premier League brand. ""The issue of whether it makes money isn't the issue,"" says Paul Kam, Chairman of ProEvents. ""It is a very important market for the clubs. The benefits are long term."" It is a sentiment echoed by Chelsea's new man. ""It would be unreasonable for us not to do preseasons like this and not touch the amount of fans that we have,"" André Villas-Boas, newly installed manager at the club, told CNN ahead of the tournament. ""We have to respect [both] our commercial activities and the football planning, and at this moment we have been balancing it properly."" Fans in Asia seem to be grateful that the League's big guns are concentrating on this region. ""It's the first time I've seen them play and it was a great experience,"" says Eric Yiu, a Hong Kong fan who started supporting Chelsea three years ago. ""I was lucky, a friend gave me tickets."" Hong Kong is not exactly an undeveloped market for the England's Premier League. In 2006 cable operator PCCW paid HK$1.56 billion (US$200million) for the broadcast rights to Premier League games. The casual Hong Kong fan is likely more familiar with the star names at Chelsea and their counterparts at other high-flying clubs than they are with local professionals. Expanding a support base is set to become even more important for clubs. The sport's European governing body, UEFA, seeks to impose punitive measures on clubs who fail to balance their books. Beginning in the 2012-13 season, the Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules stress that income should be earned from football-related activities and are designed to straiten those clubs who operate outside of normal profit-and-loss structures. Clubs found guilty of breaking FFP rules will be banned from European competition -- a huge disincentive given the popularity, prestige and profile that playing in the UEFA Champion's League brings. Cynics will point out that accounting sleights of hand will essentially render FFP rules meaningless. Newly-wealthy Manchester City, for example, recently announced a stadium naming rights deal with Etihad, the airline wing of their own parent company, Abu Dhabi United Group. The club's Chief Executive, Garry Cook, said the deal was ""one of the most important arrangements in the history of world football."" At $US 651M, the 10-year arrangement is far outside the market price for similar naming rights and it has been suggested that this, amongst other, equally creative ways of getting money into the club provides clubs like City with a loophole to avoid FFP stricture. The club's rivals, including Arsenal's outspoken manager Arsene Wenger, have cried foul of the deal, which Wenger describes as part of City's ongoing ""financial doping,"" giving some teams an unfair advantage over their less wealthy opponents. ""The credibility of financial fair play is at stake,"" Wenger said at the time of the deal's announcement. ""The backdrop is UEFA's Financial Fair Play and this helps to make significant progress in that area,"" Cook said when announcing the sponsorship deal. ""This is not just a wide-ranging agreement. It is a long-term commitment."" UEFA are currently looking into the case to determine its legitimacy and they may yet not avoid censure. English football is now a global concern, with teams from the top tier jetting across the globe, trying to pry open new, lucrative markets -- clubs looking to export the passion and excitement of English football to a new, enthusiastic audience. As the playing field soon looks to be leveled, it looks likely that these foreign forays will become even more important to teams looking to stay onside of UEFA's rules.","Cash injections from rich owners increasingly dictates the performance of English Premier League clubs .

"United Nations (CNN) -- Libya's interim prime minister said on Tuesday that he expects the county to have a new government within 10 days. Mahmoud Jibril, head of the National Transitional Council's executive board, spoke at a Group of Eight conference on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. ""I expect the government to be announced within a week, 10 days maximum from now ... most of the work has been done,"" he said. ""I think this government, when formed, will help tremendously, bring about stability and order in Tripoli and the rest of the country. Therefore, I am not bothered by the time we are consuming to bring about some sort of national consensus behind this government."" Jibril said negotiations include discussion of the number of ministries the new government will have and where they will be located. Earlier Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated Libya's transitional leadership on the apparent success of that country's revolution, ushering in a post-Gadhafi era for the North African nation as part of the international body. ""For Libya, this is a historic day,"" said Ban, who directed that the country's new flag be presented alongside the U.N. flag amid a standing ovation from those in attendance. The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to accept the credentials of the country's new leadership after rebels last month all but ousted Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi after more than four decades in power. ""I am sure you saw your new flag this morning, flying so proudly outside this building,"" the U.N. chief said. The rebuilding of Libya and the Palestinian quest for statehood are expected to be the dominant topics this week as world leaders converge on the United Nations in New York for the 66th annual session of the General Assembly. On Tuesday, Ban met with Mustafa Abdul Jalil -- head of Libya's ruling National Transitional Council -- to discuss the deployment of a support mission to be run by British diplomat and U.N. envoy Ian Martin. The mission is thought to largely center on post-conflict planning, with particular focus on security-building and electoral assistance. But American participation, the U.N. chief says, is instrumental in supporting the new government, noting challenges facing transitional leadership as it confronts pockets of resistance and the specter of Gadhafi, who remains at large. U.S. President Barack Obama vowed to continue to protect Libyan civilians for as long as they remained threatened by the former regime, pledging to reopen the American embassy in Tripoli later this week. ""Six months ago, as his tanks approached Benghazi, Gadhafi predicted that his opponents would be slaughtered like rats,"" said U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague. ""But he had not counted on the courage of the Libyan people, the principled stand of the Arab League and the resolve of the international community."" Hague said he sought to send to a clear message to the former dictator and his remaining supporters that ""their time is up,"" adding that the unfreezing of Libyan assets will help pay for the country's critical services. Tuesday's Libya summit at the U.N. General Assembly was billed as an event designed to give world leaders a chance to figure out ways to help Libya rebuild from the battle against their former leader. The meeting was in stark contrast to two years ago, when Gadhafi gave a rambling General Assembly address where he floated conspiracy theories, urged probes into U.S. military activities and took aim at the structure of the Security Council itself. Meanwhile, the international body also focused on what it described as an alarming increase in global desertification, and wrapped a two-day meeting on noncommunicable diseases, now the world's leading killer. It is only the second time a health issue has been debated at a special meeting of the General Assembly, following the group's pledge to take on AIDS a decade ago. Delegates unanimously approved a ""political declaration"" on Monday, addressing illnesses including cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung diseases and diabetes in developing countries, which often struggle with limited budgets and overwhelmed health care systems. Also on the plate of U.N. activities this week is an expected address from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who will take the podium Thursday to address recent changes in the Middle East. His visit marks the seventh time the Iranian president has traveled to New York since he took office in 2005. Ahmadinejad told Iranian state media on Monday that the U.N. must meet the international community's ""real demands,"" raising questions as to whether the Iranian leader will broach the issue of Palestinian statehood, a lightning-rod topic and the subject of much diplomatic wrangling. The U.S. has pledged to block a Palestinian membership application should it reach the Security Council, but is likely eager to head-off a scenario that would involve an American veto -- a move widely seen as unpopular in the Middle East. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has, however, seemed largely undeterred. In a speech Friday that appeared both an attempt to manage domestic expectations and push the statehood issue, the Palestinian leader told an audience in Ramallah, ""We are going to the United Nations to attain full membership."" He has said the Palestinian territories should be represented by their ""natural borders"" -- with Israel remaining within its 1967 boundaries, which would afford Palestinians the Gaza strip, East Jerusalem and the West Bank. He called disputed territories inhabited by Israeli settlers ""illegal."" On Friday, the body will address the controversial bid. Abbas is scheduled to speak, and has said after he gives that speech, he will deliver a formal membership application to the U.N. secretary-general. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes the measure, is scheduled to speak later in the day and has called the move provocative and pushed for a return to the negotiating table. The Palestinian territories currently have ""observer"" status, meaning delegates can speak in the General Assembly but not vote. A ""yes"" vote in the General Assembly -- where only a majority vote would be needed -- could afford Palestinians with the status of ""permanent observer,"" similar to the position the Vatican currently holds. A vote in their favor would be all but assured, meaning they could pursue legal actions against Israel, though analysts suggest that the elevated status could prematurely raise expectations for change in the region. Hamas, the Palestinian organization that controls Gaza, has warned Abbas against making the request, saying it would show a willingness to acknowledge and negotiate with Israel, which would ""deprive the Palestinian people from their right to come back to their homeland."" The five permanent members of the Security Council are the United States, China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom. The General Assembly, the U.N.'s main policy-making body, has 193 member nations.

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- Norway's nightmare lasted just over three hours, all in the middle of a summer afternoon. Authorities are still trying to piece together exactly what happened last Friday -- and, perhaps as significantly, why. But they have offered a timeline as to how the bloodshed began in central Oslo and then continued 20 miles away, at a political youth camp on Utoya island. While police have not officially named him, they have arrested a man who has been identified in local and national media reports as Anders Behring Breivik, 32. A manifesto, purportedly written by a man of that name and posted online the day of the attacks, signals his intent to be part of a ""European civil war"" and his distaste for Norway's leadership. Here is a chronological recap of last week's violence that left at least 93 people dead across the two sites, compiled from statements and interviews of police, witnesses and government officials: . 3:20 p.m.: An fertilizer bomb explodes outside government offices in central Oslo, near the Norwegian parliament and the offices of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg. The government's leader is not present at the time of the blast. At least seven people are killed. Sometime thereafter, the suspect in the bombing takes a 3/4-mile ferry ride on Tyrifjorden -- Norway's fifth-largest lake -- to Utoya island. The 26-acre island, about 20 miles from central Oslo, is hosting a youth camp run by the Labour Party. About 700 teens and young adults are attending the camp, and are gathered in a large meeting room where camp organizers share information about the bombing in Oslo. A man dressed in an apparent police uniform asks to address the group, but instead opens fire. The suspect walks around the camp shooting people. Some try to hide or plunge into the water, while others are picked up by boaters passing by and brought to safety. But at least 86 are killed in the attack, according to authorities. 5:27 p.m.: A local police station, situated near Utoya, is alerted. 5:30 p.m.: Authorities in Oslo, home to the national police headquarters, become aware of the youth camp shooting for the first time. 5:38 p.m.: Local police near Utoya request assistance from other law enforcement agents in the Norwegian capital. 5:52 p.m.: Several local police arrive on the lakefront near Utoya. 6:03 p.m.: The first police depart for the island in a boat. 6:09 p.m.: Members of an elite Norwegian police unit arrive on the shore. 6:25 p.m.: These specially trained forces land on the island. 6:27 p.m.: The gunman does not put up a fight as he is taken into custody on the island by the police unit.","An explosion rocked government offices in central Oslo on Friday afternoon .

"(CNN) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter has denied reports that he plans to hand over power to UEFA chief Michel Platini before the end of his final four-year tenure as the head of world football's governing body. Blatter, 75, was elected unopposed for a fourth term in June after allegations of bribery and corruption led to the suspension of his sole opponent -- the former head of the Asian Football Confederation, Mohamed Bin Hammam of Qatar. Former France international Platini was voted in for a second term as head of European football's ruling body in March, and also serves as a FIFA vice-president. A report from ESPN on Tuesday claimed a deal had been struck between Blatter and Platini which would see the former European Footballer of the Year assume FIFA's top job in two years. ""The existence of a reported 'deal' between me and Michel Platini for the FIFA Presidency is pure nonsense,"" Blatter wrote on his official account on social networking site Twitter. ""The suggestion that I intend to stop my four-year mandate before its end is simply ridiculous."" It has been a troubled 12 months for FIFA, with officials Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii both receiving bans from the organization in November 2010. Nigeria's Adamu and Temarii of Tahiti were accused of offering to sell their votes during the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Adamu's appeal against his three-year ban will be heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on October 4. Bin Hammam, who was Asian president when Qatar was awarded the 2022 tournament, was then suspended in May and subsequently handed a lifetime ban from football for allegedly offering bribes in exchange for support in June's presidential ballot. The 62-year-old denies the charges and his appeal hearing against the ban will be heard on Thursday.","Sepp Blatter denies a plot to hand over FIFA presidency to Michel Platini .

"Maumelle, Arkansas (CNN) -- A man whose naked body was found next to a sleeping TV weatherman in an unfilled tub earlier this month died from asphyxiation, authorities said Thursday, but there was ""no indication"" he was strangled. Maumelle, Arkansas, police Lt. Jim Hansard noted that the medical examiner cited other contributing factors in 24-year-old Dexter Williams' death, including intoxication with methamphetamine and amphetamines. Police said the investigation remains open and there is ""no indication (from the medical examiner) in any way that there was a strangulation,' and the manner of death remains 'undetermined."" Police say Williams' body was discovered September 5 in a hot tub with former TV meteorologist Brett Cummins. Cummins, 33, has not been charged in the case. He has since resigned from KARK-TV in Little Rock. The owner of the home, Christopher Barbour, found Williams' body at the bottom of an empty tub, his face blue and purple and a chain resembling a dog collar around his neck, according to a Maumelle police report. Maumelle police will soon turn the case over to the Pulaski County Prosecutor's Office, which will determine whether any charges will be filed.","Dexter Williams died of asphyxiation, medical examiner rules .

"(CNN) -- Rangers scored three second-half goals to beat Celtic 4-2 in Glasgow's Old Firm Derby Sunday and go four points clear in the Scottish Premier League. In-form Steven Naismith fired Rangers ahead with a thumping strike after 22nd minutes but Celtic were quick to level through Gary Hooper's well-worked goal 12 minutes later. Celtic took the lead just before halftime as Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor allowed a weak shot from Moroccan Badr El Kaddouri to elude his grasp and trickle into the net. But Nikica Jelavic headed Rangers level seven minutes after the interval and they were ahead when Kyle Lafferty converted after 67 minutes. Mulgrew, who was fortunate to escape with just a yellow card for his first half challenge, then saw red in the 75th minute and Naismith took advantage against 10 men to score the fourth and his second in injury time. ""I didn't think there was an awful lot between the teams in the first-half. I'm not sure we deserved to go in 2-1 down but that's what we were faced with,"" Rangers manager Ally McCoist told Sky Sports. ""We asked the boys for a reaction in the second-half and boy did we get it."" Celtic manager Neil Lennon was disappointed by his team's second half display: ""We didn't compete and it was almost as if the players had gone out in the second-half thinking the game was won,"" he said.

HTC have racked up 93 victories between their male and female riders in 2011, and are the sport's most successful team in the past three years. In a statement Stapleton said: ""After an exhaustive search to secure long-term sponsorship we have concluded that it's time to release our team members to pursue other options.

In further quotes carried by AFP, Stapleton added: ""Our view was that if we couldn't be close enough on financial firepower, we couldn't consistently outperform with far less money. ""And if we couldn't be in a leadership position in the sport, then we weren't going to be in a position to drive change and that was our fundamental mission coming in, and if we weren't going to succeed in that, then it was best to let people go and pursue their own interests.""

"Seattle (CNN) -- Washington teachers on strike for seven days reached a tentative agreement Wednesday to end their protests, following the intervention of the governor, a spokesman for the teacher's union said. ""There's a tentative agreement, which we will now vote on,"" Union spokesman Rich Wood told CNN. ""All of the big issues, class size, teacher pay and transfers we were able to agree on."" Wood said more details of the planned deal would be discussed at a Thursday meeting for some 2,000 teachers who left the classroom for the picket line after negotiations with the Tacoma school district for a new contract broke down. Wood said teachers could go back to school as early as Friday if they approve the deal. A spokesman for the school district did not respond to CNN requests for comment on the proposed agreement. Earlier Wednesday, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire announced she would referee the feud between the Tacoma school district and striking teachers that had kept 28,000 students from classrooms for seven days. Negotiations at her office lasted about seven hours Wednesday before the agreement was announced. ""This agreement provides a long-term solution, meets the districts needs and ensures teachers remain proud to report to their classroom every day,"" Gregoire said in a statement. Last week, a state judge ordered the teacher's union and school district to restart stalled negotiations and told striking teachers to get back into the classroom. But the teachers, who have rejected school district proposals for a new three-year contract, continued their protests. Bryan Chushcoff, the judge hearing the case, said teachers and the union are defying his order. A hearing had been scheduled for next Tuesday to determine what penalties the teachers and union could face. Chushcoff said last week that an agreement could prevent further litigation from taking place over the strike. Contract talks between the school district and union fractured over teacher pay, class size and how educators are transferred between schools. Across Washington, state services cuts are in the works after the governor's office last week said the state is expected to collect $1.4 billion less in revenue between now and June 2013 than previously forecast.","Washington's governor intervenes in negotiations .

"(CNN) -- The International Olympic Committee told CNN Friday that they are waiting on the result of an investigation by amateur boxing's world governing body into allegations that huge bribes were paid so Azerbaijan can win gold medals at the London 2012 Games. Reports by the BBC suggested that organizers of the International Amateur Boxing Association (AIBA)'s World Series of Boxing (WSB) paid $9 million to an Azeri national. The money was allegedly paid to secure two gold medals for Azeri boxers at next year's Olympics in Britain.

"(CNN) -- Beth Holloway, the mother of long-missing Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, opposes a court petition to declare the her dead, an attorney said Thursday. The petition was filed in June by Dave Holloway, Beth Holloway's ex-husband. It will be heard in a Jefferson County, Alabama, probate court on Friday. Natalee Holloway was 18 and had just graduated high school in the Birmingham, Alabama, suburb of Mountain Brook when she disappeared on a celebratory trip with classmates to Aruba in 2005. ""Beth intends to oppose Dave's inexplicable effort to have Natalee declared dead,"" attorney John Q. Kelly said in a statement. ""Beth gave birth to and raised Natalee, and will always hope and pray for Natalee's safe return."" Last week, Dave Holloway's attorney said he filed the petition because he ""is seeking closure for his family."" ""This is a normal proceeding for families when a loved one has been missing for an extended period of time,"" attorney Karen Hennecy said in a statement. ""Alabama law requires a waiting period of five years when a body has not recovered and no death certificate has been issued."" ""If Dave seeks closure on such a personal and sensitive matter, it should be respected, but not imposed upon Beth in such an adversarial and public manner,"" Kelly said Thursday. Beth Holloway said in a statement last week, issued through her Natalee Holloway Resource Center, which aids families of missing persons, that she learned about the filing when she was handed documents by a process server while addressing a conference in Georgia. Natalee Holloway's disappearance remains unsolved. A suspect, Joran van der Sloot, was arrested but never charged in connection with the disappearance. He was indicted on federal extortion charges last year after prosecutors accused him of offering to sell information about the location of Holloway's remains in exchange for $250,000.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libya's National Transitional Council will hold an urgent meeting Sunday to discuss the formation of an interim government, a senior council member told CNN Friday. Mohammed Naser, the council member, said the formation of a government could take up to one week, but NTC members agreed that the interim government would include a premier, a vice premier, and 22 ministers. Naser did not give further details. Earlier this week, Elamin Belhaj, a senior member of the NTC, told CNN the formation of a Libyan government would not be announced until anti-Gadhafi forces controlled the borders of the country and liberated three cities that still remained under loyalist control -- Bani Walid, Sirte and Sabha -- a task that could take up to one month, he said. ""We are not a fully established country,"" he said this week of the fact that Libya has not been completely liberated. The NTC, he said, will expand as cities are liberated in order to give representation to all regions of the country. Ultimately, the council could have approximately 80 members; it currently has 43. Belhaj said that after liberation, the NTC will create an interim government by appointing a prime minister who will be responsible for forming the government. The prime minister will decide how many ministers will be in that interim government, but he must return to the NTC for approval of that government. Belhaj explained that the NTC decided to use the expression ""interim government"" because ""the international community wants to deal with us through a government."" That interim government will prepare for the election within eight months of a National Congress, a body that will have 200 members. At the creation of the congress, the interim government will cease to exist. The National Congress, Belhaj said, will form a committee to write a constitution for Libya, which will then be presented to the Libyan people to vote on in a referendum. If it's approved, Libya would have a permanent democratic constitution for the first time, he said. In the final stage of transition, Libya will create a political system, including the formation of political parties that will participate in general parliamentary and presidential elections. Asked to comment on charges that the ranks of the NTC are divided by regional rivalries, Belhaj said there is no division in the NTC. Islamists and secularists are ""all together"" during this stage of revolution, he said.

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid have reduced Barcelona's lead at the top of the Spanish Primera Liga to three points after coming from behind to win 2-1 at Almeria on Thursday. Madrid, looking to bounce back following their defeat in ""El Clasico"", suffered a poor start and fell behind in the 14th minute. Kalu Uche broke down the right and his low cross was met by the unmarked Albert Crusat at the far post. And the home side nearly doubled their advantage just seven minutes later when Domingo Cisma's free-kick was superbly saved by Iker Casillas. However, the visitors drew level in the 27th minute thanks to a moment of superb skill from Cristiano Ronaldo. The $125 million man burst past two defenders, fooled a third with one of his trademark stepovers and fird home a shot into the far corner for his 19th league goal of the season. From then on, Real were the better side. Veteran midfielder Guti struck the post from the edge of the area before Rafael Van der Vaart put the rebound wide. And the winning goal came in the 69th minute when Van der Vaart collected Gonzalo Higuain's pass before firing home a low shot into the bottom corner. Madrid should have added to their lead, but Ronaldo was denied by goalkeeper Diego Alves while Karim Benzema and Mahamadou Diarra also missed good chances.","Real Madrid reduce Barcelona's lead at the top of the Primera Liga to three points .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Pentagon will lift its ban on media coverage of the flag-draped coffins of war victims arriving at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday. Military vehicles carry coffins containing U.S. troops in this photo the Pentagon released in 2005. But the families of the victims will have the final say on whether to allow the coverage, he said. President Obama asked Gates to review the policy, and Gates said he decided after consulting with the armed services and groups representing military families to apply the same policy that is used at Arlington National Cemetery. ""I have decided that the decision regarding media coverage of the dignified transfer process at Dover should be made by those most directly affected -- the families,"" he said at a news conference.  Watch Gates announce reversal » . Gates said he had formed a group to create an implementation plan for the new policy. Not long after Gates' announcement, the political action committee VoteVets.org issued a written statement saying it is ""fully supportive"" of the decision.

""We look forward to the recommendations of the working group on the implementation of this policy,"" the group said. Not everyone had a positive reaction. ""Military Families United is disappointed in the president's decision to overturn the ban that has been in place for over 18 years,"" the group said in a release. ""Just last week, Families United released the results of a survey conducted among military families, which found that more than 64 percent ... believe that this ban should not be overturned. It is evident that military families were not consulted nor their wishes honored when the decision was made. ""This is a complete disregard for the will of America's military families and their need for privacy during this solemn moment,"" the release said. After the Iraq War began, critics of the George W. Bush administration accused it of disallowing photographs and filming to de-emphasize the number of casualties from what many considered an unpopular war. Although the Defense Department won't confirm it, it is widely accepted that the idea for the ban began after the December 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama, when the United States deposed dictator Manuel Noriega. After a news conference held by President George H.W. Bush, his press secretary made a humorous remark, which caused the president and reporters to laugh. At the same time, viewers were watching coffins of the first casualties from the invasion being unloaded at Dover. The following year, when the Persian Gulf War began, the Pentagon banned media coverage of war dead being returned to the base. One of the family members who favors lifting the ban is Karen Meredith of San Francisco, California, who wrote Obama urging him to order the change. Lt. Ken Ballard left for Iraq on Mother's Day 2003. He came home in a casket on Memorial Day 2004. ""I wanted the nation to grieve with me, and if we don't see those images we don't know that these young men and women are dying,"" she said. ""And to me it's an honor to have an honor guard at Dover when they're bringing these men and women back through the mortuary. But we've never been able to see those pictures of the honor being given."" Others say the honor should remain private. ""When they come off the plane these are anonymous caskets. What is the greater good of that?"" asked Vince Rangel, who was an Army Ranger captain in Vietnam. ""I would rather take that attention and give it everything it deserves at the grave site in the communities where you can get all that information, so people can understand these people as human beings. Not just as a flag-draped casket that comes out of a plane."" Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said about two weeks ago that a good deal of input needed to be collected from a number of sources, including Pentagon offices representing family interests, the Defense Department's public affairs office and the various service branches. CNN's Barbara Starr and Susan Roesgen contributed to this report.","Defense secretary Robert Gates says families will have final say on each coffin .

"Knoxville, Tennessee (CNN) -- Helen Ashe experienced many hardships growing up in Abbeville, South Carolina, during the 1930s and '40s. Her family's first house had no lights or running water. But even during tough times, she and her twin sister, Ellen, were taught to be selfless. ""My daddy taught us not to take the last piece of bread from the table; somebody may come by that's hungry,"" Ashe remembered. Since 1986, Ashe has been leaving a whole lot more than bread on the table. As the founder of the Love Kitchen in Knoxville, Tennessee, she has helped serve more than 1 million free meals to those in need. Aided by her sister and a team of volunteers, Ashe serves those whom she calls the five Hs: the hungry, the homeless, the helpless, the hopeless and the homebound. ""We have so many people that are in need,"" said Ashe, 83. ""That's what keeps us going."" The Love Kitchen prepares and distributes about 2,000 meals a week from a large community center that's equipped with a restaurant-style kitchen. On Wednesdays and Thursdays, the Love Kitchen serves a lunchtime meal where everyone is welcome. Hundreds often dine in, but the majority of meals -- 1,500 on average -- are delivered to Knoxville residents who cannot physically leave their homes. Many of these people are elderly and suffer from debilitating illnesses or diseases. ""Each week, we get a list of people that are either hospitalized, too old to come in to eat, or homebound,"" volunteer James O'Hare said. ""Then on Thursday, they take a stack of these seven meals, and the volunteers deliver to that person."" Each takeout box has an entrée, a vegetable, bread and dessert so recipients receive well-rounded meals for a whole week. But they also get much more. ""It feeds their body, and it also feeds their soul,"" O'Hare said. ""They have somebody that comes and talks to them, gives them some encouragement."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . Ashe doesn't typically deliver the meals herself. She and her sister stay at the community center, greeting volunteers, recipients and even fans who drop by to say hello. ""My sister Ellen is a blessing to me,"" Ashe said. ""She always says the Love Kitchen was in the making. And that's why the Lord sent two: because it's so much work to do for one."" The two enrolled in nursing school in the late '50s, and after graduation, they began working at what is now the University of Tennessee Medical Center. At the time, Ashe said, segregation was in ""full force."" She saw many of her black patients struggle for food and transportation. ""They didn't have money,"" Ashe said. ""They didn't have transportation home. The Lord put it into my brain for me to do something about this."" Ashe said she used her own funds when she could to help those in need. However, she dreamed of a place ""where people could come and eat and wouldn't have to pay anything."" In 1986, that dream became reality when the pastor of a nearby church said she could set up shop in the basement. The first day the Love Kitchen opened its doors, it served 22 meals. ""I think our first meal was fried chicken with some fried potatoes and a little salad on the side,"" said Leroy Mundy, 66, who has been coming to the Love Kitchen since it started. The number of recipients grew over time, as did the venue size. But more than two decades later, there's still down-home Southern cooking and some good old-fashioned Southern hospitality. ""You leave with love and some higher spirits when you talk to these two ladies here,"" Mundy said. The Love Kitchen's food is donated by an area grocery store. Local farmers and specialty shops also bring in fresh vegetables, fruit and baked goods. Meals are served fresh in a kitchen that is up to Health Department standards. Volunteers range in age, and many are local professionals who have been inspired by Ashe's vision and work. Ashe gives all the credit to God and her wonderful parents. Her motto remains the same as the day they opened their doors. ""We work for what we got, and we share what we get,"" she said. Want to get involved?

"Belfast, Ireland (CNN) -- The British government said Thursday it will pay compensation to the relatives of those killed and wounded by British soldiers in the Bloody Sunday shootings in Northern Ireland in 1972. Thirteen people died when British troops opened fire at a mainly Catholic civil rights march in Londonderry, and another man died four months later of injuries sustained on that day. Last year, Prime Minister David Cameron described what happened in Londonderry as ""unjustified and unjustifiable,"" following the release by the British government of a damning report that reversed decades of official explanations for the 1972 killings. The paratroopers who killed 14 people had no reason to believe they were under threat from the victims, gave no warnings before firing and lied to the far-reaching official inquiry into the seminal event, the inquiry concluded. The independent Saville Report was a comprehensive rejection of the British government's official account of the killings, which had stood for 38 years. Lawyers representing the affected families wrote to Cameron demanding compensation. The families now say Britain's Ministry of Defence has replied, saying it wants to ""resolve the compensation question as quickly as possible."" ""We acknowledge the pain felt by these families for nearly 40 years, and that members of the armed forces acted wrongly. For that, the government is deeply sorry,"" a spokesman for the ministry said Thursday. ""We are in contact with the families' solicitors and where there is a legal liability to pay compensation we will do so."" However, the relatives of one of the victims -- 19-year-old William Nash -- say they want the soldiers involved to be prosecuted for murder and will not accept the compensation. The relatives branded the British government offer ""repulsive"" and said they would not accept a payment ""under any circumstances."" Bloody Sunday is widely accepted as fueling support for the IRA (Irish Republican Army) during the early years of what became known as The Troubles -- 30 years of violence between pro-British and pro-Irish forces. Even the name of the city where it happened is disputed, with pro-Irish nationalists calling it Derry and pro-British unionists calling it Londonderry. The IRA, a republican paramilitary organization, is listed by the British Home Office as a proscribed terrorist group. The Troubles claimed about 3,000 lives over a three-decade period, with 1972 the single bloodiest year. The pro-British Ulster Unionist Party has called for IRA victims to be compensated by the British government.","The Ministry of Defence says it acknowledges the pain felt by families .

"(CNN) -- A lightning strike sparked a fire Monday that destroyed the Caribbean island home of Virgin Group Chairman Richard Branson, a statement from the media mogul said. About 20 people, including Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet, were in the house at the time of the fire, which broke out around 4 a.m., Branson said. No one was injured. ""Many thanks to Kate Winslet for helping carry my 90-year(-old) mum out of the main house to safety,"" Branson wrote in the e-mailed statement. Branson said the house, located on Necker Island, the 74-acre private island the billionaire owns in the British Virgin Islands, was destroyed, along with ""thousands of photographs and my notebooks."" ""But all my family and friends are well -- which in the end is all that really matters,"" he said. The lightning strike that caused the fire occurred in the midst of Tropical Storm Irene, which strengthened into a hurricane early Monday. Pictures show the house completely engulfed in flames against an ominous sky. ""Currently just huddled up with family and friends in the continuing tropical storm realising what really matters in life,"" Branson said. He promised to rebuild, saying ""we'll create something even more special out of the ruins."" In addition to Branson's private residences on the island, Necker is also open as a luxury resort that can accommodate up to 28 guests for those who can afford the hefty $54,500-a-night price tag. The island has been featured on such TV programs as ""MTV Cribs,"" and TV personalities Nick Lachey and Vanessa Minnillo were recently married on the island.","The fire was sparked by a lightning strike during Tropical Storm Irene .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- For the 2.5 million people who have fled the four-year conflict in war-torn Darfur, refugee camps in eastern Chad hold the promise of a safe haven. Women and girls have to make perilous journeys outside their refugee camps to find firewood . But, once there, it's the women refugees' role to find wood and water. To do this, they have to leave the camps and walk for many miles, putting their very lives at risk. Now, a small nonprofit organization is cutting the dangers faced by these women, by helping them to move away from firewood and cook using cardboard, tinfoil and the power of the sun. And as well as saving lives, they're offering refugees hope, independence and economic opportunity. A month's wood supply ""lasts five days"" The World Food Program gives Darfur refugees a maize/soy mixture, beans, lentils, salt, oil and firewood. But a month's wood ration only lasts five days, so to cook this food, women are forced to forage for fuel -- and that's a dangerous business. When they leave the relative safety of the camps, they are vulnerable to beatings, rape and murder at the hands of roving Janjaweed patrols and local villagers, with whom they compete for scanty resources. When Californian nonprofit Jewish World Watch heard about the dangers these Darfur refugees face, they were determined to act. Their co-founder and president, Janice Kamenir-Reznik, told CNN, ""These women have survived onslaughts on their villages and hundreds of miles of walking to get to a camp. That they should be vulnerable there seemed terrible."" Jewish World Watch saw that if they could cut the number of trips that women had to make outside the camps, they should see a concomitant fall in violent attacks. Solar cooking seemed the solution. Without forces of their own on the ground, the charity decided to fund a partner to run a trial. But when they approached the large relief organizations, they received a lukewarm response: the cultural and educational challenges involved in solar cooking were felt to be insurmountable. Kamenir-Reznik and her colleagues were certain solar cooking would work in the camps, and they persisted. ""If you protected your daughter from having to walk 20 miles to find wood and give her body to violence in the process, wouldn't you think that's worth it?"" she told CNN. ""What do people think, that these people don't care about their daughters as much as you and I care about ours? They do what they have to for survival, but that doesn't mean they like it."" Eventually, Jewish World Watch were put in touch with KoZon, a small Dutch nonprofit who were carrying out a pilot in Iridimi camp, home to 17,000 refugees. In May 2006, the Iridimi project launched. ""It can't be hot: there has been no fire."" At project manager Derk Rijks's first demonstration in Iridimi, Rijks's 40-strong female audience was skeptical. He set up the cooker, then waited until the food was ready. ""I took the oldest, most respected mama I could find in the group,"" he recalls. ""I said, 'Mama, will you open the bag and take the pot out?' I offered her my handkerchief and said, 'Take this, because the pot will be hot.' She looked at me and said, 'No, it can't be hot: there has been no fire.' I said, 'Mama, I warn you, it is very hot. You will burn yourself.' She said, 'It can't be hot.' She opened the bag, put her hand on the pot and jumped back two meters. Then she looked at me and said, 'I have two hands! I want two handkerchiefs!'"" The women were incredulous that solar cooking had worked. Rijks offered to teach them how to cook their food using solar the following day, but he still had to promise them his rations as a guarantee in case it didn't work. It did. The women in Iridimi camp have now embraced solar cooking wholeheartedly, even converting their menfolk, who were skeptical initially because the food tasted different. Cardboard and tinfoil . Rijks's team ships in the cardboard and aluminum foil that makes the cookers. The refugees use Arabic gum as a glue, which they buy in Chad -- and that's all they need. And he is keen that the refugees own and run the project independently. ""Our only jobs are to show it once or twice, train the auxiliary trainers and train the artisans. It is now their project,"" he said. The climate in Chad allows the women in Iridimi camp to cook on solar for about 330 days per year. They still have to use wood stoves in the mornings, but lunch is cooked using solar, as is the evening meal, which is kept warm in insulated baskets until it's needed. Over 18 months, all women in the Iridimi camp over the age of 15 have been trained and 10,000 cookers have been distributed. And when the women at nearby Touloum camp heard about the solar cookers at Iridimi, they asked if the project could be extended. That's happening shortly: Rijks estimates that the women in Touloum will be cooking with solar within a year and a half. Eventually, Jewish World Watch hopes to extend the project to a third camp, as well as funding the ongoing projects at Iridimi and Touloum -- the cookers have to be replaced every few months. Trips to find firewood ""cut by three quarters"" Rijks reports that the number of trips women make to find firewood has fallen by about three quarters. But that's not the only advantage. Now that the women don't have to sit by smoky fires constantly stirring their food, they are healthier and have more free time to develop cottage industries, like vegetable gardening and craftwork. The gardens are irrigated using recycled water from the showers. Some women weave insulation baskets; others make protective bags to carry the cookers. Rijks has recently struck a deal with the trucks and the Air France planes that bring supplies to the camp to take back the women's handicrafts for sale in the West. What will the future hold for these refugees? The message from the women at Iridimi is of hope, one day. ""They all say, 'When we go back home, we'll teach this to all the women in our village and they will all do solar cooking,'"" Rijks told CNN. ""They're convinced they're going home."" Rijks himself is less sure. ""I know it won't be immediate but I hope that the refugees can go back in a few years,"" he said. ""It will be an immeasurable shame on the West if we couldn't arrange that."" A catalyst for the future . As for solar cooking, Janice Kamenir-Reznik hopes that the success of their project will inspire others. ""I would hope that our little project was a catalyst for the UN High Commission for Refugees to wean the relief organizations off wood and onto solar cooking,"" she said. ""That's our ultimate dream."" ""The larger organizations tend to see things a little bit more rigidly: find a solution to cook today's dinner,"" she continued. ""But the problem's not an instant one to solve. You don't just keep providing the firewood for today's dinner. You build for the future."" And back in Iridimi camp, the ray of hope that solar cooking is bringing to some of the world's most destitute people -- along with personal safety, improved health and entrepreneurial opportunity -- will continue to shine. ..............................

"(CNN) -- The grim stories of two women who endured long-stretches of solitary confinement in Iran's most notorious prison are chilling omens for the two jailed U.S. hikers who each reportedly received an eight-year prison sentence on Saturday. Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer have been abused and assaulted in Evin Prison, their friend Sarah Shourd said in a BBC interview in June. Evin is noted for its harsh conditions and its wing for political prisoners. ""My worst fear is that they're not safe,"" said Shourd, who was arrested with Fattal and Bauer in July 2009 but was freed for medical reasons in September after 410 days of solitary confinement. The two men were sentenced on charges of spying and illegal entry. Shourd said a guard at Evin was furious that Fattal took extra food and pushed him down the stairs. The guard repeatedly threw Bauer -- Shourd's fiance -- against a wall of his cell until his head began bleeding. She said the three had feared that they would be executed soon after they were arrested, when a guard began cocking his gun. In July 2009, Shourd, Fattal, and Bauer were hiking in Iraq's autonomous Kurdish area along the border with Iran when they were arrested by Iranian police. Shourd said they accidentally strayed across the border. Iranian authorities say the three crossed into Iran illegally. Twice, they feared for their lives as guards loaded them into a vehicle to a mysterious location and cocked their weapons, Shourd said. Terrified, they held hands, cried out and begged for their lives. In September, Shourd spoke to CNN's ""American Morning"" about her stint at Evin, where she was in solitary confinement. She said she got through the ordeal of imprisonment by thinking of her mother and loved ones and ""just knowing I had to come back to them, you know, bruised but unbroken."" As she wept while prison guards slammed the door of her cell and walked away, Shourd understood what Fattal and Bauer were coping with. ""I can see them in their cramped little cell with very little sunlight and they only get out an hour a day and, you know, they exercise side by side on a space like the size of a towel."" Asked whether she was physically abused, she said no. ""It is all psychological. And it's just the hardest thing, of course, is being so alienated from your family."" She remembers how she begged to make a phone call, a request that was finally granted seven months into her captivity. ""By the time I got a phone call, I lost hope that it was going to happen,"" she told CNN. ""There's just so many ups and downs. You think it will be over and then it goes on and on and on."" American journalist Roxana Saberi also spent time in solitary confinement at Evin and spent hours thinking: Is it going to ever end? ""I felt anger toward God, as well. I said, 'Why are you punishing me? Why don't you save me?'"" Saberi told CNN's ""American Morning"" in September. She was sentenced to eight years in prison but was released after 100 days in May 2009. She said the ordeal was a hard one. ""When you're alone, you feel helpless. You might feel hopeless. At first you might be in a state of denial. You ask or tell yourself: 'I can't accept this. It is just a nightmare. It is going to end.'"" Saberi never knew whether she would be able to speak with her lawyer or when she might see her parents again. She spent her 32nd birthday in jail, in the midst of a hunger strike. She chose to stop eating because her body was the only thing she could control. It was her only weapon against the regime. The Iranians promised her freedom if she would admit she was a spy. They threatened her to keep her silent about her time in Evin. Saberi said she was threatened by her captors if she spoke about ""certain things."" One guard told her he would sign her death warrant. She said they told her: ""I think you've seen how capable we are. We have agents all over the world and we can find you anywhere. You might be reporting in Afghanistan and we can kill you and make it look like you died in a car accident.""","Iran's Evin Prison has a reputation as a dismal, dangerous place .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India's prime minister Monday called for reforms in the country's slow-paced judicial system as a key measure to fighting corruption as he discounted the notion that a citizen ombudsman alone can eradicate deeply-entrenched graft. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told a management institute in Calcutta in eastern India that his government though was open to dialogue with campaigners demanding an anti-corruption watchdog with sweeping powers. His comments came as 74-year-old activist Anna Hazare's hunger strike entered its seventh day at a large protest site in New Delhi, packed by thousands of supporters. Hazare has set August 30 as a deadline for parliament to pass a bill drafted by members of the civil society to create a Lokpal, or citizen ombudsman. The campaigner rejects the government's version of the legislation already tabled in the elected national assembly, saying it's too weak. In his speech in Calcutta, Singh reiterated that his government believed concerns over the proposed law should be conveyed to lawmakers and a parliamentary committee scrutinizing the Lokpal bill. ""We are open to a reasoned debate on all these issues,"" he remarked. Singh, however, disagreed that a Lokpal could become the ultimate solution to tackling corruption. ""The creation of the Lokpal as an institution will help. But it will not solve the problem. It needs to be supported by improvements in the pace and quality of judicial processes,"" he said. The Indian leader suggested speeding up India's justice system, notorious for its sluggishness and how long it takes to settle lawsuits. ""Speedy trials and timely judgments will do a great deal to discourage corruption and dispel the notion that those who break the law can get away scot-free. This requires a number of judicial reforms,"" he said. Meantime, Hazare continued his fast at New Delhi's Ramlila Grounds, a day after he made a rare appeal to his supporters to hold sit-ins at the homes of lawmakers until they agree to the civil-society draft of the Lokpal bill that the government has not accepted in full. New Delhi's police spokesman Rajan Bhagat told CNN that officers had removed demonstrators surrounding houses of elected leaders from different locations in the city. There were no detentions, he said. Police had no immediate details about how many protesters had gathered outside the homes of parliamentarians after Hazare's call. In his dramatic comments Sunday, the elderly campaigner also described public gatherings as superior to the federal assembly. ""... the people's parliament is over and above New Delhi's parliament. It is this people's parliament that has created that (elected) parliament,"" Hazare said. Some observers, however, disapproved of the activist's protest tactics modeled after hunger strikes of India's independence leader Mahatma Gandhi as he fought the British rule. ""Mr. Hazare is well within his rights to hold protests. But to say, 'You accept my bill and nothing else,' might amount to coercing the government and parliament,"" constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap said. He, however, described Hazare's support base as a clear indication of public disaffection with chronic corruption. ""I think most of the people may (not know) what Lokpal or Jan Lokpal bills are and about their implications. They have hit the streets because they are frustrated with this corruption and also with the government's handling of the whole issue,"" Kashyap said. Nonetheless, he warned that democratic bodies should be allowed to work in accordance with laid-down norms. ""In the name of corruption, you cannot demolish democratic institutions. You cannot throw the baby with the bath-water,"" Kashyap said. Experts also believe the South Asian nation is required to carry out a range of reforms to overhaul its systems. ""Corruption is a systemic problem. A Lokpal may be curative, but it can't be preventive as far as corruption is concerned. We need systemic, administrative and, above all, political and electoral reforms,"" Kashyap added. On Saturday, a leading civil-rights activist, Aruna Roy, echoed similar views on Hazare's campaign. ""I think (Hazare) is ill-advised. Anyone who says, 'My view should be the only view,' is wrong,"" said Roy of the National Campaign for People's Right to Information. ""We must assert our rights. But to get rid of these (democratic) institutions would be a great disaster for all the people in this country,"" she warned.","Prime minister says judicial system reform needed to curb corruption .
He says an ombudsman won't be enough .
Hazare continues his hunger strike ."
"(CNN) -- Defending champions Manchester United made it two wins out of two in the new English Premier League season as they beat Tottenham 3-0 at Old Trafford. Second half goals from Danny Welbeck, Anderson and Wayne Rooney sealed a comfortable victory for Alex Ferguson's youthful side, who went joint top of the table. It marked defeat for Tottenham in their opening game of the season after their first fixture of the new campaign was canceled due to the London riots. Victory took United level at the summit with rivals Manchester City, who maintained their 100 per cent record with a 3-2 win at Bolton on Sunday. United manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports: ""The second half was absolutely fantastic. I thought it a fast game, end-to-end, it was very even but in the second half we took off and it was a fantastic performance."" On hearing it was the second youngest team Manchester United had fielded in the Premier League era Ferguson added: ""It tells you we still believe in young players, more so when you see the ability they've got. ""This group have fantastic ability -- they force you to play them."" On Welbeck he added: ""He's always shown great loyalty Danny, when we put him on loan at Sunderland last season that's when he grew up. ""He's a bit rangy, a long-legged boy who can gallop quickly, he's a good footballer and has a great attitude to win the ball back."" Tom Cleverley was the first to test Tottenham's goalkeeper Brad Friedel as the veteran American turned his goal-bound effort round the post before Ashley Young went close with a looping header from Rooney's cross. Jermain Defoe and Gareth Bale both tested United's Spanish keeper David De Gea in the second half before Welbeck broke the deadlock on the hour with a firm header from Cleverley's right wing cross. Welbeck was also heavily involved in the second goal as his back-heel wrong footed Tottenham's defence and Anderson slotted the ball into an empty net. Rooney then grabbed his second of the season as he nodded home Ryan Giggs' cross from seven yards out. Earlier on Monday United confirmed they have signed a four-year sponsorship with express and logistics company DHL. The deal, worth $16.5 million a year according to British newspaper The Financial Times, will see the DHL logo appear on all United's training kit.","Manchester United beat Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 at Old Trafford .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from a string of hurricanes and tropical storms in Haiti has risen to nearly 800 people, an official with the Haitian Red Cross says. A man carries drinking water through the flooded streets of Gonaives, Haiti, last month. Jean Pierre Guiteau, the group's executive officer, said they suspected the numbers may climb further because many people were still missing. Heavy rainfall from four major storms in August and September created fatal flooding and mudslides in Haiti. Tropical Storm Fay caused flooding and significant damage when it hit the impoverished island nation. Heavy rains from Hurricane Gustav, considered a major hurricane, caused destructive mudslides after it made landfall in Haiti on August 26, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Tropical Storm Hanna passed over northern Haiti in early September, bringing heavy rain and flooding. Ike, another major hurricane, caused flooding and mudslides. The United States has provided more than $30 million in humanitarian assistance to Haiti in the wake of the storms, the U.S. Agency for International Development said. The United Nations' Central Emergency Response Fund has allocated more than $4 million for post-hurricane humanitarian aid, the agency said. The U.S. Navy sent the USS Kearsarge to Haiti last month to deliver more than 1,400 metric tons of relief supplies, in support of USAID and the World Food Program. It delivered heavy lift helicopters to carry rice, water, plywood and other supplies to Haitians, and also carried medical and engineering teams to remote parts of the country. Even before the tropical weather struck Haiti, an estimated 2.3 million Haitians had fallen into food insecurity, with dramatic increases in prices for staple foods, USAID has said.","Death toll from string of hurricanes and tropical storms in Haiti rises to nearly 800 .

"(CNN)  -- Brazil's Olympic swimming champion Cesar Cielo is free to compete in this year's world championships after escaping a drugs ban. Cielo, who won the 50m freestyle at the 2008 Beijing Games, was cleared by a special tribunal of the Court of Arbitration of Sport sitting in Shanghai where the worlds are being held. Cielo and teammates Nicholas dos Santos and Henrique Barbosa were given warnings after testing positive for a banned diuretic. But another swimmer on the Brazilian squad, Vinicius Waked, was banned for a year because it was his second violation for drugs offences. The CAS tribunal dismissed an appeal by world swimming's governing body FINA, who wanted stiffer punishments. It followed a six-hour hearing Wednesday at which Cielo appeared to give evidence. The quartet tested positive for Furosemide, which can act as a masking agent for other banned drugs, at a meeting back in May. They claimed that a caffeine supplement had been contaminated to bring about the failed drugs test. The decision to clear Cielo is a major boost for the world swimming championships where he is set to be a big attraction. But it drew criticism in some quarters and triple world champion Roland Schoeman wrote on his Twitter blog: ""FINA and the CAS have done a great disservice to the world of swimming & set a dangerous precedent.""

"(CNN) -- The story of Katie Goldman is one that young and (ahem) older ""girls"" all over the country can relate to. Teased for bringing her ""Star Wars"" Thermos to school, the first-grader opted instead to shield her love of the series from public scrutiny and asked her mom for a pink Thermos instead. At the tender age of 7, the boys in her class had a hard time accepting that she could like light sabers and Jedi knights just as much as they did. It would be easier for Katie to be what people expected her to be, even if it meant hiding part of who she really was. The more times change, the more sci-fi stereotypes stay the same. Not just 'guys living in their basements' The evolution of science-fiction and fantasy started decades ago, but sad to say, as Katie's experience shows, it's still not there yet. Part of the reason could be that many of us, um ... shall we say, ""older"" fans have also shielded our love of the great imaginative stories that sci-fi delivers from public view. I admit that whenever I told anyone I work with at CNN that I really loved the ""Battlestar Galactica"" series on Syfy, I quickly followed with a ""Time magazine called it the best television series of 2005,"" as if the fact that I loved the show weren't enough. ""Laugh if you want,"" wrote James Poniewozik, ""but this story of enemies within is dead serious, and seriously good."" Read more about ""Battlestar Galactica"" I (like many others, I suspect) thought that people simply couldn't take me seriously if they knew that part of me loved these fascinating tales of faraway places, worlds unexplored or the ever-present themes of beating the undefeatable, facing the ultimate challenge and overcoming evil. The numbers show I'm clearly not alone. Just take a look at who's watching the network solely devoted to science-fiction and fantasy programming. ""It's always been very gender-balanced. It has this misconception that it's about the guys living in their basements. Our audience has been about 50-50,"" said Dave Howe, president of the newly rebranded Syfy network (formerly SciFi). ""I think it's one of those urban myths that's existed for a very long time: They are the stereotypical sci-fi fan, and people ignore women and families ... dating back to when we were all at school."" So you think you know the sci-fi audience? Did you know that some 67% of viewers who tune in to watch Buffy slay the evil vampires (in reruns, albeit) are women? And they're not just tuning in to see the exciting possibilities vampires present. Howe -- who is also president of a horror flick network called Chiller, which he says reaches about 40 million households -- says that about 53% of the ""Masters of Horror"" audience are female. ""People think they're not into science-fiction, and then you look at who's going to see 'Harry Potter' or 'Spider-Man' or 'Twilight.' ... Science-fiction is the most mainstream genre, period."" Oh, yeah, did I mention that Howe says the average age of those Syfy-watching women is about 45? One size does not fit all . It's much better to be a ""Star Wars"" fan today than it was when I was kid. Not because the story has changed but because the characters have. In ""Star Wars' "" new animated life on Cartoon Network (which, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner) ""The Clone Wars"" features a girl who is a Jedi apprentice. The character Ahsoka Tano is a strong-willed, determined and often sassy Jedi-in-training who at times comes to the rescue of her know-it-all master. It's something not lost on actress Ashley Eckstein, the voice of Ahsoka Tano. ""I have to give Lucasfilm credit for creating the character of Ahsoka,"" Eckstein said. ""She is the first female Jedi who has been the focus of the series. They have created a series with several female characters as lead characters, and sometimes the women carry the episodes. They are making it OK for these women to be the leads. Now, when the kids are playing 'Star Wars' on the playground, there is a Jedi for the little girls to be. For the girls who don't want to be a princess, they can be a padawan."" Eckstein was so passionate about giving the girls permission to ""get their girl on"" that she negotiated rights with Lucasfilm to develop a line of clothing called Her Universe and other products aimed strictly at the female market. ""I started working on 'The Clone Wars' almost five years ago, and I was always a 'Star Wars' fan and wanted to show it off, and so I went to the Web and to stores, and I realized it didn't really exist. There were very few products, and on one site, under the women's section, they had men's shirts,"" said Eckstein, who is persuading executives at Disney to carry the line. She also gives credit to another actress, Alyssa Milano, who started a clothing line called Touch for female sports fans. ""I'm aware of her line because my husband plays baseball, and I've bought several of her pieces,"" said Eckstein, who spent close to three years convincing people there was a market for this. ""We started at conventions and events and online and at San Diego Comic-Con, where the 'Star Wars' celebration and the support was overwhelming. I don't want this to just be a merchandise line. I want it to be a community for female fans. One thing I found in my research is that girls were hiding the fact that they were sci-fi fans, and many women were afraid to say 'I'm a girl, and I like ""Star Wars"" or ""Star Trek."" ' They didn't feel like they could be taken seriously."" And Eckstein has a message for 7-year-old Katie: ""We can show our pride and be a girl at the same time and be proud of it. I'm a nerd and a geek, and I'm proud of it. So show who you are and what you like, and if you're confident, people will leave you alone.""","Older geeky girls tend to hide their obsessions from public view .

"(CNN) -- A Florida jury on Saturday found a millionaire guilty of murdering his wife in their upscale home. Diane Ward was shot dead in 2009 in the house she shared with her husband, James ""Bob"" Ward, in the Orlando suburb of Windermere. Two years later -- and following a week-long trial and deliberations that stretched into a second day -- he was convicted of second-degree murder. Soon after entering the Orlando courtroom late Saturday morning, Ward went to a back row and sat between his two visibly distraught daughters, one of whom had testified that she detected no animosity between her parents. He put one arm around both in order to comfort them for several minutes, before heading to his regular seat for the jury's verdict. When the verdict was read, the 63-year-old Ward showed little evident emotion, though his daughters continued to cry. According to an Orange County Sheriff's Office arrest affidavit, the victim was found in the master bedroom -- ""a large pool of blood at the top of her head"" and a .357 Magnum handgun on a nightstand next to the bed. She was shot between her eyes. Ward told police the couple were the only ones in the house at the time, besides their four dogs. After the verdict, prosecutor Robin Wilkinson said the jury's message, and beliefs, were clear. ""It says that out of anger, out of frustration, Mr. Ward pulled a gun and shot his wife in the face,"" she said of the verdict. Defense attorney Kirk Kirkconnell, meanwhile, said his client ""knows that we have good grounds to appeal (and) I think that he remains optimistic."" But the verdict still stings. ""He's disappointed,"" Kirkconnell told reporters. ""He hates leaving his family, obviously, as any man would."" During the trial, the defense contended that Ward loved his family, while prosecutors said the Florida millionaire's demeanor -- along with the evidence -- proves he murdered his 55-year-old wife. The defense rested its case Thursday, a week after testimony started. It asserted that Diane Ward died after a struggle over a loaded gun, not because of any ill intent of her husband. The prosecution pointed out that Ward called 911 the night of the shooting and said, ""I just shot my wife,"" then offered shifting stories as the call progressed and later in his conversations with relatives and colleagues. They said that his stories were inconsistent at best, while the evidence suggests that he pulled the trigger. ""What I would like to do is appeal to one thing, and one thing only: your common sense,"" fellow prosecutor Ken Lewis told the jury during the rebuttal phase of closing arguments Thursday.","NEW: The prosecutor says Ward killed his wife ""out of anger, out of frustration""

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- An Italian state police forensic expert who carried out the initial DNA examination presented at Amanda Knox's trial defended the methods used in an appeal hearing Tuesday. The questions put to Patrizia Stefanoni focused on a key piece of evidence -- a clasp on a bra belonging to murdered British student Meredith Kercher. The defense team is seeking to demonstrate that DNA evidence used in Knox's original trial is not conclusive as she appeals her conviction and 26-year sentence for the 2007 murder of her housemate. Two new forensic experts, professors Carla Vecchiotti and Stefano Conti, cast doubt this summer on the DNA evidence that played a role in the convictions of Knox and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito in 2009. Vecchiotti and Conti said the clasp from Kercher's bloodied bra, which allegedly contained Sollecito's DNA, was ""dirty"" and had been allowed to rust, making further testing futile. The evidence, the two argued, should be ""inadmissible."" But Stefanoni defended the methods and equipment used in the investigation under questioning Tuesday in a Perugia court by prosecutor Manuela Comodi. Stefanoni said the machine used for the DNA examination was clean -- and rejected suggestions the clasp had been contaminated. She said it had been moved but not turned over or stepped on at the scene. The hearing adjourned Tuesday after highly technical and heated debate as Adriano Tagliabracci, a forensic expert for Sollecito's defense team, testified in support of the findings of Vecchiotti and Conti. More argument over the DNA evidence in the case is expected Wednesday. But speaking outside court Tuesday, prosecutor Comodi said she considered that Stefanoni and a prosecution forensic expert, Giuseppe Novelli, had clearly proven the good work they had done. She suggested the prosecution team could ask for another DNA examination to be carried out. Francesco Maresca, an attorney for Kercher's family, echoed that message, saying the independent forensic team could have done more tests if they had doubts about the DNA evidence. Earlier, forensic expert Francesca Torricelli, used by the Kercher family's attorney, questioned in her testimony why the independent experts had not tested the small amount of DNA material found on another key piece of evidence -- a knife from Sollecito's home that prosecutors in 2009 said had traces of Knox's genetic material on the handle and Kercher's in a tiny groove on the blade. Vecchiotti testified in earlier hearings that the knife tested negative for blood and the amount of DNA said to be Kercher's was so low, it could not be examined again with any conclusions. But Torricelli said Tuesday she had witnessed the work of Vecchiotti and Conti, and that the machinery they used during their investigation could check extremely low quantities of DNA. Meanwhile, Novelli told the court that for him, and others, it was not a question of ""quantity of DNA, but rather quality"" to carry out a successful examination. Vecchiotti and Conti have said records about the machine that did the DNA testing were missing, suggesting the testing process may have been unreliable. On Monday, the prosecutor said the records had been found and asked the judge to admit them as evidence. The defense argued they should not be admitted because they were not in the files originally given to the new experts. Comodi said Vecchiotti and Conti could have had them if they had asked for them. Knox's father, Curt, told reporters outside court Monday that he believed the independent experts ""have done a very good job in evaluating the information ... and I don't see it breaking down at this point. I see that it has been good for Amanda."" CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","NEW: Experts from the police, defense and prosecution disagree over DNA evidence .

"The kidnapped father of Chelsea footballer John Obi Mikel has been released alive by his captors in the Nigerian city of Kano. Michael Obi went missing from Jos -- the main city in Plateau State in central Nigeria -- on August 12 and had not been seen or heard of since.

"(CNN) -- Four years ago a shock defeat by France sent a rugby-mad nation into mourning, but New Zealand's All Blacks erased some of that hurt with a comprehensive 37-17 vanquishing of their longtime bogey team on Saturday. Captain Richie McCaw looked a broken man after the 2007 World Cup quarterfinal defeat in Cardiff, but he was able to celebrate his 100th international appearance in style as the Kiwis lived up to their status as tournament favorites on home soil in Auckland and reached the quarterfinals. ""We realized we had to take a step up this week,"" the flanker told the tournament website after victory against a nation who also ended New Zealand's 1999 World Cup hopes in the semifinals. ""We had to absorb a fair bit early on and I was proud of the way the boys did that. When we got the opportunity we put the points on the board. The boys held their cool, and when we had a chance we took it. I'm very happy with the way things went."" No. 8 Adam Thomson and wing Cory Jane scored inside the first 20 minutes, then fullback Israel Dagg dotted down either side of halftime to give New Zealand a 29-3 advantage. France, losing semifinalists in 2007, showed some steel with tries to Maxime Mermoz and replacement Francois Trinh-Duc but NZ substitute Sonny Bill Williams crossed late to seal victory. The bonus point gave the All Blacks a maximum 15 points from three Group A outings ahead of their final match against Canada on October 2. France's Les Bleus still have a five-point advantage over third-placed Tonga, who they meet the previous day. Marc Lievremont's team will likely play England in the last eight after Martin Johnson's men responded to stinging criticism from their coach to thrash Romania 67-3 earlier on Saturday and take control of Group B. Johnson, a World Cup winner as a player in 2003, was unhappy with unimpressive victories over Argentina and Georgia but this time his players delivered with 10 tries in Dunedin to seal a last-eight spot as one of the pool's top two teams. Wingers Mark Cueto and Chris Ashton both scored three tries against the under-strength Romanians, who face East European rivals Georgia in their final match. England close against ""Auld Enemy"" Scotland, who have struggled so far in the tournament and face a tough test against 2007 semifinalists Argentina on Sunday in a match that will have a big bearing on the group. ""In some aspects of the game, we didn't really get tested,"" Johnson said. ""Next week is going to be a different game. This was what it was and we did a job. Next week it really starts, because it will be a scrap.""","New Zealand beat France 37-17 to reach Rugby World Cup quarterfinals .

"Paris (CNN) -- Dominique Strauss-Kahn arrived in Paris on Sunday morning, less than two weeks after a judge dismissed sexual assault charges against him in an international scandal that altered France's political landscape. The former International Monetary Fund chief was greeted with applause at a Paris airport before leaving in a private car and coming home to his apartment. He was accompanied by his wife, journalist Anne Sinclair. On Saturday, Strauss-Kahn was mobbed by reporters in New York as he left the brownstone where he had been staying. His homecoming marks the end of a four-month court battle involving a man who had been favored to be the next president of France. Strauss-Kahn was pulled off a Paris-bound plane on May 14 in New York over accusations he sexually assaulted a Guinean maid in a luxury hotel suite in the city. Days later, he resigned from the International Monetary Fund, spent a few days in jail and was put under house arrest. His lawyers have maintained his innocence throughout the process. ""There was an act in that room that was consensual, not forcible,"" Benjamin Brafman said. Questions arose over the credibility of the accuser, Nafissatou Diallo, prompting prosecutors to back off. In July, prosecutors said Strauss-Kahn is no longer under house arrest and dropped the charges on August 23, citing the accuser's credibility issues. ""If we do not believe her beyond a reasonable doubt, we cannot ask a jury to do so,"" prosecutors said at the time. Strauss-Kahn largely remained in New York even after a judge removed his house arrest restrictions. The diplomat's return to Paris on Sunday marks his first since the scandal broke out. Strauss-Kahn's arrest sent shock waves through France and redefined the landscape of the country's upcoming presidential race. His homecoming raises the possibility of his return to politics or a prominent position in the government. Strauss-Kahn still faces a civil suit from Diallo and an accusation of attempted rape by a French writer. The diplomat and his wife have been one of France's power couples since they married in 1989.

"Near Kherbet Al-Jouz, Syria (CNN) -- As the Syrian military on Tuesday continued its relentless advance against protesters, citizens who had fled their homes for safety related ""horror story upon horror story"" to a reporter who managed to enter the country. Despite the Syrian government's consistent refusal to give CNN and other international news organizations permission to enter the country, a CNN reporter crossed the Turkish border into northwestern Syria for a few hours Tuesday. She spoke to people at a makeshift campsite near Kherbet al-Jouz, where tarpaulins strung between trees provided the only shelter from the elements for the hundreds of Syrians encamped there. One family said they had spent an entire night standing rather than lie in the mud. One man tried to protect himself from the rain with branches and a piece of tarpaulin. Watch: Misery at refugee camp in Syria . Families bathed in a muddy stream, where they also washed the few clothes they had brought with them. Thousands of Syrians head to Turkey . Illness has already begun to spread, said Mohammed Merri, a pharmacist who carried supplies with him as he fled, then set up something of a field hospital once he arrived at the camp. ""My biggest problem is the children and people with heart disease,"" he said. ""I don't have the medicine for that."" Most of the refugees here are from the region that includes the nearby city of Jisr al-Shugur, which government forces entered Sunday. A number of people said they had witnessed bombings around the city as they fled. One man said soldiers shot at him, and a woman said she witnessed death. ""They set our fields on fire, destroyed our homes,"" said a woman who added that she was planning to try to cross into Turkey for protection. But others said they would remain in Syria, some hoping to find loved ones lost in the chaos, others hoping against hope to return to their homes. Mousa, 26, said he tried to do just that a few days ago, but didn't succeed. ""I was on my friend's motorcycle and suddenly I saw the military advancing through the olive groves,"" he said. ""And they started shooting at me."" Jisr al-Shugur is not the only town in the area that was occupied by the military. On Sunday, the army also entered Dair Alzour and set up a presence in four areas of the town, an activist said. They arrived aboard tanks and pickup trucks carrying heavy weaponry, the activist said. But protests were continuing in defiance of the military, the activist said. Since such protests started in Dair Alzour a month ago, four people have been killed and about 200 wounded, some of them seriously, the activist said. In addition, some 1,500 people have been arrested. But on Tuesday, about 16 tanks were leaving Dair Alzour heading toward Albu Kamal, on the border with Iraq, the activist said. Residents of the tribal area have strong connections with tribes in eastern Iraq. As of Monday, 6,817 Syrian refugees had crossed into Turkey, said Metin Corabatir of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees office in Ankara. Amnesty International said last week it believes more than 1,100 people -- including 82 children -- have been killed in Syria since the crackdown started in mid-March. As a result of such reports and the distribution on social media platforms of chilling videos depicting violence, Syria's government has drawn international condemnation -- albeit no response from the U.N. Security Council. ""The Security Council has failed, so far, to react on Syria, which I think is extraordinary and disappointing,"" said Carne Ross, a former U.N. diplomat. The United States has imposed sanctions on President Bashar al-Assad and other senior Syrian officials because of human rights abuses, freezing any assets held in the country. The four European members of the Security Council -- Britain, France, Germany and Portugal -- have said the council must act. But ambassadors from China and Russia disagree, stating that U.N. action would risk further destabilizing the key Middle Eastern nation. ""China and Russia are concerned that if the U.N. Security Council feels empowered to address the major human rights violations occurring around the world, eventually the Security Council will focus on issues within China and in the neighborhood of Russia,"" said Jamie Metzl, executive vice president of the Asia Society. ""The failure of the U.N. Security Council to act is a tragedy,"" he said. Some countries' reluctance to act may be traceable to the Security Council's resolution aimed at protecting civilians in Libya. Russia and others quickly signed off on the resolution, but -- nearly three months later -- efforts by NATO forces appear caught in a stalemate. As for Jisr al-Shugur, the Syrian military seized control of the town over the weekend, a network of human rights activists said Monday. The Syrian government gave a similar assessment. ""Army units on Monday restored security and tranquility to the city of Jisr al-Shugur,"" state-run news agency SANA reported. The Syrian government insists it is stopping ""armed terrorist groups"" who carried out a ""massacre"" in the city; opposition activists say the government's claims are a ruse to justify a crackdown on demonstrators demanding government reform, in keeping with the wave of political protests across the Middle East and North Africa this year. Throughout Syria's uprising, its government has described activist leaders as terrorists looking to destabilize the country. This month, the government said 120 members of the security forces had been killed by ""armed groups"" in Jisr al-Shugur. But Syrian refugees who have fled to Turkey said some Syrian soldiers rebelled after being ordered to fire on unarmed protesters and instead started fighting among themselves. Syrian opposition members, including human rights activist Wissam Tarif, also said the deaths likely stemmed from a rift within security forces. Because of the restrictions on journalists' entry into Syria, CNN has been unable to independently confirm the accounts. CNN's Richard Roth, Salma Abdelaziz and Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","NEW: ""They set our fields on fire, destroyed our homes,"" one woman says .

"(CNN) -- A day after Saudi King Abdullah announced greater political participation for women in the future, some Saudis questioned just how big a change may really be on the horizon. Some women's rights activists who were initially elated by Sunday's announcement said they were feeling disappointed because the changes do not kick in immediately. ""We don't really think now that we've been promised a real right,"" said one. But a member of Saudi Arabia's Consultative Council called one of the changes the king announced ""hugely important."" King Abdullah announced two changes Sunday, which would be historic for Saudi Arabia. He said women will be allowed to serve as members of the Shura Council, the Consultative Council that advises the king. Its 150 members are appointed. The king also said women will be allowed to run as candidates and nominate candidates in the next set of municipal elections. It is unknown when those may ultimately take place. The changes do not apply to elections scheduled for this Thursday -- which will be only the second set of elections in the kingdom since 1963. While the king did not use the word ""vote"" in his remarks, allowing women to take part in the nomination process would amount to voting within Saudi Arabia's system. ""We don't really think now that we've been promised a real right because it's been postponed."" said Wajeha Al-Huwaider, a prominent Saudi women's rights activist. ""The king could have said this is happening now because the next election is going to happen this Thursday -- it wouldn't have been a problem to postpone this election for a month and have women participate in this round."" ""For the Shura council it's another year and a half, for the municipal election it's another four years -- anything could happen during that time,"" she said. ""Whatever can be given can be taken."" ""That will give time for extremists to reverse the decision,"" said Al-Huwaider. ""The government thinks they will give time for people to adjust to the idea, but if you're against something, you'll never change your mind and if you're for it you'll never change your mind. Why do they hesitate when it comes to women's issues? The government always hesitates."" This Thursday's elections come after more than two years of delays, so any time frame for when future elections may take place is not seen as a solid plan. Amnesty International said the announcement that women will be given the right to vote is ""no guarantee of rights."" ""It is a welcome, albeit limited, step along the long road towards gender equality in Saudi Arabia, and a testament to the long struggle of women's rights activists there,"" said Philip Luther, the human rights group's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, in a statement. ""It is, however, much overdue and does not go nearly far enough."" ""The whole system of women's subordination to men in Saudi Arabia needs to be dismantled,"" Luther said. Saleh Al-Namla, one of the 150 members of the Consultative Council, expressed no doubts that women will join the council in 2013, and called it a very significant step. ""I think it's hugely important,"" he said. ""They will be full members of the Shura Council just like anybody else. We have women advisers, but in the next round of Shura Council appointments, they will be full members of the committee just like any other member."" The U.S. State Department notes that there are 13 advisers on the council. Al-Namla said the 13 advise the council, but are not among the 150 members. The changes the king announced follow increasing pressure, from outside and inside Saudi Arabia, to give women the right to vote and greater political participation. Earlier this year, Saudi women activists wrote the government requesting that women be allowed to vote and be candidates in the municipal elections, according to the U.S. Library of Congress. Saudi Arabia's ""Minister of Municipality and Rural Affairs declared that Saudi women will not be able to either run or vote in this election,"" the Library of Congress reported on its blog. ""According to news reports, the Minister stated that the ban on women's participation is due to the lack of segregated voting facilities."" When election centers opened in April for voters to register, some groups of women turned up and were turned away. It was one of the first public acts of the ""Saudi Women Revolution,"" a movement set up to campaign for the end of Saudi Arabia's discriminatory laws. In June, a number of Saudi women took to the streets -- in cars -- to demand the right for women to drive and travel freely in the country. There are no specific traffic laws that make it illegal for women to drive in Saudi Arabia. However, religious edicts are often interpreted as a prohibition of female drivers. Such edicts also prevent women from opening bank accounts, obtaining passports or even going to school without the presence of a male guardian. Authorities stopped Manal al Sharif, 32, for driving a car May 21 and detained her the next day. She said she was forced to sign a form promising not to drive again and spent a week in jail. Her case became a rallying cry for women activists. The U.S. State Department's human rights report on Saudi Arabia, published in 2011, notes many challenges facing women in Saudi Arabia in 2010: . ""By law a female rape victim is at fault for illegal 'mixing of genders' and is punished along with the perpetrator."" ""Women continued to face discrimination under the law and remained uninformed about their rights. Although they may legally own property and are entitled to financial support from their guardian, women have few political or social rights, and society does not treat them as equal members."" ""The guardianship system requires that every woman have a close male relative as her 'guardian' with the authority to approve her travel ."" ""Women risk arrest for riding in a vehicle driven by a male who is not an employee or a close male relative."" ""Women also faced discrimination in courts, where the testimony of one man equals that of two women."" ""The law requires a woman to obtain the permission of a male guardian to work if the type of business is not 'deemed appropriate for a woman.'"" The report also noted some improvements. ""Increased efforts to protect women and children against domestic violence through the National Family Safety Program, as well as the Human Rights Commission, reflected a significant human rights achievement,"" the report said. It also noted that in 2010, ""women increasingly participated in political life, albeit with significantly less status than men.""

"(CNN) -- Three siblings caught after allegedly firing at Colorado police during a high-speed chase appeared in court Monday, facing a ballooning list of charges against them. Lee Grace Dougherty faces 29 charges, while her brothers Dylan Stanley Dougherty and Ryan Edward Dougherty face 23 and 24 charges respectively, according to complaints filed Monday in Huerfano County District Court in Walsenberg. That includes five counts of attempted second-degree murder for 29-year-old Lee Grace Dougherty, for allegedly threatening five police officers with a gun on August 10. She also faces eight first-degree assault charges and one count of aggravated motor vehicle theft, among others. Her brothers face a similar laundry list of charges. Both Ryan, 21, and Dylan, 26, for instance, are charged with five counts of attempted second-degree murder and five of first-degree assault, among others. Following their court appearance Monday, the trio's next scheduled appearance is by ""telephone setting"" on Wednesday at 1:15 p.m., according to the Colorado court's website. Besides charges in Huerfano County, in southern Colorado, the trio also have been indicted in Pueblo County. There, Dylan Dougherty has been charged with attempted murder, while his siblings are each charged with assault. They are also accused of crimes in Florida and Georgia. Police arrested the three after they crashed their car along a rural Colorado highway. Police say they were shooting at officers with an AK-47 during a chase at speeds up to 120 mph. According to investigators' affidavits, Ryan Dougherty was driving Wednesday as Dylan Dougherty fired an AK-47 at pursuing officers. ""We weren't trying to hurt anyone; we just wanted them to get back,"" Lee Dougherty told investigators after her arrest, according to one affidavit. ""They were way back, and we could barely see them. We were getting shot at, then we wrecked."" Lee Dougherty said she pointed a gun at Walsenburg Police Chief James Chamberlain, according to the affidavit. But Chamberlain fired first, wounding her in the leg. The trio is wanted in armed bank robbery in Georgia and the attempted murder of a Florida police officer on August 2. They escaped from Florida with police in pursuit after they shot out a cruiser's tire, according to authorities. Colorado authorities said the siblings spent the night before their capture in the San Isabel National Forest, about 10 to 12 miles west of Colorado City. Earlier this month, in Huerfano County, bond was set for the three siblings at $1.5 million each. And in Pueblo County, Dylan Dougherty has $1 million bail, while his siblings have been ordered held on $250,000 each.","A sister and two brothers face 29, 24 and 23 charges respectively in a Colorado court .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Three bomb blasts in northwest Pakistan killed four security personnel Tuesday and destroyed an oil tanker carrying fuel for NATO forces in Afghanistan, police told CNN. One of the bombs was planted along a road and exploded as a military convoy drove by, said senior police official Muhammad Iftikhar Khan. Two soldiers were killed in the explosion and four others were injured, Khan said. The blast took place in a village in Bannu, a district adjacent to the Taliban strongholds of Pakistan's tribal region along the Afghan border. About an hour north of Bannu, a roadside bomb in the outskirts of Peshawar killed two policemen and injured two others as they drove by in their police van, police official Amjad Khan told CNN. A third planted bomb in the outskirts of Peshawar destroyed a parked oil tanker and damaged four others, Khan said. All five tankers were carrying fuel for NATO troops in Afghanistan. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but militants in the region have frequently targeted Pakistani security forces and supply trucks headed for Afghanistan in an effort to undermine U.S. and NATO efforts there. On Monday, armed militants in southwest Pakistan torched two other oil tankers, said Azam Shahwani, a senior government official in Baluchistan province. No one was injured, but two of the oil tankers were destroyed, he said. More than half of the supplies for NATO forces in Afghanistan travels through Pakistan.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Six members of one of Mexico's most active drug gangs, including someone accused of being the organization's bookkeeper, were arrested this week, federal authorities said Wednesday. Federal policemen stand at a checkpoint in the state of Michoacan last week. The arrests were the most recent in a string of high-level apprehensions targeting La Familia Michoacana; the cartel operates in its namesake state of Michoacan in southwest Mexico. Armando Quintero Guerra, who federal police said was in charge of the cartel's expenses, was among six people arrested Tuesday, said Ramon Eduardo Pequeno, head of the anti-drug unit of the public security ministry. Also arrested was Lourdes Medina Hernandez, who is in a relationship with La Familia's top boss, Servando Gomez, Pequeno said at a news conference. The string of arrests followed the killing of 12 off-duty federal police officers whose bodies were found with signs of torture off a remote highway on July 14. Hit men for La Familia Michoacana linked to the killings were arrested last week, authorities said. Authorities more than tripled the number of federal police officers patrolling Michoacan in response to the killings. The killings were among a series of reprisals by La Familia after federal police captured one of the group's top leaders, authorities said. An unprecedented wave of violence has washed over Mexico since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after coming into office in 2006. More than 10,000 people have died in that time span, about 1,000 of them police.

"New York (CNN) -- Lawyers for ex-International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit by his accuser in a now-dismissed sexual assault case Monday, arguing his job gave him immunity from civil cases. As head of the IMF, Strauss-Kahn had the same protections as diplomats, his attorneys wrote in court papers. U.S. courts recognize those protections as ""customary international law"" even though the United States has not signed the U.N. convention that specifically includes IMF officials, they wrote. Though Strauss-Kahn resigned as IMF managing director after his arrest in May, his immunity continued while he was under house arrest in New York, they told a New York state judge in the Bronx, where the lawsuit was filed. Manhattan prosecutors dropped sexual assault charges against him in August amid questions about the credibility of his accuser, Nafissatou Diallo, who sued Strauss-Kahn as prosecutors prepared to dismiss the case. Prosecutors later disclosed that Diallo had made false statements ""in matters great and small,"" undercutting their case against the 62-year-old banker. Diallo, a Guinean immigrant who worked as a maid at the Sofitel Hotel, accused Strauss-Kahn of sexually assaulting her in his hotel room and of smearing her reputation as he fought the charges against him. Strauss-Kahn was considered a possible contender for the French presidency before his arrest. In a television interview following his return to Paris, he confessed to a ""moral weakness"" and an ""inappropriate relationship"" with Diallo, but denied any violence or aggression. In their filing Monday, his attorneys also asked a judge to bar other allegations of improper sexual acts if the lawsuit is allowed to stand. French journalist Tristane Banon has filed a complaint against Strauss-Kahn in France, alleging he attempted to sexually assault her in 2003; he has filed a counter-suit alleging slander.","Ex-IMF chief says he had immunity similar to diplomats .

"(CNN) -- Residents of the Atchafalaya Basin in south-central Louisiana are as diverse as the unique waterways that course through the heart of Cajun country. Of African, European, Caribbean and Native American descent, for generations these Louisianans have made their living from the water and sea, chasing after shad and crawfish or working on and supplying oil rigs and refineries. They're also a resilient lot. A roster of hurricanes is a constant reminder of the dangers and damage wrought by nature: Betsy, Gustav, Ike, Rita and, of course, Katrina. Now the danger comes from the north, instead of the Gulf of Mexico, in the form of a historic flood. ""People are used to flooding,"" said Drake Pothier, president of the Houma-Terrebonne Chamber of Commerce. ""But they are more used to it coming from the opposite direction."" Gov. Bobby Jindal on Tuesday predicted that as many as 3 million acres of his state could be affected by the flooding spawned by the Mississippi River. Some 500 National Guard members have been mobilized to meet the challenge. Twenty-one parishes issued emergency declarations and 16 hospitals are identified as being at high risk. As has been the case upriver from Missouri south to Tennessee, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is predicting its system of levees and flood walls will hold, keeping the river from inundating most Louisiana towns and farms that line its banks. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the coming days is expected to decide whether to open the Morganza Spillway above Baton Rouge. It hasn't been opened since 1973. Such a move would spare Baton Rouge and New Orleans even more damage from the floods, but it would flood populated and rural areas in the swampy Atchafalaya Basin. The basin is home to the Atchafalaya River and myriad tributaries. There's plenty to worry about in communities such as Butte La Rose, Bayou Sorrel, Morgan City, Krotz Springs and Houma. They have varying levels of flood defense. Some residents are posting questions and fears on the Corps Facebook page. ""I'm going to wait a little longer"" before deciding on evacuating, said Leanne Boudreaux, 33, of Krotz Springs, an Atchafalaya River community that doesn't feature a traffic signal. It does have a levee. Boudreaux is too young to remember the landmark 1973 flood, but she knows what nature can dish out. Gustav heavily damaged her residence in 2008 and, as the mother of two, she is paying attention to the latest developments. She considers the river dangerous. Despite the number of workers at an oil refinery in town, many people have to go to Baton Rouge, about 40 miles east, to work and shop, she said Tuesday. Camping and fishing are popular in Butte La Rose, 20 miles south in St. Martin Parish. Downstream, in Morgan City, teacher Julie Cortez McCarty, 42, is glad the oil town has a sea wall, but she is concerned about water backing in from Lake Palourde and other waterways. ""We are surrounded by water,"" she said. ""Morgan City is pretty much an island."" It's the waiting on the Corps' decision on the Morganza Spillway that's causing stress, McCarty told CNN. ""They won't give us a definite yes or no if they will open it or not,"" she said. Like others, McCarty's worried the water could remain for a couple of months and affect jobs. She's also somewhat philosophical about the greater good when it comes to deciding on spillways and other efforts to channel water to less populated or less settled regions. ""How do you decide whose life or property is more important?"" McCarty asked. Morgan City is one of several areas that could be affected by the opening of the Morganza Spillway. Opening it would relieve pressure on the levee system and reduce the record-setting volume of water heading down the Mississippi. If that spillway is opened, Jindal predicted that roughly 2,500 people and 2,000 structures would be at risk directly inside the floodway. Another 22,500 people and 11,000 structures would be affected by backwater flooding, he said. On Monday, officials began opening gates on another spillway, the Bonnet Carre in Reserve, Louisiana -- about 35 miles west of New Orleans. Twenty-eight gates were opened on Monday and another 44 were opened Tuesday. The Corps released maps outlining areas that could be flooded in the Atchafalaya Basin if the Morganza Spillway is opened. ""They expect the height of the water to reach between 5 and upwards of 25 feet above ground elevation, causing flooding through many southern portions of our state,"" Jindal said. ""We've been hearing about the possibility of flooding,"" Dan Gober, who lives in the town of Gibson, about 15 miles east of Morgan City, told CNN affiliate WWL. ""We've not been hearing any specifics as to how high the water might get."" Gibson residents remember the last time the spillway was opened, saying it put 3 to 4 feet of water in their homes. And it could be even worse this time, Terrebonne Parish President Michel Claudet said. What was farmland in 1973 is now residential land, he said. ""At that time, we were not as populated."" Terrebonne Parish has already declared a state of emergency, and its website was directing residents to sandbag distribution centers. Measures aimed at minimizing flooding were being implemented, Claudet said. Levees were being elevated and reinforced. ""Generally speaking, people are very concerned,"" the Chamber's Pothier said. The western part of the parish is expected to see the largest impact, he said, adding Houma is expected to come through the flooding in pretty good shape. Terrebonne Parish has about 110,000 residents and has one of the strongest local economies in the state, with an emphasis on oil and gas, health care and seafood, Pothier said. Unemployment is low and the parish has retained strong home values, he said. In the Assumption Parish town of Belle Rose, Carol Vincent said she is ""going nuts"" and trying to hope for the best, but ""we're expecting the worst."" ""We're all on pins and needles,"" she said. Her husband and some friends put sandbags around her property, and plan to take further action to protect it. Her home flooded once before, she said, but only one room. ""It ruined my carpet,"" she said. In West Feliciana Parish, ""our biggest concern is Angola State Prison,"" said parish President Ken Dawson. The prison, officially the Louisiana State Penitentiary, is protected by a levee system, he said. ""A lot of those inmates have been moved out of the prison to other facilities, and that is going to continue until they get to a number they can house on higher ground with no problem."" Before 2005's Hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans metropolitan area saw significant flooding in May 1995, when 24 inches of rain fell in some neighborhoods, said forecaster Phil Grigsby of the National Weather Service. If the Morganza Spillway is not opened, Morgan City's high water will crest May 25 at about 9.5 feet, said Grigsby. That level will be 12 to 13 feet if the waterway is opened. Levels in Bayou Sorrel will be 7.5 feet higher if the spillway plan is put into place. The increase will be more modest in Butte La Rose, Grigsby said. Using sand baskets, National Guardsmen are raising a 5-mile stretch of earthen levees on the lake side of Morgan City, said planning and zoning director Carl Kraemer. He expects the levees, which were fortified after the 1973 floods, to hold the water if the Morganza Spillway is opened. Still, the city doesn't know exactly what to expect when the 140-mile long Atchafalaya River crests later this month. ""We're positive and worried at the same time,"" Kraemer said.","500 National Guard members mobilized .
Residents in low-lying areas have been put on alert .
There is concern about a plan to open the Morganza Spillway .

"(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of Syrians marched Sunday in memory of anti-government protesters killed on Friday, calling them ""martyrs"" and chanting for freedom, demonstrators told CNN. ""The area was so packed with thousands of people it was difficult to move,"" said human rights activist Wissam Tarif, calling it ""the biggest crowd I have ever seen since the unrest started."" After eight victims were buried, protesters shouted slogans including, ""The people demand the fall of the regime,"" Tarif said. Other demonstrators chanted, ""With our blood, with our souls, we will sacrifice for you martyrs,"" at the Grand Mosque in the Damascus suburb of Douma, the site of Friday's protest, another eyewitness said. National security forces left the marchers alone because the dead had been declared martyrs, the source said, requesting not to be named for safety reasons. The government did not immediately confirm there had been a march or that security forces had steered clear. The Damascus Center for Human Rights Studies said Sunday that 123 people have died since the start of the unrest in Syria last month. Opposition leaders circulated a list of demands, saying that if the regime were to respond positively, they would not call for the government's collapse. The demands include the immediate release of political prisoners, lifting of emergency and martial law, and withdrawal of intelligence forces from Syrian cities. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad appointed a new prime minister earlier on Sunday. Adel Safar, a former academic with a doctorate in biotechnology, was agriculture minister for eight years before being appointed to lead the government, the state news agency said. The government resigned last week in the face of protests that have left at least dozens dead. Al-Assad accepted their resignations on Tuesday, but made no further concessions in a widely anticipated speech to the nation on Wednesday. At least 15 people were killed in Douma on Friday, Tarif said Sunday. He based his tally on calls to hospitals and relatives of the victims, he said. Eight people were buried Sunday, he added. Another person was killed in Al Sanameen near Daraa, activists said earlier. The anti-regime demonstrations pulsating across Syria resulted in a security hunt for armed snipers and a wave of arrests Saturday. Syrian security forces were searching for members of an ""armed group"" that killed ""a number of citizens and security forces"" in Douma on Friday, the Syrian Arab News Agency reported on Saturday. SANA reported that a girl was killed when the armed group opened fire on civilians in the city of Homs. The agency cited an official source as saying that snipers from the group fired at citizens and security forces from rooftops. ""Security forces are pursuing the members of the armed group that terrorized the citizens through firing randomly,"" SANA reported, citing the source without identifying the official or the alleged armed group. Activists and witnesses dispute the government account, telling CNN that government snipers fired shots at unarmed protesters and government forces beat demonstrators. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said security forces in the volatile southern city of Daraa and in Homs arrested  about 20 people on Saturday after demonstrations the day before. Along with the protests in Douma, Daraa, Homs and Al Sanameen, people also took to the streets in Latakia, Baniyas and Kamishli on Friday, activists told CNN. Before Friday's fighting, dozens of people were killed in the last two weeks across Syria, with many deaths reported in the southern city of Daraa, where popular demonstrations started, and the coastal city of Latakia, activists say. The list of opposition demands circulated Sunday called for a decree guaranteeing the right to peaceful demonstrations and the ""termination of all threatening and intimidating acts against our sons and daughters in our schools whether by school staff or secret service agents in and around the schools and to refrain from obliging them to participate in demonstrations supporting the regime."" It called for an amended constitution accommodating ""a multi-party democracy"" and guaranteeing ""basic human rights,"" the establishment ""of a truly independent judiciary system,"" freedom of information and expression and an end to ""the existing corruption in Syria.""

"(CNN) -- The big story of the GOP presidential race these days is how Gov. Rick Perry has suddenly burst into the sky as a new star. Whether he will continue to burn brightly or flame out is probably the most important question no one can answer. Only a few weeks ago, the Republican field seemed both weak and settled. Michele Bachmann introduced some uncertainty when she sparkled at the CNN debate in New Hampshire and won the straw poll in Iowa. But she seemed unlikely to catch the front-runner, Mitt Romney. Indeed, he was on cruise control, comfortably out front in polls and money. Then, boom! Perry jumps in and turns the race upside down. A CNN poll taken over the weekend showed Perry building a 12-point lead over Romney among Republican voters, 30-18 with Sarah Palin third and Ron Paul slipping to fourth. Did last night's debate change the underlying dynamics? Let's await the verdict of voters, but my sense is that Rick Perry walked out the same way he walked in: front-runner. Mitt Romney has a better command of the facts and, at the CNN debate last night in Tampa, again won on points. But Perry has ""command presence"" -- that ineffable quality people look for in leaders. Especially in hard, uncertain times, people want someone strong and decisive up front, steering. Romney looks more the manager, Perry the leader. There is something muscular, tough, almost animalistic about Perry that seems to be resonating among Republicans -- at least for the moment. It's partly the way he carries himself -- shoulders back, chest forward, a confident stride. It's partly his smile as others beat up on him. But it's mostly the way he talks -- simple, straight-to-the-point, colloquial, no qualifiers, cut the B.S. Conservatism served straight up. People are so tired of lying, pandering and political correctness that they enjoy the change: ""He didn't say Ponzi scheme, did he? Wow!"" He may not be book smart, but he is street smart -- and wily. His appeal may well be limited to tea partiers and the hard right. Judging from Twitter traffic, many others who tuned in last night were horrified by what they saw. ""Lock all those candidates up in the hall so they won't destroy the country,"" was a typical response from the left. And there were groans as well that the evening was not only too right but too white. We remain a splintered people, so that it may be exceedingly difficult for anyone to govern in the next few years. What do you think of the GOP candidates? Still, the tendency to write off Perry -- especially among the Eastern elite -- is a mistake. Last week, after his debut in the Reagan Library debate where he called Social Security a failure and a Ponzi scheme, the word went out from the commentariat that Perry was toast. Wrong! If anything, he went up among Republican voters, not down. For anyone who was around 30 years ago, the comparisons to the Reagan campaign of 1980 are obvious: One of the most qualified men in history (George H.W. Bush) versus an ex-Hollywood actor. Both were good men, but there was a difference: While Bush knew his stuff, Reagan knew how to lead. In uncertain times, voters in both the primaries and the general elections turned to the candidate who offered strength and decisiveness. Gerald Seib has an excellent column in today's Wall Street Journal that explores in more depth. Let's be clear: Perry could well flame out in coming weeks. He could easily get into trouble for what he says. His tendency to shoot from the lip brings back uncomfortable memories of George W. There are those who insist that he could also get into trouble for what he may have done. His detractors in Texas are spreading the word that he plays on the edges and plays rough. His rivals are starting to dig as are out-of-state press. Will anything come of it? No one knows. Some in Texas have stirred up trouble against him for years, and he keeps winning. Ironically, if Perry does flame out, he will have done Mitt Romney an enormous favor. Not only has Perry made Romney seem more mainstream as a candidate, but he has also lifted the quality of Romney's game -- Romney was much crisper and more animated last night than when he was on cruise control. If Romney now beats Perry for the nomination, he will have much better chops for the general election. Still, those in the White House who are hoping that Perry is their opponent next fall should take a second look. As scary as he may seem to many, Perry could offer the tough, decisive leadership that a lot of people want in tough times. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen.","David Gergen: The big news in GOP contest is the sudden rise of Rick Perry .
He says Texas governor isn't winning debates on points .

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- The death toll from historic floods in southern Brazil continued to creep upward Monday, with 112 reported dead, the state news agency said. People make their way through floodwaters in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina last week. Officials say 19 people remain missing and nearly 79,000 residents have been left homeless, according to the state-run Agencia Brasil. Many of the deaths have been caused by mudslides. The city of Ilhota in the hard-hit state of Santa Catarina has recorded 37 fatalities, the most of any municipality, Agencia Brasil said. In the city of Maximus in Luis Alves state, eight rescuers were injured over the weekend, one of them gravely, the news agency said. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Monday that Santa Catarina will be rebuilt and become just as strong as it was. ""We cannot lose hope,"" Lula said. ""We must be convinced that people will reconstruct the state of Santa Catarina. There is a national solidarity never seen before in the history of the country."" Lula flew over some of the flooded areas last week and proclaimed the disaster one of the worst in the country's history. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" Lula said Thursday. He said last week he was releasing 1.97 billion Reals (US$854 million) in aid to the affected areas, especially Santa Catarina. Officials have distributed 880 tons of food, nearly 1 million liters of water and 60 tons of clothing, toys and cleaning and personal hygiene material, Agencia Brasil said Monday. Authorities also were warning residents in flooded areas to be careful with food and water they consume. Food that has been under water or moist should not be eaten unless it's in a sealed plastic bag or a can, they said. The health secretary for Santa Catarina also said residents who drink contaminated water run the risk of getting hepatitis A and diarrhea. The disaster also is having an economic effect, with bridges, roads, houses and buildings destroyed. The federation of industries said the closed port in Itajai is costing $33 million a day. The port is the major terminal for frozen goods in Brazil and second in the transport of containers, Agencia Brasil said. Port Superintendent Arnaldo Schmitt said last week part of the terminal could be back in operation in two weeks.","NEW: Authorities warn about health risks of flood-contaminated water, food .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Three African armies launched a raid on a rebel camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the three armies announced on Monday. Jospeh Kony, leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, in 2006 in southern Sudan. Congo's national army joined Ugandan forces and southern Sudanese militia in a military operation Sunday meant to root out pockets of the Lord's Resistance Army -- which had been preparing to launch an assault on Uganda from camps in eastern Congo, a joint statement from the three said. The operation comes amid stalled peace negotiations intended to disarm LRA leader Joseph Kony and end a rebellion that began in Uganda over two decades ago when President Yoweri Museveni came to power. Targeting rebel hideouts in Garamba, the triumvirate force said it was trying to rescue hostages and hunt down LRA leaders, accused of fomenting recent attacks against civilians in the region, including DRC, southern Sudan, and Central African Republic. LRA spokespeople could not be immediately reached for comment. The Lord's Resistance Army -- led by Kony, who claims spiritual powers -- sought to overthrow its government, demanding the constitution be replaced with a version of the Ten Commandments. The Ugandan government and the rebels agreed to a cessation of hostilities in August 2006, but there have been outbursts of fighting since. The LRA, which the U.S. State Department describes as ""vicious and cult-like,"" has been known for its unpredictable behavior. Local villagers and international human rights groups have accused the rebels of committing widespread abuses, including recruiting young boys and girls as soldiers and sex slaves. In October 2005, the International Criminal Court unsealed arrest warrants for five LRA commanders, including Kony, who is alleged to have ""ordered LRA forces to begin a campaign of attacks against civilians in Uganda"" in 2002, according to the court. The 33 counts against Kony included 21 counts of war crimes. Charges also included sexual enslavement, rape, inducing rape, directing attacks against civilians and forced enlisting of children to fight, according to a news release from the court. Eastern Congo has been riddled by another conflict -- warfare between rebels and government forces that has uprooted 250,000 people since summer and has claimed the lives of many. That conflict is an offshoot of the Rwandan conflict dating back to the early 1990s, when hundreds of thousands of Rwandans were killed in ethnic battles between minority Tutsi and majority Hutu. CNN's David McKenzie and Carolina Sanchez contributed to this report.","Three African armies raid rebel camp in Democratic Republic of Congo .

"(CNN) -- It's not just for French kissing or for showing your dissatisfaction. Besides showing off at concerts, licking lollipops, and teasing, the tongue could help people gain mobility. Aside from everyday functions of chewing, swallowing, talking and tasting, the tongue has new uses such as steering wheelchairs and helping blind people see. Also in Spain last month, doctors transplanted a tongue as part of a face transplant surgery. ""The tongue is considered very much like the trunk of an elephant or the tentacle of the octopus. It's the same kind of structure with how many shapes, configurations the trunk or tentacle can assume,"" said E. Fiona Bailey, an assistant professor of physiology at The University of Arizona in Tucson. ""Researchers realize there is a lot of potential there."" Transplanting tongues . A team of surgeons in Spain last month performed a face transplant, which is considered the first to include the tongue and jaws. A 43-year-old man who lost his jaws and tongue after a cancer battle 11 years ago received a transplant for the bottom third of his face, according to the Hospital La Fe in Valencia, Spain. Dr. Pedro Cavadas, the surgical team leader, said the objective was for the patient to recover feeling in his face and also to swallow, talk, feel and taste with his tongue again. But the first tongue transplant in 2003 had short-lived results.  Doctors in Austria transplanted a tongue to a 42-year-old cancer patient.  The cancer returned and the patient died 13 months after the surgery, according to a 2008 article written by his doctors in the journal Transplantation. A transplant recipient has to take immune suppressing drugs so he or she won't reject the new organ.  But this puts the person at risk for cancer recurrence because of the weakened immune system, said Dr. Douglas Chepeha, a head and neck surgical oncologist at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center in Ann Arbor. Unlike liver or kidney transplants, reconnecting the tongue is also more complex because of its nerves, said Chepeha, who is the director of the microvascular program. ""A nerve is not like a single wire in your house,"" he said.  ""When we say a nerve, there are literally thousands if not hundred thousands of tiny little fibers. It'll be like taking a fiber optic cable and cutting it -- let's say that cable had 100,000 fibers in it -- how do you realign it?"" Chepeha said: ""If we can get some way of knowing which way to hook the nerves up, someday it'll work better. Right now, we're not there."" Driving wheelchairs . A new kind of wheelchair allows people who cannot use their hands and feet to steer using simple tongue movements. This technology can assist people who have spinal cord injuries, said Maysam Ghovanloo, an assistant professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Unlike hands and feet, the tongue has a distinct advantage because it doesn't connect to the spinal cord, he said. To use the wheelchair, a magnet the size of a lentil sits on the driver's tongue affixed by edible glue. When the person in the wheelchair touches a certain tooth with his or her tongue, the wheelchair moves -- for example, a left tooth, the wheelchair will turn left. Magnetic sensors trace the movement of the tongue and transmit the directions to get the wheelchair moving. ""The tongue is always moving, but the technology is smart enough to tell the difference between natural movements and the tongue movements [meant to steer the wheelchair],"" Ghovanloo said. Researchers conducted clinical trials this summer in which people with spinal cord injuries navigated through an obstacle course using their tongues. Those who had recently been injured were more receptive to driving with their tongues than others who have gotten used to the existing technology, Ghovanloo said. The tongue-driven wheelchair is not available to the public yet, pending more clinical trials in 2010. Aiding vision . Researchers devised an instrument to allow users to ""see"" through the tongue. Called the BrainPort, the vision device sits on the tongue to help blind people get a sense of their environment. The device, which is the size of a postage stamp, connects to a digital video camera. The camera paints the visual scene in front of a person by turning it into gentle stimulations on the tongue that feel like bubbles. For example, when a person moves across the room, the device creates vibrations across the tongue to resemble the movement. Aimee Arnoldussen, a neuroscientist at the device maker's company, Wicab Inc., said scientists turned to the tongue because ""the tongue has a high density of nerve endings, which makes it sensitive."" Other parts of the body, such as the back, were not sufficiently sensitive.  The fingertips were sensitive enough, but people wanted full use of their hands to grip a cane or to grab objects. Placing the device ""on the tongue inside the mouth, frees the hands to interact with environment,"" Arnoldussen said. Plus, the device can be hidden in the mouth. The device is still in development, but Arnoldussen said the company hopes to make it available to the public within the next year. E-tongue senses sweet . Scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign developed a handheld device the size of a business card, which can taste the sweetness in food and drinks. This could lead to the first electronic tongue that would be able to identify sources of sweetness. ""We could determine what sweetener would be in your tea,"" researcher Christopher Musto told CNN Radio. The device can distinguish among 14 kinds of sweeteners, from natural sugars to artificial ones such as Splenda. Musto described two possible applications: This would be a first step toward an electronic tongue and second, it could be a handheld device that would determine what sweetener and the amount.","Researchers turn to the tongue for new ways to help people with disabilities .

"Washington (CNN) -- Congress is launching a broad-ranging investigation into possible waste, misuse and corruption tied to billions of taxpayer dollars used to support private military contractors in Afghanistan. Among the questions being raised is whether money provided in a nearly $2.2 billion trucking contract in the war-torn country went to pay off local warlords and the Taliban. The investigation comes as the Obama administration begins deploying another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan. The White House has requested more than $70 billion to fund the war in fiscal year 2010, according to a Senate subcommittee memo. ""Serious allegations have been brought to [Congress'] attention that private security providers for U.S. transportation contractors in Afghanistan are regularly paying local warlords and the Taliban for security,"" said Rep. John Tierney, D-Massachusetts, who chairs the House National Security and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee. ""After a preliminary inquiry, it has been determined these reports warrant a full-scale ... investigation. If shown to be true, it would mean that the United States is unintentionally engaged in a vast protection racket and, as such, may be indirectly funding the very insurgents we are trying to fight."" Eight companies currently split the Afghan host nation trucking contract, which went into effect in May. The contract, according to Tierney's subcommittee, provides ground transportation in Afghanistan for more than 90 percent of supplies for U.S. troops, including food, fuel and ammunition. Most supplies are shipped overland via Pakistan to Bagram Airfield, the main U.S. base in Afghanistan. They are then distributed to hundreds of other smaller airfields and bases. In the Senate, an oversight subcommittee headed by Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, also is looking into how contractor money is being spent. Federal auditors state that approximately $950 million in ""questioned and unsupported costs"" has been submitted by Pentagon contractors for work in Afghanistan, according to a report prepared for Congress. That amount represents 16 percent of the total contract dollars examined so far. The U.S. government has spent more than $23 billion on contracts in Afghanistan since 2002, the report states. There are currently 104,000 Pentagon contractors in Afghanistan -- a figure that could rise to 160,000 to support President Obama's planned troop increase, according to the report. Roughly 100,000 U.S. troops are slated to be in Afghanistan at the height of the coming surge.","Among questions is whether $2.2 billion trucking contract went to pay warlords .

"Saint-Marc, Haiti (CNN) -- Patients arrive at the front gates of St. Nicholas Hospital hunched over and groaning, only to be greeted by chaos and confusion. Getting inside isn't easy, but once in, aid organizations and local staff try to treat those most vulnerable to the ravages of cholera in an area of wooden benches grouped as a triage area. Many here are still lying in the open air and are sprawled out on concrete with anxious relatives holding re-hydration fluid, hoping it will treat the cholera now stalking this rural area about 60 miles northwest of the capital of Haiti, Port-au-Prince. Death toll passes 250 . Those most at risk are the very old and the very young. Dozens of infants who lay crying and uncomfortable on their mothers' laps, dehydrated and weak. Haiti's health minister, Dr. Alex Larsen, told CNN in a telephone interview that he believes the cholera outbreak is stabilizing. Larsen added that reports of the outbreak spreading are so far unsubstantiated. BLOG: Cholera can be deadly within hours . The United Nations confirmed to CNN on Saturday that there are five confirmed cases of cholera in the capital but those cases originated from the area in and around Saint-Marc. CNN toured St. Nicholas Hospital with a team from the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. The team is here to support the government's efforts and advise on how to best mitigate and contain the outbreak. ""It is encouraging that the mortality rate seems to be coming down."" says Dr. Eric Mintz, a scientist with the CDC who specializes in diarrheal diseases. Mintz adds that while the outbreak is likely to spread, the fatality rates should continue to drop, and the water, sanitization and hygiene infrastructure in the country can be strengthened in time to avoid a full-scale disaster.","St. Nicholas Hospital in Haiti is packed with cholera victims .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Three suicide attackers shot their way onto the grounds of a five-star hotel in the northwest Pakistani city of Peshawar and set off a car bomb, killing at least seven people and wounding dozens, officials said. Pakistani police gather at the five-star hotel destroyed by a car bomb. Peshawar Police Chief Safwat Ghyour said about 40 people were wounded in the attack on the Pearl Continental Hotel, which is often frequented by foreigners and diplomats. The blast inflicted severe damage on the building, which is surrounded by a security wall, and destroyed dozens of cars in the parking lot, police and witnesses said. The information minister for Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, put the death toll at 11, with at least 50 wounded. A local official, Sahib Zada Muhammad Anis Khan, said one of the dead was a Nigerian national who worked for the United Nations. Qhazi Jamil, senior superintendent of Peshawar police, told CNN three gunmen in a pickup fired on security guards at the hotel's entrance gate and forced their way inside before setting off the bomb. Hussain and the chief of Peshawar's bomb-disposal squad said the bomb contained about 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of explosives. Peshawar is the capital of North West Frontier Province, which has suffered a spate of bombings on civilian targets in the wake of the Pakistani military's ongoing military offensive against Taliban militants. Sajjan Gohel, an international security analyst at the Asia-Pacific Foundation in Britain, said the blast appeared to be a response to the government's offensive. ""It has been criticized very heavily in the tribal areas because of the fact that the Pakistani military has been using helicopter gunships against the Taliban, which has resulted in very high civilian casualties,"" Gohel said. He said people in the region are sympathetic to the Taliban, the Islamic militia that ruled most of Afghanistan before the September 2001 attacks on New York and Washington by its al Qaeda allies. ""This is where winning hearts and minds is so key and important, which the military are failing to do,"" he said. However, hundreds of Pakistani villagers who have formed an anti-Taliban militia are currently fighting to remove the Islamic militants from their region of northwestern Pakistan, military spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN. Abbas told CNN the Pakistani military is supporting the villagers, who turned against the Taliban after a suicide attack on a local mosque during Friday prayers left at least 40 dead. The Pearl Continental is owned by the same group as the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, which was destroyed in a suicide truck bombing in September.

"(CNN) -- English Premier League team Manchester City unveiled plans for a new training academy on Tuesday, as the club looks to build on its recent on-field success. City were taken over by taken over by Abu Dhabi billionaire Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan in August 2008, and have invested heavily their playing squad since. Manager Roberto Mancini guided City into the European Champions League for the first time in their history with a third-place finish in England's top division last term, as well as leading them to an FA Cup triumph -- the club's first trophy in 27 years. Now the Etihad Stadium outfit are hoping to maintain their push for honors with the development of a brand new academy complex a mere stone's throw from their 47,000-seater home in east Manchester. Man Utd's dominance a sign of EPL weakness . A planning application for the project, which would boast 15 full-size and two half-size football pitches as well as accommodation for 40 youth-team players, was lodged by the two-time English champions on Tuesday. ""Manchester City has entered a new phase in the long term strategy set out by the club's owner three years ago,"" read a statement on the club's official website. ""Whilst the club already has a strong pedigree of nurturing young talent; the limits of what can be achieved with the existing facility have been achieved."" The site will also contain a 7,000-capacity stadium for youth team matches, a separate building for the first team and a bridge linking the Etihad Stadium to the area -- which will be known as the Etihad Campus. ""The development and recruitment of youth talent is at the heart of our long term strategy of building a sustainable football club for the future,"" City's chief football operations office Brian Marwood said. ""The opportunity to build a world class facility supported by a well researched youth development plan would be a significant step in the realization of that strategy."" Gavin Hamilton, editor of World Soccer magazine, told CNN that despite the City's financial investment in their youth set-up, only time will tell whether it will change their current strategy of signing big-name stars such as Argentina striker Sergio Aguero and Spain midfielder David Silva. ""I'm always slightly suspicious when big clubs start investing in youth policies,"" said Hamilton. ""Chelsea did it a few years ago and very few young players have come through the youth system there."" Hamilton also cast doubt on City's ability to match the set-up of European champions Barcelona, who have brought a number of first-team regulars through their famous La Masia academy. ""I'm always suspicious as well when clubs say they're going to copy Barcelona, because they are the great team of the moment and it's very fashionable to copy what they're doing. ""But what Barcelona have been doing goes back decades, you can't just buy it overnight. Even if you're talking about a long-term development plan it's going to take decades."" Hamilton also said that the successful development of young players is not necessarily achieved through financial investment, but through adopting the correct attitude to nurturing emerging talent -- citing Dutch champions Ajax as a perfect example of the right approach. ""The clubs that are successful with youth policies are the clubs that don't necessarily spend a lot of money, but believe in youngsters and believe in putting youngsters into the first team at an early age. ""So a club like Ajax, which is famed for its youth academy, wouldn't spend a huge amount more than other clubs. But what they do have is a commitment to putting youngsters out; blooding them at an early age and believing that if you're good enough you're old enough.""","Manchester City have unveiled plans for a new team academy complex .

"(CNN) -- A day after Standard & Poor's rating agency downgraded the U.S. credit rating to AA+ from its top rank of AAA, there were more questions than answers Saturday about what effects the move will have on the economy and American consumers. The move by S&P, one of the leading credit rating agencies, came just days after Congress approved a deal to deliver $2.1 trillion in savings over the next decade. The deal followed heated debt-ceiling talks in Washington. ""The downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that Congress and the administration recently agreed to falls short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilize the government's medium-term debt dynamics,"" S&P said Friday shortly after markets closed. While it was unclear what the short-term impact of the credit rating downgrade would be, some initial answers were expected Monday when the stock market reopened. One area of concern is whether a downgrade would ward off investors from buying U.S. debt and increase the country's cost to borrow money, therefore increasing consumer interest rates on everything from mortgages to car loans to student loans. ""Only time's going to tell how we're going to be affected,"" former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker told CNN. ""Interest rates that affect the U.S. government ultimately can ripple throughout the economy, which is not good news given our weak economic condition already."" Rating agencies such as S&P, Moody's and Fitch analyze risk and give debt a grade that is supposed to reflect the borrower's ability to repay its loans. The safest bets are stamped AAA. That's where the U.S. debt has stood for years. Moody's first assigned the United States a AAA rating in 1917. Fitch and Moody's, the other two main credit ratings agencies, maintained the AAA rating for the United States after this week's debt deal, though Moody's lowered its outlook on U.S. debt to ""negative."" A negative outlook indicates the possibility that Moody's could downgrade the country's sovereign credit rating within a year or two. John Chambers, the head of sovereign ratings at S&P, told CNN that the political brinkmanship over the debt ceiling proved to be a key issue, with ""the U.S. government getting to the last day before they had cash-management problems."" Few governments separate the budget process from the debt-authorization process as the United States does, he noted. And, though the budget deal that finally was reached will deliver at least $2.1 trillion in savings over the next decade, that will not suffice, he said. ""It's going to be difficult to get beyond that -- at least in the near term -- and you do need to get beyond that to get to a point where the debt-to-GDP ratio is going to stabilize,"" he said. Asked who was to blame, Chambers said, ""This is a problem that's been a long time in the making -- well over this administration, the prior administration."" Congress should shoulder some of the blame, he said. ""The first thing it could have done is to have raised the debt ceiling in a timely manner so that much of this debate had been avoided to begin with, as it had done 60 or 70 times since 1960 without that much debate."" Chambers added that his agency's decision is likely to have a long-term impact. ""Once you lose your AAA, it doesn't usually bounce back,"" he said. He pointed to the decision by Congress about whether to extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts as one crucial area. ""If you let them lapse for the high-income earners, that could give you another $950 billion,"" he said. U.S. Treasury officials received S&P's analysis Friday afternoon and alerted the agency to an error that inflated U.S. deficits by $2 trillion, said an administration official, who was not authorized to speak for attribution. The agency acknowledged the mistake, but said it was sticking with its decision. The administration official called it ""a facts-be-damned decision ... Their analysis was way off, but they wouldn't budge."" But Chambers defended his agency's move. ""It doesn't make a material difference,"" he said. ""It doesn't change the fact that your debt-to-GDP ratio, under most plausible assumptions, will continue to rise over the next decade."" Rumors of a possible downgrade surfaced shortly after Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi announced in Rome that finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States-- may meet ""in a few days"" to discuss the sagging world economy. The announcement came on a day when financial anxiety gripped the globe. Stock markets worldwide saw intense volatility amid worries of a widening debt crisis in Europe and a stalled economic recovery in the United States. American markets were dramatically up and down a day after having their worst day since the 2008 financial crisis. Stock market values fell Friday across Europe and Asia, where reaction to news of the U.S. credit downgrade was mixed. A scathing editorial in the Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency criticized the United States for living outside its means. ""China, the largest creditor of the world's sole superpower, has every right now to demand the United States to address its structural debt problems and ensure the safety of China's dollar assets,"" the editorial said. ""To cure its addiction to debts, the United States has to re-establish the common sense principle that one should live within its means."" Other responses were more measured. ""We will have to analyze it. It will require some time,"" said India's finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee. ""(The) situation is grave and there is no gain in making off-the-cuff remarks."" In South Korea, which also holds a large amount of U.S. debt, the Yonhap news agency said government officials were closely monitoring financial developments in the United States. ""The news is bad and Seoul plans to keep very close tabs on how the market reacts,"" Yoon Jong-won, head of the ministry's economic policy bureau, told Yonhap. Concerns about debt issues in Europe appeared to battle with optimism that a positive U.S. jobs report indicated the American economy is not headed into a new recession -- the dreaded ""double-dip."" ""The crisis in Europe is quickly becoming on par with the financial crisis of 2008,"" David Levy, portfolio manager at Kenjol Capital Management, told CNN Money. ""The jobs report shows that things aren't getting much worse in the U.S., but the focus is clearly on Europe at this point."" ""We are going to get through this,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said prior to the downgrade at the Washington Navy Yard, where he announced a jobs program for veterans. ""Things will get better. And we're going to get there together."" Obama, who spoke Friday afternoon with France's Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel about the crisis, noted that July marked the 17th consecutive month of private-sector job growth in the United States, but said much more work needs to be done. Obama is urging Republicans and Democrats to come together in efforts to strenghten the American economy, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement Saturday. ""The bipartisan compromise on deficit reduction was an important step in the right directionm"" Carney said. ""Yet, the path to getting there took too long and was at times too divisive. We must do better to make clear our nation's will, capacity and commitment to work together to tackle our major fiscal and economic challenges.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission told Congress on Thursday that the likelihood of a Fukushimi Daiichi-type event in the United States is ""very, very small."" However, it said an ongoing study of the Japanese disaster will probably lead to changes to increase safety at the nation's 104 commercial power plants. The commission said, in a nutshell, it expects to require nuclear plants to be prepared for bigger natural disasters, to survive longer power outages and to consider the possibility of simultaneous disasters affecting multiple reactors, as happened in Japan. Commissioner George Apostolakis said one of the lessons of Fukushima is ""humility."" ""I believe that, as a community of safety analysts, we were pretty confident that there would be no new surprises,"" Apostolakis said. ""Fukushima has challenged that belief."" Commissioners said the commission's core safety concept, a belts-and-suspenders policy called ""Defense in Depth,"" is sound. The policy requires power plant designers and operators to have multiple, redundant layers of defense to respond to failures so that no single layer of response is relied on. They also endorsed support for regulations that require plants to be designed to withstand the strongest natural disasters on record for that location, with an added margin of safety. But while voicing support for both concepts, some commissioners said ""Defense in Depth"" needs to be deeper and margins of safety wider. Currently, emergency plans for most U.S. nuclear reactors envision one nuclear reactor being in danger. At Fukushima, all four operating reactors were affected by the tsunami that followed an earthquake in March. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also requires plans to evacuate a 10-mile zone around power plants, but U.S. authorities recommended that U.S. citizens within 50 miles of Fukushima evacuate. Japan to hand out radiation meters to children . ""If there's an overall lesson we can learn from this, I think that is you can't ... predict everything that will happen in the future. You can't predict every earthquake, every tsunami, but ... you have to be able to recover from whatever happens,"" Commissioner William Magwood IV said. Currently, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission task force is midway through a 90-day review of the Fukushima incident, searching for lessons that can quickly be applied to U.S. plants. The 90-day study, to be released July 19, will be followed by a lengthier study involving more long-term changes. At a hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, commissioners discussed some of the lessons learned. They include: . -- The commission needs to evaluate its ""station blackout"" rule concerning how power plants deal with the loss of electrical power, Commissioner William Ostendorff said. ""I think that the commission will probably receive from the task force perhaps some recommendations in this area,"" he said. -- Backup batteries used to power control room functions during blackouts are insufficient, Apostolakis said. ""Clearly, the main message from Fukushima is that four hours, or sometimes eight, is not sufficient,"" he said. ""Interestingly enough, when the requirement of four or longer hours was put in place, it was actually a conservative estimate. (Regulators) looked at the time it took to recover AC power (during a blackout). The average was about two hours, so to be conservative, they doubled it. And now we have this accident that shows its very inadequate, so that's certainly something we have to look into."" -- The commission needs to consider the impact that spent-fuel pool problems can have during a larger event, Chairman Gregory Jaczko said. ""I think we've had a singular focus, perhaps, on reactor safety in the event of accidents and not put enough attention into considering the impact of spent fuel pools (on the response),"" he said. -- The commission needs to consider staging of emergency and back-up equipment. After the September 11 terrorist attacks, the commission required plants to stage auxiliary diesel generators near nuclear plants, Magwood said. ""We require those units to be just a very short distance away from, say, reactor buildings. Clearly, if we had those procedures in place and had experienced a Fukushima-type event, that equipment would have been wiped out along with a lot of the other side equipment. That was a significant revelation for me and something I think we have to address,"" he said. -- The commission needs to review first-responder communication capabilities. ""It's always very difficult to have communication in a crisis situation, and I think that's an area that we can always be exercising and improving,"" Commissioner Kristine Svinicki commission. Commissioners also said the agency must study what led to the hydrogen explosions that plagued Fukushima but said not enough is known about the incident to recommend changes. ""We've always asked ourselves the question, 'Are the plants still safe? Is there anything we need to do today to address that?' And the answer continues to be 'No,' "" Jaczko said. ""We want to get good information, (and) we have time to do that. ""The likelihood of something like this happening in the United States is still very, very small, because these are really very, very unlikely types of events,"" he said. Jaczko said the current 90-day review ""may seem like a very long time, (but) to the people doing the review, it's going by in a millisecond."" ""But it's important that we get it right, and I think that so far, they are looking at all the right things,"" he said.","Commissioners tell Congress of potential changes to power plants .
""Humility"" among lessons of Japan's disaster, commissioner says .
They say the present core safety concept is sound ."
"(CNN) -- Infectious disease detectives worldwide rushed Thursday to find the cause of an outbreak of a rare strain of E. coli that has spread to 10 countries and is blamed for at least 16 deaths and hundreds of illnesses. Nine patients in Germany had died of a form of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, according to the World Health Organization, which cited Tuesday figures as its most recent. Six had died of enterohemorrhagic E. coli, EHEC, a strain of E. coli that causes hemorrhaging in the intestines and can result in abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea. One person in Sweden has also died. Across Europe, 499 cases of HUS and 1,115 cases of EHEC have been reported, WHO said on its website. In addition to Germany and Sweden, cases have been identified in Austria, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. All but two of the cases occurred in people who had recently visited northern Germany or, in one case, had contact with a visitor from northern Germany, the organization said. Scientists at the Beijing Genomic Institute said the outbreak of infection in Germany is caused by a new ""super-toxic"" E. coli strain, though the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the strain has been seen before. ""We have very little experience with this particular strain, but it has been seen before,"" said Robert Tauxe, deputy director of the CDC's division of foodborne diseases. The CDC said the strain is very rare and added that, while it is not aware of any cases ever having been reported in the United States, it is aware of a few previous reports of the strain in other countries. Britain's Health Protection Agency has said that the strain suspected in the outbreak is ""rare"" and ""seldom seen in the UK."" Though WHO said it does not recommend any trade restrictions related to the outbreak, Russia announced a ban Thursday on fresh vegetable imports from the European Union. Russia imposed the vegetable ban because ""no one wants to get sick. It is a natural protective measure taken in response to events that are happening in Europe today,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said Thursday. Gennady Onishchenko, head of the Russian Federal Agency for Health and Consumer Rights, issued a statement saying the ban will remain in effect ""until we become convinced that this situation is resolved."" Customs officials have been instructed to prevent the produce from entering the country, according to Onishchenko, while supermarkets and food chains in Russia were told to withdraw European vegetables from their produce bins. Frederic Vincent, the European Commission's health spokesman, called the move ""disproportionate."" ""The commission will be writing today to the Russian authorities, and we will be liaising and working with them in the coming days to try to find a solution,"" Vincent said. The commission is the EU's executive body. Yelena Skrynnik, Russia's agriculture minister, issued a statement assuring Russians that, despite the ban, ""the volume of home-grown vegetable production combined with exports (from other countries) is sufficient to fully meet Russia's domestic demand."" In 2010, the imports of tomatoes and cucumbers from the EU amounted to, respectively, 11% and 5% of all imports of those vegetables into Russia, the Russian Agriculture Ministry said. The ban could potentially affect some larger cities in the European part of the country, where about 90% of vegetables are imported, said Sergey Shugayev, chairman of the Rural Russia Association. China and Turkey are the two largest exporters of fresh vegetables into Russia, according to the Russian Greenhouses Association. The European Food Safety Alert Network initially said EHEC was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany and distributed to countries including Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain. But authorities said Thursday the source had not been pinpointed. Spain's Ministry of Health, Social Politics and Equality said Thursday that all samples of Spanish produce that it analyzed had proved negative. Spain's ambassador to Britain, Carles Casajuana i Palet, told CNN that Spanish produce had been ""completely cleared"" and are ""safe for all consumers."" But, he added, the matter had damaged the country's growers ""and we are sure there will have to be compensations"" through the European Union. Britain's Health Protection Agency on Thursday confirmed that there were four new cases in England suspected to be related to the outbreak, bringing the total number of cases in the country to seven. The agency said that it was ""reminding people traveling to Germany to follow the advice of the authorities and avoid eating raw tomatoes, cucumbers and leafy salad including lettuce, especially in the north of the country, until further notice. In addition, anyone returning from Germany with illness including bloody diarrhea should seek urgent medical attention and make sure they mention their recent travel history."" The ban on fresh vegetables from the European Union comes three days after Russia blocked the import of fresh tomatoes, cucumbers and salad greens from Germany and Spain. On Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates imposed a temporary ban on cucumbers from Spain, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands.

"(CNN) -- Indonesia began cloud-seeding operations over the island of Sumatra on Monday in an attempt to trigger rain to put out fires creating thick blankets of haze over parts of Sumatra and neighboring Singapore and Malaysia. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), said that three Spanish-built CASA 212-200 aircraft were deployed on Friday to Sumatra. The rain-inducing operations will continue in three  specific areas for the next 90 days, Sutopo told CNN. According to the agency, the number of hot spots in South Sumatra in September has reached 1,241. Hundreds more have been detected on the island of Kalimantan, which is Indonesia's side of Borneo island. South Sumatra has the highest number of hot spots, or areas of high temperatures that could indicate peat or forest fires. Sutopo says ground operations to extinguish the fires are also ongoing. These include spraying, controlled burning, building trenches to limit the spread of the fire and sluices around the burning peat. Haze from forest and peat fires has been a perennial problem for the region, particularly during the dry months. Slash-and-burn techniques to clear land and droughts have been blamed for the fires in the past. Using uncontrolled fires to clear land is illegal but enforcement has been an issue. The worst incidence of fires and haze was in 1997 to 1998. The World Wide Fund for Nature estimates nearly 10 million hectares was burned. The Asian Development Bank put the damages and losses at about US $9 billion for Indonesia and its neighboring countries. The fires also had significant impact on Indonesia's wildlife, including orangutans, tigers and elephants and protected national parks.

"(CNN) -- Colombian Minister of Defense Rodrigo Rivera resigned Wednesday amid growing concern in the country over increased activity by the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Rivera's departure marks the first resignation of a cabinet minister in the 13 months that Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has been in office. Santos praised Rivera's service, and quickly appointed as his replacement Juan Carlos Pinzon, a former vice minister of defense who also has been Santos' chief of staff. The FARC has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s. While severely weakened in recent years, the leftist guerrilla group has continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces in the South American nation. The United States and European Union consider the FARC a terrorist organization. In the last months local authorities in various parts of Colombia have reported increased FARC activities, targeting mainly civilians and local communities. As many as 40 soldiers and police officers have died this year in attacks attributed to FARC, mainly in the southern part of the country. Before his departure, Rivera described his last months in office as decisive in the fight against FARC and said, ""We have bluntly hit the hardest blows to the organization's drug-trafficking structure in our history."" Pinzon, the new Colombian minister of defense, pledged to continue working with greater strength and decisiveness,and said he would demand from the armed forces an attitude of discipline and ethics. Journalist Fernando Ramos in Bogota, Colombia, contributed to this report.","Rodrigo Rivera had boasted success in the fight against leftist guerrillas .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Microsoft on Wednesday announced plans to redefine television as a medium that viewers can control by waving their hands and talking rather than clicking on remotes. In a speech to open the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, company CEO Steve Ballmer also said he aims to make TV more social -- letting viewers chat with each other as avatars in virtual settings and place live bets on sporting events from the TV screen. Perhaps it's time to say goodbye to the old-fashioned couch potato. At the center of this new vision for the living room is the Xbox 360, Microsoft's internet-connected gaming system that, thanks to an add-on called Kinect, can read and interpret players' motions. ""Your Xbox is becoming the hub of your living room,"" he said. ""It is your gaming system. It is your movies. It is your TV experience."" Ballmer announced an update to that system that lets Kinect's cameras read facial expressions and mouth movements in addition to what their arms and legs are doing. Called ""Avatar Kinect,"" this new feature, which is due out in the spring, will allow friends to meet up as avatars -- or video-game likenesses of themselves -- in virtual settings. A demo of this feature showed avatars chatting at a virtual-world tailgate while sitting in digital, plaid lawn chairs. In another demo, female avatars got together on a neon set, as if they were collaborating on an online talk show. Kinect's cameras watch the friends from the top of their TVs and translates their facial expressions into the digital hangout. ""As you can see now Kinect can track features like your smile, your laugh and even the raise of your eyebrows,"" Ballmer said, offering a demo of himself as a bald avatar -- his digital eyebrows bouncing up and down. Ballmer described these virtual meet-ups as a ""new way to socialize."" But, even during his speech, some Twitter users wrote they found that idea downright creepy. ""This seems unhealthy,"" one Twitter user wrote. ""Will it also track Eye Winks? or false eyelashes? What about coloured contact lens?"" wrote another. Others wrote that they're fine with non-Microsoft devices controlling their living room electronics experience. ""Sorry Ballmer, my PS3 is the hub of my living room,"" one @cnntech Twitter follower wrote, referencing the Sony gaming system. The Avatar Kinect feature is available only to people who pay a subscription fee for an Xbox Live membership, which costs about $60 per year. Even without the avatars, TV is getting more social as it brings elements of the internet into the living room, Ballmer said. Microsoft announced a partnership with ESPN, for instance, that lets people watch the BCS college football championship game over Xbox Live. Viewers can chat with friends on the TV screen during the game and place non-monetary bets about who they think will win. They can see how their predictions stack up against that of their friends and the Xbox Live community at large. Football fans would be ranked according to success, allowing sports fans to ""earn their bragging rights,"" said Ron Forbes, from Microsoft's interactive entertainment division. ""Now I can make my picks and trash talk as I'm watching the game,"" he said. ""Not on e-mail, not over text -- right in my living room on the TV."" This trend of internet-enabled, or ""connected"" TV is set to be a major theme of this year's CES, where TV makers from Panasonic to Sony are announcing app stores and other features that are designed to bring social media and Web experiences to TV. Some of these companies work internet features directly into the television instead of requiring a separate gadget, as is the case with Microsoft's Xbox. Others, like the Yap.tv app for the Apple iPad, aim to let another device provide a social experience that can supplement live TV viewing. The idea of internet TV has been tried many times before but has never gone fully mainstream. But Microsoft's internet-TV system does do one thing other don't -- full-body motion control. The company highlighted this point repeatedly, announcing partnerships, for instance, with Netflix and HuluPlus that let Xbox Kinect users control those video apps by waiving their hands and talking to the system to select and play movies. It's a ""new world of controller-free entertainment that you cannot find anywhere else,"" Forbes said. The company said it had sold 8 million Kinect sensors in 60 days, beating its goal of selling 5 million during that timeframe. The keynote address also highlighted other Microsoft efforts, including Windows Phone 7 and the Windows PC operating system, which is in the process of being upgraded to work on a range of devices, including buzz-worthy tablet computers. Microsoft is widely criticized as being behind the curve on developing an operating system for tablets. The company promised an update to its mobile Windows Phone 7 operating system that will add copy-paste functionality and the ability to switch between apps more quickly. Those features are already available from the two hottest smartphone ecosystems: the Apple iOS and Google Android. Some bloggers and wrote that Microsoft hid its skeletons in the closet during the speech -- straying from tablets and smartphones, which are big topics with other companies. But Ballmer said Microsoft is looking to the future -- and that will include all tech platforms, not just personal computers. The company aims to ""redefine what is really possible"" with technology, he said.","Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said he wants to make TV more social .

"(CNN) -- More than 1,000 protesters clashed with security forces in Kuwait on Friday, demanding greater rights for longtime residents who are not citizens of the country. The crowd -- initially 300 people before quickly growing -- was attacked with water cannons. A Kuwaiti government spokesman later claimed that the security forces were trying to protect themselves after the protesters started hurling rocks. The ""security forces on the ground talked to the protestors in a nice and civilized way,"" said Col. Adil Al-Hashash, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. Members of the crowd were told ""that they should go to the legal channels for their demands rather than protesting."" Al-Hashash said the demonstration was eventually dispersed and that several protesters were arrested and questioned by the security forces. The protest took place in Al Jahra province north of Kuwait City, Al-Hashash noted. Kuwait has been wrestling with the question of rights for non-citizen residents for decades. The country is believed to have roughly 100,000 residents who are not citizens.

"Aasta, Norway (CNN) -- Three rapid blasts echoed across the Norwegian countryside on Tuesday as police detonated explosives found at a farm owned by the suspect in last week's bloodbath in Oslo and the island of Utoya. Anders Behring Breivik is accused of killing 76 people in the Friday attacks, most of them at a summer camp run by Norway's ruling Labour Party on Utoya. Police carried out a controlled explosion at his farm in Aasta, about 100 kilometers (63 miles) north of Oslo, once some of the material was taken away as evidence, police spokeswoman Laila Sondrol told CNN. The detonation was carried out alongside a riverbank on the property, leaving a plume of grey smoke hanging over the farm after the explosion. Sondrol said investigators are continuing to search for other explosives at the farm. Another police spokeswoman, Trine Dyngeland, would confirm neither the type or quantity of the material detonated Tuesday, nor when it was found. Earlier, Breivik's lawyer told reporters his client was ""a little bit surprised"" that he was able to pull off the bombing and shooting rampage, for which authorities say he has claimed responsibility. The attorney, Geir Lippestad, said Breivik was surprised that his plan ""succeeded -- succeeded in his mind."" Lippestad said Breivik didn't expect to reach Utoya, where he is accused of shooting 68 people dead. Another eight died in a bombing outside government offices in Oslo earlier that day. Breivik used drugs before the attacks that were designed to keep him strong and awake, Lippestad said. While he said it was too early to say whether Breivik will plead insanity, Lippestad added, ""This whole case indicates that he's insane."" Lippestad said it was ""very difficult"" to describe Breivik's manner -- ""he is not like anyone."" Norwegian police released the first few names of victims of the attacks Tuesday afternoon. Three of the four -- Tove Ashill Knutsen, 56; Hanna Orvik Endresen, 61; and Kai Hauge, 32 -- were killed in the Oslo bombing, while 23-year-old Gunnar Linaker died on Utoya. Police said they would post an update at 6 p.m. every day until all the victims have been identified. Their families will be notified first. During a closed court hearing Monday, the 32-year-old suspect said the attacks were necessary to prevent the ""colonization"" of Norway by Muslims, the presiding judge, Kim Heger, said. Breivik accused the Labour Party of ""treason"" for promoting multiculturalism, Heger said. Lippestad said Breivik had told him he was in touch with two terror cells in Norway and in contact with other cells abroad, but that he acted alone in carrying out the attack on Utoya and the Oslo bombing. ""He says there are several cells around the Western world -- where, I do not know,"" Lippestad said. Breivik is cooperating with police inquiries, ""but he won't talk about the other cells,"" he said. His client considers himself to be ""in a war,"" Lippestad said. The police declined to say how many people are still missing, saying the number was still subject to change. They have said in the past that they were searching for four or five people. Forensic scientists are still searching Utoya for clues, and the island will remain closed to the public for at least two weeks, Norwegian Police Chief Sveinung Sponheim said. Other countries are involved in the Norwegian investigation into last week's attacks, police said in response to a question about Breivik's claim to have been in contact with terror cells abroad. They declined to name the other countries, saying, ""The investigation is in Norway."" They also declined to say where Breivik is being held. Prosecutors are considering charging Breivik with crimes against humanity, according to police. He is facing terror-related charges that carry a maximum 21-year sentence. Geert Wilders, a Dutch politician whose Freedom Party is referenced in a manifesto apparently written by Breivik, condemned the suspect's alleged actions Tuesday. Wilders said he was not ""responsible for a lone idiot who twisted the freedom-loving anti-Islamization ideals"" of his party. Meanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden visited the Norwegian ambassador's residence in Washington Tuesday to ""offer condolences to the people of Norway after the tragic killings that occurred last week,"" according to a White House statement. Earlier, Breivik's father said his son should have killed himself instead of allegedly going on the killing spree. ""In my darkest moments, I think that rather than killing all those people, he should have taken his own life,"" Jens Breivik said in an interview with Norway's TV2. He said he also believes his son has mental issues. ""He must be. He must be,"" the father said in response to a reporter's question about whether he thought his son was mentally ill. ""There is no other way to explain it. A normal person would never do such a thing."" Jens Breivik had a message for all the victims during his interview. ""I would like to say that I feel an incredible grief and despair over what has happened. I often think of how terrible it must be for those who are affected by this. I wish I could do something for them, but here I am, powerless to do anything,"" he said. Lippestad said Breivik does not know what his father said. He said he does not know if any of Breivik's family members have asked to see him. Jens Breivik, who was interviewed at his home in France, said he would not be visiting his son as the legal process continues. ""No. I will never have more contact with him,"" he told TV2. The suspect's father was one of many people searching for answers Tuesday after the mass killings that terrorized Norway last week. At a news conference Tuesday, hotelier Petter Stordalen pledged to give 5 million kroner ($923,000) to rebuild Utoya Island. He promised it would be ""a new Utoya, a Utoya for everyone. It's been a summer camp for the Labour Party, now it's to be an island for everyone."" Eskil Peterson, a leader of the Labour Party's youth movement, the AUF, said the party had first been shocked and now was mourning those killed. That sorrow will intensify when police release the identities of all those killed, he said. ""When we see those names, it will be heartbreaking for everybody,"" he said. According to Heger, Breivik said he worked with two cells to launch the attacks, the deadliest onslaught in Norway since World War II. Police refused to comment on the claim, but a police official said Breivik appeared to be ""very calm"" during his hearing. Almost 200,000 people participated in a memorial Monday in downtown Oslo to honor the victims, authorities said. Breivik hates democracy and all who believe in it, his lawyer said Tuesday. He added that his client felt the rest of the world didn't understand his point of view but that they would in 60 years' time. He is undergoing a medical examination, Lippestad told reporters. Breivik is now ""very tired"" because of his circumstances, he said, but he was not injured when he was taken into police custody. Marit Andersen said she knew Breivik in high school and described him as an entertainer who had friends and was quite successful in school. Andersen said she later saw Breivik's views change. ""Later, it became more extreme, and I remember after we all got on Facebook, I became friends with him there,"" Andersen said. ""He had some rather outrageous statements there. I had commented on something he said. ... I said you can't say stuff like that. It's unacceptable."" Breivik appears to have written a 1,500-page manifesto that rants against Muslims and lays out meticulous plans to prepare for the attacks. In it, the author vilifies Stoltenberg and the Labour Party, accusing it of perpetuating ""cultural Marxist/multiculturalist ideals"" and indoctrinating youths with those ideals. The author accuses the Labour Party of embracing those ideals and allowing the ""Islamification of Europe."" CNN has not independently confirmed that Breivik is the author of the manifesto, which bears his name and says it is intended to be circulated among sympathizers. The writer rails against Muslims and their growing presence in Europe, and calls for a European civil war to overthrow governments, end multiculturalism and execute ""cultural Marxists."" It contains photographs of Breivik wearing what appears to be a military uniform that features an altered U.S. Marine Corps dress jacket with medals of the Knights Templar -- an order of Christian Crusaders who helped fight against Muslim rule of the Holy Land in the Middle Ages, but which was shut down 700 years ago. Breivik asked to wear a uniform to the court hearing but was not allowed to, Heger said. The judge said he ordered Breivik held in isolation for the next four weeks to ensure he has no opportunity to tamper with evidence, Heger said. The suspect has access to his lawyer but to no one else, and not to letters or news, court officials said. According to the Norwegian newspaper VG, which cited unidentified sources, Breivik told investigators during interviews that he belonged to a revived Knights Templar. He described the organization as an armed Christian order, fighting to rid the West of Islamic suppression, the newspaper said.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to reality competition shows, it seems less is not more. ""Project Runway,"" which will feature 90-minute-long episodes when Season 8 kicks off tonight, is the latest series in its genre to adopt a longer run time. It follows in the footsteps of other elimination shows like ""The Biggest Loser"" and ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" -- both of which switched from 60-minute  to 120-minute episodes within the past two years. So what is it about elimination shows that draws viewers to the tube for hours at a time, or, in the case of ""American Idol"" and ""So You Think You Can Dance,"" multiple times a week? ""Because of the structure of competition reality shows, people have an incentive to stick around to the end to see who gets eliminated,"" said Andy Dehnart, the editor of Reality Blurred. ""But that doesn't mean the preceding 90 or 120 minutes have been full of worthwhile content."" While a show like ""The Apprentice"" easily fills a two-hour time slot with complicated tasks, other competition shows struggle to keep viewers engaged, Dehnart says. It's all about leaving viewers wanting more. For example, he says, ""'Survivor' tribal councils last for 45 minutes or an hour in real life, but much more than 10 minutes on screen would probably be too much, since not all of that conversation is compelling or consequential."" Sara Rea, the executive producer of ""Project Runway,"" which follows aspiring fashion designers as they compete for a cash prize, agrees -- noting that 7 hour long shoots are often edited down to 20 or 30 minutes of footage. ""120 minutes is a huge commitment,"" Rea said. ""This [90 minutes] just felt more like a natural progression -- to give you more, but still leave you wanting more."" The extra time will allow viewers to get to know the characters better, Rea added. ""More character development makes the show pop."" ""The real people aspect is a draw,"" said J.D. Roth, executive producer and creator of ""The Biggest Loser."" ""I know what a scripted character is going to do, I don't know what a real person is going to do."" It's sometimes hard for viewers to identify with a scripted character, whereas they can watch a reality show and say, 'My mother is just that woman,' or 'My brother is like that guy,' Roth says. The moral of the story: Longer episodes mean more time to explore each of the characters. That's what viewers want, he said. They want to see ""who these people are."" This isn't news to reality TV expert and author of ""Uberstar,"" Vaughn Alaine-Marshall, who says viewers can't help but stay tuned when they become attached to the contestants. ""'American Idol,' 'Project Runway' -- the professions these people are tying to be a part of are quite prestigious,"" he said. ""Very few people have the talent or the courage to actually become [musicians and clothing designers]. People want to see someone like them achieve these things."" And it's a win-win, Alaine-Marshall said. The longer ""American Idol"" is on, the more ads they sell. It's financially beneficial. But, he said, it's only reality competition shows that this applies to. ""The difference from these shows compared to 'The Real World,' 'The Hills' [and] 'Jersey Shore' is there's an extra tension in the drama -- someone like you could be humiliated in front of tens of millions of people. ... There's a very fine line between someone you feel complete empathy for and someone you're willing to laugh at,"" Alaine-Marshall said. ""Could you watch 'The Situation' for more than 40 minutes? [No.] But for something like 'Project Runway,' with skill and endeavor, people want to look behind the curtain."" And while the elimination aspect might be reason enough to tune in for some viewers, Roth said the appeal of such shows is very much embedded in the format and the overall process. ""If [people] have to watch too intently, you can only do that for an hour or so."" With reality competition shows, you can read the newspaper or leave the room for a minute, come back and still be able to follow along, he added, joking that, during the ""Lost"" finale, ""I had to sit there with a piece of paper ... to keep track of what was going on."" One viewer who couldn't wait for longer episodes of ""Project Runway"" is Laura Kluvo, who blogs about the show. ""I love the challenges,"" Kluvo said. ""I love to see the designers work their way through these challenges -- each with their own set of skills, talents and personalities."" Kluvo agreed with producer Rea that longer episodes mean more of an opportunity for fans to learn about the contestants. ""You have your favorites that you root for, and usually somebody that you don't like,"" Kluvo laughed. ""You watch waiting for them to get what they deserve."" But it's not just the contestants on reality competition shows like ""Project Runway,"" ""American Idol"" and ""Top Chef"" that keep Kluvo glued to the tube for hours. ""Sometimes I watch a drama and I feel depressed ... I have enough to deal with in life. I don't want to feel unhappy or depressed after watching TV,"" she said. ""I want to feel like I had an adventure. I saw the problem, I saw the problem solved, I saw someone win."" Despite the seemingly foolproof format of reality competition shows, Dehnart of Reality Blurred says a scripted series could easily hold our attention for more than 44 minutes -- though they usually don't. ""It just takes skillful storytelling and a strong arc,"" he said.","""Project Runway"" will feature 90-minute episodes when Season 8 kicks off Thursday .

"(CNN) -- A Kosovar has admitted shooting dead two American servicemen and injuring two others in an attack on a U.S. Air Force bus in Germany, his lawyers said Wednesday. Arid Uka, 21, appeared in court in Frankfurt where he faces murder charges over the March 2 shooting outside Frankfurt International Airport, in which Nicholas Alden and Zachary Ryan Cuddeback of the U.S. Air Force died. Uka ""deeply regrets the crime he has committed,"" according to a statement provided by his lawyers, Michaela Roth and Jens Joerg Hoffman, and made a full confession to the court. At the time of the incident he was ""under influence of extreme Islamistic propaganda,"" his lawyers said, but this was not the sole reason behind his actions. On the eve of the shooting, Uka had watched an Internet video that he thought showed American soldiers severely mistreating a young Muslim woman, they said. Believing the clip was real, he had reacted by shooting the servicemen in an attempt to prevent such abuse happening in Afghanistan, the lawyers said. The court heard the video clip was in fact a scene from the U.S. anti-war film Redacted, German media reports say. The Brian De Palma drama is based on the rape and murder of an Iraqi girl by American soldiers in Mahmoudiya in 2006. ""He is now aware that he has been misguided by Islamistic propaganda,"" and that his deeds are not in accordance with his Islamic faith, Uka's lawyers said in their statement. They added that Uka was keen to bring the case to an end as quickly as possible, for the sake of the survivors and families of the victims. He is believed to have acted alone, German officials have said previously. According to a complaint filed by the U.S Department of Justice in June, Uka shot Alden in the head before boarding the bus and shooting Cuddeback. He then continued to fire, injuring two other servicemen while shouting ""God is great,"" the complaint said. When his weapon jammed, Uka ran from the bus and was later arrested by German police, the complaint said. Uka, a Muslim from Mitrovica in northern Kosovo, moved to Germany with his parents as a child.","Arid Uka ""deeply regrets"" and fully confesses his crime, his lawyers say .

"(CNN) -- NATO says a new report by the United Nations that points to a spike in violence in Afghanistan differs from the alliance's tally because ""security incidents"" were defined differently. ""The U.N. counts a number of additional event types that ISAF does not include in its definition of security incidents, such as cache finds, arrests, assassinations, intimidation, and others,"" according to a statement Thursday from the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. It says ""25% of the total U.N. security incidents are event types that ISAF does not include in its definition."" Another difference, ISAF says, is that U.N. figures include ""all incidents regardless of which entity initiates the activity,"" while NATO counted only ""attacks initiated by insurgent elements."" But the international force also said it recognizes that the country's eastern regions remain a ""challenging security situation."" Enemy-initiated attacks in June, July and August were 17% higher than the same period in 2010, according to the ISAF statement. The U.N. report, from the office of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, says security incidents in 2011 are up 39% over the same period last year. Most of the incidents involved armed clashes and improvised explosive devices. There were just as many suicide attacks -- 12 per month -- as there were a year ago, the report says. ""The south and southeast of the country, particularly around the city of Kandahar, continued to be the focus of military activity and accounted for approximately two-thirds of total security incidents,"" the report says. But a rash of recent high-profile attacks and assassinations have raised questions about the country's overall level of security, particularly as coalition forces are drawn down.","ISAF says 25% of the total U.N. security incidents are not on its list .

"Paris (CNN) -- France is to open an office in North Korea in the coming days to build cultural ties and help with aid efforts, the French Foreign Ministry said Thursday. The creation of this office responds to ""a decision made by French authorities that takes into consideration identified cultural and humanitarian needs,"" a statement from the minister of foreign affairs' office said.

"(CNN) -- The Iranian attorney for two American hikers released last week said Thursday he was briefly detained by security forces following a raid on his home. Masoud Shafiee told CNN that security forces searched his apartment on Tuesday and took him to Evin Prison in Tehran for questioning. It was the same prison where his clients, Americans Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer, were held for two years. He said security forces seized his files, including those regarding the case of Fattal and Bauer, and his computer's hard drive. ""I do not know what they were looking for,"" Shafiee said. Fattal, Bauer and Bauer's now-fiancee, Sarah Shourd, were arrested after straying across the unmarked border between Iraqi Kurdistan and Iran in July 2009. Shourd was released in 2010, but Bauer and Fattal were freed last week after 781 days in captivity and a trial for espionage that Bauer said was based on ""ridiculous lies."" Shortly after their release, Fattal and Bauer thanked numerous people who helped secure their freedom, including their attorney. Shafiee ""was never allowed to represent us properly, but he never gave up,"" Fattal said. Security forces questioned Shafiee about the two Americans, he said. ""They were very polite and respectful. But the very act of taking a lawyer to prison and searching his home just because he had done his duty seems excessive and reflects negatively on Iran's judiciary,"" Shafiee said. Before he was released, Shafiee said he was asked to write a letter guaranteeing that he would appear in court whenever he was requested to do so. It was not immediately clear what, if any, allegations Shafiee may face.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Muhammad Saad Iqbal is a free man after serving more than six years at the U.S. military's detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- without any charge. A guard talks to a Guantanamo detainee, inside the open yard at Camp 4 detention center, this week. Now, Iqbal is considering suing the U.S. government for unlawful detention. ""I am angry in my heart,"" Iqbal said in a recent interview. ""It's easy for the U.S. government to say, 'There are no charges found and he's free.' ""But who will be responsible for seven years of my life?"" His attorney in Washington, Richard Cys, said he is considering a lawsuit against the U.S. government, on behalf of Iqbal, but the details of the suit have not been worked out. Cys said he is waiting for the outcome of a habeas corpus petition, which ""could be a vehicle for future lawsuit."" ""We may well have claims arising from our habeas action, but we're still not sure what path we're going to pursue,"" he said. It would not be the first lawsuit brought against the U.S. government by a former Guantanamo detainee. President Obama signed an executive order Thursday to close the camp within a year. The move could lead to an increase in the number of lawsuits brought by former detainees who -- like Iqbal -- say they were held for no reason.  A former Gitmo detainee talks about his experiences » . The Pakistani citizen was taken into U.S. custody in January 2002 while visiting family in Indonesia. He reportedly was arrested after talking about making a shoe bomb, something he denies. ""I never [made] that statement,"" Iqbal said. ""But they have [said] a lot of things, like I went to Afghanistan, but they have no proof."" Iqbal says while in U.S. custody, he was taken to Egypt, then to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. In March 2003, he arrived at Guantanamo's military prison, which became a lightning rod for critics who charged that the Bush administration had used torture on terror detainees. Iqbal accuses his handlers in Guantanamo of beating him during his six-month hunger strike and withholding medical treatment until he agreed to cooperate. ""Even when they take me to hospital, I can't even walk but they put me in 4-by-4 [cell], my hands tied with handcuffs and my legs also had leg shackles,"" he said. The CIA and Pentagon repeatedly have denied allegations of mistreatment and torture, saying all interrogation was lawfully done. In response to Iqbal's allegations, CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano told The New York Times this month, ""I have no idea what he's talking about."" Six months after he was admitted to Guantanamo, Iqbal said he tried to kill himself. While no one watched, Iqbal said he and several inmates tried to hang themselves with bedsheets. Four of the prisoners died, according to Iqbal. But his survival continued what he calls the theft of his freedom by the U.S. government. Former President Bush and other senior officials have repeatedly denied that the U.S. government used torture to extract intelligence from terror suspects. Obama issued three executive orders Thursday designed to show a clean break from the Bush administration on the war on terror. One ordered the closure of the Guantanamo Bay facility within a year. A second executive order formally banned torture by requiring the Army Field Manual be used as the guide for terror interrogations, essentially ending the Bush administration's CIA program of enhanced interrogation methods. The third establishes an inter-agency task force to lead a systematic review of detention policies and procedures and a review of all individual cases. Iqbal was among nearly 800 inmates who came through Guantanamo Bay, classified by Washington as suspected terrorists. Most were never charged with a crime. With the help of a U.S.-based lawyer, Iqbal was released in September without ever being charged. He returned to Pakistan, walking with the help of a cane, complaining of back pain, a bad leg and a torn eardrum -- all the result, he says, of his time in custody. Not once during those nearly seven years in custody did anyone tell him why he was being held. All they told him, according to Iqbal, was that they were sent ""by the U.S. government [in] Washington, D.C., by [the] CIA, to interrogate you if you have any information about terrorists or terrorism."" Despite his anger and his physical ailments, Iqbal says he ""was born again and given a new life from God"" after his release. He is demanding justice for what he says was his unlawful detention -- but not through violent means. ""We have to convey that Islam is a peace[ful] religion and we [do] not hate anybody,"" he said.

"Beijing (CNN) -- China's first space laboratory module launched Thursday, according to state-run media, an important milestone in China's plan to build a space station. China's Xinhua news agency showed a picture of President Hu Jintao watching the launch of Tiangong-1 at Beijing Aerospace Control Center along with Communist Party officials. Tiangong means ""heavenly palace"" in Chinese. It lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in Gansu Province, northwest China. The module was on a carrier rocket, called the Long March 2F T1. The 8.5-ton lab module is part of an experiment to test space rendezvous and docking capabilities, essential for the operation of a manned space platform. Opinion: Make China our new partner in space . Wu Ping, spokesperson for the China Manned Space Engineering Project, told a press conference before the launch that the effective volume of the experiment module is about 15 cubic meters, which could potentially accommodate three astronauts. Tiangong-1 was originally scheduled to launch at the end of August but was postponed after the failure of another satellite launch. When the module successfully enters its low Earth orbit, an unmanned spacecraft -- Shenzhou-8 -- will be sent into space to dock with it. The two spacecraft will fly for about 12 days after the first docking, before conducting another docking test at an appropriate time in flight, Xinhua reported. After the two tests, the Shenzhou-8 will return to Earth and the Tiangong-1 will rise to its original orbit to wait for the next docking test. China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003, the first stage in a ""three-step"" strategy to develop its manned engineering project. The launch of Tiangong-1 is the second step. If successful, it will be followed by the last phase: to build a permanent space lab that will allow astronauts to conduct long-term space experiments. ""It is of great significance for the realization of the three-step Strategy of China Manned Space Engineering Project and the promotion of sustainable development of manned space flight."" said Wu. According to Xinhua, Beijing hopes to build a space station by around 2020. China is not part of the project that maintains the International Space Station (ISS), which currently orbits the Earth conducting experiments in a range of fields, from physics to astronomy. The ISS is a joint venture between NASA, Russia's RKA space agency, Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency, the European Space Agency and the Canadian CSA.","NEW: China launches the space lab module Tiangong-1, which means ""heavenly palace"" in Chinese .

"WESTERN DESERT, Iraq (CNN) -- The hot wind swirls around the human bones and cracked skulls that litter the forsaken desert lands in Western Iraq. The entrance to the bunker complex where al Qaeda terrorized enemies in Iraq. We are standing in the middle of what was an al Qaeda execution site, just outside an intricate bunker complex that the organization used to torture and murder its victims, the bodies left to rot or be eaten by animals. From the back of the police truck the opening to the first bunker is barely discernible in the distance. ""Al Qaeda came in as a massive force"" one of the officers says as we bump along the harsh terrain. ""They stole our cars, our personal cars. They kidnapped two of my brothers. They blew up the house over there."" In the distance we can see his village -- a set of sand colored homes surrounded by parched farmlands. As we approach grubby children chase the truck and then stand to the side, despondent, as the officer points to their home. ""Their father was killed by al Qaeda,"" he says. In 2007 the U.S. military launched a series of airstrikes that drove out al Qaeda. As we enter the first bunker Captain Khaled Bandar tells us they found the floor littered with bodies. A gaping hole is evidence of the U.S. firepower. Insurgents used the layered and intricate labyrinth of passageways and hatches to carry out summary trials and executions. The police show us clothing and shoes, saying they are leaving them in place in case the families of the victims decide to come back. The stench of decay still lingers. Al Qaeda has been on the defensive in recent years, notwithstanding spectacular attacks attributed to the group like last week's blasts in the capital, including suicide truck bomb attacks on the ministries of foreign affairs and finance.  At least 100 people were killed and more than 500 wounded. But the concerted security campaign against the group has forced it to change its structure and strategy. According to one man who has close connections to al Qaeda in Iraq and asked not to be identified, the group lost support because it lost the protection of the people. ""There is an old saying about the basics of war. Whoever wins the people wins the war. So when al Qaeda didn't win the people over, it lost its battles,"" he explains. ""Al Qaeda's strategy of taking control of areas has been abandoned for now. Their method is propaganda, instilling fear, terrorizing."" He adds that the group stopped recruiting over the last six months because of a shortage in funding and increased infiltration. ""Al Qaeda is moving towards selecting the elite and condensing its forces rather than expanding. The Americans nearly defeated al Qaeda by cornering it and reducing its operations,"" he says. But those operations are still deadly, and the war is by no means over. ""No, the war is not over in Iraq, a type of battle is over, but there are new battles cloaked in politics. Now politicians try to pay militias, al Qaeda, or armed factions ...in order to eliminate political foes,"" the man with knowledge of al Qaeda says. And al Qaeda is still able to send a message to those who dare oppose them. The police officers show us blood stains in the desert near the bunkers and tell us how they found two beheaded bodies just a month ago. They were identified as being the brothers of two police officers from another city, Ramadi. Meanwhile, al Qaeda's global war has sifted to a place it believes it can still win -- Afghanistan. ""Al Qaeda in Afghanistan is made up of true believers, those who believe in jihad and fighting, and that's why they joined,"" the man with connections says. ""As for most of al Qaeda in Iraq's members, they are just looking to benefit themselves, or they join out of resentment for a certain sect or to avenge their families."" As for Iraq's longterm stability, that very much still hangs in the balance. He says: ""Peace will not be achieved by a magic wand or the rhetoric of a politician. Peace will be accomplished through the will of the Iraqi youth. We have to wait for this generation to change ... so that a generation that hates (the violence) will emerge.""

"(CNN) -- The Tampa Bay Rays and St. Louis Cardinals won wild card berths in the Major League Baseball (MLB) playoffs after dramatic victories Wednesday. Trailing 7-0 to the American League (AL) East champion New York Yankees in St. Petersburg, Florida, the Rays launched an astonishing comeback to win in the 12th-inning. Despite their comeback success, the Rays still needed the Baltimore Orioles to defeat the Boston Red Sox in Maryland to clinch the berth on the regular season's final night. The O's obliged by notching a 4-3 win in the bottom of the ninth in a game delayed by rain for an hour and a half. There was similar drama in the National League (NL), as the Cardinals capitalized on the Atlanta Braves' 4-3 loss to National League East champion Philadelphia. The Cardinals beat Houston 8-0 to earn the other wild card spot. Major League Baseball introduced the wild card system in 1994. It rewards the two best-performing second-place teams with a spot in the playoffs -- with one team coming from each league. The Rays' victory capped a remarkable turnaround, with the Florida-based team having been nine games behind the Red Sox on September 3. Third baseman Evan Longoria hit the game-winning home run in the 12th-inning, and told the Rays' website it was like something ""meant for some kind of book."" ""If you could have drawn it up any better, it would be completely fake,"" he said. The Cardinals completed an equally impressive comeback, having trailed the Braves by 10 games on August 25. ""Once we got within hailing distance, the game of baseball is what it is,"" Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said on the team's website. ""We kept doing things that gave us a chance."" ""A winning record against winning clubs. We just kept cranking out extra wins, and it made the thing look better and better."" After Wednesday's events, the line-up for the 2011 MLB playoffs has now been decided. The Rays' reward for their heroics is a series against the AL West champion Texas Rangers, while the Yankees will go up against the AL Central-winning Detroit Tigers. In the National League, the Cardinals will take on the Phillies, with the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Milwaukee Brewers meeting in the other National League Division Series.

"(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad defied expectations and dashed widespread hopes during an anticipated nationally televised speech Wednesday when he made no mention of lifting a state of emergency. In his rambling 45-minute speech to the National Assembly, he acknowledged that Syrians want reform and that the government has not met their needs. Making several references to an anti-Syria ""conspiracy"" and threats to ""stability,"" al-Assad said strife cannot win out over future reforms. ""Although President al-Assad did acknowledge the need for reform, his failure to address head-on the lifting of the state of emergency smacks of procrastination,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and Africa. ""He could declare this tomorrow if he wanted. ""He should have immediately ordered his security forces to stop using unwarranted force and announced steps towards implementing key human rights reforms."" U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said ""the speech fell short of the type of reforms the Syrian people demanded"" and lacked substance. Al-Assad made few concrete promises after weeks of anti-government demonstrations that have left at least 61 people dead, according to Human Rights Watch. The address ""failed to commit to a specific reform agenda that would safeguard public freedoms and judicial independence and prohibit the Syrian government from encroaching on human rights,"" the group said. Reem Haddad, a spokeswoman for the Syrian Information Ministry, told CNN the emergency law ""will be lifted,"" but she said procedures must be worked out. ""The president presented his own vision"" on an announced package of reforms, Haddad said. Details will come in a ""limited time frame,"" she added. Asked if Syrians received enough information, Haddad said, ""I wouldn't say the people expected more."" At least 16 people were killed after the speech in clashes in the city of Latakia, which has been a center of unrest and the site of ongoing protests for the past few days, an eyewitness and an activist told CNN. They said the deaths happened during clashes between anti-government demonstrators and security and army forces. Haddad denied any deaths in the city. The eyewitness, who did not want to be named for security reasons, said protesters started gathering in central Latakia's Qitar Square after the speech and chanted, ""No to sectarianism, we want freedom"" and ""We stand by Daraa,"" the southern city that has seen the most violence since anti-government protests started almost two weeks ago. As the crowd reached several thousand by the afternoon, they said, army personnel and security officers began shooting at the demonstrators. ""Latakia is tense and quiet tonight following the evening's events,"" the eyewitness said. ""We are fearful because we have received today's violence as a message from the regime coinciding with the president's speech."" Another eyewitness said protests erupted in the city of Jasem, northwest of Daraa, with thousands of demonstrators in the town square. He said he also heard about demonstrations in other nearby towns. Toner said the Syrians should not interfere with planned Friday demonstrations. Al-Assad spoke a day after the Syrian cabinet resigned amid an unusual wave of unrest across the nation. Also Wednesday, the Reuters news agency reported two of its journalists are missing in Syria. Reuters quoted diplomatic sources as saying correspondent Suleiman al-Khalidi, a Jordanian national based in Amman, had been detained by the Syrian authorities in Damascus on Tuesday. The agency said photographer Khaled al-Hariri, a Syrian based in Damascus, has not been in contact with colleagues since Monday. A Syrian official said authorities were working to establish what had happened to the two men, Reuters reported, adding the agency is ""deeply concerned"" about their whereabouts. Two other Reuters journalists were detained by Syrian authorities over the weekend. Television producer Ayat Basma and cameraman Ezzat Baltaji, both Lebanese, were expelled to Lebanon, Reuters reported. Syria is the latest in a string of Arabic-speaking nations beset with discontent over economic and human rights issues. In his speech, al-Assad said Syria's government will not fall like a domino in a string of Arab revolutions, saying that instead, Syria had kicked the dominoes of the ""conspirators"" and that they had fallen instead. Al-Assad also blamed unrest in his country on ""enemies ... working daily and scientifically to undermine the stability of Syria."" He said they were ""stupid in choosing to target Syria."" ""In principle, we support reform and meeting people's needs,"" the president said. ""This is the duty of the state. But we cannot be for sedition."" He referred obliquely to the anti-government demonstrations, calling them ""a test of our unity."" Al-Assad said, however, ""we can't say that everybody who went out was part of the conspiracy. That wouldn't be accurate. ""Syria is not isolated from what is happening in the Arab world. We are part of this region,"" al-Assad said. ""We influence and are influenced by it, but at the same time we are not a copy of other countries."" Legislators in the People's Assembly cheered the president when he arrived to begin the speech. The state-run SANA news agency had reported that al-Assad's speech would ""tackle the internal affairs and the latest events in Syria"" and ""reassure the Syrian people."" Al-Assad did make a passing reference to the emergency law, in place for almost 50 years. ""Sometimes we can postpone a certain suffering that may be caused by the emergency law or any other law or necessary measures that the citizen endures, but we cannot postpone the suffering of a child whose father cannot treat him because he doesn't have the money for his medication or when the state does not have this drug or this treatment,"" he said. The law allows the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes. In effect since 1963, it also bars detainees who haven't been charged from filing court complaints or from having a lawyer present during interrogations. Ihssan Zouabi, a protester in Daraa, called the president's speech a disappointment because he didn't address demands, including lifting the emergency law. ""We were hopeful prior to the speech but after, everyone was shocked. We were expecting much, much more,"" he said. A Syrian rights activist who goes by the alias Malath Aumran for security reasons said he and other Syrians were disappointed. He said people are dying for freedom but the ""martyrs"" weren't mentioned. ""For me now, at this time ... actually he said nothing, he did nothing for us,"" Aumran said. ""All of what he said was that we are traitors, that we are working for foreign conspiracies against our country, ... that the United States is behind this, what is going on in Syria."" Amnesty's Luther said the group is ""disturbed by reports that security forces could already be shooting on demonstrators in Latakia who have been protesting against his speech."" Human Rights Watch called on al-Assad to lift the state of emergency, amend a law that allows forces to punish people for peaceful expression, investigate security services and allow the registration of new political parties.

"(CNN) -- A group of 20 doctors who were detained during this year's protests in Bahrain have been convicted of attempting to overthrow the government and hit with lengthy prison sentences, authorities and a human rights group said Thursday. Thirteen of the physicians were sentenced to 15 years in prison, two for 10 years and five for five years, said military prosecutor, Col. Yussef Rashid Flaifel. Charges against the doctors included possession of unlicensed weapons, inciting the overthrow of the government, provoking sectarian hatred and forceful occupation of a public building, officials said. Prosecutors have alleged that, at the height of the protests earlier this year, the accused medical personnel refused to help patients at Salmaniya Medical Complex, the main hospital in the Bahraini capital, Manama. ""The Salmaniya Hospital was used as a coordination center for three weeks for protests calling for the overthrow of the government. Those doctors who have been found guilty were charged with abusing the hospital for political purposes,"" a government spokesman said. ""Nobody is above the law."" This month, the doctors were released on bail after reports that several of them had gone on hunger strikes. At the time, human rights activists hoped that their release was good sign, though the charges against the doctors still stood. But Thursday, Amnesty International issued a statement, decrying the court's decision. ""These are simply ludicrous charges against civilian professionals who were working to save lives amid very trying circumstances,"" said Philip Luther, deputy director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa program. ""It appears that the real reason for targeting these health workers was the fact that they denounced the government crackdown on protesters in interviews to international media."" ""We've repeatedly said that Bahraini authorities should never have used military courts to prosecute ordinary civilians, including doctors, teachers and human rights activists,"" he added. An attorney for the doctors said the group will appeal the verdict next month in a Bahraini civilian appellate court. Protests have lingered in Bahrain for months despite a crackdown by the kingdom's Sunni monarchy, backed by troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. More than 30 people have been killed during the demonstrations, in which activists say Bahraini security forces used live ammunition against protesters. Opposition groups say more than 1,000 people -- mainly Shiites -- have been detained and more than 2,000 have lost their jobs for allegedly taking part in the protests.","The doctors are accused of trying to overthrow the Bahraini government .

"Berlin (CNN) -- German police arrested two men in Berlin on suspicion of plotting a bomb attack, police said Thursday. A 24-year-old German of Lebanese descent and a 28-year-old man from Gaza had tried to obtain chemicals that can be used to make a bomb, Berlin Police press officer Martin Otter told CNN. Police do not believe the suspects had a specific target, he said, and they are not thought to have any links to international terrorist organizations. Otter said the police operation in Berlin was over as of Thursday afternoon. Officers earlier searched an Islamic cultural association and two other addresses in Berlin in connection with the arrests. Law enforcement had been monitoring the men for months, police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf told CNN. He said the pair came under suspicion after they sought to acquire a large amount of cooling agent. The arrests were made in the Kreuzberg and Neukoelln districts of Berlin, Neuendorf told reporters outside the Islamic center. The center was searched because police believed the suspects might have stored some chemical material there as it had a lot of space, he added. Neuendorf said many papers had been found but no explosives. The public prosecutor's office for Berlin is investigating the case, he added. A German intelligence official, who did not want to be named because he was not specifically authorized to talk to the media, told CNN the suspected plot was thought to be Islamist. Berlin's Al Rahman mosque was visited by investigators as well as the Islamic center, the intelligence official said. There has been increased concern in recent years over homegrown, al Qaeda-inspired terrorism in Germany, he said. German counter-terrorism officials are especially concerned by the spreading influence of the English-language AQAP (al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) Inspire online magazine in Germany, which gives instructions on how to carry out an attack, he added. Berlin resident Annette Suessmuth, 25, told CNN she was concerned for the safety of her two young children after the arrests. ""I am shocked. Normally I go here very often for shopping. I don't feel safe any more,"" she said. The federal chairman of the German police union, Bernhard Witthaut, said the arrest of two suspects after months of shadowing was a ""huge success"" for Berlin's police. He urged all Germans to remain vigilant, saying: ""It is better to call the police one time too often than to stay passive."" With the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the United States only three days away, many security services around the world are on a heightened state of alert. CNN's Rick Noack and Stephanie Halazs and CNN security analyst Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.","NEW: The suspects did not have links to international terrorist groups, police say .

"London (CNN) -- A funeral took place in London Friday for Mark Duggan, the father of four whose death after his cab was stopped by armed police led to protests that expanded into four days of rioting. A horse-drawn cortege processed through the streets from his parents' home in the north London neighborhood of Tottenham to the church in nearby Wood Green where the ceremony was held, with many mourners on hand. Duggan, 29, died on August 4 from a gunshot to the chest after a police unit that deals with gun crime stopped the cab that was carrying him. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is still investigating the circumstances around his death and said Thursday that it ""is far from reaching any conclusions."" A peaceful protest in Tottenham two days after his death turned violent and rioting spread to other parts of London and other English cities over the following days. Michael Jarrett, 47, from Tottenham was among hundreds who turned out to pay their respects to Duggan and his family. In 1985, Jarrett's mother, Cynthia, died after four police officers searched her home in Tottenham's Broadwater Farm housing project. Anger over her death sparked the Broadwater Farm riots, in which a policeman died. The area's reputation was tainted for years. Speaking outside the church where Duggan's funeral was held, Jarrett told CNN little had changed in the decades since then. ""The ethnic minorities are still being mistreated,"" he said. ""I don't think a lot changed, the mood in the area is one of regret and sorrow. But there is still a lot of mistrust where the police are concerned."" He said politicians who blamed people who ""just want to loot, steal and riot"" for the unrest that broke out last month need to look at the underlying problems behind such behavior. ""I actually condemn the looting and the burning of buildings,"" he said, ""but I understand the situation behind and the frustration and anger behind it. That I do understand. Fully."" Yvonne Collail, 47, from Tottenham told CNN she was concerned that the recent trouble in Tottenham had made everyone less safe and meant the police would have to carry guns, which is unusual in Britain. London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement beforehand that a senior officer had ""met with the parents and family of Mark Duggan and discussed the policing arrangements"" for the funeral. ""In line with the family's wishes, the policing will reflect the family's desire for a local, peaceful and dignified funeral,"" the statement said. Questions remain unanswered about the circumstances of Duggan's death. Prime Minister David Cameron said last month that Duggan had been shot by police but the IPCC has yet to reach a formal conclusion. In a letter to the Times of London published Thursday, the IPCC said the newspaper's headline indicating that an officer had been cleared of shooting Duggan was incorrect and ""irresponsible."" The IPCC said it is continuing to follow numerous leads as it investigates Duggan's death, including examining security camera footage, conducting forensic tests and talking to witnesses. The commission acknowledged that ""people want answers,"" but urged them ""not to rush to judgment until they see and hear the evidence for themselves."" A Metropolitan Police statement Thursday said: ""The firearms officer involved in the shooting of Mark Duggan is not about to return to operational firearms duties."" Initial reports that Duggan shot at police were ruled out by ballistic tests, which found that a bullet that lodged in one officer's radio was of a type issued to police. The IPCC also said there had been no exchange of fire. A handgun that was not police issue was found at the scene, the IPCC said, but there was no evidence it had been fired during the incident.

"(CNN)  -- Defending champion Roger Federer and world number two Rafael Nadal were sent crashing from the Masters 1000 event in Cincinnati Friday. Federer, unbeaten at the hard court tournament since 2008, went down tamely to eighth seed Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic, losing 6-2 7-6 in just over 90 minutes. Earlier, in-form Mardy Fish thrashed Nadal 6-3 6-4 to march into the semifinals in Ohio. Victory earned the seventh-seeded American a clash against fourth-ranked Andy Murray of Britain, who he beat in the corresponding tournament last year. The seventh seed, who pushed world number one Novak Djokovic all the way in the Montreal Masters final last week, continued that superb form against a listless Nadal. Fish claimed the early break against Nadal, who had been involved in a marathon tussle with fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco the previous evening, and never looked back. He wrapped up the first set in 43 minutes and broke through in the fifth game of the second as Nadal sent a forehand wide on break point against him. Fish, who was serving magnificently, never looked like surrendering the advantage and carved out three match points before winning it with a forehand passing shot after one hour 43 minutes. It was his first victory in seven attempts against the indominatable Nadal as he acknowledged in his post-match interview. ""He's kicked my butt six times and it feels pretty good to have turned it around,"" he told Sky Sports. ""I'm so much more confident right now and if I was to choose a surface and a court I would choose this one,"" he added. Murray, who crashed out in ignominious fashion in his opener in Montreal last week, has been showing much improved form and saw off France's Gilles Simon 6-3 6-3 in an early morning encounter. ""It is good when you win to get it out of the way,"" Murray told Sky Sports. ""I managed to get through and look forward to the next one."" But it was the defeat of Federer that proved the main talking point as the former world number one looked out of sorts from the start against the big-hitting Berdych. He was broken twice in the opening set and could not fashion a single break point. The second set was closer, but Berdych, who beat the Swiss star in the semifinals of Wimbledon last year, easily won the tiebreak 7-3 to progresss. He will play world number one Novak Djokovic, who was also given a scare before beating Gael Monfils in the night match. The French sixth seed took the first set, but his Serbian opponent recovered to win 3-6 6-4 6-3 in two and a half hours. ""It was a very physical match, but I hung in there and it was a good win,"" Djokovic told AFP. The win takes Djokovic to 56-1 for the year with his only defeat to Federer in the semifinals of the French Open.","NEW: Novak Djokovic survives scare to beat Gael Monfils in Cincinnati .

"(CNN) -- Hours of TV each day. The internet. Increased travel and mobility. All these factors expose us to culture and voices on a national rather than local scale. But if you think all this exposure is homogenizing our language, think again. Regional accents are going strong around the United States, bringing with them all kinds of cultural flavor. If you're one of the many that assume all this media exposure must be homogenizing the American accent, you're not alone. It sounds like a logical hypothesis: The accents heard in the media are far-reaching and pervasive, so local accents must be on the decline as the population is exposed to all this ""standardized"" speech. But experts say it's a common misconception that has no basis in fact. ""There is zero evidence for television or the other popular media disseminating or influencing sound changes or grammatical innovations,"" wrote linguist J.K. Chambers in a 2006 essay for PBS. And experts agree that regional accents around the United States are alive and well. But what effect are these regional accents having on American culture? As part of the CNN iReport cultural census, which examines some of the more intangible characteristics that define the American population, we asked people around the country to read a standard passage aloud so we could evaluate their regional accent. We also asked them to tell us a little about their speech: how they feel about their accent, who influenced it, and how they think others view it. Some of the strongest opinions came from iReporters with ""country"" accents: Southern or Western. These accents are among the most stigmatized in the United States, and people who possess them have a wide range of views, from pride to annoyance. ""I hope that when others hear me speak, they hear me, not my western twang,"" writes iReporter Sarah Beth Boynton, who was raised in Salt Lake City. Boynton grew up singing with her family and got sick of hearing that she should only sing country music because of her accent. ""I have made a concerted effort to speak with as little 'western twang' in my accent as possible,"" she revealed. Meghann Holmes also tries to modulate her accent, but for professional reasons. A native of Kentucky, she says she's proud of her accent and has ""great appreciation for regional accents and dialects."" But she thinks this pride may not be appropriate for her workplace. ""Because I work in public relations, and because I am aware that some employ a negative image of people with strong 'hillbilly' accents, I tend to modify my speech when I am conducting business,"" says Holmes, who lives in London, Kentucky. According to law professor Mari Matsuda, concerns like Holmes' are well-founded. Matsuda, who teaches and writes at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, penned a frequently cited paper called ""Voices of America: Accent, Antidiscrimination Law, and a Jurisprudence for the Last Reconstruction"" for the Yale Law Journal. ""Sociolinguists have shown that in the area of speech evaluation, we are particularly susceptible to the cultural stereotypes we have absorbed,"" she writes. ""Low-status accents will sound foreign and unintelligible. High-status accents will sound clear and competent."" Or, to put it simply, ""there is significant discrimination against regional accents,"" she said via e-mail. Matsuda argues that discrimination against both foreign and domestic accents, intentional or unintentional, can hurt people with a ""low-status"" accent when they're looking for a job. A University of Chicago psychology study from 2010 backs her up: The study found that people who spoke with a foreign accent were seen as less credible than those who spoke with a ""standard"" American accent. Still, some Americans wouldn't give up their regional accent for anything. Just ask Sonya Tricie of New Orleans. ""I always hated my accent growing up, often trying to over-enunciate words to prevent sounding like the people around me,"" she remembers. But her tune changed, literally, when she went through the hellish experience of Hurricane Katrina. ""After Hurricane Katrina, I was horrified when I realized this very cultural and unique thing might be gone forever,"" Tricie explains. ""I moved back home and there is almost no way to describe how happy it makes me when one of my kids says something so local in our accent!"" ""I love my accent. It is a part of me,"" agrees Kenyotta Elijah of Lufkin, Texas. She, too, tried to change her accent for professional reasons when she was younger, and says she's gotten her fair share of jokes from people who have ""preconceived notions about southerners, particularly Texans."" But now, it's a point of pride. ""I love it when others, especially northerners, hear me talk,"" she says. ""Most of the time, they find my accent cute.""","Regional accents are alive and well in the United States .

"(CNN) -- First Sgt. Brian Vasquez smiled as he stumbled upon an old letter that had been missing since he was a young soldier in Desert Storm. ""You are so kind to remember me with a very nice letter,"" Vasquez read from the weathered pages. ""The cards and letters I receive from you are very dear to me."" The letter contained words of encouragement written by Dorothy Landgraf, a stranger at the time, but eventually a friend. Hundreds of soldiers who got her letters came to know her as Granny Dot. Granny Dot was a regular one-woman USO. From 1991 to 2003, she wrote more than 100 letters a month to deployed soldiers. Initially, she addressed the letters to ""Any Service Person,"" hoping that someone without family support could have some contact back in the United States. ""I would do anything for that woman,"" said Vasquez. ""She always had an uplifting message for anyone who didn't have family, or who felt afraid."" After finding her letter, Vasquez put in a phone call to thank his ""granny"" for her encouragement. ""It just set my heart alive that he would remember me,"" Granny Dot said. ""My heart aches for soldiers -- it always did when I was a little girl at 8 or 9 years old. I thought the soldiers were so important. I've just always been real patriotic. I teach my kids to be that way."" Supporting the troops was a family affair in the Landgraf household. Granny Dot would come home from work, cook dinner, and her husband, Kenneth Landgraf, would wash the dishes so she could begin writing. Her real-life grandchildren pitched in during the holidays. Granny Dot's support didn't stop with the letters. She ensured her soldiers were well taken care of by mailing them cookies, toys, games, Big Red chewing gum, films and magazines. ""One box I sent out had makeup in it and ended up in a company that had no females,"" Granny Dot said. ""The men made a point to write me back telling me how much they enjoyed dressing a couple of the guys up and joking around."" The soldiers meant the world to Granny Dot. She said corresponding with them and learning about their lives was incredibly rewarding. Each time a different soldier responded to one of her letters, Granny Dot proudly tied a bright yellow ribbon to her dogwood tree in New Albany, Indiana. There were 147 ribbons in all. Eventually, Granny Dot's worsening health required that she put away her typewriter. Once she stopped writing, most of the soldiers followed suit. Many things have changed since Granny Dot churned out letters and sent gifts regularly. Next week, Granny Dot will celebrate her 59th wedding anniversary. She said that some details of her vast friendships with soldiers have slipped from her memory, but she is happy the soldiers have kept her on their minds. ""It was my life for those 12 years,"" Granny Dot said. The words in Granny Dot's letter to Vasquez have faded with age, but the message is as clear as the late summer day on which it was written: . ""I hope this letter finds you well and in a safe place, if there is such a thing in this world. ... You are a delight to my life and my heart. You are the future and I feel that you will make a better world.""","Soldier remembers kind stranger who wrote him letters of encouragement .

"(CNN) -- University of Miami football coach Al Golden says his team is moving forward, despite allegations by an imprisoned former booster who claims to have spent millions on improper gifts, entertainment and travel for Hurricanes athletes. ""I think, if anything, it's going to bring us closer together,"" he said of the current team, which he said has nothing to do with the allegations. Golden, who was hired in December, said that despite the scrutiny of the program, his team had its best practice yet Wednesday. The Hurricanes open their season at Maryland on September 5. Inside the football program, ""we are moving forward,"" he said. The allegations were leveled by Nevin Shapiro, a onetime Miami businessman now serving a 20-year federal prison term for fraud. Shapiro told Yahoo! Sports that he showered dozens of Miami players with cash and jewelry, paid restaurant and nightclub tabs and supplied prostitutes over an eight-year period -- and that several coaches were aware of the activity. Shapiro was arrested in 2010 on charges of overseeing a Ponzi scheme that prosecutors determined had totaled $930 million. He pleaded guilty to securities fraud and money laundering in September, and his accusations against Miami were part of his agreement to cooperate with prosecutors, his lawyer told CNN's ""Newsroom"" Wednesday. Golden said that he is cooperating with the NCAA investigation and that part of that entails getting the ""young people"" to cooperate, too. ""We want to get to the truth,"" he said. The coach declined to elaborate further, citing the ongoing investigations. Once the NCAA concludes its investigation, Golden said, the school and his program will ""act accordingly."" Miami Athletic Director Shawn Eichorst said in a statement Thursday that ""these are not times for pity and reflection."" ""There are tough times ahead, challenges to overcome and serious decisions to be made, but we will be left standing and we will be stronger as a result,"" he said. ""I understand there are unanswered questions, concerns and frustration by many but this athletic department will be defined now and in the future, by our core values, our integrity and our commitment to excellence, and by nothing else."" Charles Robinson, who interviewed Shapiro for Yahoo! Sports, called Shapiro ""a mixed bag as a human being,"" but documents and former players have backed up some of his allegations. The NCAA, which regulates college sports, said it has been investigating Shapiro's claims for five months. NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a written statement that if true, the allegations show the need for ""serious and fundamental change"" in college sports, especially regarding the conduct of boosters and agents.","NEW: Athletic director says this is not time for ""pity and reflection""

"(CNN) -- As debt-ridden Greece braces for strikes while its prime minister attempts to reassure Europe that his country will pay its bills, the 17 eurozone countries are in various stages of deciding whether to approve the expansion of Europe's bailout fund. The proposed enhancements to the European Financial Stability Facility would allow the fund to increase its lending capacity from â‚¬250 billion to â‚¬440 billion and buy sovereign bonds in capital markets -- a strategy designed to prop up debt prices and help struggling eurozone countries fund themselves. Europe's leaders originally hoped that the EFSF would never have to be used; now they are hoping the fund's new powers will be enough to prevent the collapse of the eurozone. First they will have to pass the measures. Here's a rundown of where the countries stand and the dates their governments approved (or are expected to approve) EFSF expansion. YET TO APPROVE . Estonia -- September 29 . The Estonian parliament passed one of two necessary resolutions to ratify EFSF expansion earlier this week, despite attempts by the country's main opposition party to block the changes on the grounds that one of the eurozone's poorer states simply cannot afford to help bailout failing eurozone economies. Final approval is expected on Thursday. Malta -- October 3-7 . Malta joined Finland in its demand that Greece put up collateral in exchange for any additional bailout money that Malta would pay into the EFSF. But it is unclear whether Malta will join the Finns in dropping that requirement before passing EFSF enhancement. Either way, approval and ratification of any proposed plan cannot happen until lawmakers return from recess on October 3. Netherlands -- October 3-7 . Once opposed to expanding the rescue fund, the Dutch are now expected to approve enhanced EFSF measures with a parliamentary vote by the end of the first week of October -- although hardliners in the government continue to call for the private sector to take on more of the debt burden. Cyprus -- October 3-7 . The Cypriot cabinet has approved the measures and parliament is expected to ratify the EFSF expansion sometime during the first week of October. Slovakia -- Mid to late October . One of the eurozone's poorest countries is also the biggest obstacle to enhancing the EFSF -- and members of the governing coalition's refusal to approve the plan means a parliamentary vote may not happen until mid-October. Portugal -- End of October . While Portugal hasn't officially approved EFSF expansion, it is expected to within weeks -- the cash-strapped country is, after all, receiving financial assistance from the bailout fund. ALREADY APPROVED . Germany -- September 29 . The German Bundestag approved the expansion of the EFSF by a vote of 523-85 -- a huge majority and an important victory for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has led calls for the bailout fund to be enhanced. Approval of EFSF expansion measures by Europe's largest economy -- and largest holder of Greek debt -- was seen as necessary for the bailout fund's future success. Finland -- September 28 . One of the most vocal opponents of EFSF enhancement in the early going, Finland has now dropped its demand that Greece put up some cash collateral in return for its approval -- a requirement that threatened to derail the bailout fund expansion and further destabilize global markets. By a vote of 103-66, the Finnish Parliament approved the measures Wednesday, despite the absence of any agreement over its demand for collateral. Slovenia -- September 27 . Despite a no-confidence vote that brought down Slovenia's government last week, the parliament approved the expansion of the bailout fund on Tuesday. Greece -- September 27 . Easily the least surprising 'yes' vote on this list, Greece officially ratified EFSF expansion yesterday -- a vital step towards the bankrupt nation receiving a second bailout worth over 100 billion euros out of the bailout fund in the coming months and years. Austria -- September 27 . Just weeks after opposition parties blocked the government's attempt to fast-track the EFSF bill, lawmakers approved EFSF enhancements that are expected to be officially ratified on September 30. Ireland -- September 22 . Another of the obvious 'yes' votes on the list, Ireland -- which received an 85 billion euro bailout last year -- was never going to object to EFSF expansion. Italy -- September 15 . Ratification of the expansion of EFSF powers was included in Italy's passage of highly contentious austerity measures aimed at balancing Europe's third largest economy by 2013. Spain -- September 15 . Spain, known along with Italy as the two at-risk eurozone countries that are ""too big to bail out,"" passed EFSF expansion several weeks ago. Luxembourg -- September 15 . As expected, Luxembourg approved EFSF enhancement, but Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker reportedly ruled out any proposed increases to the amount of money at the fund's disposal. Belgium -- September 14 . The Belgian parliament approved the EFSF expansion by a large majority. France -- September 8 . Europe's second largest economy was the first country to approve EFSF enhancement. French banks are among the most exposed to risk due to a potential Greek default.","Germany's approval of EFSF expansion is seen as necessary for the fund's success .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Amanda Knox and former boyfriend Rafael Sollecito are killers and the evidence proves it, a prosecutor insisted Friday in wrapping up her statement in the duo's appeal of their 2009 murder convictions. Knox and Sollecito were convicted of killing Knox's former roommate, Meredith Kercher, in a bloody crime that left the victim half-naked with her throat slashed. Knox's attorneys argued in their closing arguments Thursday that police had made numerous mistakes investigating the crime and that evidence didn't support the convictions. But prosecutor Manuela Comodi said the evidence is clear, from bloody footprints with particular characteristics that match the two to the very spot where Knox's DNA was found on a kitchen knife believed by investigators to be the murder weapon. ""They are young, but so was Meredith. They've murdered. And they have killed for nothing. And for this they must be condemned to the maximum sentence,"" Comodi said. The hearing was expected to continue Friday with an attorney for Kercher's family addressing the court. No ruling is expected until Monday, when Knox and Sollecito are expected to give final statements, according to the judge. At Friday's hearing, prosecutor Giuliano Mignini said Knox and Sollecito tried to blame the killing on another co-defendant, Rudy Guede, because Guede is black. Guede was also convicted in the case and is already serving a 16-year sentence. Comodi, showed jurors a photograph of a bloody footprint found in the bathroom of the home were Kercher was killed. There was no way the footprint was Guede's as defense attorneys had contended, Comodi argued. Comodi said experts have concluded that the footprint was not Guede's and probably was Sollecito. She also told the court that just because the footprint was found ""not usable"" for positive identification, it doesn't mean that they are ""non usable'"" when you can do a process of elimination. Comodi also used her microphone to demonstrate the how the location where Knox's DNA was found on the presumed murder weapon -- at the junction between the blade and the handle -- suggests a stabbing motion, rather than a cutting motion. On Thursday, Knox's attorneys gave their final arguments to counter prosecutors' portrayal of her as a cunning ""femme fatale."" Lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova told the jury ""that the only possible decision to take is that of absolving Amanda Knox,"" as he wrapped up his closing argument. He said the court had seen no trace of Amanda Knox in the room where the murder took place. Another one of Knox's lawyers, Luciano Ghirga, said she was ""very afraid but her heart is full of hope"" that she will be freed. Her ""image was massacred"" by the media and the attacks on her character started before the trial, he said, adding that he considered her as a daughter. Concluding an emotional appearance, he appealed to the jury to put themselves in the shoes of Knox's family -- a counterpoise to the words of appeals court prosecutor Giancarlo Costagliola, who asked the jury to put themselves in the shoes of Kercher's family at the start of the closing arguments a week ago. The ""clan Knox"" -- as Knox's family have been referred to -- are not part of some rumored U.S. conspiracy to put pressure on the Italian courts to release her, Ghirga said. Rather, ""they are parents and they deserve respect."" The lawyer also praised the court's work, saying he felt Knox's rights had finally been respected. Urging the jury not to let innocent people stay in jail, Vedova earlier detailed what he called many ""mistakes"" made in the investigation into Kercher's death. When Knox was arrested and interrogated, she was not allowed a translator and was discouraged from getting a lawyer, Vedova said. ""'That night Amanda Knox's right to defend herself was denied,"" he said. ""She was just a young girl, first time out of the country. She didn't speak Italian."" Vedova argued that some of the DNA evidence presented by the prosecution should be thrown out. He said some material was contaminated as a result of poor practice by police, including supposed traces of mixed blood in the bathroom sink shared by the two girls. The prosecution's use of alleged bloody footprints in their case was also wrong, he said. As for the knife used to kill Kercher, a key piece of evidence, Vedova told the court there was a ""concentration of nothingness, a fantasy"" in the prosecution's arguments. He ridiculed a theory that Sollecito had not disposed of the knife because he was concerned his landlady would notice it was missing, asking: ""What kind of a killer would think about this after committing a murder?"" Knox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, while Sollecito got 25.

"(CNN) -- How do you get someone to buy a ticket for a cancer show? Pretend it's a comedy of course. Hey, it worked with ""The Bucket List!"" Anyhow that seems to be the marketing strategy for ""50/50,"" a sympathetic and yes, sometimes, humorous drama about a young man diagnosed with a rare form of the disease that's nowhere near as crass as the trailer would have you believe. Of course the combination of crass and Seth Rogen is a proven winner, so you can't blame them for trying. He plays the crude, beer-swilling, girlfriend-hating best buddy supporting role, but even this off-the-peg character has more going for him than usual. He may be boorish, especially around women, but Kyle genuinely wants what's best for Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Learning that his pal's chances of coming through this are 50/50, he immediately takes heart: ""If you were a casino game you'd have the best odds."" A more resourceful actor than he used to be, Rogen shows us someone who is actively trying to grow up even if he's not too sure what that might entail. It's a delicate portrait of a clumsy man. As you would expect, most of the dramatic heavy lifting falls on Gordon-Levitt, and he responds smartly by underplaying, muting his responses, looking for stillness and calm -- or what his trainee therapist (Anna Kendrick) recognizes as numb denial. When that composure does break, Gordon-Levitt hits you hard with Adam's anger and fear. Admittedly the movie doesn't have the stomach for the gaunt physical enfeeblement you see in most serious cancer cases -- and occasionally in rare, brave films like ""One True Thing."" Adam shaves his head and admits to some weariness, but that's about as far down that depressing road director Jonathan Levine wants to take us. Few audiences will complain. It's a movie, not a documentary. Based on an autobiographical screenplay by Will Reiser (a friend of Seth Rogen who apparently went through the same diagnosis), ""50/50"" generally avoids the terminal whimsy that swamps Gus Van Sant's current arty atrocity, ""Restless"" in favor of practical real-life concerns like getting to and from the hospital, eating and allowing your loved ones their share of the suffering (Anjelica Huston more or less steals the movie with a knockout turn as a difficult and overbearing but still caring mom). On this evidence, hanging out for chemo with the guys is almost like poker night -- until one player cashes in his chips for good. But the mordant camaraderie Adam strikes up with his much older fellow patients (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer) rings true, actually. Anna Kendrick (from ""Up in the Air"") works hard to make her novice psychologist believable -- a tall order in the circumstances but she carries it off well enough -- while Bryce Dallas Howard bravely follows ""The Help"" with another chilly narcissist, Adam's girlfriend Rachel. The plotting isn't exactly unpredictable, but when it comes to juggling comedy and pathos, ""50/50"" gets the balance just about right. It's no cure for cancer, but when we're dealing with such a painful topic it sure doesn't hurt to laugh -- or cry -- and know you're in good company.","Seth Rogen shows us someone who is actively trying to grow up .

"Bamenda, Cameroon (CNN) -- Cameroon's longtime president, Paul Biya, has officially declared his candidacy for the October 9 presidential polls despite calls for him to step down after nearly 30 years in power. Biya's party, the ruling Cameroon's People Democratic Movement party (CPDM), sent a high-profile delegation Sunday to the headquarters of ELECAM, the country's electoral commission, to cast his name on the list along with at least 50 other presidential candidates, including three women. The move by the 78-year-old president to seek another seven-year term in office has drawn sharp criticism from the opposition Social Democratic Front, whose leader, John Fru Ndi, is also running for president. In the opposition-held stronghold of Bamenda, the capital of the country's Northwest region, thousands of government troops from the Rapid Intervention Battalion were stationed in strategic locations to keep order after Biya's announcement. In 2008, Biya erased term limits from the constitution. That move -- coupled with rocketing food prices -- fueled anti-government riots that human rights groups, cited by the U.S. State Department, say killed approximately 100 people. The government of Cameroon put the number of deaths at 40. ""We are worried about the fate of the youths in Cameroon. We do not have jobs and the cost for basic necessities like food, health and even water remain record-high. Cameroon is not to be ruled only by French-speaking citizens. We have English citizens as well,"" Bamenda resident Peter Ambe told CNN. As many as 80% of young people in Cameroon are unemployed, according to opposition figures, while the government says unemployment is at 76%. Ambe accuses Biya and his administration of corruption and embezzlement of state funds. As the political unrest simmered, many politicians voiced concerns that the so-called ""Arab Spring"" -- in which authoritarian governments in the Middle East and North Africa were being pushed out by popular uprisings -- was inching its way to sub-Saharan Africa, starting with Cameroon. In June, the opposition SDF called for a boycott of voter registration and disruption of the polls, denouncing the country's elections commission due to its makeup of all Biya appointees. Two months later, the SDF backed off of its threatened disruptions after the government agreed to revise the composition to the elections commission and create better conditions for free and fair elections. But critics charge that Biya has consistently bypassed the constitution and doctored poll results in his favor, still putting ELECAM under his control. The European Union recently provided funding to increase voter awareness in Cameroon, as well as to train journalists and observers for the October 9 election. Supporters of the ruling CPDM party told CNN that criticisms against the president should be measured against his accomplishments, and noted that the country enjoys relative peace and stability. ""Mr. Biya is the people's choice,"" Prof. Elvis Ngolle Ngolle, a senior cabinet minister, told CNN.","President Paul Biya has been in power since 1982 .

"(CNN) -- If anyone knows how to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, it's trainer Christiane Head. The 62-year-old explained to CNN how she did it in only her first full season as a trainer. Chantilly is the heart of the French horseracing industry. At 6.45am on a hazy September morning the sun is threatening to rise over Les Aigles, a 500 acre warren of trails and tracks that serves as a training ground for the 1,800 racehorses that are exercised here daily. A woman -- in her 60's, bespectacled, unassuming -- peers into the soupy mist. She waits. Suddenly the silence is broken by the sound of hooves. A pair of horses, followed by another pair, and another, canters into view, emerging as if from behind a curtain of fog. As the parade of thoroughbreds passes by, snorting steam from their nostrils in the morning air, the woman calmly appraises each one, looking at their legs, theirs heads, occasionally throwing a question to the rider bobbing atop the prancing animal. If an unspoken sense of deference hangs in the air, that's because this woman is no ordinary racehorse trainer. She is Christiane Head, scion of France's most famous racing dynasty; the first female racehorse trainer in France and the first woman to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, France's most prestigious race. ""I'm the fourth generation of my family to train,"" explains Head. ""Ever since I was very small I wanted to be a trainer but my dad [Alec Head, a successful trainer and breeder in his own right] said, 'No, there are no female trainers in France. ""'Maybe you can marry a trainer but you won't be able to train yourself.' So I started working with him as his assistant. It took a little time but eventually I applied for my license and in the end they gave it to me. That was more than 30 years ago and I've been training ever since."" Head, whose family trace their roots back to England, has trained for some of the biggest owners both inside and outside France and has won more than 100 Group races, including the Arc, which she captured in her first full season as a trainer. Indeed, the 1979 Arc was something of a Head family affair: the winner, Three Troikas, was trained by Head, owned by her mother Ghislaine and ridden by her brother Freddy; then a top jockey, now a trainer himself. ""I see the race as if it was yesterday. Freddy was in the middle of the pack going very easily. Before he got into the straight and I said to my mother, 'We've won the race.' She just turned to me and she was furious! She said 'Never say that!' But she was traveling so easily, the filly, that when Freddy pulled her out she just went. He never asked her to do anything, she just went. It's something that I'll never forget."" The victory was all the more unusual because Three Troikas was only the 10th female horse to win the race, beating older males. ""That filly was so good, but she had to beat the best,"" recalls Head. ""That year there was the winner of the French Derby and the winner of the English Derby [in the race]. For a filly she was very strong. She looked more like a male than a female. And, like all good fillies, she had a lot of character."" Although there has not been a female winner of the Arc since Zarkava in 2008, this year's field features a strong filly contingent, including the favorite Sarafina and the fancied Galikova -- trained, appropriately, by one Freddy Head. The life of a trainer is one of early starts, late nights, dashed hopes and disappointments; for every Arc winner, there are hundreds of horses who will never make the grade. Not a life, in short, for anyone who is anything less than 100% committed to the cause. But despite being in her fourth decade as a trainer, Head is showing no signs of slowing down. ""I'll keep going as long as I can because it's very difficult to stop. Every year you receive new two-year-olds and yearlings and you want to see how they turn out. I get up at 5 o'clock every day and I'll be here until half past 12, 1 o'clock. And that's every day the same: Saturday, Sunday, there's no weekend, nothing. But you know, it's also never the same. You never get bored."" With the next generation of Heads already coming through, there is no indication that this family's domination of the French racing industry is set to come to an end any time soon. ""Freddy's got a son who works with him and I've got a daughter who's married to a trainer. It's in our blood. Sometimes I think we have more horse blood than human blood.""","Christiane Head is in charge of one France's most famous racing dynasties .

"(CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton designated an India-based militant group as a foreign terrorist organization Thursday. It is the Indian Mujahideen, which has ""close ties to other U.S.- designated terrorist entities."" They include Pakistan-based Lashkar e-Tayyiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Harakat ul-Jihad-i-Islami. The State Department said in a statement the group's goal ""is to carry out terrorist actions against non-Muslims in furtherance of its ultimate objective -- an Islamic Caliphate across South Asia. "" In 2008, the group ""was responsible for 16 synchronized bomb blasts in crowded urban centers and a local hospital that killed 38 and injured more than 100 in Ahmedabad,"" the State Department said.

"(CNN) -- All 21 people aboard a military plane that went missing off Chile's Pacific coast, near the Juan Fernandez islands, are dead, Defense Minister Andres Allamand said Saturday. According to preliminary information, the passengers died instantly on impact, according to Allamand. At least four bodies were found earlier Saturday, one day after the plane went missing. Two of the bodies recovered were female and two were male, government spokesman Andres Chadwick told reporters. The four bodies were flown to the capital, Santiago, where authorities identified the victims. An emergency beacon originally believed to be from the plane was also found Saturday, but is now thought to have belonged to a fishing boat, CNN Chile reported. Gen. Maximiliano Larraechea, secretary general of the air force, earlier told Chile's state-run broadcaster TVN that one of the plane's locator devices had been found. TVN quoted him as saying he was almost certain the plane had crashed because of the number of items recovered. The plane tried to land twice before losing contact, Allamand told reporters Friday. Chile's TVN Executive Director Mauro Valdes said five of the passengers were employees of the television station, including Felipe Camiroaga, a well-known and popular TV personality. The country's president, Sebastian Pinera, vowed to investigate the circumstances of the crash. ""This is a tough blow to our country, but it is precisely these moments of anguish and uncertainty that require the unity and solidarity of all Chileans,"" CNN Chile reported the president said Friday. CNN's Mariano Castillo and Umaro Djau contributed to this report.","NEW: Four bodies -- two male and two female -- are identified in Santiago, an official says .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United has announced a record operating profit of £110.9 million ($176 million) for last season, cementing its position as the world's richest football club. The English Premier League champions also reported that its turnover for the year had increased by almost $73 million to $536 million, as it considers a plan to raise a further $1 billion on the Singapore Stock Exchange to reduce its considerable debt burden. United's net debt stands at $498.7 million, in part due to the money the U.S.-based Glazer family had to raise to buy the club for $1.2 billion in 2005. The deal effectively left the club with a huge mortgage and crippling interest payments -- believed to be around $72 million a year, according to British media reports. Blog: Football's financial folly . But a hugely successful year on and off the pitch has helped to alleviate the pressure. On the pitch, they won their 19th Premier League title -- another record -- and were beaten finalists in the lucrative Champions League, Europe's top club competition. The club also scored off the pitch with a series of high-profile commercial deals, including the first year of their $129 million shirt sponsorship agreement with the Aon Corporation and a $64 million deal with logistics company DHL to sponsor their training kit. United top Forbes' football rich list . However, the club's financial strategy is increasingly focused on Asia, where it has an estimated 190 million supporters -- helped in no small part by the proliferation of English Premier League broadcast rights across the region in recent years. As a result, United's owners favor Singapore for the initial public offering (IPO) to cash in on this enormous fan base, though Britain's Guardian newspaper reported that they will pursue a dual-share structure, whereby investors will have to purchase one ""non-voting"" share for every voting share. This will allow the Glazers to raise funds while retaining control of the club they de-listed from the London Stock Exchange six years ago. Earlier this month, the club announced a three-year partnership with a Vietnamese mobile telecoms company. According to United's official website, Beeline will distribute a range of content, from on the pitch action, to news and interviews, to the club's estimated 16 million fans in Vietnam. ""Everyone knows about the passion of our fans in that part of the world and this deal makes it a lot easier for us to keep in touch with them,"" said United manager Alex Ferguson.","Manchester United's turnover increases by almost $73 million to $536 million .

"(CNN) -- The Egyptian cabinet is scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss an agreement between political groups and the ruling military council on election policies, the status of the country's unpopular emergency law and other issues. Some activists said the agreement doesn't go far enough to meet the demands of the popular uprising that led to the end of country's longstanding regime, while other political groups said the agreement represented progress. The agreement, reached Saturday, includes promises to open more Egyptian parliament seats to political parties and consider canceling the country's emergency law. The agreement also includes a promise to consider abolishing military tribunals and to consider adopting a 1952 law that opposition groups hope would prevent former President Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party from having a role in national politics for up to 10 years. Also included are plans to draft a document to guide the creation of a new constitution and a call for presidential elections following a national referendum on adopting the new ruling document. The coalition of parties had also sought an agreement to hold presidential elections immediately after parliamentary voting scheduled for November, as well as a promise to hand control to a civilian government next year. The deal failed to go far enough, said Mona Seif, a founding member of the No to Military Tribunals movement, who called the decision by a majority of party representatives little more than ""treachery."" ""These parties were fooled if they think they accomplished something,"" said Seif, who called for renewed protests against the military council. The agreement comes amid rising dissatisfaction with the council, which took control in February after widespread popular demonstrations forced Mubarak to step aside. Following an attack on the Israeli embassy in Giza this month, the council reinstated the widely unpopular emergency law that many in the opposition felt was used by Mubarak to suppress dissent. Despite the concerns, the agreement is a ""positive step toward true democracy,"" said Esam El Erian, the spokesman for the Freedom and Justice Party and a leading figure in the Muslim Brotherhood. ""Yes, abolishing the emergency law was a main demand of the January 25th revolution and the council promised to abolish it, but the reality on the ground is that there are many forces debating including former members of the regime that come in different faces."" El Erian said. Military leaders plan more meetings with political parties to iron out more differences, said Major Alaa Iraqi, a spokesman for the Supreme Council. ""Pleasing everyone is impossible,"" Iraqi said.","An agreement between military council and parties doesn't go far enough, one critic says .

"(CNN) -- Outsider Danedream won Europe's most prestigious horse race the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Sunday in a record time. Danedream gave Germany only their second win in the race to lead an unusual one-two-three for fillies for the first time since 1983. The 27-1 shot came home five lengths clear of Shareta, whose stablemate and favorite Sarafina never threatened, with Epsom and Irish Oaks winner Snow Fairy in third. Danedream's time of two minutes 24.49 seconds for the 2,400m underlined the fast ground at the course in Paris, breaking a record held by Peintre Celebre since 1997.

"(CNN) -- Basketball superstar Kobe Bryant is in talks with Virtus Bologna over a move to the Italian team as the NBA lockout continues. Los Angeles Lakers' shooting guard Bryant, a five-time NBA champion, would be a massive draw if he opted to play for Bologna, who issued a joint statement Monday to confirm the negotiations. ""Virtus Bologna and the management of Mr. Bryant are working very intensely to try and create this important deal,"" read the statement on the website of the 15-time Italian champions. ""Reaching such a complex deal requires both sides' maximum attention for every little detail. ""Everyone wants a positive outcome to the deal, the goal of which is Kobe Bryant's presence in Italy, economic interests for the 17 clubs in Serie A and more attention for all of Italian basketball."" Bryant, named the NBA's most valuable player in 2008, spent seven years in Italy as a child, when his father Joe Bryant played in the country's Lega Basket Serie A between 1984 and 1991. The NBA has been in a state of lockout since July, as a dispute between the players association and the teams over the league's collective bargaining agreement rumbles on. The collective bargaining agreement is a contract between players and franchises which outlines how NBA stars should be paid. The current dispute is over the average salary which should be earned by players over the term of their contracts. Talks were held over the weekend in an attempt to resolve the ongoing disagreement, but after little progress was made discussions were extended into Monday. NBA training camps were also due to begin Monday, but they have been canceled as talks over a new labor agreement continue.","Kobe Bryant in talks over a move to Italian team Virtus Bologna .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkish companies are reeling from a recent Syrian government decision to ban the import of products that have a customs tax of more than 5%. Meanwhile, the Turkish government is considering whether or not to slap punitive policies, such as possible economic sanctions, against its eastern neighbor and former close political ally. The Syrian government announced on September 22 that it would suspend imports of high-tariff goods. Last week, Syria's minister of economy and trade described the partial import ban as ""temporary and precautionary."" According to the Syrian state news agency SANA, Mohammad Nidal al-Shaar said the ban was aimed at preserving dwindling foreign currency reserves. According to a list published by the Turkish Ministry of Economy, the products Syria has banned include mobile phones, contact lens fluid, and vehicles ranging from passenger buses and vans to ambulances and trucks used for construction. Turkish businessmen fear the move could dramatically affect trade between the two neighbors. According to Turkish government statistics, bilateral trade between Turkey and Syria more than tripled between 2006 and 2010, as Damascus and Ankara signed a free trade agreement and removed visa requirements for each others' citizens. ""There is fear,"" said Ibrahim Eminoglu, an official involved in foreign trade at the Chamber of Commerce in Antakya, a Turkish province bordering Syria. ""Companies are calling us and asking about it. ... For example, we have a client who was going to sell car batteries [in Syria]; now he is not sure if he should go ahead and make the deal."" ""There will be some impact on cosmetics, construction, packing sectors and refined petroleum products,"" said Murat Akyuz, chairman of the Mining and Metals Exporters' Association in Istanbul. ""We will try to compensate [the loss] with other markets."" The anti-government uprising that erupted in Syria last March, and the subsequent brutal government crackdown that has resulted in the deaths of more than 2,700 people, severely damaged close political ties between the Syrian and Turkish governments. Turkish government officials have repeatedly criticized bloody Syrian military operations against opposition protesters. In recent months, Turkey has hosted meetings for political groups opposed to the Syrian government. The Turks have also been feeding more than 10,000 Syrian refugees, who have been housed in tent cities after they fled across the border to escape Syrian security forces. On Sunday, a Turkish government official told CNN that Ankara was weighing possible further steps against the Damascus regime. ""We are considering taking some steps, but we're not there yet,"" the Turkish official said, on condition of anonymity. For days, the Turkish media has been writing about the possible imposition of punitive economic sanctions against Syria, including the freezing of government assets. So far, no sanctions have been adopted. Some Turkish industrial leaders fear further deterioration of political relations could hamper Turkey's access to lucrative Middle Eastern markets. ""Syria is the only door in land transportation to the rest of the Middle East for transit trade to other countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Dubai,"" said Eminoglu, of the Antakya Chamber of Commerce. ""We have been looking into alternative routes in case there is a need for it, such as sending containers by ship."" Meanwhile, there are signs the import ban is unpopular within the Syrian business community, which experts say has largely avoided picking sides throughout the six-month-long uprising. In an article published in Gulf News last week, Syrian journalist Sami Moubayed warned the import ban would ""drive a permanent wedge between the Syrian government and the business community."" Moubayed wrote that many Syrian companies are already struggling because of U.S. and European sanctions that curtail trade and banking transactions. ""The present legislation will drive many heavyweights out of business who made fortunes lately through importing foreign consumer products,"" Moubayed wrote. ""Now they feel that the regime is no longer on their side.""","Turkish government considering economic sanctions against neighbor Syria .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Police stepped up security in northern Israel Monday after a fire at a mosque overnight in an apparent revenge attack. Suspects set the mosque in the village of Tuba-Zangariyye on fire and left graffiti on its walls, police said. The smell of smoke filled the area in the morning hours, said Sheik Fuad Shehade, the mosque's imam. He arrived to find the building burned, with charred copies of the Koran inside. After the overnight attack, around 200 residents from the village gathered on the outskirts and started marching towards the neighboring Israeli town of Rosh Pina, an Israeli police spokesman said. Residents blocked the road, hurled rocks at police and burned tires, police said. The police responded by firing tear gas. Words written on the mosque's walls said ""price tag,"" ""revenge"" and ""Palmer."" Asher Palmer and his year-old son were killed 10 days ago when rocks thrown at their car near the city of Hebron caused it to turn over and crash, authorities said. ""Price tag"" attack is a term frequently used by radical Israeli settlers to denote reprisal attacks against Palestinians in response to moves by the Israeli government to evacuate illegal West Bank outposts. Lately ""price tag"" attacks have also targeted Israeli military forces and police stationed in the West Bank. It is rare for them to carry out attacks inside Israel. Kamal Khatib of the Islamic Movement in northern Israel said the mosque attack showed the extremist atmosphere in the country. The burning of the mosque and the graffiti indicate that ""Jewish hands"" were behind the attack, he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office condemned the attack. ""The prime minister was furious when he saw the pictures and said that the attack contradicts the values of the state of Israel. Freedom of religion and freedom of worship are supreme values,"" said a statement released by the office. Netanyahu said ""the pictures are shocking and have no place in Israel,"" according to the statement. Israeli parliamentarian Ahmed Tibi urged both sides not to get drawn into violence, which is what extremists want. ""The answer at the moment is to rebuild the mosque,"" he said. Israeli police have set up an investigation team and collected evidence in the area, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.","The mosque's imam says he arrived to find the building burned .

"(CNN) -- The Orange County, Florida, Sheriff's Office spent $293,123.77 on detective work in the disappearance of 2-year-old Caylee Anthony in 2008, according to authorities, and it wants to be reimbursed. The sheriff's office is among three law agencies asking a county judge in Orlando to order the girl's mother, Casey, to pay their investigative costs. A court hearing on that request was set to take place Thursday, but it was rescheduled to September 2, court spokeswoman Karen Levey said Wednesday. Anthony has been in seclusion since her July acquittal on murder charges in the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter and her subsequent release from jail. But in the same case, a Florida jury convicted her on four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to law enforcement officers. Prosecutors cite those misdemeanor convictions as the legal basis for their request that Anthony pay for the police costs involved in her daughter's disappearance. Caylee Anthony's skeletonized remains were found in December 2008 in woods less than a mile from her grandparents' Florida home. Lt. Paul Zambouros of the Orange County Sheriff's Office said the investigative costs of $293,123.77 are based largely on the criminal investigation division's work between July 15, 2008, and December 11, 2008. If other deputies' work were included, ""the reimbursement for cost of investigation would certainly be larger,"" Zambouros said in an internal July 28 memo. Prosecutors are also seeking reimbursement for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's investigative expenses of $71,939.56 and the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation's expenses of $10,645.38, according to court records. Anthony's attorney didn't return calls for a comment.","NEW: A court hearing on whether to bill Casey Anthony is rescheduled to September 2 .

"(Financial Times) -- The global manufacturing sector is in the worst shape since the summer of 2009 as slowing economic growth and the deepening eurozone crisis take their toll on the world's factories. Purchasing managers' index surveys released on Monday indicated global manufacturing activity weakened slightly last month to the lowest level since June 2009, when the world economy was emerging from recession. However, the fortunes of manufacturers diverged depending on their location: conditions deteriorated in Asia and the eurozone but picked up slightly in the US and UK. The JP Morgan PMI of global manufacturing fell slightly from 50.2 in August to 49.9 in September. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles the PMI surveys, said: ""Generally, the conditions in global manufacturing are getting worse, with the eurozone seeing the steepest deterioration [and] increasing signs of weakness in Asia"". The surveys come as politicians and central bankers race to resolve the eurozone sovereign debt crisis amid fears that uncertainty about the region's fate is hampering the global economic recovery. Manufacturing activity in the US rose slightly faster than economists expected, according to the Institute for Supply Management survey, lifting hopes that the world's biggest economy can avoid slipping back into recession. Carmakers in the US reported strong sales for September, as consumers replaced old vehicles, credit conditions eased and the supply of Japanese vehicles recovered. Activity also rose slightly in the UK, confounding economists' expectations that the sector would shrink. In both the US and the UK, rising production coincided with a drop in backlogs of work, which economists said suggested the pace of expansion might not be sustainable. In the eurozone, the manufacturing sector shrank for the second month in a row, with new orders falling at their fastest pace since June 2009. Economists at Barclays Capital said this was ""consistent with a deepening industrial recession"". German manufacturers were the strongest in the region while those in Greece, Spain and Ireland suffered most. PMI surveys in Asia showed a fourth successive monthly fall in activity in Taiwan, while manufacturing in India slowed to its weakest level for two and a half years. Conditions also worsened in Japan. Official PMI figures for China, published at the weekend by the National Bureau of Statistics, showed a slight improvement in activity. Manufacturers continued to hire more people in the US, Germany, Japan and several other countries, while there were job losses in China, the UK and India, among others. © The Financial Times Limited 2011 .","The global manufacturing sector is in the worst shape since summer 2009 .

"Between Bani Walid And Misrata, Libya (CNN) -- Ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has been surrounded and has no way of leaving the area, Anees al-Sharif, a spokesman for the Tripoli Military Council, told CNN on Wednesday. He said that he could not comment on where Gadhafi is, but that rebel fighters were closing in. The Tripoli council is part of the rebel coalition known as the National Transitional Council. Abdallah Kenshil, chief negotiator for the NTC, said he could confirm that two of Gadhafi's sons, Saif al-Islam and Mutassim, had been seen in Bani Walid. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Tuesday that officials believe Gadhafi is on the run. ""I don't have any information as to exactly where he's located,"" he said. Pro-Gadhafi and Syria-based al-Rai TV aired a message purportedly from Gadhafi. ""NATO will be defeated by force because its financial ability is not enough to proceed with the shelling,"" said the speaker, insisting he is in Libya and will not leave. ""They claimed I left to Niger so they can weaken you and destroy your morale,"" the man said, adding such reports were ""lies."" Two Libyan convoys passed through Niger this week, officials in that country said. The U.S. State Department said it viewed the two sets of vehicles as parts of a single convoy -- and that Gadhafi is not believed to be on it. Kenshil told CNN on Wednesday that the rebel fighters had started advancing on Bani Walid, one of the last Gadhafi loyalist strongholds, Wednesday night but did not give further information. Earlier Wednesday, trucks armed with anti-aircraft guns and rocket launchers pulled into a forward operating base 30 kilometers (18½ miles) southwest of the Libyan coastal city of Misrata. The fighting force known as the Victory Unit was back from its patrol of the desert landscape separating the Gadhafi stronghold of Bani Walid and rebel city of Misrata. The 70-kilometer (43½-mile) buffer zone has been quiet for the past two weeks as a cease-fire was declared while tribal leaders from Bani Walid and representatives from the National Transitional Council negotiate the city's surrender. ""We don't want more bloodshed,"" said Antar Al Birra, the commander of the Victory Unit. ""Too many people have died, so we hope the negotiations will be successful."" Al Birra's forces are battle-hardened from months of heavy fighting, and with Gadhafi's forces against the ropes, he says the battle to take the city will be short. ""If we are ordered to take the city, it won't take us long, maybe two or three hours,"" Al Birra said. Many soldiers on the front hope for a peaceful solution. But as Saturday's deadline looms, many are anxious as hope begins to fade that one will be reached. ""Negotiations have completely failed,"" said Shamsaddin Ben Ali, a spokesman for the NTC. ""We won't agree to their demands."" These demands include rebel forces entering the city unarmed, rebels refraining from searching houses and, the most contentious, a full pardon for the people of Bani Walid. ""We won't grant amnesty because there are people with blood on their hands, and we want them to face a trial,"" Ben Ali said. ""I predict fighting to resume on Saturday."" If rebel forces are given the green light to attack, the assault from the east will be led by Cmdr. Khalil Al Shibly. Al Shibly waits for the order from the NTC to attack Bani Walid but, like his soldiers, he hopes for a negotiated settlement. He says three other towns between Misrata and Sirte have laid down their weapons through negotiations and welcomed revolutionary forces. He believes Bani Walid will eventually do the same but says those who agree to a settlement in the city face retaliation by hard-core Gadhafi loyalists. One such town -- Waddan, 400 kilometers (249 miles) south of Misrata, which also controls Sirte's last link to the outside world -- also tried to join the revolution but is now facing resistance. ""Waddan is currently being shelled by Gadhafi's forces,"" Al Shibly said. ""The town rose up and joined the revolution but is now under attack from the nearby city of Hun."" CNN can't independently verify these claims. Al Shibly has another concern for when Bani Walid is taken, either peacefully or by force. He is afraid that some Gadhafi loyalists will stage a resistance, and if those fighters are killed in an ensuing battle, their tribes will try to seek revenge, leading to a tribal war. To avoid a potential tribal war, Al Shibly says the negotiators from the NTC have tribal links to the cities they are dealing with, but adds they still must proceed with caution. ""It is really important that we find a peaceful solution to the remaining towns,"" Al Shibly said. ""If they don't, I'm afraid the country could see some form of tribal war.""

"(CNN) -- The defense is expected to lay out its case Wednesday in the trial of Joshua Komisarjevsky, who is accused in the July 2007 home invasion, sexual assault and murders of three members of a Connecticut family. If convicted, Komisarjevsky, 31, could face the death penalty. Prosecutors say Komisarjevsky is one of two men who broke into the home of Dr. William Petit and raped and killed Petit's wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her two daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, before setting fire to the home. Komisarjevsky, faces 17 charges in connection with the brutal home invasion. The first defendant to stand trial in the case, Steven Hayes, was sentenced to death in December 2010 after being convicted on 16 of the 17 charges filed against him. Earlier in the Komisarjevsky trial, Dr. Petit, the lone survivor of the attack, testified that he was awakened after being hit by a baseball bat. He said his hands and feet were tied, and a cloth was thrown over his head. He was then tied to a pole in the family's basement, but could hear ""loud thuds"" and ""moaning,"" likely from his wife. Shortly before hearing his wife, Petit was told by one of the intruders, ""Don't worry. It'll all be over in a few minutes."" Petit said that's when he knew ""I had to get out."" Petit managed to escape but could not summon help in time to save his family. The two daughters, who were both tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation. Hawke-Petit died of strangulation. In his opening statement defense attorney Walter Bansley told jurors that his client never intended to kill anyone and that his sole purpose in breaking into the Petit home was to steal. Bansley said Komisarjevsky did not have a weapon. He told jurors that in order to convict his client of capital murder, they must determine he intended to kill someone. It was Hayes, Bansley said, who raped and strangled Hawke-Petit, poured gasoline in the house and lit a match. Komisarjevsky was a willing participant in the break-in and theft but not the murders, according to Bansley. Hayes thought that the Petits needed to be killed, Bansley claimed, but Komisarjevsky refused to kill anyone. In Session's Sunny Hostin and CNN's Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report.","The defense for Joshua Komisarjevsky is set to begin its case .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan needs to do more to implement safeguards that would control a fertilizer that is being used in explosive devices in Afghanistan, according to an American lawmaker who recently visited the country. ""Basically what we're waiting for is for the Pakistani government to implement the strategy that they've said they're going to implement when we were in Pakistan in August, meeting with all the highest-level officials,"" said Sen. Robert Casey, D-Pennsylvania. ""Unfortunately we're into October now, and I haven't seen any action in the month of September."" He said the strategy should include restricting who has access to the fertilizer; tracking it, perhaps with the use of dye; and interdicting it at the border with Afghanistan. According to the U.S. military's Joint IED Defeat Organization, 84% of improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan are made from fertilizer produced in Pakistan, and IEDs are the No.1 killer of American forces in Afghanistan, responsible for more than 400 deaths in the past two years. But a Pakistani official disputed Casey's criticism, saying authorities are moving as fast as they can on the problem, and that it has to be a joint effort on both sides of the border. The official, who declined to be identified, also said that out of the tons of the fertilizer produced, it is difficult to track down the small amounts placed into IEDs. The fertilizer, calcium ammonium nitrate, is processed into small off-white pellets and is shipped in huge sacks. The same ingredient was used by Timothy McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. While it has been banned in Afghanistan since 2009, it is legally produced in Pakistan and is widely used there for farming. Calcium ammonium nitrate is ""suitable for all crops, all seasons, soils and locations,"" according to manufacturer PakArab, whose website says they are the only firm in Pakistan that produces it. A year ago, Afghan Border Police said they stopped a convoy in which three of the trucks were smuggling 50 tons of the fertilizer -- enough to make more than 2,100 IEDs, they said. ""It's an extremely porous border,"" said Seth Jones at the RAND Corp., who was in Afghanistan last month. ""There's not enough time in a day, with a long line of vehicles, to stop every single vehicle and check it."" Jones said militants in Afghanistan are managing to smuggle IED ingredients up the Helmand River Valley to make roadside bombs targeting U.S. Marines operating in southern Afghanistan, as well as through areas like the Khyber Pass to target U.S. Army forces in the east. The American pressure on Pakistan to act comes at a time when cooperation between the two countries is already under heavy strain -- most recently, after the outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, said the militant Haqqani network ""acts as a veritable arm of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency."" Pakistani officials have vigorously denied the accusation. But Casey said that he would not be put off, as long as American soldiers are being injured and killed. ""Go to Walter Reed, and see those 19-year-old kids with half of their leg blown off -- or in many instances, having died this way,"" he said. ""That's just inexcusable, when we have the resources, the technology, and the know-how, to slow this down or to stop it in some way.""","Pakistan needs to put safeguards in place, says U.S. Sen. Robert Casey .

"(CNN) -- During the recent Republican presidential debate, the issue of vaccinating girls against human papillomavirus, or HPV, came up several times, and some statements have been made that may concern parents of children scheduled to receive the vaccine. The statements questioned the safety of HPV vaccines and the rationale for the recommendations for their use from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians. HPV vaccines have the promise of improving the lives of both women and men. The recommendations for use of the vaccine are based on scientific data, including safety studies, which indicate that the benefits of HPV vaccines far outweigh any of the known risks. The safety record of these vaccines is excellent. After five years and more than 35 million doses of HPV vaccines given, all of the available scientific evidence shows that HPV vaccines are safe and effective, and that the current recommendations will result in the best opportunity to prevent HPV infection and its consequences. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection. Studies show that 50% to 70% of women will develop an HPV infection during their sexually active lives and that infection occurs soon after they become sexually active. Although most infections resolve over six to 24 months, some persist and can lead to cancer. Certain types of HPV are responsible for almost all cases of cervical cancer, other cancers of the anal and genital areas and a significant percentage of oropharyngeal cancers in men and women. Other HPV types cause genital warts. In the United States, each year about 12,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed, and nearly 4,000 women die of complications of cervical cancer. HPV vaccines are an important scientific breakthrough. They prevent infection with the HPV types most commonly associated with the development of cancer and therefore are expected to reduce significantly the number of cases of HPV-related cancer in women and men. Two HPV vaccines are available in the United States. The first, Gardasil, was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration in 2006 for girls 9 through 26 years of age to prevent cervical cancer and genital warts. In 2009, the license was extended to include boys 9 through 26. More recent data show Gardasil also prevents other genital cancers in women and anal cancer in both women and men. The second HPV vaccine, Cervarix, licensed in 2009 for women 10 through 25 years of age, targets the prevention of cervical and related genital cancers. Both vaccines were studied extensively before the FDA licensed them. The rationale for the recommendation to immunize at 11 through 12 is that the vaccine will be most effective if given before a person becomes sexually active. Protection is expected to last for many years. ""Catch-up"" vaccinations to age 26 are also important. Even though some persons in this age group already will have been infected with one or more of the HPV types in the vaccine, the vaccine will protect them against the HPV types in the vaccine to which they remain susceptible. By the time the FDA licenses a vaccine, common side effects are known; evaluation for adverse health effects is an important requirement of the clinical trials that lead to licensure. No serious safety concerns were detected during the clinical trials of either of the two HPV vaccines. After a vaccine is licensed, a number of systems are in place in the United States to monitor vaccine safety. These include the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a passive reporting system that can detect early-warning signals about possible new vaccine adverse effects, and the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink project, which provides a database for planned immunization safety studies of possible adverse effects arising from review of those reporting system reports and medical literature. But investigation of reports to VAERS since both HPV vaccines were licensed has suggested that rare serious allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) and fainting spells, which can occur after any immunization, can also occur after HPV vaccine. Vaccine providers, particularly when vaccinating adolescents, should consider observing patients (with patients seated or lying down) for 15 minutes after vaccination to decrease the risk for injury should they faint. A recent study was conducted in CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink among females 9-26 years of age who received HPV vaccine (Gardasil). The study found no statistically significant increased risk for any of outcomes studied after vaccination. Studies on HPV vaccine safety will continue and reports of any rare event occurring after receipt of HPV vaccine will be reviewed.) And the Institute of Medicine, part of the United States National Academy of Sciences, recently reviewed reported vaccine-related, adverse events and did not find that data supported a causal relationship of HPV vaccine to any neurologic condition. Parents have a great opportunity today to reduce the risk of HPV-related cancers in their children. Parents who have concerns about HPV vaccine and some of the statements made about safety should ask their children's doctors for information. The CDC has a website that provides accurate, up-to-date information about the safety and effectiveness of HPV vaccines. Parents would do well to use trusted and reliable resources when making the important decision to protect their children from HPV infection and HPV-related cancers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joseph Bocchini.","Joseph Bocchini notes issue of HPV vaccine safety coming up in recent GOP debates .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A stay of execution for a man scheduled to die by lethal injection Wednesday evening in Georgia has been upheld by the state's Supreme Court. On Tuesday, a lower court delayed the execution of Marcus Ray Johnson, 46, after new evidence in the case surfaced. Johnson's lawyers had filed an emergency motion requesting a new trial and time to conduct DNA testing after evidence was recently produced by police in Albany, Georgia. Dougherty County Superior Court Judge Willie Lockette granted the stay, and set a hearing scheduled for February 1, 2012, on Johnson's motion for additional testing. The Georgia Supreme Court agreed with the lower court in an unanimous ruling. Johnson was convicted and sentenced to death for the March 1994 rape and murder of Angela Sizemore in Albany, Georgia. Human rights group Amnesty International praised the stay, based on doubt raised about Johnson's guilt and the emergence of evidence that had not yet been analyzed. ""Amnesty International hopes that this is a sign that there is greater concern in Georgia about the fallibility of the death penalty, especially on the heels of the outrageous and unnecessary execution of Troy Davis."" Georgia inmate Troy Davis died by lethal injection two weeks ago in a contentious case that traveled up to the U.S. Supreme Court. Davis' supporters argued that his conviction for the 1989 murder of Mark MacPhail, an off-duty Savannah police officer, was based on the testimony of numerous witnesses who had recanted, including a jailhouse informer who claimed Davis had confessed. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","Marcus Ray Johnson had been scheduled for execution in Georgia Wednesday evening .

"(CNN) -- Prince Harry -- Capt. Harry Wales, to his mates -- is coming to the U.S. Southwest this week to begin a two-month series of training exercises for British attack helicopter pilots. The Apache crews will train at Naval Air Facility El Centro in California, about 90 miles east of San Diego, officials said. The prince, 27, also will be training at the Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field in southern Arizona. It's part of a two-month series of maneuvers dubbed Exercise Crimson Eagle, in which British fliers will practice with the Apaches in terrain similar to southern Afghanistan, where some British troops are currently based. Officials stress that Harry is coming as a serviceman, not as a potential heir to the throne. ""We are treating him like any other O3 (junior grade officer),"" said Kristopher Haugh, deputy public affairs officer at the El Centro facility. Still, it's possible that the prince, like others who train in the area, may frequent area clubs, restaurants, theaters or bowling alleys. The El Centro Chamber of Commerce has asked businesses and restaurants to treat Harry with respect and safeguard his privacy. The prince may also be drawn to outdoor diversions. According to Cathy Kennerson, chief executive officer of the Chamber, the area is known for off-roading, hiking, birdwatching and the Salton Sea, also in the agriculture-rich Imperial Valley. Residents of the city of 42,000 will take the visit in stride, Kennerson said. ""They just want to put their best foot forward."" Harry is the younger son of Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, and the late Princess Diana. He served on the front line in Afghanistan as a forward air controller and saw combat, but was withdrawn in February 2008 after news of his deployment broke. Harry's brother, Prince William, is also an army officer. But as second in line for the throne, he is specifically barred from combat. According to the Telegraph in London, Harry intends to return to Afghanistan next year after he completes his training. He has been told by flying instructors he has a ""natural flair"" for flying, the newspaper reported this summer.","Prince Harry joins British military exercises in California and Arizona .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge determined Monday that the man accused of killing six in an Arizona shooting rampage is ""getting better,"" further ruling that the suspect should continue to take anti-psychotic medications as his appeal works its way through the courts. U.S. District Court Judge Larry Burns said in a motion issued Monday that there was a ""substantial probability"" that Jared Lee Loughner will be restored to competency and be able to stand trial for his role in a mass shooting in January outside a Tucson supermarket. He refused to alter Loughner's current mental health treatment plan, pointing to his observations that the suspect has improved in recent months. ""There is overwhelming evidence that the defendant is getting better, not the least of which is the noticeable improvement in his appearance, demeanor and behavior since he was last in court,"" the judge said in his six-page order. Burns is based in Southern California, but is overseeing the case in part because one of the shooter's victims was Arizona-based federal Judge John Roll. Loughner, 23, may face the death penalty if convicted in a shooting that also left 13 wounded, among them his purported target, U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. She has been undergoing intensive rehabilitation in Arizona and Texas since being shot in the head. The suspect has been diagnosed as schizophrenic and has spent time on suicide watch while in custody and undergoing treatment at a federal hospital in Springfield, Missouri. In May, a federal appeals court cleared the way for him to be forcibly medicated, over the objections of Loughner and his attorney. A hearing five days ago addressed those objections. During it, both the judge and mental health experts noted that Loughner was able to sit calmly during the hours-long proceeding, court sources said. He had been removed from a courtroom in May after an outburst, reported CNN affiliate KGUN. Prosecutors have written in court documents that Loughner has expressed ""regret for the circumstances that led to his arrest."" When he was asked whether he thought about harming himself, he said, ""I want to die. Give me the injection. Kill me now,"" the documents said. The defense team argues the state has failed to prove Loughner's condition will improve enough for him to stand trial. Several mental health experts testified at last Wednesday's hearing, including Loughner's ""daily, treating psychologist"" Dr. Christina Pietz and an outside expert psychiatrist, Dr. James Ballenger. Based in large part on their assessment of the suspect's improvement under his current medical regimen -- including the prescribed medications -- Burns decided it was best not to change Loughner's treatment. ""The testimony of (Pietz and Ballenger) established the likelihood and substantial probability that the defendant will continue to get better and can be restored to competency to stand trial in four months time,"" the judge wrote.","Federal Judge Larry Burns says Jared Lee Loughner is ""getting better""

"Washington (CNN) -- The man named one month ago to head the troubled Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives announced Wednesday he is dramatically shaking up the agency, which he readily acknowledged has been damaged by a controversial gun-trafficking operation. Acting Director Todd Jones said after 30 days of studying ATF issues and staff he is instigating a major shuffle of ATF personnel but is not yet firing anyone. Jones vowed a thorough internal review of ""all investigative processes."" Jones announced 11 high-level changes, including naming as his deputy Thomas Brandon who has overseen the Phoenix office for the past six months following bitter internal controversy over a gun operation there. ""These have been difficult times for everyone in ATF because of a case in a division,"" Jones told reporters. He then quickly confirmed he was talking about the controversial ""Operation Fast and Furious"" in ATF's Phoenix Division, which featured ATF agents allowing illegally purchased firearms to ""walk"" from Arizona gun stores across the Mexican border and into the hands of drug cartels. The plan was to trail the weapons to the cartels, but thousands of firearms were lost in the process. Jones also said he understood trust has been damaged within ATF and said it would take time to heal. ""We're going to have to rebuild trust,"" he said, referring to the reputation of ATF from its own agents and from other law enforcement agencies. The issue blew up in December 2010, when Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was murdered, and two guns at the crime scene were part of the ""Fast and Furious"" operation."" The continuing debate over who approved the operation and how soon top Justice Department officials knew of it is fueled in part by partisan politics. Some Republicans are clamoring for a special counsel to investigate whether Attorney General Eric Holder or any of his top political aides knew of the operation early on, and could have stopped it. Read up on Holder's alleged role in the operation . Some Democrats, meanwhile, point to a similar ""gun-walking"" operation run out of the Phoenix Division's sub-office in Tucson that began in 2006 under the Bush administration called Operation Wide Receiver. Some of the defendants in that case are still being prosecuted. Jones said he was confident there were no other operations which involved cases of ""guns walking."" Jones sought to stay above the political fray. ""I'm a political appointee, but I'm not a politician,"" Jones told a dozen reporters at ATF headquarters in Washington. Jones insisted he had no view on the Republican-led congressional investigation. He lumped the two Arizona cases together and said the ATF now has a ""heightened awareness of the tactic allowing gun-walking."" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa and the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a statement after Jones' announcement saying, ""The reassignments are positive, especially in the case of Tom Brandon who I hope can help lead this agency out of its troubles. ""But, I caution that rearranging the chairs on the deck, won't make Fast and Furious go away."" Grassley said he also questioned the timing of the announcement. ""There is a lot of effort at the Justice Department to spin the fact that the Attorney General was less than candid before the House Judiciary Committee, and what better way to make that go away than a bureaucratic shuffle,"" Grassley said in the statement . Jones was named to the position by Holder 30 days ago, when former Acting Director Ken Melson, under fire, was ousted and given a job as an adviser at the Justice Department. Jones said he plans to continue to wear two hats. He heads the ATF while also serving as U.S. attorney for Minnesota. He expressed confidence he can manage his time to serve in both capacities. The acting director sidestepped political issues but was clear in his caution to Congress not to slash the ATF budget because of the current controversy. ""I hope that does not happen. We'll be smart about what we ask for,"" he said. Jones said he intended to refocus the ATF on its core mission of fighting violent crime and protecting the American public. He repeatedly said he would await the outcome of the ongoing congressional investigation of ""Fast and Furious,"" as well as the inspector general's investigation before deciding whom to hold accountable. ""What went wrong? I don't know what went wrong,"" Jones said. ""We'll have to wait for those reports.""","ATF is laboring under the cloud of ""Operation Fast and Furious""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Coroner's investigator Elissa Fleak returned to the stand in the eighth day of the trial of Michael Jackson's doctor Thursday morning to continue her testimony about what she found in searches of the pop icon's bedroom. The pathologist who conducted the autopsy on Michael Jackson and ruled his death a homicide could testify later Thursday or Friday in the involuntary manslaughter trial of Dr. Conrad Murray. Jurors should also soon hear the two-hour interview Murray gave to police two days after Jackson's June 25, 2009, death of what the coroner concluded was the result of ""acute propofol intoxication"" in combination with sedatives. Los Angeles Police Det. Orlando Martinez, who questioned Murray, is expected to testify Thursday or Friday that Murray told him he had been administering propofol to Jackson regularly for two months to help him sleep. Deputy District Attorney David Walgren covered a table with drug vials and medical paraphernalia taken in Fleak's searches, a visual display of Murray's in-home treatment of Jackson. Fleak identified a saline bag that was cut open and an empty 100 milliliter propofol bottle inside. The prosecution alleges Murray used it as a makeshift IV drip to administer propofol to Jackson. The defense contends Murray gave Jackson just 25 milliliters of the surgical anesthetic and used a syringe to push it in. Twelve bottles of propofol were found in the bedroom during her first search the day Jackson died, including an empty vial found on the floor next to the bed, Fleak said. Seven bottles of medications were on a nightstand next to the bed, including one with lorazepam pills prescribed by Murray to Jackson. Murray's defense lawyers say Jackson caused his own death by swallowing eight lorazepam pills and orally ingesting propofol while Murray was out of the room. Although crucial to prove that Murray is criminally responsible for the pop icon's death, Thursday's forensic testimony is not likely to match Wednesday's emotional drama when jurors heard Jackson's slurred voice telling his doctor ""I hurt, you know, I hurt."" A photograph of Jackson lying dead on a hospital gurney was later projected onto a large screen in the courtroom, a vivid reminder to jurors of why they will listen to a least a month of testimony. While the court camera feed focused on the disturbing image for just five seconds -- the result of an earlier decision to minimize public exposure to such shocking images -- it was displayed on a large screen in front of the jury for about two minutes. Forensic computer expert Stephen Marx, who found the Jackson audio file on Murray's iPhone, said it was recorded on May 10, 2009, when Jackson was preparing for his ""This Is It"" concerts set for London two months later. Prosecutors, who played a clip of the stunning audio in their opening statement last week, let the jury hear the entire recording in Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial Wednesday. ""Elvis didn't do it. Beatles didn't do it. We have to be phenomenal,"" Jackson said. ""When people leave this show, when people leave my show, I want them to say, 'I've never seen nothing like this in my life. Go. Go. I've never seen nothing like this. Go. It's amazing. He's the greatest entertainer in the world.' I'm taking that money, a million children, children's hospital, the biggest in the world, Michael Jackson Children's Hospital. Going to have a movie theater, game room."" In the portion never before heard in court, Jackson talked about his life and concern for children: . ""Children are depressed. The -- in those hospitals, no game room, no movie theater. They're sick because they're depressed. Their mind is depressing them. I want to give them that. I care about them, them angels. God wants me to do it. God wants me to do it. I'm going to do it, Conrad."" Another voice, which the prosecutor said was Murray's, is heard saying, ""I know you would."" ""Don't have enough hope, no more hope,"" Jackson said. ""That's the next generation that's going to save our planet, starting with -- we'll talk about it. United States, Europe, Prague, my babies. They walk around with no mother. They drop them off, they leave -- a psychological degradation of that. They reach out to me: 'Please take me with you.'"" At the end, Jackson said he was ""going to do that for them."" ""That will be remembered more than my performances. My performances will be up there helping my children and always be my dream. I love them. I love them because I didn't have a childhood. I had no childhood. I feel their pain. I feel their hurt. I can deal with it. 'Heal the World,' 'We Are the World,' 'Will You Be There,' 'The Lost Children.' These are the songs I've written because I hurt, you know, I hurt."" At the end, Jackson told the doctor, ""I am asleep."" His brother Jermaine Jackson wiped tears from his eyes as he listened in court. Prosecutor Walgren said in his opening statement that Jackson was ""highly under the influences of unknown agents"" when Murray recorded Jackson. Another recording found on Murray's phone and played in court Wednesday was a voice mail from Frank Dileo, who was Jackson's last manager. Dileo's message to Murray, left five days before Jackson's death, suggested that he ""get a blood test"" from Jackson because ""we've got to see what he's doing."" He referred to ""an episode"" Jackson had at a rehearsal the night before. ""He's sick,"" Dileo said. Concert producer Kenny Ortega testified about Jackson's illness in the first day of the trial, which he wrote about in an e-mail sent about the same time Dileo was leaving his phone message. ""He appeared quite week (sic) and fatigued this evening,"" Ortega wrote. ""He had a terrible case of the chills, was trembling, rambling and obsessing. Everything in me says he should be psychologically evaluated."" Murray's iPhone also contained e-mail attachments that appeared to be Jackson's medical records sent by Murray's office assistant to the doctor, who was gathering them for a British insurance agent who was arranging cancellation insurance for Jackson's London concerts. The insurers were concerned about news reports that Jackson was seen ""at various times using a wheelchair"" and that he suffered a back injury, lupus, emphysema and cancer, according to an e-mail from the agent to the doctor. Jackson refused to authorize the release of his medical records to the insurance company, Murray wrote back, but he added concerning the news reports of illnesses, ""let me say they're all fallicious (sic) to the best of my knowledge."" One record shown in court, kept under the alias ""Omar Arnold,"" indicated that in September 2008, Murray diagnosed Jackson with insomnia and anxiety. It showed he treated him with valium and Xanax. Files from the phone suggest Murray was dealing with the insurance agent's request around the same time he said he was struggling to help Jackson go to sleep with sedatives. The prosecution wants to show jurors that Murray was distracted by a long list of phone calls and e-mails, causing him to neglect Jackson, who stopped breathing and died. Prosecutors argue that Murray, who was Jackson's personal doctor as he prepared for planned comeback concerts, is criminally responsible for the singer's death because of medical negligence and his reckless use of the propofol to help Jackson sleep. If convicted of involuntary manslaughter, Murray could spend four years in a California prison and lose his medical license.","Dr. Conrad Murray's police interview to be played in court .

"(CNN) -- If Pakistan prosecutes one of the men who helped the CIA hunt down Osama bin Laden, what does it say about the state of relations between Washington and Islamabad? Nothing good, according to national security experts contacted by CNN. New questions are being raised about strained ties between the United States and Pakistan in the wake of a Pakistani commission's recommendation of treason charges this week against a Pakistani doctor who helped U.S. intelligence officials track bin Laden to a compound in Abbottabad. Abbottabad is a largely military community on the outskirts of Islamabad. ""A case of conspiracy against the state of Pakistan and high treason is made"" against Dr. Shakeel Afridi, the information ministry declared, summarizing the commission's investigation into the death of the al Qaeda leader. The recommendation is nonbinding. It remains to be seen whether the government will act on it. Afridi allegedly helped the CIA use a vaccination campaign to try to collect DNA samples from people who lived in bin Laden's compound. The goal of the effort was to acquire DNA evidence from bin Laden family members, according to The Guardian, a British newspaper. The vaccination campaign, a senior U.S. official told CNN, occurred shortly before U.S. forces raided the compound and killed bin Laden on May 2. Pakistani officials insist they were unaware of bin Laden's location, and have expressed anger over President Barack Obama's decision to move ahead with the raid without consulting them. Incidents such as the bin Laden raid and continued U.S. drone strikes within Pakistan's borders have also raised questions of U.S. violations of Pakistani sovereignty. Several analysts also have noted lingering Pakistani anger over the case of Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor and U.S. citizen charged with killing two men in January in Pakistan. Davis was released in March after compensation was paid to the victims' families. For their part, U.S. officials have expressed concern over the alleged infiltration of Pakistan's intelligence services by Islamic extremists, as well as growing anti-American sentiment in Pakistan, among other things. They've also expressed concern about Afridi being jailed without charges. ""This was one small piece of a very large intelligence effort,"" the U.S. official said. ""People need to put this into some perspective."" The recommendation is ""a short-sighted move to gain leverage by the Pakistanis in a troubled U.S.-Pakistan relationship,"" said Fran Townsend, a former national security official in George W. Bush's administration. ""They're obviously angry at the U.S. for the bin Laden raid, and this is just another way they can express their anger."" ""Each time one side does something to insult the other ... it undermines the ability to rebuild trust between the two sides,"" Townsend said. ""Every public move (such as the recommended treason charge) makes the private ability to negotiate a path forward harder."" Michael Rubin, a national security analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, called the continuing uproar over the bin Laden raid the latest ""in a long line of reasons for Pakistan being angry at the United States."" ""Never have we had an ally with whom we've agreed on so little over such a long period of time,"" Rubin told CNN, noting U.S.-Pakistani ties dating back to the Eisenhower era. ""The bin Laden raid was simply the icing on the cake."" But ""any doubt Pakistan wasn't knee deep in the bin Laden mess has now been put to rest,"" Rubin argued. ""The fact that they're prosecuting the doctor shows that given a choice between the United States and al Qaeda, Pakistan would rather be an ally with the latter,"" he said. Some analysts, however, draw parallels between Pakistan's possible decision to prosecute Afridi for treason and an earlier U.S. decision to prosecute former U.S. Navy intelligence official Jonathan Pollard on the same charge. Pollard was caught spying for Israel -- a close U.S. ally -- in 1985. He was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment. ""Pakistan has a pretty legitimate"" case, said Peter Bergen, a national security expert and director of the New America Foundation, a non-partisan Washington think tank. ""It doesn't really matter how valid the goal is. That doesn't change the fact that you're spying for a foreign intelligence service."" Why, Bergen asked, ""should Pakistan somehow not play by the same rules that a lot of countries play by?"" Bergen called the recent Davis case ""seismically important"" in Pakistan. It ""seemed to confirm a widely held view in Pakistan that a bunch of people working for CIA are wandering around their country."" ""That's the context in which (the recommendation of treason charges) is happening,"" he said. Is there anything the U.S. government can do to help Afridi? ""The U.S. finds itself with very little leverage"" in this case because Afridi is a Pakistani national, Townsend said, drawing a contrast to Davis' situation. A solution can be found, she argued, but ""I expect the Pakistanis will exact some price for this."" It's possible, Bergen said, that Afridi ""may just become a bargaining chip at some point."" Regardless of the circumstances, U.S. policymakers have an obligation to do what they can to help Afridi, Rubin asserted. ""It's not just about this man. It's about signaling we'll protect anyone who comes forward to assist our fight against terrorism,"" Rubin said. ""Bin Laden is dead, but there's always going to be a new bin Laden out there. We'll always need help like this doctor provided."" CNN's Pam Benson and Reza Sayah and journalists Nasir Habib and Shaan A. Khan contributed to this report .","Pakistan may charge a doctor with treason for helping U.S. officials find Osama bin Laden .

"Washington (CNN) -- As anti-Wall Street protests continued across the country, several hundred people gathered Thursday in the nation's capital in a scheduled anti-war demonstration that also adopted new overtones in decrying economic disparities. Demonstrators first congregated in the shadow of Congress, at its height filling about half of Washington's Freedom Plaza, which is about the size of a city block. Many carried placards and listened to speeches from activists railing against inequality, corporate greed, as well as the American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The protest came a day before America marks the 10th anniversary of the start of the Afghanistan conflict, and a day after the release of a Pew Research Center survey in which American veterans expressed ambivalence about both wars. Half of the 712 who have served since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks said they felt the Afghanistan war was worth it, while 44% made the same assessment about the Iraq conflict. This aspect of the poll had a margin of error of 5.7 percentage points. Yet military conflict was just one of the topics addressed Thursday. Others focused on economics, in the same spirit of demonstrations that have cropped up in more than a dozen U.S. cities. The hub of the ""Occupy Wall Street"" movement fittingly has been in New York City, with many rallying and camping out there and elsewhere to protest on a wide range of mostly economic issues. The Washington protesters, for one, spelled out the number ""99"" with a human chain that seemed to loop around Freedom Plaza. It is a reference to the group's claim that 99% of Americans are underrepresented in the country's current political and financial systems, while the other 1% of the population wields too much influence. By late afternoon, part of the group broke off and headed toward the U.S. Chamber of Commerce building. There, in front of a two-story banner in front of the building that reads ""JOBS: Brought to you by American free enterprise,"" the demonstrators chanted, ""Where are the jobs?"" Speaking at a news conference earlier Thursday, President Barack Obama said demonstrators -- in Washington, as well as those in New York and other cities nationwide -- ""are giving voice to a more broad-based frustration about how our financial system works."" But Obama also defended the country's financial sector, saying, ""We have to have a strong, effective financial sector in order for us to grow."" Thursday's demonstration is not the first in Washington about economic matters. A day earlier, several hundred union and progressive activists sought to capitalize on the growing ""Occupy Wall Street"" protests with a Capitol Hill rally demanding new public spending on job creation and an end to federal budget cuts. The event, led by former White House clean energy adviser Van Jones, highlighted growing liberal frustration with a public policy agenda increasingly dominated by deficit reduction efforts and difficulty in implementing more traditional economic stimulus measures as well as revenue increases. CNN's Eric Fiegel and Lesa Jansen contributed to this report.","Demonstrators in Freedom Plaza protest against U.S.-led wars .

"New York (CNN) -- A federal judge has ordered that an official monitor be put in place to prevent discrimination in the hiring of New York City firefighters. U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis said the city needs ""to comprehensively reassess its policies and practices, to analyze the evidence showing the effect of those policies and practices, and to rationally consider how they can be changed to achieve a firefighter hiring process that is -- in actual practice and effect -- fair and open to all."" The order requires the city to take remedial steps to fix discriminatory hiring practices and puts the court monitor in place for at least the next 10 years to make sure those steps are taken. Garaufis cited ""the clear evidence of disparate impact that Mayor (Michael) Bloomberg and his senior leadership chose to ignore was obvious to anyone else who looked."" ""Instead of facing hard facts and asking hard questions about the City's abysmal track record of hiring black and Hispanic firefighters, the Bloomberg Administration dug in and fought back,"" the judge said in his ruling. Mark LaVorgna, a spokesman for the mayor, said the city intends to appeal the decision. Litigation against the city's firefighter hiring practices began in 2007, when the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint alleging the Fire Department of New York's hiring exams negatively affected black and Hispanic applicants. ""Four years of litigation and two adverse liability rulings later, the City still doesn't get it,"" Garaufis said. ""The City's senior leaders have routinely denied that they are responsible or doing anything to remedy nearly forty years of discrimination."" Bloomberg strongly disagreed with the decision. ""I think it's fair to say no previous administration has done more or been as successful in attracting the diversity to the FDNY than we have,"" the mayor told reporters Wednesday, ""and I couldn't feel more strongly about it."" Bloomberg said 61,000 people, more than half of them minorities, applied to the fire department in the last recruiting campaign, ""shattering any previous record for minority applicants."" Garaufis acknowledged that the city has improved its minority recruiting, but he said the subsequent hiring processes and ""discriminatory testing procedures"" have kept many of these minorities from actually being hired. Paul Washington, a representative of the Vulcan Society, one of the plaintiffs in the case, praised the decision. ""We're very pleased to see this order and it's certainly long overdue,"" Washington said. ""We're glad to see the judge properly addressing this issue."" Details of the court-appointed monitoring, as well as logistics for a future fairness hearing in which third parties will be able to express their opinions, is scheduled for October 20, said Darius Charney, an attorney for the plaintiffs.","Official monitor will oversee FDNY hiring practices, federal judge rules .

"(CNN) -- For most designers, good design is neither just a well-functioning object nor a good-looking object, but rather both. I say both, as the simultaneity is crucial so that function and appearance support each other and, when done well, in a sense become indistinguishable. In designing products, we consider these two attributes -- along with other factors such as budget, material capability and consumer response -- and add them to the mixture that constitutes design. What Steve Jobs did was to add yet another element: innovative marketing. Have you ever been in an Apple Store that isn't packed with people ""just browsing?"" They are there to soak up whatever Apple is and does. Who would ever have thought that bulky, wooden Parsons tables would be enough? But you can bet on one thing: Jobs did not go to market research groups to find the answer. He knew that all each store would need, beyond its terrific merchandise, were bare essentials. Think about it: He didn't need flashing neon, he didn't need hip tunes blaring so that you couldn't hear each other, he didn't need wild colors or expensive materials. He simply needed a clean space with a sales force of people, each wearing an Apple T-shirt. I gasp whenever I see, in a newspaper or magazine, a new restaurant where the designer has opted for outrage in his or her need to be the next cutting-edge idea, forgetting that the customer might just want a good place to eat with friends. I imagine that Jobs would not have had a hand in that type of scenario. He might simply have said, ""It's not that difficult. After all, it's just about dinner."" Share your memories of Steve Jobs . Designers often neglect the essence of innovation when they are overwhelmed with the requirements of the product they are designing. The Apple Store design, the product design, the hardware design and software design all come down to innovation -- something not tried before. I am reminded of an apocryphal story about Pablo Picasso. Two frumpy ladies were standing in front of a cubist portrait of Gertrude Stein, or at least the label said ""Gertrude Stein."" One woman turned to her friend and said, ""It doesn't look like Gertrude Stein."" Whereupon Picasso, who happened to be standing behind them, said in a prophetic tone, ""It will."" In a commencement address to Stanford University graduates that's been widely televised since his death, Jobs revealed something about himself that I, too, have felt intensely since I suffered paralysis. Of course, being aware that his illness would limit his time, he said that he wanted every day to be spent making a contribution. One imagines that Jobs, given how much he loved doing what he did, wanted to leave this world exhausted from his passion for his life's work, for that's all that would give him rest. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Graves.","Designer Michael Graves says Steve Jobs added innovation to the designer's tool kit .

"(CNN) -- The battle over the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would stretch 1,700 miles through six states, from Alberta, Canada, across the U.S. heartland, and into Texas to Gulf Coast refineries, is intensifying. The final congressional hearing on the $7 billion project is scheduled for October 7 in Washington. And the State Department, which has to sign off on the deal because of the international scope of the project, has said a decision is expected before the end of the year. Environmental groups are furious about the pipeline, which would carry at least 700,000 barrels of tar sands oil a day to U.S. refineries, and the plan to run it through sensitive environmental areas. During a two-week protest in front of the White House more than 1,200 people were arrested, including actress Daryl Hannah and leading NASA climate scientist James Hansen. Veteran activist Bill McKibben, with the group Tar Sands Action, was the main organizer of the civil disobedience campaign or sit-in, which ended this weekend. The group wanted to send a message to President Barack Obama because the project also needs a presidential permit to move ahead. ""There are two basic problems here. One they want to run a 1,700-mile pipe and they're going to run it through some of the most sensitive land in this country: The Ogallala Aquifer (which provides drinking water for 20 million people) in the middle of the country,"" McKibben said. McKibben thinks the second problem may be the bigger issue. ""Even if you can get all that oil to Texas without spilling it, what you've done is open up a huge pipeline into the second-largest pool of carbon on Earth, after the Saudi oil fields."" He quotes leading scientists as saying if oil companies tap this huge pool of tar sands in a big way, ""it is essentially game over for the climate."" The oil industry disputes this. And the State Department concluded in a final environmental review on August 26 that the pipeline would have no significant impact. ""There would be no significant impacts to most resources along the proposed pipeline corridor,"" Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs Assistant Secretary Kerri-Ann Jones told reporters on August 27. A spokeswoman for the American Petroleum Institute, Sabrina Fang, says TransCanada is going to develop the pipeline, whether the U.S. is involved or not and that China is poised to get involved in exporting the oil if the U.S. doesn't. Fang says she thinks the protesters are really protesting against jobs. She points to the flat Labor Department jobs report for August and the nation's 9.1% unemployment rate last month. ""This pipeline can create 20,000 jobs, almost immediately. So we are very much for this pipeline. We think it's great for the American economy 'cause it will create jobs and it's also good for energy security."" Later this month McKibben says more civil disobedience actions are planned in Canada on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. He also says they're planning another big protest in Washington on October 7, the day of the final hearing. The pipeline would draw from oil sands deposits in Canada and pass through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas, with construction on an existing pipeline in Kansas. It is estimated to cost $7 billion.","Environmental groups say dangerous pipeline would go through sensitive land .

"Beijing, China (CNN)  -- China and the United States, the largest producers of greenhouse gases, will team up to fight climate change and create clean energy, their leaders said Tuesday. Chinese President Hu Jintao and President Obama said their nations will cooperate to advance technologies and work toward a global agreement on reducing carbon emissions. ""As the two largest consumers and producers of energy, there can be no solution to this challenge without the efforts of both China and the United States,"" Obama said. ""That is why we've agreed to a series of important new initiatives in this area."" What would you ask Obama? Share your question for CNN's interview . After Tuesday's meeting, Hu told reporters, ""We agreed to expand our cooperation on climate change, energy and environment,"" which includes developing a China-U.S. clean energy research center. The declaration by Hu and Obama comes ahead of next month's U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, and follows recent acknowledgment by the world's top economic powers, including the U.S., that there's no hope of a major breakthrough on climate change by year's end. The U.S. president said the two leaders want to accelerate the world toward a pact to cut greenhouse gases. The leaders did not offer a time frame, however. ""Our aim ... is not a partial accord or a political declaration,"" Obama said, ""but rather an accord that covers all of the issues in the negotiations and one that has immediate operational affect. ""This kind of comprehensive agreement would be an important step forward in the effort to rally the world around a solution to our climate challenge."" Instead of reaching a final deal in Copenhagen, a strategy dubbed ""one agreement, two steps"" was unveiled at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit over the weekend in Singapore. The aim is to produce a pact over a longer period. The first step would be to have all 191 countries involved in the Copenhagen summit signing on to a framework that includes key ingredients, such as how to finance the coordinated effort to battle climate change. The second step, a binding deal on cutting carbon emissions, would be hashed out in further negotiations. ""Opportunity is knocking. It is up to you to open the door,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement Monday. ""We must seize this opportunity to create a safer and more prosperous future for all, to reduce the emissions that are causing climate change and to help the most vulnerable adapt to impacts that are already under way."" Like the United States and China, APEC and Group of 20 leaders -- the world's leading economies -- have pledged to drive toward a climate-change agreement in Copenhagen. The conference, set to begin December 7, aims to strike a deal on a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 pact that has legally binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The United States never ratified it, though more than 200 other nations did.","President Obama, Chinese leader pledge to work to reduce carbon emissions .

"(CNN) -- Kenyan police have detained a suspect in connection with the killing of a British tourist and the kidnapping of his wife, police spokesman Charles Owino told CNN Tuesday. The attack happened at a remote safari lodge on the coast, near the border with Somalia. About 12:30 a.m. Sunday, bandits attacked the couple, who were staying at Kiwayu Safari Village, a tourist resort on Kiwayu Island in Kiyunga division of Lamu west district on the coast, Kenyan police said. During the attack, David Tebbut was shot dead and his wife, Judith Tebbut, was abducted, police said. The couple had arrived at the hotel Saturday afternoon after spending a week in the Masai Mara game reserve in southwestern Kenya. They were the sole guests in the hotel, which has cloth doors. ""From what we can be able to gather, he resisted, and that's why he was shot dead,"" Kenyan Police Commissioner Mathew Iteere said Sunday. ""Maybe they wanted to take the two, but he resisted and that's why he was shot dead."" Iteere said the motive was not known. ""We are treating it just as a bandit attack,"" he said. A travel website lists rates at the 18-cottage resort as beginning at $400 per night. A maritime security source aware of the situation said Sunday that Islamic militants probably took Judith Tebbut by boat toward Ras Kamboni in Somalia.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The U.S.-led war in Afghanistan marked its 10th year Friday having passed two major milestones: The Taliban has been forced out of power and Osama bin Laden is dead. But there was little observance by U.S. troops in Afghanistan, where a month earlier many participated in commemorations to mark the 10th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ""We really celebrated the 10th anniversary of 9/11, and we were out here in Afghanistan,"" Marine Corps Maj. Gen. John Toolan Jr., commanding general of ISAF troops in southern Afghanistan, told reporters during a briefing on Thursday. ""I think that to us it was a far more significant date than 10 years of fighting in Afghanistan because, really, when you look at the 10 years, you're looking at different levels of forces, different levels of attention given to Afghanistan."" The U.S.-led war in Afghanistan began October 7, 2011, with an air campaign that was followed within weeks by a ground invasion. President Barack Obama has called it ""the longest-running war in the nation's history"". The aim was to oust the Taliban and dismantle al Qaeda's leadership, though the leaders of both groups -- Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden -- managed to escape capture. Bin Laden was killed in May during a raid by U.S. commandos on his hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The whereabouts of Mullah Omar is unknown, and he has not been seen in public in years. As the United States turned its attention toward Iraq, insurgent violence in Afghanistan flared against Afghan civilians and security forces as well as the U.S. and its coalition partners. More than 2,700 troops from the United States and its partners have died during the 10 years of war, according to a CNN count. Of those, 1,780 were American, 382 were British and 157 were Canadian. Since the conflict began, the number of casualties has risen by the year, with a significant jump from 2008 to 2009. At least 296 coalition troops died in 2008. It nearly doubled in 2009 when 517 coalition troops were killed. That year, President Barack Obama authorized a surge of 33,000 U.S. forces to Afghanistan to combat the violence. Two years later, the United States outlined its plan to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, beginning with pulling the 33,000 surge troops by the end of 2012 and the remaining 68,000 by the end of 2014. The move was followed by withdrawal announcements by most of the NATO nations. On Thursday, defense ministers from the 49 nations that make up the International Security Assistance Force pledged their support to Afghanistan even as they make plans to withdraw troops by 2014. ""Let there be no mistake: transition is not departure. We will not take our leave when the Afghans take the lead,"" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters Thursday in Brussels, Belgium. The ministers are scheduled to meet again in May in Chicago where Rasmussen said they will ""need to decide what more we will do."" While NATO has insisted that the transition of security for the country to Afghan forces is conditions-based rather than calendar-driven, the clock is ticking on the withdrawal deadline. The planned withdrawal has raised a number of questions about the stability of Afghanistan, which has been hit by a wave of high-profile attacks in recent months that have jeopardized the peace negotiations. Last month's turban bomb assassination of former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, revered by many as a father of the Mujahideen movement that ousted the Soviets in the 1980s, appears to have dealt the biggest blow to the peace process. Rabbani was the chairman of President Hamid Karzai's High Council for Peace, which has been trying for a year to foster dialogue with the Taliban -- a strategy that Karzai publicly abandoned following Rabbani's killing. The war in Afghanistan, once viewed by a majority of Americans as a must, has become widely unpopular as concerns have shifted to the economy and job losses. In a new Pew Research Center report on war and sacrifice released this week, half of post-9/11 veterans said the Afghanistan war has been worth fighting. Only 44% felt that way about Iraq, and one-third said both wars were worth the costs. Robert Messel is among those veterans who question the war. Messel, who was a freshman in college and a ROTC student on September 11, 2001, said he remembers thinking that the war in Afghanistan would be over before he joined the Army. But as the war continued, Messel said he began to have mixed feelings. ""I joined to defend the country, and I feel that a lot of the things we were doing were not exactly that,"" he said in a CNN iReport. ""In my opinion, it basically should have been limited to what we initially were going in to do: Hunt down bin Laden and the architects of the attacks."" Messel said it is very difficult to look back objectively on the experience. ""You lost friends and made sacrifices. You don't want to ever think that everything that happened was in vain,"" he said. But Asmatullah Kohistani has a different perspective on the war, which he says gave his family back their home and their livelihoods. He was 13 when he and his family fled their home in Afghanistan's Kapisa province amid a civil war that would see the Taliban take control of the country. Driven out by bombardments and fighting, his family crossed into Pakistan, making their home in Islamabad. Kohistani, 28, said ""everything changed"" after the Taliban were forced from power. Kohistani, who worked for a U.S. business for two years upon his return to Afghanistan, founded media startup Afghan123.com last year. ""(E)veryone can have a job and go to school (now), and I can have my business,"" he said in a CNN iReport.","The U.S.-led war in Afghanistan began October 7, 2001, with an air campaign .

"(CNN) -- Reigning world and Olympic champion Usain Bolt has eased his way through the 100m heats on the first day of the IAAF World Championships in Daegu, South Korea. The Jamaican sprinter, who broke his own 100m world record at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin with a time of 9.58 seconds, won his heat in 10.10 seconds to advance to Sunday's semifinals. ""I feel great. I did well. People are going to say what they want but I'll focus on what I want. Nobody has broken my world record,"" Bolt said, AFP reported. ""I've worked during the season. I've worked it out so that's why it looked so easy -- focus and exercise. I was really happy because I worked hard all season. I finally got it right,"" Bolt added, AFP reported. Bolt's compatriots Nesta Carter, Michael Frater and Yohan Blake are also safely through to the semifinals as are the United States trio of Justin Gatlin, Trell Kimmons and Walter Dix. Meanwhile, Kenya's female distance runners had a day to savour as they scooped all six medals on offer on the opening day of the championships. Edna Kiplagat took gold in the marathon with a time of two hours 28 minutes 43 seconds beating compatriots Priscah Jeptoo and Sharon Cherop who finished second and third respectively. Vivian Cheruiyot claimed Kenya's second gold of the day in the 10,000m winning in a time of 30 minutes 48.98 seconds. Fellow countrywoman Sally Kipyego crossed the line in second, while 2009 champion Linet Masai came in third to cap a memorable day. ""It's absolutely fantastic. It's a wonderful day for Kenyans and for the entire country. Cheruiyot said, AFP reported. But it was a day of despair for reigning Olympic champions Australia's Steve Hooker and Britain's Christine Ohuruogu. Defending pole vault champion, Hooker failed to register a single vault in three attempts at the modest height of 5.50 meters, while Ohuruogu was disqualified during the heats for the 400m after making a false start. ""People false start all the time. It's sad. I've worked really hard so I just feel wasted,"" the 27-year-old Briton said, AFP reported. Saturday also saw the start of the decathlon with America's Ashton Eaton and Trey Hardee leading the way.

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Murder victim Meredith Kercher's family cannot forgive anyone until they know the truth about her killing, Kercher's sister said Tuesday as Amanda Knox flew out of Italy, a free woman after four years. Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were dramatically cleared of the murder Monday, in a jury ruling that left Knox sobbing and almost unable to walk out of the court unaided. The decision stunned the Kercher family, who were visibly downcast Tuesday morning. It sends them ""back to square one,"" Kercher's brother Lyle said. Stephanie Kercher, the victim's sister, demurred when asked if the family is ready to forgive Meredith's killer or killers. ""Until the truth comes out, we can't forgive anyone,"" she said. Analysis: Truth about student's slaying remains elusive . She said the family looked forward to reading the judge's explanation of how the jury reached its decision, which by law must be published within 90 days. Not knowing why one jury two years ago convicted Knox and Sollecito of murder, sexual assault and other crimes related to Kercher's killing, while another said Monday they are innocent is ""the greatest disappointment,"" Stephanie Kercher said. Kercher's mother, meanwhile, did not speak ill of Knox, even when asked what she thought of the American's assertion that her life had been destroyed by the ordeal. ""That's probably true in a way,"" Arline Kercher said. In an interview with CNN, Lyle Kercher said the family accepts the decision, as it accepted the decision in the original trial. ""We have the utmost respect, obviously, for the decision and the integrity of the court,"" he said, adding, ""We will abide by that."" No end to Knox as pop culture obsession . Knox, who arrived in Seattle to cheers just after 8 p.m. ET, thanked her supporters and those who helped her family in emotional remarks at a brief news conference. ""I'm really overwhelmed right now,"" she said. ""I was looking down from the airplane and it seemed like everything wasn't real."" She told her supporters, ""Thank you for being there for me."" Knox spent Monday night with her mother before leaving Italy, her lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova told CNN. Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini said Tuesday that he will appeal the ruling to Italy's High Court. When the appeal reaches the High Court, the hearing will be very short and dependent on key technical issues and arguments, not a review of the actual trial itself, according to Luiss University law professor Nicola Di Mario. Kercher's family said it would support such an appeal, but added it was the state's decision. If Italy's highest court overturns the lower court's decision, it effectively revalidates the trial court's sentence, which means 26 years in prison for Knox. Italy would then have to put in a request to U.S. authorities for extradition, and it would remain to be seen if that would be granted. If the court does not overturn the appeals ruling, Knox could not be tried again for the same crime under the ""double jeopardy"" rule. How 4-year saga unfolded . Knox and Kercher were students at Perugia's university for foreign students when Kercher's partly clothed body was found stabbed and with her throat slashed in the house they shared. Monday's ruling prompted a wave of euphoria by Knox, her family and supporters, as well as howls of disapproval outside the courtroom. ""Perugia is a quiet town. The fact that people came and cry out loud 'shame' on the ruling means something,"" Mignini said. After the ruling, Knox broke down sobbing and was escorted out of the courtroom by two people. KIRO: Seattle reacts to Knox's release . ""We're thankful that Amanda's nightmare is over,"" Knox's sister, Deanna, said on the courthouse steps. ""She suffered for four years for a crime she did not commit."" Co-defendant Sollecito: 'My nightmare' Knox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009 of murder, sexual assault, possession of a weapon, interfering with a crime and theft. The jury cleared Knox and Sollecito of those charges, freeing them from their respective 26- and 25-year sentences. But the jury Monday upheld Knox's conviction on the charge of defamation against Patrick Lumumba, an early suspect in the case whom Knox accused of killing Kercher. Lumumba was arrested, but released after his alibi checked out. He later sued Knox, winning 40,000 euros ($54,000) in damages. Knox was sentenced Monday to three years on the defamation charge, but received credit for the years she has already spent behind bars, her attorney said. A third person, drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted separately of involvement in the killing and is serving 16 years. Defense teams for Knox and Sollecito have suggested Guede could have been the sole killer. The jury evidently believed Knox's impassioned final statement to the court, delivered in a voice trembling with emotion. ""I am not what they say I am -- perverse, violent. ... I haven't murdered. I haven't raped. I haven't stolen,"" Knox said in the most important speech of her life. Sollecito put his claim simply in his own closing statement. ""I have never hurt anybody,"" he said. As he concluded, he dramatically removed his plastic ""Free Amanda and Raffaele"" bracelet, saying: ""I have never taken it off since it was given to me. ... I think now is the moment to take it off."" Following the rulings, Knox returned briefly to the prison and was greeted by cheers and shouts of ""well done,"" said Rocco Girlanda, a member of the Italian parliament who became an advocate for the 24-year-old American. ""Her first desire is to lie down on a green field,"" he said .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korean and South Korean military units exchanged gunfire near their border Friday, South Korean authorities said. No casualties were reported. The exchange happened after North Korean forces fired two rounds from a 14.5 millimeter machine gun at a South Korean military guard post near the border town of Chorwon, South Korea, about 73 miles (118 km) northeast of Seoul, according to an official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The South Korean unit responded with three ""warning shots"" from a .50-caliber machine gun and warned the North Korean guard post by loudspeaker to desist, the official said. The demilitarized zone at the location of the shooting is 1.3 kilometers (0.8 miles) wide. Chorwon was the scene of heavy fighting during the 1950-53 Korean War. North Korea on Friday threatened to retaliate against its neighbor for shunning bilateral military talks. The gunfire exchange apparently won't cancel reunions of families separated by the Korean War, which ended in a truce but no formal peace treaty. The weeklong reunions begin Saturday at Mount Kumgang, the two countries' joint mountain resort in the North. North Korea has requested record shipments of rice and fertilizer in exchange for concessions on the reunions, the South Korean Yonhap news agency reported earlier this week. While there are occasional shooting incidents across the demilitarized zones, the tensest flash point on the peninsula in recent years has been the disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea. There were fatal naval clashes there in 1999 and 2002. In March this year, the sinking of a South Korean vessel killed 26 in what a South Korean and international investigation team concluded was a North Korean torpedo attack. North Korea continues to deny involvement. The prickly relationship between the countries since the Korean War has had periodic conciliatory moves and flare-ups. Friday's incident occurred two weeks before the G-20 summit in Seoul. The G-20 includes industrialized nations and developing economies, which focus on economic issues and economic policy coordination. Authorities said a total of 50,000 police and riot police will be deployed during the summit on November 11 and 12, according to Yonhap. Journalist  Andrew Salmon contributed to this report.","The incident was at the border of North Korea, South Korea .

"(CNN) -- Russian law enforcement officers raided the Russian offices of oil giant BP, the company said Wednesday, blasting what it called ""illegal"" interference in its work. The company issued a statement about the raid, saying there were ""no legitimate grounds for such a raid,"" and that the court decision it was based on should not be allowed to stand. The raid is related to a long-running battle between BP and Russian partner, TNK-BP, over oil exploration in the Russian Arctic. It comes a day after ExxonMobil signed a deal with Russian oil company Rosneft that includes Arctic exploration, a blow to BP. BP said the raid targeted a part of the company that was not involved in the dispute with TNK. It was ordered by a Russian court in the city of Tyumen, BP said. ""If the Tyumen Court decision is allowed to stand, it means any party can raid a company's premises at will and examine all its documents,"" BP said. The Russian Federal Court Bailiff Service, which reportedly conducted the raid, did not immediately answer CNN requests for comment or issue a statement.

"(CNN) -- The top security official in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon was found shot dead and burned inside a truck in the city of Monterrey, the state-run Notimex news agency reported, citing state officials. The governor's office confirmed the death of Homero Guillermo Salcido Trevino, head of the control, command and communications operations for the state police. He suffered five bullet wounds, and his body was set on fire inside his official truck, officials said. Officials found the body Sunday night. Eighteen people were killed Monday in Padilla in the neighboring state of Tamaulipas, prosecutors said in a statement. Five Padilla residents were among those killed, the statement said, along with six people traveling in the city. Another seven bodies were dumped in the town square, the prosecutors said. Additionally, unspecified damage was done to Padilla's municipal palace, the lower judiciary court and the city police command. Tamaulipas is in the central northeast of Mexico, bordering Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. Padilla is about 200 miles from the U.S. border. The state prosecutors said state and local authorities were working the case and pledged cooperation with federal authorities as well. Northern Mexico has been plagued by a steady stream of violence fueled by the lucrative drug trade in Mexico. According to the government, there have been more than 34,600 drug-related deaths since President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on the cartels in December 2006. Alejandro Poire, Mexico's national security spokesman, told CNN's Rafael Romo last week that half the more than 15,000 drug-related deaths last year occured in just three of the country's 32 states -- Chihuahua, Sinaloa and Tamaulipas. Thirty percent of the total is in Chihuahua alone, with most of those in Ciudad Juarez across the border from El Paso, Texas. ""We can get ahold of this violence,"" Poire said. ""We have shown it in other parts of the country, and we will do it because we have a comprehensive strategy to address crime and violence."" Monday's violence followed several incidents last week in the region that left another 18 people dead. On February 6, the remains of five men discarded along the highway between Monterrey and Reynosa in Tamaulipas were found, Notimex reported. The state news agency said the bodies were naked, except for plastic bags. A day earlier, gunmen clashed with soldiers in three separate incidents in Tamaulipas, leaving 13 people dead, the agency reported.

At least 400 people have been wounded and 23,000 displaced in the latest violence, the agency reported. So far this year, more than 200,000 civilians are believed to have fled their homes in the capital, it said. ""People who have been able to reach northern Somalia and neighbouring countries are mostly arriving on foot and by small buses and traveling without shelter. They tell our staff that the streets of Mogadishu are completely deserted and that people are too afraid to leave their houses. In these dangerous and difficult conditions, aid distributions are becoming rare and those who venture out are risking their lives,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The agency said people are leaving the capital for other parts of Somalia, such as Puntland, or to the neighboring countries of Ethiopia and Kenya, and across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen. Somalia generates the largest number of refugees in the world after Afghanistan and Iraq, the agency said. At the end of August, there were more than 614,000 Somali refugees and over 1.4 million people displaced within the country. ""The collapse of the state, spiraling violence and anarchy, compounded by poverty, has led to one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world and unacceptable suffering of the civilian population,"" the agency said. African Union troops from other countries have been helping the transitional government fight the Islamist insurgents, who are trying to topple the government. In fact, Uganda recently said it is deploying an additional 750 peacekeeping troops to Mogadishu. The increase is a fulfillment of the commitment pledged by the government of Uganda at the African Union Summit in July. The African Union agreed to send an additional 2,000 troops total to Mogadishu. Djibouti and Guinea are also expected to send their battalions. When all parties fully deploy the pledged troops, the number of AU troops will increase up to 7,000, said Fred Opolot, Ugandan government spokesman. ""The increase in the troops comes as a response from the government of Uganda and AU to the recent attacks in Kampala carried out by Al-Shabaab,"" said Opolot, referring to the bomb attacks on World Cup fans in Uganda in July, which left as many as 79 people dead.","Troops and militants have been fighting in Mogadishu .

"London (CNN) -- Debate is rife in Australian political circles about whether carbon trading is the way forward for climate change abatement. Carbon trading is said to be one way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is looking to introduce a mandatory carbon trading system by 2010 which will cap the amount of pollution industry can release. The proposed Australian system will be similar to the European Union emission trading system which was established in 2005. With Phase 1 of the European system complete, there are a few lessons about carbon trading that Australia -- and other countries looking to go down this path -- could benefit from. So what is carbon trading? Carbon trading -- also known as ""cap and trade"" -- is a system designed to cut the carbon emissions which contribute to global warming. Generally in a market-based cap and trade system, a central authority -- such as a government or international body -- sets a limit on the amount of carbon which can be emitted and then divides this amount into units which are allocated to different groups. These units can then be traded as any commodity would. Carbon trading can occur both between countries and amongst industries within countries. A second approach to carbon trading involves a country or business generating carbon credits by investing in ""green"" projects -- usually in developing countries -- that are said to reduce emissions. Why is it necessary? According to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) there is unequivocal evidence that human activities have contributed to a gradual warming of the planet which has resulted in a change in climate. The IPCC report provides scientific evidence of change including to the duration of seasons, rainfall patterns and an increased frequency of extreme weather events. Industrialization is recognized as a key factor in the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere and according to the IPCC the world has warmed by an average of 0.74°C in the past 100 years. The IPCC predicts that if GHG emissions continue to rise at their current rate, this century will see a further 3°C rise in the average world temperature. While the consensus of the scientific community (via the IPCC) is that action must be taken to avert the worst impacts of climate change, economic arguments about the cost of climate change abatement -- advanced by countries like the U.S. and at one time Australia -- have in the past proved an impediment to action. A carbon trading system is said to be one way that countries can look to make greenhouse gas emissions cuts with minimal economic impact. Do you think carbon trading is the way to reduce greenhouse emissions? What trading systems exist? Established in 2005, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is the largest multi-national, multi-sector CO2 trading system in the world. The ultimate aim of the system is to ensure that EU Member States are compliant with their Kyoto Protocol commitments and to do this the most energy-intensive industries are allocated carbon permits by Member States which allow them to emit a certain amount of CO2. If these companies want to emit more CO2 than their permits allow for, they are able to buy them from more efficient companies with spare permits. The EU ETS takes in around 12,000 installations which account for around 50 percent of EU greenhouse gas emissions from industries such as power, steel and cement manufacture. According the World Bank, the EU ETS contributed $50 billion of the $64 billion traded in the carbon market in 2007. The second largest carbon trading system exists under the United Nations Kyoto Protocol. The Protocol -- which sets binding emission targets for 37 industrialized countries -- permits emissions trading in order to help countries meet their agreed upon targets. Countries have agreed to an average 5 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions, compared to 1990 levels, by 2012 and carbon trading is one way to meet this quota. By December 2008, the EU ETS will link up with the UN trading system to create a more global scheme. The Clean Development Mechanism is a further carbon trading mechanism of the Protocol which allows industrialized nations to claim emission credits from investment in clean technologies which will ""offset"" carbon in developing countries. Developed nations can also finance emission reduction projects in developing countries through Joint Implementation in exchange for emission credits. New Zealand has established a mandatory carbon trading system this year and Australia has also committed to expanding the pioneering New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme to a national market by 2010. New mandatory systems are being considered for Japan and Canada. Voluntary carbon markets also exist, with the Chicago Climate Exchange one of the more established ones. What do permits cost? The cost of a carbon permit is dictated by the market forces of supply and demand. In 2007, one European Union Allocation (for one ton of carbon) was trading at $30 to $35. What industries are subject to trading? Under mandatory schemes like the EU ETS, it's the most energy-intensive industries within Member States which are subject to carbon trading. This includes industries like power installations, steel and cement manufacture and the construction industry. The commercial aviation industry -- which accounts for 3 percent of EU emissions -- could be brought into the EU ETS by 2011. Currently personal or household emissions and the public sector and transport industry emissions are not included in any carbon trading system. Has emissions trading been successful? Yes and no. The introduction of mandatory systems which cap emissions like the EU ETS is a step in the right direction for trying to cut emissions without a major cost to business. However, critics such as Carbon Trade Watch argue that the current carbon trade systems are flawed because there is a tendency for the biggest polluters to be over-allocated permits. This was clearly evident with Phase 1 of the EU ETS when the market virtually collapsed in 2006 because too many allowances were allocated. Market analyst Franck Schuttellaar estimated that the United Kingdom's most polluting companies made windfall profits of around $1.7 billion as a direct result of generous carbon credit allocation under the EU ETS. Questions have also been raised about whether carbon trading systems actually reduce GHG emissions. Independent UK think-tank Open Europe reported that between 2005 and 2006 emissions from industries covered by the ETS actually rose in UK by 3.6 percent and by 0.8 percent across the whole of Europe. Auctioning off carbon credits at the outset -- rather that simply allocating credits to business for free -- is one way that has been proposed to help the system make a real impact on emissions. Certainly, increasing the scarcity of carbon credits would help ensure that businesses commit to genuine low-carbon alternatives. While carbon emissions account for around 70 percent of greenhouse gases, they are not the sole cause of climate change and it would seem a safer bet to reinforce a carbon trading system with other legislative measures aimed at reducing emissions.","Carbon trading is said to be one way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Existing carbon trading systems have had limited impact on emissions to date .
The European experience serves as a good lesson for new trading systems ."
"(CNN) -- A report in South Korean media is fueling the ongoing speculation about the deteriorating health of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. Kim Jong Il, seen in an undated state-issued photo, has made only two public appearances since August. YTN News, citing unidentified intelligence sources in South Korea and China, reported Monday that the 67-year-old leader has pancreatic cancer. South Korea's Unification Ministry flatly denied the report, which comes a week after a frail-looking Kim appeared in public for the first time in months. Doctors told South Korea's state-run Yonhap News Agency that it is impossible to tell the status of Kim's health from the recent video of the reclusive leader. Kim appeared at a July 8 ceremony to commemorate the 15th anniversary of his father's death. He seemed frail and gaunt as he walked into the service flanked by senior party and military officials. North Korea's official KCNA news agency has routinely criticized the Western media for erroneously exaggerating the status of Kim's health. Last week's appearance was his second since he was widely reported to have suffered a stroke in August. Kim was seen in April when he was reappointed as chairman of North Korea's military board. His recent health problems and long absence from public functions have prompted speculation on whether he was ready to groom an heir. The rules governing transfer of power in the secretive communist nation are unclear, but it is widely believed that Kim's youngest son, Kim Jong Un, will succeed him.  Facts about North Korea » . In April, the North Korean leader named Kim Jong Un and brother-in-law Chang Sung Taek to the country's powerful National Defense Commission. Chang, who is married to Kim Jong Il's sister, has effectively run the country in the wake of the leader's health problems, according to TIME Magazine. Chang is ""the bridge from Kim Jong Il to Kim Jong Un,"" according to Baek Seung Joo, who watches North Korea at the Korea Institute for Defense Analysis, who spoke to TIME Magazine last month.","Media reports, citing unconfirmed sources, say Kim Jong Il has cancer .

"(CNN) -- U.N. military helicopters Sunday pounded heavy weapons positions of fighters loyal to self-declared Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo, United Nations officials said. Choi Young-jin, head of the U.N. mission in the country, said pro-Gbagbo forces were shelling the Golf Hotel in Abidjan, where the country's internationally recognized president Alassane Ouattara is staying, and ""today they began to shell our quarters"" -- the section of the hotel in which the U.N. forces are headquartered -- as well. ""So we decided we cannot pass this moment without action,"" Choi said. Together with the French military, U.N. forces targeted key positions. Choi said there were ""several camps"" belonging to the Gbagbo loyalists. ""We are taking them out."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he ordered the military operation Sunday ""to prevent the use of heavy weapons which threaten the civilian population of Abidjan and our peacekeepers."" The U.N. mission does not extend to extracting Gbagbo from his residence, Choi said. It would be up to pro-Ouattara forces to oust Gbagbo, he said. Ban renewed his call for Gbagbo ""to step aside immediately."" ""Civilians are bearing the brunt of the violence,"" the secretary-general said. ""The fighting must stop. Mr. Gbagbo needs to step aside immediately."" Gbagbo's forces had attacked the Golf Hotel Saturday as well. U.N. forces fired back at the time, said Hamadoun Toure, spokesman for the U.N. mission in Ivory Coast. ""We stand ready to protect the Golf Hotel, as we have a mandate,"" he told CNN. Toure added that Gbagbo loyalists continue to control three main areas -- the presidential palace, Gbagbo's residence and the state television station, RTI. He said the French military and U.N. forces are in charge of the Abidjan port. Violence erupted after Ivory Coast's disputed presidential election in November and escalated into all-out war when Ouattara's forces launched an offensive that brought them into Abidjan. As Gbagbo has refused to cede power, the political stalemate has plunged the West African nation into crisis. The U.N. human rights office said Friday that its investigators found more than 100 bodies over 24 hours in three Côte d'Ivoire towns. Gbagbo's forces used a lull in fighting last week as a ""trick"" to reinforce their positions around the Abidjan, according to Alain Le Roy, the head of United Nations peacekeeping operations. They said Tuesday they wanted a peaceful solution to the months-long fighting, but soon resumed shelling both the U.N. headquarters and the civilian population, Le Roy told reporters at the United Nations. Since then, they have regained control of two central areas of Abidjan and fighting is continuing, Le Roy said Friday, after briefing the U.N. Security Council on developments in the cocoa-producing nation. ""They have clearly used the lull of Tuesday as a trick to reinforce their position,"" he said. Mark Toner, acting deputy spokesman for the U.S. State Department, released a statement Saturday echoing that idea. ""It is clear that Gbagbo's attempts at negotiation this week were nothing more than a ruse to regroup and rearm. Gbagbo's continued attempt to force a result that he could not obtain at the ballot box reveals his callous disregard for the welfare of the Ivoirian people, who will again suffer amid renewed heavy fighting in Abidjan,"" he said. Most areas of the capital, however, are now under U.N. or French military control, journalist Seyi Rhodes reported from the French military base in Port Bouet. The French military has been working to reconnect the disrupted water and electricity supply in what is the country's main city.

"(CNN) -- NATO agreed Thursday to take command of enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya and was considering taking control of the full U.N.-backed military mission, Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN. Rasmussen's announcement fell short of what U.S. President Barack Obama has sought, and it was unclear if concerns by Turkey and some other NATO allies over coalition airstrikes on Libyan ground forces would prevent NATO from agreeing to expand its command over the entire mission. ""What we have decided today is that NATO will enforce the no-fly zone,"" Rasmussen said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""We are considering whether NATO should take on overall responsibility. That decision has not been made yet."" Rasmussen said he expected NATO to take over full control of the no-fly-zone enforcement in a few days, and to decide on the issue of broader responsibility ""within the coming days."" However, a senior administration official said that in fact, NATO reached an understanding that it will control the rest of the mission, with details on the extent of the mission still being worked out. The administration official, who spoke to reporters on condition of not being identified by name, said NATO ambassadors actually made two decisions Thursday. One was to take over command of the no-fly zone, and the other was a political decision to take responsibility for enforcing the full U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the military mission. ""That latter part, we are still completing the operational planning and expect to be completed by this weekend,"" the administration official said. The U.N. resolution authorizes a no-fly zone, enforcement of an arms ban, and other steps as necessary to protect Libyan civilians. So far, the U.S.-led coalition has interpreted that to include airstrikes on Libyan ground forces threatening the rebel stronghold of Benghazi and in other areas. Thursday's agreement was reached in a conference call between U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her counterparts from Britain, France and Turkey, according to the senior administration official and diplomatic officials who spoke on condition of not being identified by name. At NATO headquarters later, the meeting of ambassadors extended long past its expected conclusion. NATO sources said a major sticking point involved the rules of engagement for coalition forces enforcing the U.N. resolution, with Turkey raising concerns over details. When Rasmussen finally emerged to announce an agreement, it was clear that questions over the rules of engagement remained unresolved. Asked if the announcement revealed a split in NATO over the mission, Rasmussen said no. However, he also acknowledged that if unaltered, the agreement would mean the overall Libyan mission would have two parts, with NATO enforcing the no-fly zone and arms blockade, and the U.S.-led coalition that launched the mission handling other necessary civilian protection. Rasmussen said NATO would use the mission's already established chain of command for enforcing the no-fly zone. The NATO supreme commander, an American, would be in charge, but the mission would be under NATO control, Rasmussen noted. In addition, non-NATO partners including Arab countries would participate, Rasmussen said. After Rasmussen's announcement, Clinton told reporters that all 28 NATO allies authorized military authorities to develop a plan for NATO to take on the broader mission of civilian protection under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973. ""NATO is well-suited to coordinating this international effort and ensuring that all participating nations are working effectively together toward our shared goals,"" said Clinton, who took no questions. ""This coalition includes countries beyond NATO, including Arab partners, and we expect all of them to be providing important political guidance going forward. We have always said that Arab leadership and participation is crucial."" Clinton also said she will travel to London on Tuesday to attend an international meeting on Libya that will include NATO allies and Arab partners in the Libya mission. NATO sources told CNN that the shift in command for enforcing a no-fly zone was expected by Sunday night. According to the sources, NATO has sent a directive to NATO's military chain of command asking for a plan on how to execute an expanded role for enforcement of U.N. Resolution 1973. Under the expanded role, called ""no-fly plus"" by some officials, NATO might be given more robust rules of engagement to ensure that civilians are protected, the sources said. One proposal for ""no-fly plus"" would allow some coalition forces to withdraw from certain missions, the sources said. So far, U.S. forces have taken on the bulk of the Libyan mission, according to figures provided by the Pentagon. Of a total of 175 Tomahawk missiles fired, 168 were from the United States and seven from Great Britain, the only two countries to possess them, while U.S. planes have flown almost two-thirds of the sorties and U.S. ships comprise more than two-thirds of the total involved. The U.S. aerial involvement will ease once NATO assumes full operational control of the no-fly zone, officials say. It was unclear whether the number of U.S. Navy ships taking part also would decrease, as well as what role U.S. forces would play in the civilian protection part of the mission. Obama has repeatedly said that the United States will turn over control of the Libya mission to allies within ""days, not weeks."" While he specified that would mean no U.S. planes in the air over Libya, Obama left open the possibility of U.S. naval vessels playing a role in blockading Libya against arms shipments. CNN's Jennifer Rizzo, Larry Shaughnessy, Tom Watkins and Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","NEW: U.S. official says NATO agrees take on broader command, but details pending .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday that Iran and China are making ""quite disturbing"" gains in Central and South America. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says the U.S. mustn't ""turn our backs on countries in our own hemisphere."" In wide-ranging comments on the region, she also said the Obama administration will work to improve relations among even its harshest critics in the Western Hemisphere, including Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, and is looking to the Castro brothers in Cuba for some reciprocal action in response to the president's easing of travel and other restrictions. Efforts by the Bush administration to isolate certain Latin American leaders had failed, she said, and the United States now must work to counter efforts by China, Iran and Russia to gain influence there. ""What we are doing hasn't worked very well and in fact, if you look at the gains, particularly in Latin American, that Iran is making and China is making, it is quite disturbing,"" Clinton said at a town hall meeting at the State Department with senior Foreign Service Officers. ""They are building very strong economic and political connections with a lot these leaders. I don't think that is in our interests,"" she said. ""We have no guarantees here that we can create a better relationship with someone who has a different view of politics, the economy and so much else. But we think it is worth trying to just explore this and see what comes of it,"" Clinton said. ""I have to say that I don't think -- in today's world that is a multipolar world where we are competing for attention and relationships with at least the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians -- that it is in our interests to turn our backs on countries in our own hemisphere."" She pointed to a large Iranian presence in the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, as an example of what other countries are doing in Central and South America. ""We are looking at how to deal with [Nicaraguan President Daniel] Ortega,"" she said. ""The Iranians are building a huge embassy in Managua. You can only imagine what it's for."" Clinton's voice was hoarse, she coughed occasionally and seemed to be nursing a cold, but she made no mention of her health. On Cuba, Clinton said the United States is awaiting a response from Cuban leaders Raúl and Fidel Castro. ""We would like to see some reciprocity from the Castros on political prisoners, human rights and other matters,"" she said. ""So we are looking at a number of different relationships and trying to figure out whether we can be more productive. My bottom line is what's best for America, how do we try to influence behavior that is more in our interest than not."" Later, Clinton appeared to be fighting back tears when she spoke at a ceremony to honor Foreign Service officers who had been killed in the line of duty. She spoke about 25-year-old Brian Adkins, who was just beginning his State Department career when he was murdered this year in Ethiopia. ""Please know how grateful we are for his selflessness and service to his country,"" Clinton said. Adkins' name and those of three other Foreign Service officers were added to a plaque in the State Department entrance.","Hillary Clinton: Obama administration trying to improve ties with even harshest critics .

"(CNN) -- An estimated 13,000 Congolese civilians threatened by fierce fighting and gruesome attacks have fled to neighboring Uganda over the past two days and more are expected, the United Nations' refugee agency said in a news release Thursday. Congolese Anosiate Nyirahabineza holds her son Jeremiah in Kampala, Uganda, in June. The agency said the people fled from villages in the besieged province of North Kivu, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where fighting between rebels and government troops has prompted the displacement of 250,000 people since August. The staff of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in the southwestern Uganda town of Ishasha said the people crossed into Uganda from Congo's Rutshuru district. Since August, about 27,000 civilians have escaped to Uganda, which now hosts more than 150,000 refugees from countries in the region. The U.N. agency said the latest refugees are reporting many attacks and atrocities. It quoted a 25-year-old named Daudi, who said, ""The assailants killed everybody in my village. They took the young boys with them and killed all the rest of the population. It's a miracle that my wife and I managed to escape."" He said one of his two children was separated from the family and it is not known where he is. Another villager said rebels who attacked his village ""killed all the women, even pregnant women,"" the U.N. agency said.","13,000 Congolese have fled into Uganda in past two days, U.N. says .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The Mount Merapi volcano in Indonesia erupted at least three times Tuesday, forcing thousands of nearby residents to flee. Indonesian media reported that 15 people were killed, including some journalists who were staying in a guesthouse to get close to the volcano. CNN could not independently verify those reports. Mount Merapi, which looms on the horizon north of the major city of Yogyakarta, is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes and lies in one of the world's most densely populated areas. The volcano has a summit elevation of nearly 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Christian Awui, a rescuer at the scene, told CNN that the first thing that residents heard were sirens from an early warning system announcing the coming eruptions. ""There was panic,"" he said. ""You could hear the rumbles of the volcano."" People ran to a refugee camp about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) away. Because it was still dark, it was hard to tell how the eruptions compared with previous ones, Awui said. Some nongovernmental relief agencies were poised to offer immediate help. One of them was World Vision Indonesia, a Christian relief and development agency. ""Right now, our biggest concern is the children,"" said Fadli Usman, World Vision Indonesia's rapid assessment team leader. ""Children are always forgotten in the early moments of a disaster like this. My first task will be to assess the needs of the children and their families in the evacuation centers so our team can begin to help them."" Usman said about 1,500 people -- mostly women and children -- had found refuge at a four-building shelter about 7 miles (12 kilometers) from the volcano. The evacuees, he said, are worried about the men who stayed behind to guard their homes and fields on the mountain. A dusting of ash covered motorbikes and cars at the shelter parking lot, the relief worker said. The heavy ash fallout also obscured any view of the mountain from his location, he said. Usman had reported earlier that traffic was heavy as people left the region near the mountain. The traffic was not chaotic, he said, and the road was open and under control.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A group of 13 Salvadoran immigrants missing in southern California amid fears that they planned a cult-like mass suicide have been found alive, unhurt and upset to find they were the subjects of an extensive search. Authorities had been scouring the Palmdale area of northern Los Angeles County on horseback and by helicopter Sunday in search of the group, which included eight children between the ages of 3 and 17, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. A resident spotted one of the vehicles identified in the lookout at a park and notified the sheriff's department, he said. One woman in the group told CNN they were ""perfectly OK"" and were shocked and angry to learn that such an extensive search was under way. The woman, who would not give her name, said they had been praying all night in the park, that they had done this routinely and that their husbands were aware of the practice. The search began Saturday afternoon, when the husbands of two women in the group reported them missing, the Sheriff's Department said. One of the men said their wives were part of a ""cult-like group"" and had been ""brainwashed"" by its leader, and Whitmore said the wife left a purse with her husband and asked her ""to pray over"" it. When the husband opened the purse, he found money, mobile phones and notes that ""talked about meeting Jesus, talked about deceased relatives soon to meet up,"" Whitmore told CNN earlier Sunday. That raised concerns that the group members planned to take their own lives, he said. The husbands told investigators that the group had broken away from a Christian church in the Los Angeles area ""and formed a separate group that included both traditional and non-traditional practices and beliefs,"" the Sheriff's Department said Saturday. Its leader, whom investigators identified as Reyna Marisol Chicas, had taken her followers on a similar outing six months ago ""in the apparent belief that there was going to be a major earthquake."" Several members of the group spoke with investigators, and Chicas was held for questioning after giving deputies a false name, Whitmore said. Though no crime had been committed and the group appeared to be praying for 'honest and well-meaning things,"" he said deputies had to investigate once their husbands filed missing persons reports. ""The letters themselves could be interpreted in many ways,"" Whitmore said. ""Now, some of the language in it could be interpreted as saying goodbye as relatives, but that's an interpretation."" But given the husbands' concerns, ""It is better to overreact than underreact,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The number of confirmed H1N1 flu cases worldwide surpassed 10,000, the World Health Organization said Tuesday. In the United States, at least 5,469 cases of swine flu have been reported. Commonly known as swine flu, the outbreak has sickened 10,176 people and caused at least 80 deaths, mostly in Mexico, the organization said. The actual number of people affected may be higher, as it takes time for national governments to confirm cases and report them to the global body. In the United States, at least 5,469 cases of swine flu have been reported, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has linked six deaths to the outbreak; health officials in New York have connected a seventh death -- a school official -- to the disease. Concern about the disease deepened Tuesday, even as authorities have said the outbreak may prove to be less severe than first suspected. A 44-year-old man died Tuesday in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, according to John Shelton of the St. Louis County Health Department. The man, whose name was not released, had been hospitalized for the past few weeks. He had visited Mexico and tests showed he had swine flu, Shelton said. However, the county medical examiner will determine the cause of the man's death. In New York, medical investigators determined that the death of a 16-month-old boy in Queens was not linked to the flu. The boy had a fever when his mother brought him to a hospital Monday and he died less than an hour later, drawing attention from investigators. That death came a day after an assistant principal from New York died after contracting the H1N1 virus. That man -- Mitchell Wiener -- had an underlying health condition, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, New York City's health commissioner and President Barack Obama's pick to lead the CDC. Wiener died Sunday of complications of the H1N1 virus, hospital and state officials said. If confirmed by the CDC, Wiener's death would be the seventh linked to swine flu in the United States. The CDC has confirmed three in Texas, two in Arizona and one in Washington state. Wiener's school is among a handful in New York that temporarily closed at the recommendation of the city's Health Department. Frieden said Sunday that ""with the virus spreading widely,"" closing affected schools ""will make little difference in transmission throughout New York City, but we hope will help slow transmission within the individual school communities."" The flu strain, which originated in Mexico, killed dozens of people there, causing U.S. officials to worry that it could take a similar toll north of the border. So far, however, it has acted similar to typical seasonal influenza, which usually can be treated successfully but can be deadly among the very old, very young and people with pre-existing health problems. CNN's Kara Devlin and Mary Snow contributed to this report.","H1N1 flu has caused at least 80 deaths, mostly in Mexico .

But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers e-cigs an unapproved new drug because of a lack of scientific proof that they're safe or effective. The FDA is trying to halt importation of e-cigs, but isn't seizing products already being sold in the United States. ""The FDA has been detaining and refusing importations since at least last summer of these so-called 'electronic cigarettes,' "" FDA spokesperson Rita Chappelle told CNN in a written statement.  Watch Sanjay Gupta's take on e-cigarette » . Smoking Everywhere is ""pretty sure"" the product is safe, based on laboratory testing in Europe, Taieb said. The company declined a CNN request to review safety reports. ""There are no ingredients in our e-cigs that can cause cancer. However, it is a pretty new product, so we are not 100 percent sure of the side effects at this point,"" Taieb said. ""But we haven't heard of any negative side effects yet, but we are pretty sure they are safe."" Electronic cigarettes run on a battery. A person inhales an e-cig as he or she would a typical cigarette. When inhaled, the battery warms liquid nicotine stored in a plastic filter. The combination of heat and liquid creates the vapor or ""smoke"" puff when exhaled. Health experts say the idea of an electronic cigarette is a great alternative to tobacco smoke but more evidence is needed. ""Nicotine is not the thing in tobacco smoke that causes cancer, but inhaling pure nicotine may be dangerous,"" said Dr. Steven Schroeder, physician and smoking cessation expert at the University of California-San Francisco Medical Center. ""We have no clue what the health effects could be."" Nicotine replacement therapies -- the patch or gum -- are safe and highly successful to help quit smoking. Tobacco smoke causes nearly 90 percent of lung cancer deaths, according to the American Cancer Society. ""If it is a choice between smoking tobacco product or a nicotine replacement -- of course, keep taking the nicotine,"" Schroeder said. ""It is a heck of a lot healthier than tobacco smoking."" Developers of e-cigs echo the thought. ""We aren't claiming electronic cigarettes help you quit altogether, but I promise our product won't cause cancer. So no matter what way you look at it, it's the healthier option,"" Taieb said. Smoking Everywhere sells thousands of electronic cigarettes a day in the United States, the company said. Most are sold online or in 100 mall kiosks across the states. The company, which gave samples of e-cigs to celebrities at this year's Grammy and Oscar awards, said it expects that ""big-name"" actors will soon promote the product. U.S. sales are expected to double in 2009. Sales of e-cigs have been on the rise in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden and Brazil for several years. The trend prompted the World Health Organization to issue a statement in 2008 calling for more safety testing. ""If the marketers of the electronic cigarette want to help smokers quit, then they need to conduct clinical studies and toxicity analyses,"" the statement said. The idea that that e-cigs may be a good tobacco smoke alternative in the future could hold true, the FDA and WHO acknowledged, but proof of the product's safety must come first.","Electronic cigarettes don't contain tar, other chemicals; only liquid nicotine .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- A 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck northern Peru on Wednesday, authorities said. The quake's epicenter was about 350 miles (570 kilometers) northeast of the country's capital, Lima, and 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Pucallpa, Peru, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. Authorities at the Geophysics Institute of Peru said no victims or significant damage had been reported. At least one aftershock had been recorded, the institute said. Lima residents felt a brief, but strong, tremor. The quake struck around 12:45 p.m. near Peru's border with Brazil at a depth of about 90 miles (145 kilometers).

"(CNN) -- A grocer has told a court in Italy that an American woman accused of murdering British student Meredith Kercher was in his shop the morning after the death, contradicting the timeline she had previously given. Both Raffaele Sollecito (left) and Amanda Knox deny charges of murder and sexual assault. Amanda Knox, 21, has said she was at the home of her former boyfriend and co-accused Raffaele Sollecito, 24, until 10 a.m. on the day after Knox's roommate, Meredith Kercher, was stabbed to death. She said she then left for her house to take a shower. But on Saturday, witness Marco Quintavalle said a young woman he identified as Knox came into his supermarket near Sollecito's house in Perugia at 7:45 a.m. on November 2. He said the woman was waiting for him to open up, and that he exchanged glances with her when she entered. ""It really struck me, she had a very pale face and these light eyes,"" Quintavalle said. ""I can still see the image in my head."" Asked by the presiding judge Giancarlo Massei if that woman was in the courtroom, Quintavalle said he was sure it was Knox. ""It's her, I'm sure of it,"" he said, looking at her, according to the Daily Telegraph. Knox did not appear to react. After the death police found a receipt at Sollecito's house for cleaning products from the shop where Knox was allegedly spotted, the paper said. Officers say bleach and cloths found in the house were used to clean the knife used in the murder and the murder scene itself. Knox and Sollecito are charged with murder and sexual assault in the November 2007 killing of Kercher, who died in what prosecutors called a ""drug-fueled sex game"" with the couple and a third person, Rude Guede. Guede was convicted of murder in October and sentenced to 30 years in prison. He is expected to be one of about 100 witnesses in the case. Kercher was found dead in her bed, half-naked, with a knife wound to her neck. In court papers, prosecutors state that Sollecito held Kercher by her wrists while Knox poked at her with a knife and Guede sexually assaulted her. Prosecutors say they have physical evidence placing the defendants at the scene, and that they gave investigators confusing and contradictory statements about their whereabouts the night Kercher died. Knox first said she was at the house she shared with Kercher, then changed her story, according to court records. Sollecito, meanwhile, said he was never at the house, but was at his apartment, watching a movie on his computer with Knox. Later, he told investigators he did not remember whether Knox was with him the entire night. Defense lawyers are expecteed to argue that the physical evidence was tainted by sloppy police work. The trial, which is expected to take months, has drawn more than 140 journalists from 86 news outlets to the courthouse in Perugia, a university town about 185 km (115 miles) north of Rome.","Grocer contradicts timeline of woman accused of murdering Meredith Kercher .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- The Italian government said it would halt the construction of a controversial landfill near Naples, but the assurance was not enough for protesters who clashed with police Saturday night, injuring six police officers. Residents were protesting not only the building of a new landfill, but the conditions of an existing landfill, which they said pose an environmental and health hazard. Guido Bertolaso, the chief of Italy's civil protection agency, was named by the government to deal with the issue. He told reporters that the government would put the second landfill on hold and the current landfill will be analyzed for any dangers to people or natural resources. But protesters were wary of the government's word, and continued their demonstration. Some 500 protesters were blocking the road that leads to the landfill, though police estimated that only 20 or 30 people were involved in the clashes with police. Some speculated that those involved were not even involved in the protest, but were hooligans looking to start trouble. Protesters hurled rocks, firecrackers and Molotov cocktails at police. Bertolaso met Sunday with the mayors of the towns in the landfill area in Naples to restate the governments position. But the mayors have not agreed to Bertolaso's proposed compromise. Another meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday. ""We are going to continue these battles and I believe that we'll obtain what we want,"" said Domenico Auricchio, mayor of Terzigno. ""I only ask my citizens to have faith in the local institutions. We'll continue to battle to the end, but now I ask that these acts of vandalism stop because they don't bring any thing good to any one."" Another nearby mayor, Gennaro Langella of Boscoreale, said, ""Our citizens have asked for a bigger guarantee that a second landfill would not be open. It has not been possible to obtain that and therefore we don't think we can sign the document."" Despite the lack of agreement, Bertolaso said the government will move forward unilaterally with its proposals. He also said that garbage in Naples, which has been piling up on streets, will be cleared within four days. Last week, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi promised that ""within 10 days, the situation should be brought to normality."" He said the current landfill poses no risk to the residents.","The Italian government promised to halt a second landfill near Naples .

"Belgrade, Serbia (CNN) -- Clashes between Serbian police and protesters broke out Sunday in Belgrade after an ultranationalist party demonstrated against the arrest of genocide suspect Ratko Mladic. Nearly 20 people were injured in the violence -- seven police and 12 civilians -- according to police. They said they made more than 100 arrests. Mladic, wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in connection with the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, was captured Thursday after nearly 16 years in hiding. The Serbian Radical Party held its protest Sunday in front of Serbia's parliament building. Despite calls for calm from the event's organizers, demonstrators on the fringes of the rally threw rocks at police. Hundreds of officers, some in riot gear and others on horseback, moved in against the crowd. Some beat and kicked protesters. Police stayed on the streets as the demonstrators scattered. ""We are gathered here to peacefully protest the betrayal by (Serbian President) Boris Tadic and his bosses in Brussels,"" party leaders told the crowd before the clashes erupted. ""We have had enough economic humiliation by our enemies, who are destroying our country ... in every way."" At the protest -- which was attended by members of Mladic's family and thousands of others -- speakers demanded that Tadic step down and asked that elections be held immediately. Mladic's son, Darko, told the crowd that his father is sick. ""He needs medical treatment that he is not getting,"" the younger Mladic said. He described his father as ""a freedom fighter,"" and said he had ""defended his own nation, defended his people, which was his job."" The younger Mladic called on protesters to keep their demonstration peaceful. ""Tomorrow if I'm able to visit my father, I will tell him of this and he will cry again,"" he said. Mladic gave himself up without a fight, despite having two handguns, according to Rasim Ljajic, the government minister in charge of searching for fugitive suspected war criminals. Officials located Mladic in a village called Lazarevo, north of the Serbian capital, after culling information from his former comrades, those who supported him financially and his close family members, Ljajic said. It is not clear what source led investigators to the former military commander, accused of ordering the 1995 massacre of some 8,000 Muslims in the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica. His arrest clears a major hurdle that once stood between Serbia and its long-awaited entrance into the European Union, but the move could also usher in political backlash from the country's electorate, some of whom consider Mladic a hero. ""We're conscious of this danger,"" Ljajic told CNN Saturday. ""We know we did something that didn't bring us joy or applause from the public. But we also know that we took great responsibility and did something that the political elite of any country is supposed to do."" He called Mladic's capture ""a political investment,"" noting the government's desire to bring the war crimes suspect to justice ""even if citizens punish us in the next elections."" The massacre at Srebrenica, which sparked international outcry and preceded a NATO bombing campaign, is now remembered as the worst atrocity in Europe since World War II. Mladic allegedly presided over the five-day slaughter in July where Muslim men and boys were systematically executed in what was described at the U.N. war crimes tribunal as ""the triumph of evil."" Mladic's forces encircled the town, a U.N.-declared ""safe area"" where thousands of Bosnian Muslims had sought refuge, allegedly conducting wholesale slaughter and rape, despite the presence of a few hundred lightly armed Dutch U.N. peacekeepers charged with protecting the area's residents and its refugees. The former general is considered the last of the fugitive war criminal suspects in the region, following the capture of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who died in jail in 2006 during his trial at The Hague. At the rally Sunday, a defiant Darko Mladic told the crowd, ""We will never accept those who bombed us to write our history. For centuries we have been fighting for our own state, for our own country to give us security. We don't allow illiterate Westerners to write our history."" A medical team has determined that Mladic is healthy enough to be extradited to face a war crimes tribunal, a court spokeswoman in Belgrade said Friday. While the war crimes suspect suffers from several chronic conditions, the team said there are no immediate problems barring a move. This comes after five doctors examined Mladic Thursday night, according to the ex-general's lawyer, Milos Saljic. CNN's Ivan Watson contributed to this report.","NEW: Nearly 20 people are injured as protesters, police clash in Belgrade .

"OXFORD, England (CNN)  -- You might expect Oxford and Cambridge universities to ask prospective students to compare the works of Chaucer to Boccaccio or to explain the theory of relativity. Cambridge students may have to field questions in the application process that would baffle some observers. Instead, Oxford wants to know: ""Would you rather be a novel or a poem?"" Cambridge asks applicants: ""What would you do if you were a magpie?"" The idea, say administrators at the two ultra-prestigious schools in England, is to see how well prospective students can think, not just how much they know. ""What we're trying to do is move students out of their comfort zone,"" said Mike Nicholson, Oxford University admissions director. ""Many students will have a body of knowledge, and they may be expected to be trusted on that in the interview. What we want to do is take them beyond that point and get them to start thinking for themselves.""  See examples of the application questions » . In the United Kingdom, 90 percent of students are educated at state schools. But 53 percent of Oxford University's students come from state schools. That seems to indicate that wealthier students who can afford private schools have an advantage. Tutoring company Oxbridge Applications -- founded by Oxford graduates in 1999 -- says 68 percent of the 35,000 clients it has helped are state-funded students. It costs $300 for a day of mock interviews or $1,500 for a full weekend course. Oxbridge says 47 percent of its clients get into one of the elite colleges. The overall success rate for all applicants to the two schools -- commonly referred to as Oxbridge -- is 24 percent, the tutoring company says. ""At Oxbridge Applications, we have a network of 500 former tutors and former admissions tutors as well,"" said company founder James Uffindell.

"(CNN) -- Japan's parliament elected Yoshihiko Noda as the country's new prime minister Tuesday, making him the country's sixth new leader in five years. Noda won 308 out of 476 possible votes. The prime minister-elect will officially take over his new post after a ceremonial endorsement by Japan's emperor, which is expected to happen Wednesday. Ahead of the vote, former Prime Minister Naoto Kan officially submitted his resignation, as did his Cabinet, clearing the way for Noda's election. The Democratic Party of Japan, the country's ruling party, picked Noda as its new leader on Monday. He served as finance minister in Kan's cabinet. In his first speech as party leader, Noda called for party unity to tackle Japan's massive problems. ""Running Japan's government is like pushing a giant snowball up a snowy, slippery hill,"" he said Sunday. ""In times like this, we can't say, 'I don't like this person,' or 'I don't like that person.' The snowball will slide down."" On Friday, Prime Minister Kan announced that he would resign. His approval rating had tumbled following the devastating March earthquake and tsunami that triggered the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl as reactor cores overheated and spewed radioactive material into surrounding areas. An observer of Japan's revolving door of prime ministers said the country's political problems are weighing down one of the world's largest economies. Japanese politicians lack spine and public support, said Keith Henry of the Tokyo-based Asia Strategy, a government policy consulting firm. ""They've got to turn the ship around 180 degrees,"" Henry said. ""Until they see an iceberg, they're not going to do it."" Japan is facing a massive reconstruction program in the region devastated by the tsunami, an ongoing nuclear energy crisis and unaddressed problems in the economy. Noda, a fiscal conservative, has pledged to raise taxes and would like to privatize state assets. Last week, the credit rating agency Moody's downgraded Japan to an Aa3 rating from Aa2, blaming the country's huge deficit and frequent changes in administration that have prevented the government from implementing long-term economic policies. The CIA World Factbook puts the government debt at more than 200% of the GDP. CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this report.","NEW: Yoshihiko Noda comes to power after serving as finance minister .

"(CNN) -- Roars, growls and galloping hooves replaced music Tuesday on some of Mogadishu's radio stations in a protest of a ban on music imposed by Islamic extremists. Radio Shabelle, along with the stations Tusmo and Hornafrik, were responding to threats from Muslim militant groups that believe music is un-Islamic and want it prohibited. Mogadishu's 14 private radio stations stopped playing music Tuesday after Hizbul al-Islam, an Islamic extremist group, issued a 10-day ultimatum. The threat was backed by the main militant group al-Shabaab, which has been linked to al Qaeda. A statement from the National Union of Somali Journalists said several stations received calls, warning them that there would be consequences if they failed to comply with the ban within 10 days. But the three stations decided to broadcast the noises instead of music. Radio Shabelle announcers could be heard speaking on air, backed by the sounds of hooves, ocean waves, gunfire -- even the roars and growls of big cats. A radio station director, who could not be identified because of safety concerns, said the stations were unhappy about the ban but were forced to comply ""because of fear for our lives."" A Somali journalist, who also asked not to be identified, said there is widespread fear that this marks the beginning of a wider plot by extremists to silence independent media. He fears that female journalists may become the the next target. Hizbul al-Islam is one of many rebel groups operating in the country. The group has a complicated relationship with al-Shabaab; between them, the two groups control much of Mogadishu, and several radio stations are in neighborhoods under their control. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991. Islamic militant groups are fighting the government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. Journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report.","Mogadishu's 14 private radio stations stop playing music after threat from Islamic extremists .

"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- Rural villages held mass burials in northern Nigeria on Sunday, the Red Cross said, raising the possibility that six days of post-election violence have produced heavy casualties. There is no official death toll, but witnesses say hundreds have died. The government has provided few other details out of concern the violence could spiral. Shehu Sani, president of the Civil Rights Congress and longtime civil rights campaigner, told CNN there have been 500 burials. CNN could not independently confirm that number. The Civil Rights Congress, based in Kaduna, has in the past been known to ally itself with pro-northern political groups. The election of President Goodluck Jonathan, who is from the majority-Christian southern part of the country, sparked violence in the Muslim-dominated north last week. Concerns about ongoing violence led Nigerian election officials last week to delay subsequent gubernatorial elections in two states. Northern Muslims in some areas charged that the elections were rigged. Armed protesters in the region prowled the streets chanting the name of former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, the main opposition frontrunner. The last election four years ago was widely condemned for rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. While the Monday elections were marred by violence, reports of underage voting and other logistical problems, observers considered it an improvement. World leaders have urged the west African nation to probe allegations of ballot stuffing and unusually high turnout in some areas. After he was declared the victor, Jonathan warned perpetrators that persistent postelection violence could threaten the stability of the country. ""These acts of mayhem are sad reminders of the events which plunged our country into 30 months of an unfortunate civil war,"" Jonathan said last week. Jonathan was referring to a period of unrest in the 1960s that spawned a civil war in Nigeria. Muslims fearing reprisal attacks in Christian areas have fled to military barracks or neighboring states, the Nigerian Red Cross said. More than 40,000 people are displaced in the north, according to the aid group. Government officials have declined to release the number of fatalities or injuries over fears it could prompt revenge attacks. Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer and its most populous nation with 150 million people.","Civil Rights Congress president reports 500 burials .

"(CNN) -- Clashing priorities of jobs versus the environment are provoking questions about how far the nation should go to promote clean energy alternatives like solar and wind power. ""The actual debate happening in the United States is not hard to understand,"" wrote Matthew Yglesias on the Center for American Progress Action Fund's blog. ""We're having an argument about whether doubling-down on fossil fuel extraction or promoting efficiency and renewal energy would be better economic policy."" Each side has its experts. On one hand, economists at the University of Massachusetts believe large-scale investment in clean energy would create about three to four times as many jobs as the same money would in fossil fuel industry. On the other hand, expanding development of oil and natural gas resources would create 1.1 million jobs and $127 billion in government revenue by 2020, according to a new Wood Mackenzie study cited by the American Petroleum Institute. Those numbers could benefit the nation's budget and some of America's 14 million unemployed. Charles T. Drevna of the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association summed up his stance in an editorial for the Washington political web site, The Hill: ""It's time for America to develop an energy policy based on reality rather than ideology, grounded in what works rather than in hopes and dreams."" As political pressure rises inside the White House to slash unemployment, Courtney Hight -- a former member of the White House Council on Environmental Quality -- says she doubts now whether President Obama is ""seeing the opportunity for job growth within some of these clean energy standards and policies."" Defending Obama's environmental record, White House spokesman Clark Stevens pledged the administration ""will continue to take steps to meet the president's important goals of protecting the health of our families, increasing our nation's clean energy generation, reducing our reliance on foreign oil, and supporting American industries and innovation."" Criticism of Obama's clean energy initiatives resulted in the resignation of an administration energy official this week after solar panel maker Solyndra -- which got about a half billion dollars in federal loan guarantees -- went bankrupt. On Thursday, Obama defended government help for clean energy companies because they're ""part of that package of technologies of the future that have to be based here in the United States."" The president said Europe and China are outpacing the U.S. in clean energy because their governments are offering incentives. Many smaller U.S. clean energy companies, he said, find it difficult to find private investors. Environmental 'gut check time' for Obama? Nonetheless, environmentalists say they're worried about other clean energy issues. The State Department is poised to decide later this year whether to approve a permit for a Canadian company to build a new oil pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to Texas, which supporters say will increase jobs and energy independence. In a move last month that angered much of the environmental community, Obama decided to delay implementing EPA rules limiting smog from vehicles, power plants and factories. Business leaders applauded the decision, saying the rules would have killed jobs. Poll: Alternative energy trumps fossil fuel . So, what do Americans think? Most (63%) say developing alternative energy sources should be a higher priority than expanding fossil fuel exploration and production, according to a Pew Research Center study. For so-called ""main street Republicans,"" that number is 66%. Less than half (48%) of all Americans believe global warming is a proven fact caused mostly by cars, power plants and factories, according to a CNN/ORC poll. For self-described independent voters, that number is 38%. ""There's really no evidence at all that most people see a conflict between environmental protection and job creation in fact in many ways they see them going hand in hand,"" said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. As for Election Day politics, Obama is unlikely to lose many votes over his environmental record, Mellman says, because most environmentalists will find themselves with few acceptable alternatives. Obama's 2012 GOP rivals include candidates who doubt that climate change is real and who favor eliminating the EPA. What Obama does risk is voter turnout and enthusiasm -- key factors that helped him win in 2008. To what extent will clean energy advocates try to convince their friends, relatives, co-workers and colleagues at the water cooler or at cocktail parties or barbeques that they ought to vote for the president? ""I think many of them will,"" says Mellman. ""The question is, how many of them will? And I think that is influenced to some extent by the administration's policy decisions.""","Refiners urge energy policy ""based on reality""

"(WIRED) -- And on the 61st day, the TouchPad rose again. HP has plans to produce another round of its TouchPad tablets before the year is out, despite its earlier decision to discontinue its mobile hardware products. ""Despite announcing an end to manufacturing webOS hardware, we have decided to produce one last run of TouchPads to meet unfulfilled demand,"" HP spokesman Mark Budgell wrote in a company blog post. ""As we know more about how, when and where TouchPads will be available, we will communicate that here and through e-mail to those who requested notification."" Budgell says it will be a few weeks before devices from the additional run will be available for purchase. The blog post signals further confusion from a company in upheaval. Two weeks ago, HP announced suddenly it would end production on all of its mobile hardware, including the soon-to-be-released Pre 3 and Veer smartphones. The decision also included the company's iPad competitor, the TouchPad, killed off a mere 49 days after its debut in July. Circulating rumors suggested third-party retailers were sitting on hundreds of thousands of unsold units. HP followed its announcement by slashing prices on remaining TouchPad inventory, reducing the price of the 16-gigabyte TouchPad to $100, and the 32-gig version to $150. Since the blowout sale prices, however, the company hasn't been able to keep any TouchPads in stock. Retailers have been bombarded by customer requests for the cheapened devices, and dozens of retailers have reported completely selling out. Which is most likely the reason behind HP's decision to once again beef up its inventory for a last TouchPad blast. ""Tablet computing is a segment of the market that's relevant, absolutely,"" HP personal systems group exec Todd Bradley told Reuters in an interview. The company continues to explore licensing options for, webOS -- its proprietary operating system -- according to Bradley. There's no guarantee, however, that HP will continue to sell the last round of tablets at a $100 rate. Hardware teardown website iSupply speculates that, in terms of components alone, a 16-GB TouchPad costs HP approximately $300 to build. That's a $200 bath HP is taking on each individual unit sold, not including the cost of labor, shipping and associated expenses. HP did not immediately respond to a phone request for comment. While the resurgence in TouchPad interest may be a promising sign for HP, the company's flip-flopping decision process isn't serving its public image. ""The only thing I know for sure that's going on at HP is that they have completely lost control of their message,"" Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps said by e-mail to Wired.com. Epps continued, saying HP was ""sabotaging their brand with the mixed messages."" As of today, the TouchPad is now the No. 2 best-selling tablet after the iPad, according to FastCompany. Ironically, that's the exact position HP was vying for. Unfortunately for the company, it took bargain-bin pricing and the threat of extinction to get there.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Thousands of Egyptian workers went on strike Thursday to demand better compensation and transparency in executive salaries, authorities said. The walkout included employees in the petroleum, railway and telecommunication industries, as protests demanding the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak dragged into their 17th day. On Wednesday, tens of thousands of protesters jammed Cairo's Tahrir Square, with so many spilling into a nearby compound of government buildings that government officials moved parliament to another site. The government again sought to portray the imminent threat of chaos if the octogenarian president, Hosni Mubarak, were to end his 30 years of autocratic rule by stepping down right away. Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit told PBS' ""NewsHour"" Wednesday that the military might have to intervene if that were to occur. ""Do we want the armed forces to assume the responsibility of stabilizing the nation through imposing martial law, and the army in the streets?"" Aboul Gheit asked rhetorically. ""For the army to rule, to step in, to put its friends on the scene, that would be a very dangerous possibility."" He urged the protesters to adopt ""some rationality"" and said the self-proclaimed Council of the Wise, a group of prominent Egyptians from various walks of life, should determine a course of action. Aboul Gheit told PBS that Mubarak's interest was to protect the stability of the most populous nation in the Arab world. That's why he will not accede to the protesters' demands that he relinquish power immediately, he said. ""He thinks that it would entail chaos and it would entail violence and it would entail also opportunities for those who would wish to act in a manner to threaten the state, the stability of the country and society,"" Aboul Gheit said. Human Rights Watch has put the death toll at more than 300 since the January 25 rally that ignited the movement. ""Instead of running scared, the regime is fighting back with both words and violence to quash its opponents, portraying the opposition as a foreign-backed, un-Egyptian group of conspirators,"" Human Rights Watch said Wednesday on its website. ""Sadly, its propaganda campaign appears to be as crude as its actual physical crackdown has been."" The protests were largely peaceful Wednesday, with demonstrators in one rally composed solely of children who chanted anti-Mubarak slogans. ""We want the whole regime to end because they are not making our lives any easier,"" said 11-year-old Yousef Saeed. Some of their older relatives said they had brought the children to the square to witness history unfolding. ""It is the birth of freedom,"" said Saeed's uncle, Mohammed Mostafa. ""Witnessing this event will engrave in them love of this nation, loyalty, freedom and respecting change. I want them to be free."" But the prospect of freedom was competing with the cost of living as a motivator for some Egyptians, 20% of whom live in poverty. ""Whether Hosni stays or Hosni goes, what's important is that the youth get jobs,"" said Amgad, a mother of three living an hour outside Cairo, in the rural town of Fayoum on the Nile Delta. Her work at a doctor's office earns her $30 per month -- not enough to pay the electricity bill. Amgad said her husband, a day laborer, has been unable to find work since the demonstrations began on January 25. ""Our situation is horrible, to be honest,"" she said as she showed CNN the bedroom where she, her husband and their three daughters sleep. ""I can hardly feed them."" On the streets of Cairo, the people showed no signs of relenting. They chanted, ""Mubarak is a thief."" The embattled president, meanwhile, went about business as usual Wednesday, meeting with his foreign minister and Russia's deputy foreign minister, state-run television showed. The unrest extended beyond Cairo. Two people were killed and others were wounded in clashes with police in southern Egypt, state TV reported. A journalist said the hostilities stemmed from complaints about a member of the police force in Kharga. In the northern town of Port Said, protesters attacked the governor's building over a land and housing dispute, state TV said. The protesters were galvanized by the tears and words of an activist who was seized by security forces and held for 10 days before he was released Monday. ""If you are true Egyptians, if you are heroic Egyptians, it's time to step down,"" Wael Ghonim told CNN Wednesday in a message directed to the ruling elite. The 30-year-old Egyptian father of two administered the Facebook page that is widely credited with calling the first protest. Ghonim, on leave from his job at Google in Dubai, said he was prepared to die for the cause. ""Kidnap me, kidnap all my colleagues!"" Wael Ghonim said in comments that challenged Vice President Omar Suleiman to try to undo his efforts and those of his supporters. ""Put us in jail! Kill us! Do whatever you want to do. We are getting back our country. You guys have been ruining this country for 30 years. Enough! Enough! Enough!"" Mubarak's regime said Tuesday that it had discussed a number of reforms with leaders of various opposition groups and appointed a panel to look into amending the constitution. But its insistence that Mubarak's immediate exit was a recipe for chaos elicited impatience from the Obama administration. Washington is calling on its African ally to expand negotiations with opposition groups, lift the 30-year state of emergency and make constitutional changes to bring about democratic elections. But White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs expressed impatience Wednesday with the pace of progress on those matters. ""I think it is clear that what the government has thus far put forward has yet to meet a minimum threshold for the people of Egypt,"" he told reporters. A short White House statement on U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's telephone conversation with Vice President Omar Suleiman used the word ""immediate"" or ""immediately"" four times. Biden ""urged that the transition produce immediate, irreversible progress that responds to the aspirations of the Egyptian people."" The statement also hinted the White House harbors doubts as to whether the Egyptian government is seriously committed to reforms, referring to the regime's statements as ""what the government is saying it is prepared to accept."" Meanwhile, an Arab diplomat said that Saudi Arabia would consider matching the more than $1.5 billion in military aid that the United States provides each year to Egypt if Washington were to cut it. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Nic Robertson, Saad Abedine, Amir Ahmed, Caroline Faraj and Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","NEW: Thousands of Egyptian workers strike demanding more money and transparency .

"(CNN) -- With Rick Perry instantly assuming the top spot among candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, it is no surprise that nearly every other man and woman on stage with him at last night's debate took aim. Citing his executive order mandating inoculations against a sexually transmitted disease that can lead to cervical cancer, Michele Bachmann expressed outrage that Perry, she said, had ""forced"" ""government injections"" of 12-year-old girls. Jon Huntsman archly claimed that Perry's skepticism about a border fence was nothing short of ""treasonous."" Ron Paul accused Perry, his fellow Texan, of raising his taxes, increasing the state's debt, and expanding the state government's workforce. The most extended critique of Perry, though, came right out of the gate, from Mitt Romney. Romney accused Perry of trying to scare senior citizens and ruin the Republican Party by calling Social Security unconstitutional, a Ponzi scheme and a failure. Of all the jabs at Perry last night, these mattered most. Social Security stands out as the most important topic generating substantive disagreement among the top Republican contenders. In a debate that vacillated between broad principles of national defense and the rule of law on the one hand, and small government initiatives conducted at the state and federal levels on the other, this particular exchange featured disagreements about one of the oldest, largest and most popular entitlement programs in the country. Just as important, the exchange between Romney and Perry over Social Security underscored their competing views about the meaning of limited government. In their first sentences about entitlement reform, these candidates stand together for reducing waste, slashing fraud and trimming the federal government. It is in the second and third sentences, though, that the differences become clearer. For Perry, power should devolve to the states, and the federal government should maintain operations over only those policy domains for which it has a clear constitutional responsibility. As he noted in his opening remarks last night, the very reason he wants to be president is to make Washington less consequential in the lives of Americans. When asked later about Social Security, Perry went out of his way to offer assurances that the benefits for current and near retirees would remain intact -- ""slam dunk, guaranteed,"" as he put it. But he persisted in characterizing the issue of Social Security reform primarily as one of increased state control. ""The issue is, are there ways to move the states into Social Security, for state employees or for retirees."" Romney, by contrast, has proposed a variety of measures that in his view will shore up Social Security without either increasing taxes or reducing the federal government's involvement. Though he didn't lay them out Monday night, the components of Romney's plan include the raising of the retirement age, the creation of personal retirement investment accounts for younger workers, and the indexing of benefits to prices rather than wages, as is currently done. Between the two at last night's debate, Perry was the clear audience favorite. But should Perry win the nomination, we can expect President Obama to pick up right where Romney left off on Social Security. On the other hand, if Romney can survive a Republican primary season in which the median voter is vastly more conservative than in the general election, then the terms of next year's debate about Social Security will be vastly more conventional -- to the great relief of moderates and frustration of the tea party sponsors of last night's debate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Howell.","William Howell says front-runner Rick Perry was target for GOP candidates at debate .
He says Mitt Romney turned focus to Social Security and Perry's Ponzi scheme comment .

"Middlebury, Vermont (CNN) -- I've spent most of my adult life -- over three decades -- in Vermont. To some degree, it has been like Eden itself, a shelter from the American storm: leafy mountains, red barns and white clapboard houses, quiet dirt roads with covered bridges, village greens, lots of fresh organic food, ex-hippies galore and the open waters of Lake Champlain, which treads a narrow path over 100 miles between the Green Mountains to the east and the Adirondacks to the west. The county where I live -- Addison -- has refused to let in the big box stores, such as Walmart and Costco We prefer our country stores, where you can buy anything from maple syrup and cheddar cheese to nails or diapers for a baby. Bernie Sanders, a socialist, is one of our two senators. We were the first state to allow civil unions. Soon, a single-payer health care system will be put into place -- a bold experiment that might show the rest of the country how to do such a thing. Rumor has it that the number of cows in Vermont exceeds the number of people. And we don't get many hurricanes or tropical storms up here. They haven't been words in our local vocabulary. The problems with weather usually come in the dead of winter, and they involve large quantities of ice, which gather on the birch trees and bend them to the ground. I sometimes have to head to the nearby college where I teach -- a three-mile journey -- on cross-country skis. And that's a satisfying mode of transportation. But as everyone knows by now, we just got hit by Irene, with devastating results -- especially on the eastern side of the Green Mountains. More than 200 roads were closed at one point, with stretches washed out by flooding streams. The lovely town of Brattleboro, once the home of Rudyard Kipling, was deep under water, and people are still trying desperately to clear away the mess. One famous old covered bridge is gone -- a pity, as we have the highest concentration of covered bridges anywhere in the United States, and it's always a shame to lose one. Even where I live, on an old farm outside of Middlebury, on the western side of the state, we had winds that tore up trees by the roots. Power lines were down. Branches still litter the ground around my 150-year-old house, and several shingles were blown from the roof. The Otter Creek, which runs nearby, is dangerously swollen still, reminding me of that great line in T.S. Eliot: ""The river is a strong brown god."" I've never seen the river this color before: deep brown. My youngest son, a feisty teenager, just asked me if he could swim in the creek. I told him about the people swept downriver only two days ago, one of them still missing. What is weird is how bright and calm the weather has become, leaving behind so much destruction, stirring up stories that will probably linger by the fireside for decades. The sky is suddenly clear as gin. There is no wind, just the aftermath of nature's wrath. I feel a sense of awe, thinking of Irene, how it moved through us on a dark Sunday, churning through the night, turning the field beside my house into a pond. Now it has left us -- thank God -- having taken its nastiness elsewhere. It has left Vermonters to pick up the pieces one by one, like Adam and Eve after the Fall, having to deal with the fact that a snake came through the garden. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jay Parini.","Jay Parini: Vermont a haven of mountains, red barns, clapboard houses, covered bridges .

"Berlin (CNN) -- Germany's top constitutional court Wednesday rejected a lawsuit charging that the bailout of Greece was illegal, but it said lawmakers would have to approve any future bailouts. The decision halts a move that could have thrown doubt on future efforts to prop up the euro and gives embattled Chancellor Angela Merkel breathing space. Opponents of the bailout argued that it violated the powers of Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, but the Federal Constitutional Court rejected that argument. Berlin has been pouring money into the economies of Greece and Ireland in an effort to save the common European currency they all share, the euro -- a move that has angered many Germans and badly hurt Merkel's popularity. The court ruling is a partial victory for Merkel, but it limits the future ability of a German government to pump cash into weaker economies. The ruling means in the future the chancellor will not be able to move quickly to prop up problem euro zone economies. Instead, she will have to present a plan to a fractious Bundestag. Lawmakers ""must remain in control of fundamental budget policy decisions,"" the court said in ordering ""mandatory approval"" by parliament of bailouts in the future. CNN's Sarah Sultoon and Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","The Federal Constitutional Court throws out a legal challenge to the bailout .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Authorities arrested a 26-year-old woman in camouflaged fatigues Thursday, accusing her of peering into the windows of Britney Spears' house, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.

Security personnel found Miranda Tozier-Robbins looking through the windows of the singer's home in Calabasas, California, the department said in a written statement. Tozier-Robbins also had a backpack and video equipment, the statement said. Security personnel asked her to leave, but she ""balked,"" the statement said. They then physically escorted her off the property. A policeman arrived later to arrest her. She was booked on charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct, the statement said. Bail was set at $5,000, but Tozier-Robbins was released on a citation to appear in court on June 16. The whereabouts of Spears, 27, during the incident were not immediately known.","Authorities say woman in camouflaged fatigues was peering into the windows .

"(CNN) -- Before the start of Libya's civil war, you could count the number of newspapers in the country on one hand and all were heavily controlled by the government. Now there are 120 independent newspapers in the city of Benghazi alone, according to local journalists. These newspapers are mostly run and staffed by engineers, doctors and students, said International Media Support, one of several foreign organizations that is helping train journalists in Libya. One, called ""Sowt"" -- ""Voice"" in Arabic -- was launched by five medical, engineering and economics students in their early 20s in February. It began as an eight-page magazine, now increased to 12 pages and selling 3,000 copies a week across eastern Libya and beyond. One of the editors, Mohamed Shembesh, a 22-year-old civil engineering student, said: ""At the time there was no email or mail service, so we put a physical box in Freedom Square and made a sign telling people they could post contributions to our newspaper. ""Within 10 days we had tens of articles, which we edited and printed in the first issue of the paper,"" he added. The magazine had no source of income, so the editors put charity boxes on streets for contributions. In 10 days they had raised enough money to pay for the first print run of 2,000 copies. The eight-page magazine included four color pages. Many other people eager to make their voices heard when Moammar Gadhafi lost control of the city in February set up their own newspapers. While it may seem surprising for newspapers to be flourishing in an internet age, Libya's uprising was not conducted as much through social media sites as those in Egypt and other Arab countries. Internet penetration in Libya is just 5.5%, according to the ITU, an agency of the United Nations that focuses on the internet and communications. In addition there were frequent internet blackouts after the uprising began in February. The cause of the blackouts was not clear, but a regular connection was not restored until August. Abdelsalam Doma, local coordinator for International Media Support in Benghazi, said: ""Before the uprising we had five newspapers in the whole country and they were just mouthpieces of the government. ""All they had been doing was supporting Gadhafi's word, glorifying his personality and trying to eliminate anything else. ""After the revolution we had all these new newspapers taking the opposite view -- but it is not totally professional. ""In the beginning all they did was attack Gadhafi. It was like someone writing on his Facebook page. The articles had no structure, they were not informative, they took one side but never both sides, there were never any quotes."" Doma, a 25-year-old engineering student, has himself been on a steep learning curve since the start of this year. He started to work as an interpreter when foreign journalists arrived in Benghazi and decided to train as a journalist on the job. ""I started going out with the crews and tried to learn their craft,"" said Doma. ""The foreign journalists have been teaching me. They write a piece, and I write a piece and they tell me what's wrong with mine."" Doma began submitting articles to local newspapers and made a radio documentary. He said: ""I submitted my first article to a local newspaper about military camps. I was really embarrassed to show it to anyone, but the editor was totally in love with it and asked me to keep giving them articles. ""I made a radio documentary called 'The Night Visitor' about Gadhafi's secret police for a local station. ""Nobody here really knows what a radio documentary is, but a lot of people loved it. Here in Libya there's a social stigma, we don't talk about things we fear, but I managed to get people to talk."" Torben Brandt, a media expert for International Media Support, a Danish organization, made his first mission to Benghazi in June, and set up a permanent office there in August. He recruited Doma as a local media coordinator to monitor the state of the media and write regular reports about the content and quality of radio stations, newspapers and the growing number of satellite television channels. The organization has run workshops and courses for local journalists on conflict reporting. It has also held a two-day workshop for 100 journalists all over the eastern part of Libya in the city of Derna. The organization plans to move into Tripoli as soon as it is safe to do so. ""In Benghazi, 80% of people starting up newspapers are engineers because it's the center for the oil refineries,"" said Brandt. ""It's amazing to see how hungry people are for knowledge."" He knows that not all the newspapers can survive, but hopes those that do will become more professional. Doma said that is already starting to happen. ""I'm quite optimistic,"" he said. ""I read newspapers and nowadays people are providing analysis and holding the politicians to account. ""Some of the new government are still trying to control the media, but the journalists are resisting that. Some journalists now have contracts with foreign television channels from Qatar, Lebanon or United Arab Emirates."" Doma added: ""The biggest obstacle to the local media is financial sustainability. People are just paying to produce the newspapers out of their own pockets and the market is too loaded with 120 newspapers. People don't know what to buy. ""Most of the newspapers will die out and a few good ones will survive."" The content of ""Sowt"" too has changed in the eight months since it launched. Shembesh said: ""At the beginning we had six pages of reader articles, and we simply edited them for language. ""Now we only have two or three pages from readers and we have a couple of professional writers. We cover social and political events, social problems, interviews with military and rebel leaders. ""We now get contributions through Facebook and we will be publishing on the internet so people abroad can read us."" Shembesh hopes that ""Sowt"" will be one of the newspapers that can become sustainable. ""We have started to carry advertising,"" he said. ""We know it's a hard time now and we have to focus and work hard to win the crowds over. It helps that we got in early and built up a base of readers very fast."" Shembesh still has another year of his studies and plans to become a civil engineer, but believes he can continue to publish ""Sowt"" alongside his other work. Doma is still undecided about becoming a full-time journalist and is juggling several career options and responsibilities. In addition to work for International Media Support, Doma is volunteering in a blood bank, helping out at a local hospital, and acting as a guide and facilitator for a rehabilitation center for fighters with physical, mental and psychological scars from the war. ""And I'm still a student preparing for my final project,"" he said. ""I'm busy doing all kinds of things and I'm really shattered.""","120 newspapers have launched in Benghazi since February .

"(CNN) -- We were told to be awake and ready to move at 4 a.m. The National Transitional Council fighters we were with were planning to launch a dawn assault on the Saharan city of Sabha. All predictions indicated it would be one of the bloodiest battles yet. NTC officials said loyalist forces would use weaponry they hadn't used before. They didn't go into detail but it sounded ominous. Western intelligence sources told CNN the fighters in Sabha still loyal to Libya's ousted leader, Moammar Gadhafi, had heavy artillery and would likely use it. Sabha was frequently described as loyalist and pro-Gadhafi. The night before the assault there was an edgy, giddy atmosphere on the air base where we were camped along with the force that had traveled more than 600 kilometers from Tripoli. The fighters were shooting more ordinance than usual into the air, and they flocked to our campsite behind the officer's club, eager to chat, and even more eager to use our satellite telephones. One after another, they shyly asked if they could make a call. Each one had a special reason for calling -- reassuring parents, a brother getting married, a sick baby daughter, an angry girlfriend. Many talked about their expectations for the coming day. It would be a bloodbath. It would be easy. ""Maybe I'll die tomorrow, I'm ready for it,"" declared Mohamed, a toothy young man from Sabha who had spent several years in Manchester, England, where he had picked up the local accent. ""But if I don't die, you are all welcome to stay at my house in Sabha."" Mohamed, like many of the fighters from Sabha, insisted most of the people in his home town sided with the revolution. But there was concern about possible resistance from members of Gadhafi's Gadadfa tribe. Despite a month of impressive advances by the anti-Gadhafi forces, it's clear not everyone has gone over to the revolution. That afternoon we had gone into the nearby town of Birak Al-Shati. I had seen scattered green flags flying over some of the houses earlier in the day. Unlike other towns we had been through, few people in Birak Al-Shati waved or flashed the v-for-victory sign. They just glared at us. As CNN's Cairo camerawoman Mary Rogers was taking pictures of the town, a car drove up to me in the town's main roundabout. The driver, a young man in his early 20s, shouted to me: ""Allah, Moammar, Libya, wa bas"" -- (God, Moammar and Libya only) -- the standard slogan of Gadhafi supporters, then began to pull away. ""Wait,"" I told him. ""Talk to me. We've been speaking to pro-revolutionaries (Gadhafi opponents), but not your type."" In the passenger seat sat a boy, maybe 10-years old, who repeated the slogan several times, pumping his fists in the air. ""No camera,"" the driver told me. ""Everyone around here feels the same, but we're afraid to say anything with all these thuwar (revolutionaries) around."" He then drove away. I crossed the street to a cigarette shop where there were about half a dozen people inside. The shopkeeper, a chunky man in his early 20s wearing a jalabiya, echoed the same sentiments. As did another man, who identified himself as Jamal, a businessman. ""If there were free elections here, and we had a choice between voting for Gadhafi or the new regime in Tripoli, 90% would vote for Gadhafi,"" he said. ""And none of this would have happened if NATO wasn't bombing Libya."" A young fighter with an AK-47 walked into the shop to buy cigarettes. Surprisingly, the discussion over the new Libya carried on. ""We don't want these guys here,"" he said, pointing to the fighter. ""They are going around, breaking into houses, stealing people's possessions. That's what they did to my cousin's house."" ""If that's what happened, your cousin deserved it,"" replied the fighter, who said he was from Tripoli. By now a fairly large crowd had gathered to listen and take part in the conversation. Suddenly a man pushed through the crowd and grabbed Jamal by the shoulder. ""Get out of here and stop talking like that!"" he shouted, clearly angry, pushing Jamal out of the shop. ""Are you an idiot?"" It was getting tense, so I stepped out of the shop. ""Don't worry,"" the shopkeeper told me. ""It's his brother. He just doesn't want trouble."" As I stepped to the side of the road, anther car drove up, this time with three occupants wearing baseball caps emblazoned with the pro-Gadhafi Libyan flag. When I peered into the car, I saw that the driver had a bottle of clear brown liquid in his lap. In the back seat a teenager with a machine gun in his lap was rolling a joint. ""We are the revolutionaries of Birak Al-Shati,"" the driver said, a big grin on his face. ""What's that?"" I asked him, pointing to the bottle. ""Whiskey!"" he proudly declared. ""You want some?"" I declined. I knew we had a big day ahead of us. Although we had been told to be awake and ready to go at 4 a.m., I woke up two hours later. Having spent much of the last seven months in Libya, I knew these guys were not strong on punctuality. We ended up leaving the base around 10 a.m. behind the ambulances, and met the main body of fighters heading to Sabha. An hour later, after an uneventful drive though the desert, we arrived on the outskirts of Sabha. I could see some smoke on the horizon, but could hear no gunfire. Small clumps of people by the side of the road were cheering and waving. Driving further into the city, the crowds grew larger. There was gunfire but it was all in the air, the ubiquitous celebratory gunfire. Up above, a man tore down the green flag from the city's main water tower and sent it fluttering to the ground. We were the only journalists in Sabha. Wherever we stopped cheering crowds mobbed us. Most asked if we were with Al-Jazeera. The huge, bloody battle for Sabha wasn't to be. No one was disappointed. ""We are now in Sabha and we were not expecting this,"" one of the doctors shouted. ""This is the best moment of my life."" There was fighting, of course, in the Sabha neighborhood of Manshiya. We watched as cars and ambulances rushed to the emergency ward in the city's main hospital. It was pandemonium. The medical team we had traveled with arrived at the hospital just minutes before the first casualties began to arrive. Along with the wounded, came the dead, more than 10 in the two hours we were at the hospital. Suddenly the bravado of the young fighters was gone when they drove up with the bodies of their dead comrades. They cried like children in one another's arms. Others just sat on the curb and wept quietly as their friends tried to console them. For many it was their first real encounter with combat. Others vowed to carry on the fight and avenge their friends. By contrast, the loyalist dead were received without fanfare. A pickup drove up to the main entrance to the hospital with two bodies covered with a light blue cloth splayed in the back. On the side of the pickup truck the fighters were smug with satisfaction. ""We killed the rats,"" one told me, pointing his gun toward the bodies at his feet. That night we slept next to a NATO-bombed VIP guesthouse at the airport, which had become the main base for the hundreds of NTC fighters who had taken part in the conquest of Sabha. The next morning we ventured out into the city. Mid-morning, and there were few people out on the streets, and still plenty of green flags. In front of the administration building at Sabha University, a still intact portrait of Gadhafi featuring the odd slogan, ""High you are above every ceiling, proud you are above every height."" Within minutes, a group of gunmen showed up, backing their pickup up to the poster, which they proceeded to rip apart with a knife. We then went to Al-Gurda, a tight neighborhood composed of families from all over Libya. People look after their neighbors, keep an eye out for strangers, and never, as residents told us, dabbled in the dangerous business of politics. The streets are dusty, the asphalt crumbling. The roads in this corner of Sabha were paved once, in the 1980s and never since, they told me. We sat down with the neighborhood men, each one cradling his machine gun. They explained that the last straw was when armed strangers -- they called mercenaries -- arrived on their street. ""We shot one, he died right over there,"" one of the men told me, pointing to the corner. He then showed me the video of the dying man he had shot on his cell phone. Dentist Abdel Majid Tijani said he had learned to use a gun in school. Gadhafi ""forced us to train on this,"" he said, patting his AK-47 assault rifle. ""He intended to change us to fighters to fight for his dreams in Africa and in other places. But God decided the reverse. He forced us to train on this thing to fight him."" Afterwards, we went to the nearby home of Khadija Tahir, a strong-willed English teacher at Sabha University. I asked her why Sabha, despite its reputation for being a Gadhafi stronghold, had fallen to the opposition in less than 24 hours. People ""realized that this man is not right. So many people came 180 degrees from being pro-Gadhafi to protesting Gadhafi,"" she told me. ""The other reason is that people got fed up -- lack of electricity, lack of water. So they wanted to get out of this situation. I am one of them."" There are still a few parts of Sabha where the ""thuwar,"" the revolutionaries, are hesitant to tread. But most parts of Sabha were like Al-Gurda. They'd simply had enough.","CNN's Ben Wedeman met the NTC fighters heading to Sabha .

"BIHAR, India (CNN) -- Extreme flooding has displaced millions of people on either side of the India-Nepal border after a river burst its banks, authorities said Thursday. People walk along a flooded railway track in Madhepura, India. In India's northeastern state of Bihar, almost 3 million people have been affected by the worst flooding in decades, and more than 100,000 people have been displaced in southeastern Nepal after the breach last week. The Saptakoshi River in Nepal is the same one that flooded neighboring India's poorest state, although the Indians call it the Kosi River. In some stretches, it is three miles (5 km) wide. Nepalese Home Secretary Umesh Mainali said that of those displaced in Nepal, ""more than 40,000 are living in government run camps."" Many victims are taking shelter in schools and colleges. Residents were forced from their homes after an aged and damaged embankment on the river burst August 18 in Nepal. Water flowed so forcefully through the breach that it actually changed the course of the river, which now flows 75 miles (120 km) east of its original bed. Bad weather and washed-out roads -- including the region's main highway -- have hampered relief efforts, officials said. The heavy rains have also made repairing the breach difficult. Nepalese and Indian teams have been working separately to try to stem the flow of water, Mainali said. State-run Nepal Television reported Thursday that many Indian citizens are coming through the open border because of the availability of food and shelter. The Indian government said that about 50 people have been killed, revising the figure down from 87 deaths reported Wednesday. The Disaster Management Department in Bihar released a death toll of 12, an increase of two since Wednesday. There was no immediate explanation for the variance in numbers. ""Flood is understatement,"" Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said. ""It's a disaster.""  Watch how India is struggling to cope » . Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, head of the ruling Congress party, flew over the four most flooded districts of Supaul, Saharsa, Araria and Madhepura, the news agency Press Trust of India reported. Singh announced immediate aid of about $238 million and promised the delivery of 125,000 metric tons of grain to the region. CNN's Sara Sidner traveled by boat Thursday with some of the soldiers and called the mayhem ""enormous."" ""We have seen panic, we've seen sorrow, we've seen despair. ... Hundreds of people screamed to us from rooftops as we floated by."" The soldiers were trying to pull people to safety, Sidner said, ""but there are simply too many people to rescue and too few boats to do so. People were literally screaming, waving, running with suitcases in water trying to get to us."" The Home Ministry said that nearly 153,000 people have been evacuated, and 31,000 are staying in 155 relief camps. About 228,000 homes have been damaged. There was no number provided Thursday on the number of homes destroyed. Madhepura district, where 1 million people live in 378 villages, is the worst hit, officials said. There are 900,000 residents in Supaul and 250,000 in Araria. More than 2.7 million people in 1,600 villages have been affected, thousands of them marooned on thin strips of dry land peeking out from cloudy brown waters of the swollen Kosi River. With heavy rainfall forecast for the next two days, officials worry that the situation will get much worse. Indians call it the River of Sorrow. Every summer, from June to September, the relentless monsoon rains cause the Kosi to overflow, bringing untold misery. This year, though, it swallowed entire villages in areas unaccustomed to water that deep -- with the worst flooding in 80 years in the landlocked rural state. Government agencies, nongovernmental organizations and good Samaritans have begun doing what they can: using motorboats to rescue stranded residents, for example, or dropping thousands of food packets from the sky.  Watch as boats deliver supplies, provide rescue » . The scale of the disaster is overwhelming. About half the state is under water, a submerged area the size of the entire U.S. state of Delaware. One man told CNN's partner network IBN that he scrounged together 2,000 rupees ($45) to pay a boatman to ferry his family to safety. ""We agreed on 2,000 (rupees), and he upped it to 2,700 ($61) just like that,"" he said. ""What can I do? I paid him."" But many others stayed put. Nine hundred million Indians survive on less than 85 rupees ($2) a day, a British government study found this year. Many of them live in Bihar, the poorest and considered to be the most lawless state in India. They have nowhere to go. ""It's raining here. People are on rooftops begging to be rescued,"" CNN's Bharati Naik said while touring some of the affected area Thursday. There are ""not enough boats. Villagers are crying and extremely frustrated."" Officials worry that in coming days, stranded residents may start drinking the contaminated river water, raising fears of an epidemic. ""There is no water to drink,"" one man told CNN-IBN. ""We are hungry. We're thirsty. We have to drink something."" Roshan Kumar, a teacher from one of the flooded villages, arrived at an army base to seek help for his neighbors. About 30,000 people are stranded, he said. The army said it's doing all it can. Meanwhile, the water level in many areas continues to rise even as hope, among many, is beginning to falter.","India and Nepal battle worst flooding for decades .

"(CNN) -- As the rest of the world waits to see if Japan can avert a nuclear catastrophe, a small band of experts is putting their lives at risk to prevent the disaster. Thousands of people living near the troubled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have been evacuated from their homes because of the risk of radiation leaks from reactors damaged by last week's devastating earthquake and tsunami. But while most hurry in the opposite direction, about 180 plant workers are staying put -- despite the fact that doing so could result in serious illness or even death -- to battle the meltdown threat. ""The workers at this site are involved in a heroic endeavor,"" former U.S. Department of Energy Official Robert Alvarez told CNN. ""There is at least fragmentary evidence that in some places on this site there are life-threatening doses of radiation. I think they are doing enormously heroic work."" The workers left at the site are said to be highly trained and experienced nuclear operators, engineers and safety staff with highly specialized knowledge. Richard Wakeford, of the Dalton Nuclear Institute at the University of Manchester, said for many of them -- despite the highly unusual and potentially dangerous circumstances -- it will be just another day at the office. ""They see it as doing their job,"" he said. ""The Japanese in particular are dedicated to duty, and they will see it as their duty to do what they are doing."" According to the World Health Organisation, the average person is exposed to about 3.0 millisieverts (mSv) a year of radiation, from naturally-occurring, medical and other sources. But monitoring at the Fukushima Daiichi site has recorded radiation as high as 400 millisieverts an hour -- a level known to be a risk to human health. Exposure to 1,000 millisieverts (1 Sievert) of radiation can cause radiation sickness. ""It is difficult to get a clear picture, but there have been spikes in radiation to enormous doses, high enough to risk radiation sickness,"" said Dr. Ira Helfand, a member of the organization Physicians for Social Responsibility. ""These people are undergoing total body radiation, which can cause leukaemia and lymphoma as well as thyroid cancer later on,"" he said. Experts say lessons have been learned since the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl 25 years ago, when an unauthorized experiment saw radioactive dust spread across swathes of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and western Europe. Then, emergency workers were sent in with little or no protection to deal with the fallout. ""It was pandemonium; there was no monitoring, no idea of the risks,"" Wakeford said. By contrast, he said, staff at Fukushima Daiichi will be kitted out in protective clothing and breathing apparatus, they will be closely monitored and working in teams to limit their exposure to radiation. ""If I were them I would be more worried about the hydrogen explosions, which have been huge -- enough to blow the roofs off two buildings -- and which I think are a much bigger risk to the workers on the ground,"" he told CNN. But Dr. Helfand said reports suggested that the operation was not going 100% to plan, describing it as ""something out of an adventure movie."" ""We are in totally uncharted waters, people are ad-libbing to deal with the situation,"" he said. ""Using fire trucks to pump a mixture of sea water and boron onto the reactors is not in any of the manuals."" Wakeford said the workers will have known they may one day face a risky situation such as this. However, Helfand said that made them even braver, and their work more admirable. ""These workers are trained to understand the risks, but that only makes it all the more heroic that they have agreed to stay and work to prevent a disaster,"" he said. ""They know that if there is a reactor meltdown it could be a major disaster affecting huge areas and massive numbers of people, and they are risking their lives to try and prevent that. All of us owe them a huge debt of gratitude."" Professor Wakeford agreed: ""They are heroic, there is no doubt about that -- it's a pity that isn't recognised more. They are heroes, and I bow down to them.""","180 workers at Fukushima nuclear power plant trying to avert nuclear catastrophe .

"(CNN) -- A new social media campaign hopes to harness the power of celebrities and a Bob Marley song to help bring awareness to the thousands suffering from the famine in the Horn of Africa. The ""I'm Gonna Be Your Friend"" campaign, which kicks off Tuesday, is named for a line in Marley's 1973 song ""High Tide Or Low Tide."" It uses the song as the soundtrack to a short film on the East African crisis directed by award-winning director Kevin MacDonald. Among MacDonald's movies is the critically acclaimed ""Last King of Scotland."" Prominent celebrities -- such as Eminem, Rihanna, Lady Gaga and Britney Spears -- have pledged to promote the film by posting it on their Facebook pages or offering links on their Twitter feeds. The video is also on sale, with proceeds going to Save The Children. ""With over 150 global stars already signed up and more joining by the hour, the combined total of their fans and followers on the social networks is over 700 hundred million people,"" the campaign said. ""This huge number will not only help raise awareness of the scale of the crisis but also vital funds for those suffering in the region."" Twelve million people are facing a hunger crisis in the Horn of Africa. Somalia has been hardest hit. ""Not one child should be denied food nor water. Not one child should suffer. Along with Save the Children, we must stand up together as friends to put a stop to this, to feed our children and to save their lives,"" said Rita Marley, Marley's wife.","The campaign is named for a line in the Marley song ""Hide Tide Or Low Tide""

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- It took Norma Margeson a few minutes to learn to control the skinny metal robot. But instead of viewing it as a machine, she soon warmed up to it as a companion. Georgia artist Norma Margeson has embraced a robot prototype that can fetch household items for patients. ""Oh, I love it,"" she said. ""I think it is such a unique character. It has a personality all its own. It can be a friend, a very good friend."" Margeson, an artist from Marietta, Georgia, is learning how a health care robot dubbed El-E (pronounced ""Ellie"") can help her accomplish some simple household tasks. El-E is being tested by Margeson and other patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ""We named it El-E because she reminds us of an elephant. She has this one arm that is sort of gray that can lift objects and move up and down,"" said Professor Charles Kemp, director of the Center for Healthcare Robotics at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. Right now Kemp and his colleagues are focusing on programming El-E to locate and fetch common household items such as a hairbrush, a bottle of pills, a cell phone or a TV remote. El-E also can open doors.  Watch El-E the robot in action » . A robot with those skills could provide some independence for patients with motor impairments and a respite for caregivers. Kemp said he hopes his robots could help people in wheelchairs, the elderly and those with such diseases as arthritis and diabetes. ""There is still significant research to be done in order to make robots like El-E function in real homes on a daily basis,"" Kemp said. ""Real homes contain a diverse array of objects, have obstacles that make robot navigation difficult, have varied lighting, contain fragile items, provide shelter to pets and family members, and have messy areas."" Kemp has been working for more than a year with Jonathan Glass, a neurology professor at Emory University in Atlanta and director of the Emory ALS Center. ""What Charlie and his team have been very focused on is not what they can make the robots do, but what they can make the robots do that's important to people,"" Glass said. ""We may think of things that are relatively trivial -- picking up a cell phone, picking up a remote control for a TV set or even pushing a button somewhere that they cannot quite reach. That may seem to be a small thing to somebody. But to these folks, it's a very big thing."" El-E is about 5 feet tall, with a single robotic arm that can move up and down to pick up objects at different heights. The robot swivels and rolls on a motorized, wheeled base. During a demonstration in a living-room setting at Georgia Tech, Margeson used a laser pointer to identify objects she wanted El-E to deliver to her. Patients with different levels of mobility also can use head-mounted pointers or touch pads. El-E retrieved bottles of pills and a water bottle when Margeson pointed to them, but its claw could not get a proper grip on a cell phone. Like any young creature, however, the robot is designed to learn from its mistakes. ""In this case, it missed the object. It should try again actually, and it should recognize that it didn't succeed,"" Kemp said. Formal studies have shown El-E to be an efficient worker. In 127 out of 134 trials (94.8 percent), the robot successfully picked up the requested object. Kemp and his students have studied the work of service dogs to try to mimic the most useful assistive functions. And while El-E will never be the warm and loving companion that a German shepherd or a Labrador might be, there are efforts to make El-E interactive and at least somewhat anthropomorphic. When El-E is ready to work, it says: ""Waiting for laser command."" After the patient points at an object, the robot acknowledges, with the words, ""Detected laser pointer."" Patients can decide whether El-E should put the object on a table or put it directly in their hands. ""If you look at me, I will deliver to your hand,"" says the robotic voice. Glass said that many ALS patients have, by necessity, learned to be tech savvy. ""For the most part, patients at this stage of the disease are used to dealing with technology,"" he said. ""They're used to dealing with motorized wheelchairs; they are used to dealing with automatic speaking devices and computers."" But programming a robot to do ""human"" things involves a lot of hardware and software. El-E is powered by a Mac Mini with the Ubuntu Linux operating system. ""It needs to have a laser to navigate and to find objects on the surface,"" Kemp said. ""It needs to have this camera so it can know where to move its hand. It needs to have these four sensors so that it can know as it is moving how much to grip on the object, when to stop moving down, when to let go of the object when handing out the object to a person."" Kemp's Web site, http://www.charliekemp.com/, includes video that shows what El-E sees as it navigates across a room. Depending on funding, Kemp said he hopes home health care robots may be available in less than 10 years. By that time, El-E may have learned how to carry a plate of hot food from the microwave to the table and pick up a glass without breaking or spilling it.","Engineers at Georgia Tech are developing a health care robot for home use .

"Guatemala City, Guatemala (CNN) -- The two top candidates in Guatemala's presidential race are headed for a runoff after tallies Monday revealed neither had secured enough votes to win the election. Otto Perez Molina, a retired army general who pledged to take a tough stand on crime, garnered the most votes in Sunday's elections. With almost all of the ballots counted Monday night, Perez Molina had 36% of votes -- far short of the more than 50% needed to win outright. His closest competitor, businessman Manuel Baldizon, had 23% of votes, said Guatemala's election authority. Observers from the Organization of American States criticized Guatemalan election officials' apparent disorganization and slow vote-counting after Sunday's election, the state-run AGN news agency reported. The watchdogs said they hoped the process would improve in the second round of voting, scheduled for November 6. Dealing with widespread violence and the growing threat of organized crime figured heavily in the campaigns of all 10 candidates vying for the presidency. Baldizon championed a crime-fighting plan called ""Security Now!"" Campaign posters for Perez Molina, who led in polls before Sunday's election, featured a clenched fist.  The 60-year-old retired general pledged to bring a ""mano dura"" -- firm hand -- to Guatemala's highest office. In a debate co-hosted by CNN en Español last month, Perez Molina called for ""elite units of the army"" to play a larger role in the nation's battle against gangs and drug cartels. But that proposed approach -- and Perez Molina's high rank in the military during Guatemala's decades-long civil war -- worries human rights groups both in Guatemala and abroad. ""These groups have begun questioning his military past and his participation in the war against the insurgents during the armed conflict. Undoubtedly, this issue will be present during his presidency if he wins the elections,"" said Miguel Castillo, a political analyst at Guatemala's Francisco Marroquin University. Concerns stem from the fact that the Guatemalan military committed multiple atrocities during the civil war, though Perez Molina has never been directly implicated in any of them, Castillo said. Perez Molina is campaigning for president for a second time. He was defeated in 2007 by incumbent President Alvaro Colom. ""We would have liked to win in the first round, but we are prepared with a revision of plans and strategy to face the second phase of this electoral process,"" he said early Monday, according to AGN. First-time candidate Baldizon, 41, also said he was ready for the next round, AGN reported. The businessman and attorney, who is running under the banner of the Leader Party, has energized young people. His campaign slogan was ""Only the people can save the people."" The youngest of all the candidates, Baldizon espouses a concept he calls ""renewed democratic liberty"" in which all members of society have a role to play in seeking solutions to common problems. ""In order to change Guatemala, we need a president who's really committed to our nation, with a calling for service, and who truly wants to change Guatemala,"" Baldizon said. Poverty is endemic in Guatemala, and the country has one of the worst crime rates in Latin America. Forty-three percent of children under 5 are chronically malnourished. And the murder rate last year was 42 per 100,000 people -- one of the highest in the world. In a Vox Latina national survey in July, more than two-thirds of Guatemalans said violence was the issue that concerned them most, far outpacing the combined totals for the economy, unemployment, poverty and lack of education. This is only the fourth time that Guatemala has held presidential elections since peace accords were signed in 1996, officially ending a civil war that devastated the Central American country for 36 years. The conflict left more than 100,000 people dead and a million refugees. The new president will take office in January. CNN's Fernando del Rincon, Rafael Romo and Arthur Brice, and journalist Patzy Vasquez contributed to this report.","Retired Gen. Otto Perez Molina gets the most votes, but must face a runoff .

"(Mashable) -- Google has announced a major algorithmic change to its search engine, subtle in nature and perhaps unnoticeable to many users, but one that should dramatically improve the quality of Google's search results. With this move, Google is targeting content farms -- a common name for low quality sites whose main goal is to attract search traffic by piling up (mostly) useless content, usually by either producing large amounts of low-quality text or by copying it from websites with original content. Google does not go into details of the change which should impact 11.8 percent of Google's queries (currently only in the U.S., with plans to roll it out elsewhere over time), but it does say that it will affect the ranking of many sites on the web. ""This update is designed to reduce rankings for low-quality sites -- sites which are low-value add for users, copy content from other websites or sites that are just not very useful. At the same time, it will provide better rankings for high-quality sites -- sites with original content and information such as research, in-depth reports, thoughtful analysis and so on,"" explain Googlers Amit Singhal and Matt Cuttsin a blog post. While the change will surely have many website owners up in arms, complaining that their website was unfairly ranked lower than before (we're sure that in some cases they will be right), it's a very welcome one.

"Toronto, Ontario (CNN) -- Police fired tear gas outside a prisoner processing center Sunday in Toronto where groups of people gathered to protest the arrest of G-20 demonstrators, a security spokeswoman said. A total of 604 people have been arrested since the protests broke out June 18, said Constable Tim Garland of the Ontario Provincial Police. At least 253 of those arrests came on Sunday, he said. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper had harsh words for demonstrators who set at least four police cars ablaze and shattered several windows around the city during the weekend's protests. ""We obviously deplore the actions of a few thugs,"" Harper said at the conclusion of the G-20 summit. Some of the detained protesters were released Sunday from the prisoner processing center -- an old film studio converted to a makeshift jail amid the protests -- while others were being held for bail, Ontario Provincial Police Constable Rodney Petroski said. Some of those released emerged in their stocking feet, carrying a bag of their belongings and speaking about the conditions inside the center. Several detainees who had been arrested for ""breach of peace"" told CNN that they weren't given access to legal counsel and were denied blankets and frequent trips to the bathroom outside what they described as 6-foot by 9-foot makeshift cells. Elsewhere, mobs scuffled with police in multiple locations, according to Neda Snyder, a spokeswoman for the Integrated Security Unit. Of the Sunday arrests, 70 took place on one thoroughfare, Bancroft Avenue, she said. There were no reports of serious injuries to either protesters or police, according to the ISU, which said the safety of summit participants was never compromised. ""I do not believe that the individuals bent on vandalism and violence in our city have finished with their intent, so we will remain vigilant,"" Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair said Saturday night. Blair told reporters that packs of disruptive demonstrators infiltrated peaceful protests in order to cause chaos and distract police. ""These criminals rely on the anonymity of hiding in a larger group of the curious and the naive,"" he said. At least four police cars went up in flames and smoke during hours of confrontation, authorities said. Protesters left behind broken windows and graffiti. Blair said police used tear gas after warning a group of protesters ""engaged in acts of destruction"" Saturday. Not all encounters between police and protesters were hostile. At one intersection the crowd danced and chanted, ""You're sexy, you're cute, take off your riot suit!"" More aggressive groups of demonstrators moved from intersection to intersection, trying to circumvent police and get to the security fence protecting the summit meeting. ""The fence is a symbol that they can build a fence and spend a billion dollars on their agenda. The fence is a symbol of what's wrong with this country,"" protester Rolf Gerstenberger said. Authorities said the fence was not breached Saturday. Behind it, world leaders met for an economic summit focusing on recovery from the global financial crisis. Participants agreed on ambitious targets for getting deficits under control, pledging to cut them in half by 2013, according to a final statement made at the conclusion of the conference. This weekend's meetings come on the heels of the two-day G8 summit outside Toronto, where the leaders of the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Japan and Russia also focused on recovery from the global economic crisis. The group also made note of other thorny issues in their final statement issued Saturday, singling out Iran and North Korea for criticism.

"(CNN) -- A major Italian trade union called on workers to strike Tuesday, as the country's Senate prepares to vote on austerity measures to try to bring the country's budget under control. The strikes were causing transport chaos in cities across the country, with parts of the metro shut down in Rome, the Italian news agency ANSA reported. The CGIL union said demonstrations were planned for cities including Rome, Naples, Florence, Milan and many others. The strike comes amid international worries about the health of Italy's economy, the third-largest in Europe. Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi last month insisted that his country could confront the financial anxieties shadowing Italy and rest of the continent. Speaking to lawmakers, he said the economic challenges Italy faces need ""to be tackled with determination and without panic."" But he also noted ""we do not deny we are facing a crisis,"" adding: ""We need to work together to overcome it."" There have been fears that the debt crisis roiling Greece and Portugal is spreading to Italy and could affect the stability of the euro, the currency used by 17 nations on the continent. Italy has one of the lowest growth rates in the world and among the highest public debts, warned Domenico Lombardi, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former International Monetary Fund executive board member. He said the roots of Italy's troubles lie in its huge public debt and low growth rate. Italy's economy has been growing at only 0.3%, he said, and most importantly is projected to grow at a similarly feeble rate for the next few years. ""This very low rate of growth really is one of the lowest in the world,"" he said, ""and on top of that Italy has a very high public debt."" That debt stands at about 120% of gross domestic product (GDP) -- or in other words, a fifth more than the country's annual economic output -- and is one of the highest in the world, bar that of Greece, which has had to be bailed out by Europe. Put these two factors together in Italy and it ""becomes clear that the economy is not going to be able to generate enough resources to pay for its debt,"" Lombardi said. Professor Iain Begg of the London School of Economics told CNN that while Berlusconi's public return to the helm on the economy was welcome after a conspicuous absence, Italy's mercurial prime minister is also a part of the problem. Italy under Berlusconi has failed to ""grasp the nettle of economic reform"" to tackle low growth over a sustained period, Begg said. In addition, he said, Berlusconi erred in July by publicly criticizing Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti (who is himself troubled by corruption allegations) over recently announced austerity measures. ""As soon as you start playing these kind of games politically, the markets smell blood and as soon as they scent it, they start tearing flesh,"" Begg said. He argues that Italy should not be in trouble in the first place because although its debt is high, it is not rising. Also, the public-sector deficit -- the gap between taxation and expenditure -- is very low at 4% compared with other countries, such as 10% in the UK and 11% in the United States. Italy isn't exposed to the same kind of property bubble as Spain and its banking system is strong, Begg said. But other elements, like the new debt deals agreed for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, have paradoxically pushed up borrowing costs for Italy to record levels -- with bond yields, or interest rates on government debt, reaching 6% -- and put it under greater pressure, he said. Unlike McWilliams, Begg believes Italy is highly unlikely to default on its huge debt -- but its situation is nonetheless ""precarious"" if it wants to avoid years of low growth. And the picture is not altogether bleak. Unemployment in Italy, at just over 8%, is not as high as in Spain or Greece, Begg said, giving more leeway for the government to carry out tough reforms and the economy to be turned round. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Strikes cause transport chaos in cities across the country, an Italian news agency reports .

"(CNN) -- Joe Marshall was cruising across the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge when a piece of steel and a giant cable crashed down. He was just 50 yards away. The iReporter was just far enough away that he didn't see the debris as it fell. But he did see cars quickly move to the right lanes to avoid the mess. The falling debris forced the closure of the bridge and snarled traffic between Oakland and San Francisco, California, as commuters look for alternate ways to get to and from the cities. It's also forcing structural engineers to look at key questions around the nation's infrastructure: Has the nation done enough to address crucial bridges two years after the tragic collapse of a bridge in Minnesota that killed 13 people? The answer, experts say, is no. The pieces that fell this week raise even more troubling issues because repairs had just been made in September to the same section of the 73-year-old bridge, which spans the San Francisco Bay and carries an average of 280,000 vehicles daily. Over Labor Day weekend, crews worked to repair a damaged steel beam. ""The bridge has been inspected, and it is now safer than when we closed it,"" Randell Iwasaki, the director of the California Department of Transportation, said at the time. Abolhassan Astaneh-Asl, a structural engineering professor at the University of California, Berkeley, says he's concerned that authorities took a ""Band-Aid"" approach in September. ""It failed,"" he said. He's worried about what he calls ""fracture-critical"" bridges: roughly 460 bridges across the country that are in dire need of repairs. ""Following the Minnesota bridge collapse, there was a lot of discussion because of emotions,"" he said. ""I didn't really see a sustained effort that says, 'We are going to replace these fracture-critical bridges.' "" Federal regulators said support plates that were about half as thick as they should have been were the likely cause of the August 1, 2007, bridge collapse in Minnesota that killed 13 people and injured 145. The gusset plates -- metal plates that are meant to strengthen joists -- are believed to have failed on the I-35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. A new bridge has since opened in Minnesota, what the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials hailed as one of the nation's Top 10 transportation feats this year. ""It is critical that our transportation systems receive the funding necessary to keep America moving. But even more important is that our state and local governments use that money to deliver projects that quickly meet the needs of our communities,"" John Horsley, the group's executive director, said in a recent report. But engineers say that's the problem: Repairs aren't happening quick enough. If a tragedy like the Minnesota collapse doesn't get people's attention, they wonder, what will? ""I have seen some lip service, but I have not seen a lot of momentum and action,"" said William Ibbs, a professor of civil engineering at UC-Berkeley. ""Part of that is due to the economic recession. When California has a budget deficit of $25 billion, they don't worry about bridges. They worry about closing the budget gap."" Fari Barzegar, a civil engineering consultant based out of Oakland, says the Minnesota collapse put critical bridge problems front and center before the American public. ""In the engineering community, we knew these things many years ago, and there were requests for money, which wasn't coming,"" Barzegar said. But he says funding hasn't kept up post-Minnesota. According to a 2009 American Society of Civil Engineers report, more than 26 percent of the nation's bridges are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials estimated in 2008 that it would cost roughly $140 billion to repair every deficient bridge in the country. Bridges are typically inspected every two years. ""If we don't start making substantial progress in five years, we will have more collapses,"" Ibbs said. The Bay Bridge opened in 1936 and spans 8.4 miles. It was the largest and most expensive bridge -- $77 million -- of its time. The bridge is best known to most Americans from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. A 50-foot section of the bridge collapsed during the quake, killing one person and prompting efforts to make it quake-tolerant. Part of the bridge, the West Span, is a suspension bridge. The other portion of the bridge, known as the East Span, is a truss-cantilever design. This week's falling debris happened on the East Span, which is in the process of being replaced.","Falling debris on Bay Bridge raises questions about repairs after Minnesota collapse .

"(CNN) -- England opener Alastair Cook just missed out on reaching a remarkable triple- hundred as the hosts continued to turn the screw in the third cricket Test against India at Edgbaston on Friday. Cook scored a career-best 294 as England racked-up a massive first innings total of 710-7 declared on day three, an unbeatable lead of 486 runs with two days play still remaining. And England's position became even stronger when Indian opener Virender Sehwag was caught at slip for his second succesive opening ball duck, as the visitors began their second innings in disastrous fashion. However, in fading light, Gautum Gambhir and Rahul Dravid steered India to 35-1 at the close of play, still needing a mammoth 451 runs to make England bat again. India cannot possibly win the match now, but they will need to bat for the remaining two days to salvage a draw, or hope that some bad weather finds its way to Birmingham. Starting the day on 456-3, in reply to India's score of 224, England continued to plunder runs at will. And, after passing his second-ever Test double century, Cook looked on course to become only the sixth England batsman in history to reach 300, and first since Graham Gooch -- also against India -- in 1990. However, he was caught in the deep, off the bowling of Ishant Sharma, just six runs short of that famous milestone. Cook's marathon innings of 12 hours and 47 minutes fell just half an hour short of the England record, set by Len Hutton, when making 364 against Australia at The Oval in 1938. Their score of 710 was was England's best for 73 years and their third highest of all-time behind the 903-7 declared against Australia at The Oval in 1938 and 849 against the West Indies at Kingston, Jamaica, in 1930. It also leaves them perfectly placed to go an unbeatable 3-0 up in the four-Test series and secure the win that would see them replace India at the top of the Test Championship table.","Alastair Cook scores 294 as England dominate third Test against India .

"(CNN) -- Three United Nations peacekeepers were killed in an ambush in a camp for displaced people in Sudan's Darfur region, the global body said Tuesday. Two of the dead were soldiers; the third was a police adviser for the joint U.N. and African Union mission in the troubled region. Another six peacekeepers were injured in the incident. They came under attack at 10:15 Monday night in the Zam Zam camp in North Darfur while the security unit was on patrol. One of the assailants was also killed, a statement from the joint mission said. It was unclear why the attack occurred. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon ""strongly condemns"" the attack, the U.N. said in a statement. The attack was carried out by unidentified armed men while the peacekeepers were on a ""confidence-building patrol,"" the statement said. Ban ""appeals to the Sudanese authorities to investigate the incident and to bring to justice the perpetrators as soon as possible,"" according to the statement. The peacekeeping mission in Darfur is the world's largest at 20,000 authorized troops. Since it began in 2008, 33 peacekeepers have been killed. ""I condemn in the strongest terms this attack on our peacekeepers who have worked selflessly to bring security to the internally displaced persons of Zam Zam camp where so many Darfuris have sought refuge,"" said Ibrahim Gambari, head of the mission. ""An attack on international peacekeepers is a war crime and we will ensure that justice will be served."" Darfur is among the most dangerous areas of operation for U.N. personnel. The region remains a tinderbox. At least 300,000 people have been killed and 2.7 million others driven from their homes as a result of fighting between Sudanese rebel groups and the Khartoum government and its allied armed militia.

"(CNN) -- Sri Lanka's coconut development minister has banned the felling of coconut trees in an effort to increase coconut production in the face of a severe shortage. Minister Jagath Pushpakumara said that over the past few years, coconut production has decreased because coconut palms are being cut down. He was addressing a media briefing Monday at the Government Information Department. The ban requires that approval for cutting coconut trees be obtained from the provincial managers of the Coconut Development Board. The ban will not apply to trees affected by the coconut leaf wilt disease in the Weligama area on the nation's southern coast. Sri Lanka's annual coconut production is 2.7 billion nuts, and the ministry expects to increase this to 3.5 billion, Pushpakumara said. In an effort to curb a coconut black market, the Sri Lankan government last week set a ceiling retail price of 30 rupees (27 US cents) per coconut in state-owned stores, but stocks quickly sold out and then reappeared at more than double the price on the black market. The island nation-state in the Indian Ocean is approximately the size of the state of West Virginia and has a population of 21.3 million. The island counts coconuts as a dietary staple and one of its biggest exports, along with trademarked Ceylon tea and rubber.","Sri Lanka acts to boost coconut production, which has been dropping .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Part of the U.S. embassy annex in Kabul came under attack early Monday, a U.S. official and an official from the International Security Assistance Force said. The attack was believed to be largely over by about 4 a.m., the U.S. official said. At that point, there was not yet any word on casualties. ISAF Maj. Jason Waggoner said it was a single incident, not several attacks. The U.S. official described the situation as fluid at the targeted facility, which is used by U.S. government personnel in the Afghan capital. The area is known as a place where personnel both live and work, some in intelligence operations. A CIA spokeswoman declined to comment on the attack. ""Police have heard gunshots in the area,"" said Siddiq Siddiqi, the spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry. ""The gunshots continued for three or four minutes."" Afghanistan has been site of several high-profile attacks of late, including strikes at the NATO headquarters and the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and the assassination of former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani. Rabbani had been leading efforts for reconciliation talks. U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta contended last Thursday that such attacks represent a strategy shift by the Taliban, the conservative and militant group that has been waging a years-long fight in the war-torn nation. ""We judge this change in tactics to be a result of a shift in momentum in our favor and a sign of weakness in the insurgency,"" Panetta said in a Senate Armed Service Committee hearing. He added that ""the insurgency has been turned back in much of the country, including its heartland in the south, and Afghan National Security Forces are increasingly strong and capable."" Mike Mullen, the outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified then that he felt Pakistan is ""exporting"" violence to Afghanistan. He described the Haqqani terrorist network as ""a veritable arm of Pakistan's intelligence"" -- an assertion that Pakistani officials later strongly denied, even as it admitted the country does have contacts with the group. August was the deadliest month for U.S. forces in Afghanistan since the conflict began. Seventy-one American troops died that month, including 30 killed when insurgents shot down a helicopter August 6 in the eastern central province of Wardak. The surge in U.S. deaths comes as NATO is drawing down and handing over security control to national forces. Some 10,000 U.S. troops are scheduled to depart by year's end, with all U.S. military personnel out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014. CNN's Barbara Starr and Claudia Dominguez contributed to this report.","NEW: Ministry: The gunshots continued for three or four minutes .

"(CNN)  -- Stuart Broad's stunning five wickets for no runs spell, including a hat-trick, restored England's hopes after Rahul Dravid's 34th Test hundred had put India in command at Trent Bridge Saturday. England looked set to face a massive first innings deficit until Broad performed his heroics to wrap up the Indian innings for 288, a lead of 67. The home side battled to 24 for one, losing Alastair Cook cheaply, by the close to trail by 43 with three days left of the second Test. But it could have been so much worse for Andrew Strauss' men who won the first match of the series at Lord's in convincing fashion. Dravid and Yuvraj Singh had taken India to 258 for four wickets with a stand of 128 until Broad struck. He removed Yuvraj for 62, caught behind, then soon afterwards had India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni caught at second slip by James Anderson. Next ball Harbhajan Singh was lbw, although the decision by South African umpire Marais Erasmus looked dubious with replays indicating he had hit the ball. But there was no doubt about his hat-trick dismissal as he clean bowled Praveen Kumar. Dravid went shortly afterwards to Tim Bresnan for an excellent 117, while Broad, who had earlier removed India's batting legend Sachin Tendulkar, wrapped up the innings to end with Test-best figures of six for 46 in 24.1 overs. Broad, who top-scored in England's first innings of 221, was pleased to have performed his feat on his home ground. ""It's always nice to get a hat-trick anywhere but to get it at Trent Bridge is special,"" Broad told Sky Sports. ""We have to bat well tomorrow (Sunday) to set it up for ourselves."" Dravid, who shared an invaluable stand of 93 for the second wicket with VVS Laxman (54), admitted he had been constantly under pressure on a difficult wicket. ""It was hard work, but the wicket did get easier than yesterday. ""They have a good quality bowling attack and they tested us.""

"(CNN) -- Alastair Cook made a superb century as England remained on course to leapfrog opponents India as the number one ranked Test team in the world. On another dominant day for England in Birmingham they finished on 456-3, to lead by 232 after India slumped to 224 all out in their first innings. Cook took full advantage of a lackluster Indian bowling attack by batting all day for an impressive 182 not out with captain Andrew Strauss and Kevin Pietersen also notching half centuries. England are now odds on favorites to go 3-0 up in the four match series and confirm their status as number one. Resuming on 84-0, Strauss and Cook made a patient start and amassed another 100 runs before Strauss was bowled by Amit Mishra for 87. Ian Bell made a confident 34 and the ball before he was clean bowled by Praveen Kumar, Cook notched up his 19th century to a standing ovation from the Edgbaston crowd. Pietersen made a brisk start to his innings with Indian fast bowler Ishant Sharma coming in for particular punishment. He and Cook put on 122 for the third wicket before Pietersen was given out LBW off Kumar. But that was India's final breakthrough of the day as Eoin Morgan and Cook put on another 82 before the close of play. India now face a huge task to save the match and prevent being usurped at the top of the world rankings. ""It's always nice to score runs and especially pleasing when you haven't scored in the last two tests,"" Cook told a press conference. ""It's been frustrating not getting through that new ball and it was important that when I did I made it count.

"(CNN) -- Sri Lanka opened their 2011 Cricket World Cup with a thumping 210-run win over Group A outsiders Canada in front of a home crowd in Hambantota. An 81-ball century from Mahela Jayawardene -- the fastest by a Sri Lankan at a World Cup -- and 92 from captain Kumar Sangakkara laid the foundations for Sri Lanka's formidable total of 332 for seven. The pair shared a third wicket partnership of 179 as Canada's bowling attack toiled after earlier restricting Sri Lanka to 92 for two from the first 20 overs. Sehwag century sets up India victory . Jayawardene finally fell at the end of the 44th over with the score on 276 for four. But Angelo Mathews and Thilan Samaraweera chipped in with useful runs at the death to steer Sri Lanka past 300. Canada's theoretical run-chase got off to the worst of starts as opener John Davison was out to the seventh ball of the innings, bowled by Thisara Perera. Fellow opener Ruvindu Gunasekera, Zubin Surkari and Jimmy Hansra all fell cheaply, leaving Canada in the mire at 42 for four after 18 overs. Captain Ashish Bagai halted a complete collapse with steady 22 before becoming Perera's third victim. And Rizwan Cheema battled hard for his 37 as wickets tumbled around him, but was eighth man out in the 31st over. Canada's miserable day was completed five overs later when they were all out for 122 -- Henry Osinde was last man out bowled by Ajantha Mendis for four. Sri Lanka's next match is against Pakistan in Colombo on Saturday February 26. Earlier in Group A, New Zealand thrashed minnows Kenya by 10 wickets in Chennai. Kenya won the toss and elected to bat and made a respectable if somewhat slow start to their innings, scoring 33 runs in the first ten overs for the loss of one wicket -- opener Alex Obanda falling to Tim Southee in the seventh over. Bangladesh excited to host Cricket World Cup . But it wasn't long before their innings began to unravel as Kiwi paceman Hamish Bennett -- who finished with figures of 4 for 16 -- ripped through Kenya's top order with only Rakep Patel (16 not out) offering any resistance. Kenya's last five batsmen managed just four runs between them as Jacob Oram and Southee bagged three wickets apiece as Kenya slumped to 69 all out in the 24th over. Kiwi openers Martin Guptill (39 not out) and Brendon McCullum (26 not out) needed just eight overs to knock off the runs as New Zealand romped home.

"Washington (CNN) -- Thomas Jefferson famously wrote about the wall of separation between church and state. He didn't mention separating church and politics, but everybody knows it's a sticky wicket. On Friday, Robert Jeffress, a Southern Baptist minister, introduced Texas Gov. Rick Perry at at a gathering of social conservatives, calling Perry a genuine follower of Jesus Christ, as opposed to another candidate Jeffress could and did mention in a later interview. ""I think Mitt Romney is a good, moral man, but I think those of us who are born-again followers of Christ should always prefer a competent Christian to a competent non-Christian like Mitt Romney,"" Jeffress told CNN's Jim Acosta. Read more: Perry's minister problem? Romney is a Mormon and he has passed this way before: Four years ago, the first time he ran for president, he made a speech to address concerns, rumors, and political analysis of his religion in a speech. ""I believe in my Mormon faith and I endeavor to live by it. Some believe that such a confession of my faith will sink my candidacy. If they're right, so be it."" Asked about the controversy on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, Romney's Republican presidential rivals took a pass. ""I'm not running for theologian in chief,"" businessman Herman Cain said. ""I'm a lifelong Christian, and what that means is one of my guiding principles for the decisions I made is I start with, do the right thing. I'm not getting into that controversy."" Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann called the issue ""so inconsequential."" Asked if she was concerned that people might think she was dodging the question, Bachmann said, ""I think, again, to make this a big issue is just ridiculous right now, because every day I'm on the street talking to people. This is not what people are talking about."" Asked the same question, Cain had a similar answer. ""If that's what it looks like, I'm dodging it, because it's not going to help us boost this economy, and you know that that's my No. 1 priority,"" he said. Many things sank Romney's candidacy in 2008. Religion may have been one of them. Explain it to me: Mormonism . Ron Brownstein, editorial director of the National Journal, points out that Romney ran poorly among evangelical Christians, especially in the South, in 2008. ""In all the Southern states, he never topped out above 20% of the votes among evangelical Christians; only 11% in the critical state of South Carolina,"" Brownstein said. In all, 45% of Republicans who vote in primaries are conservative evangelical Christians. They are far less a factor in a general election. For Romney's rivals, this requires straddling a line -- you don't want to alienate a huge part of the primary vote, nor do you want to look intolerant.","GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney's Mormon faith is once again under the microscope .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel's Antiquities Authority announced Monday that a rare Roman sword in its leather scabbard which belonged to a Roman soldier and an engraving of a Menorah on a piece of stone dating from 66 CE were found in recent days in the 2000 year old drainage system in Jerusalem which ran between the City of David and the Jerusalem Archaeological Garden. Professor Ronny Reich told CNN that the sword probably belonged to a Roman infantryman stationed in Jerusalem during the Great Revolt (66 CE). At the time there were four Roman legions stationed in the area. This is the third Roman sword found in Jerusalem but what distinguishes this find is the fine state of preservation of the sword: it is around 60 cm (about 24 inches) in length, it was found in a leather scabbard and some of the decoration on the sword was preserved. The stone artifact with an etching of the Menorah was found in the soil near the drainage channel. The etching was probably done by a sharp nail according to Reich. ""The importance of the etching,"" according to Reich, ""is  the depiction of the base of the Menorah which clarifies what the original base of the Menorah looked like: a quadrapod resting on a frame that was on the floor."" The proximity of the find to the Temple Mount is also important and the researchers of the dig Eli Shukron from the Israel Antiquities Authority and Reich believe a passerby who saw the Menorah with his own eyes drew his impression of it on a stone. The Menorah was one of the holy objects inside the Temple. The dig has uncovered so far half of the old drainage channel, which is around 600 meters (yards). In earlier digs the archaeologists found traces of people who lived in the drainage channels hiding from the Romans during the time of the Second Temple's destruction. The drainage channels were also used by people to flee the besieged city. The find comes on the eve of Tisha B'Av which is a fast day in Judaism which commemorates the destruction of the First Temple and Second Temple in Jerusalem.","Condition of sword is considered fine .

"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Doctors at a Sri Lankan hospital operated for three hours Friday to remove 18 nails and metal particles allegedly hammered into the arms, legs and forehead of a maid by her Saudi employer. Dr. Kamal Weeratunga said the surgical team in the southern town of  Kamburupitiya pulled nails ranging from about one to three inches from Lahadapurage Daneris Ariyawathie's body. He said doctors have not yet removed four small metal particles embedded in her muscles. ""She is under heavy antibiotics but in a stable condition,"" Weeratunga said. Sri Lankan officials, meanwhile, met with Saudi diplomats in Colombo to urge an investigation into the incident. ""It was cruel treatment which should be roundly condemned,"" said L.K. Ruhunuge of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment. He said the Sri Lanka government has forwarded to Saudi authorities a detailed report on the incident including statements from Ariyawathie. Ariyawathie left Sri Lanka on March 25 to work as a housemaid in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia after the bureau registered her as a person obtaining a job from an officially recognized job agency. She was held down by her employer's wife while the employer hammered the heated nails, Ruhunuge told CNN. She apparently had complained to the couple that she was being overworked, Ruhunuge said. The nails were hammered into her arms and legs while one was on her forehead, he said. ""Most of the wounds are superficial but five to 10 are somewhat deep,"" said Dr. Prabath Gajadeera of the Base Hospital. ""Luckily, none of the organs is affected. Only nerves and blood vessels are affected."" Ariyawathie, 49, is a mother of two children who were opposed to their mother's journey to Saudi Arabia for work. Several countries across the Middle East and Asia host significant numbers of migrant domestic workers, ranging from 196,000 in Singapore to about 1.5 million in Saudi Arabia, according to a report published earlier this year by Human Rights Watch. Many of the domestic workers are poor Asian women from Sri Lanka, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Nepal. Widespread abuse has been documented by global human rights groups. Common complaints include unpaid wages, long working hours with no time for rest, and heavy debt burdens from exorbitant recruitment fees, said the Human Rights Watch report. Isolation and forced confinement contribute to psychological and physical abuse, sexual violence, forced labor, and trafficking, the report said. The abuse often goes unchecked because of a lack of government regulation and protective laws. Ruhunuge said the registration of the local job agency that placed Ariyawathie has been cancelled. ""We have also asked [them] to pay compensation to the victim,"" he added. ""We want to bring those responsible for justice. We are doing our best in this regard,"" he said. He said his office was ready to accompany Ariyawathie to Saudi Arabia to testify if a case is brought against her former employers. Ariyawathie's dream was to one day return to Sri Lanka and build a house with the money she saved. ""We are looking at the possibility of helping her to do this,"" Ruhunuge said. Karu Jayasuriya, deputy leader of the main opposition United National Party, visited Ariyawathie in the hospital and said he was appalled. ""We want the government to raise this issue at the highest levels with the Saudi government. We cannot imagine that such crude and uncivilized things are happening to our workers,"" he said. Saudi officials were not immediately available for comment.","NEW: Doctors remove nails from the maid's body .

"(MNN.com) -- Lulu and I have fostered our share of dogs over the years. It's always fun to watch her teach shy and withdrawn pooches to cuddle or play keep-away. But I must admit that Lulu also has humped a few foster dogs in her day, even though she was spayed as a puppy. For advice on how to prevent this unwelcome behavior, I called trainers Andrew Zbeeb of Frogs to Dogs in Atlanta and Kate Jackson of Jabula Dog Academy in Decatur, Ga. Both deal with unruly pets for a living, and both agree that it's important to address ""special hugging"" early and often. ""It's more of an assertive thing than anything else,"" says Jackson. ""It's a way of belittling another dog. It's not necessarily dominating, but it's very rude."" To correct naughty dogs caught in the act, separate them immediately, Jackson says. Give the offending pooch a 30-second time out to sit and decompress. Then allow the dogs to resume play. ""If they step out of line again, offer time out again,"" she says. ""Redirect, redirect, redirect."" MNN: 'Jenga' dog and his owner defy the critics . Changing this behavior can take time, Zbeeb says. So don't get frustrated. It's the natural, normal way that dogs establish pecking order, he says, even if they have been spayed or neutered. That explains why Lulu reserves this unwelcome greeting for fosters rather than play dates. She never dared such rudeness with Daisy, my sister's smaller but more dominant, pint-sized pooch. ""It's a primitive instinct,"" Zbeeb says, adding that a high-value treat such as cheese or meat can help lure pets to another activity. He stresses that the treat has to be especially good to trump that instinctual behavior to hump. Also, it helps to put a leash on the dogs so you can lead them out of the room for a time out. No matter how embarrassed you get, it's important to maintain a level head when addressing bad behavior. Cursing or yelling only worsens the problem, warns Jackson. As a lead trainer of pit bull training classes offered by the Humane Society of the United States, she puts that theory to practice every Saturday with mix of altered and unaltered dogs. If they grow agitated, Jackson maintains a calm demeanor in the eye of the storm. ""The minute you raise your voice and start yelling for something that's embarrassing or stupid or bad, you lower your level of control,"" she says. ""When your dog does something that mortifies you, be swift and get in there."" MNN: How to train your dog to behave around guests . That same rule applies if your dog decides to hump humans. Pull them away and schedule an immediate time out that's outside or far away from the situation. You also can step into the dog's space, reasserting your authority. ""Humping a human, that's pretty ballsy,"" Jackson says, no pun intended. That may be grounds for calling in a trainer for assistance. ""If a dog shows confidence enough to belittle a human, they have low regard for people. That's a dog that won't tolerate any correction from a lot of people -- and that can be pretty dangerous."" In a previous column, I offered tips to help dogs behave around guests. Mastering the ""place"" command helps ensure good behavior. Zbeeb also recommends teaching your dog to properly greet humans. Start by making the dog sit and stay about 8 feet from the front door, but not right in front of the door. Once your dog masters sitting and staying, it's time for you to approach the door. If the dog moves, offer a correction and make it return to the original spot. Return to the door and open it slightly, rewarding your dog for sitting and staying. Repeat this process daily. By the end of the week, your dog should be able to sit and stay without approaching the door, even if it's wide open. Of course, it took much longer than a week for Lulu and me. Once you've mastered this step, practice with familiar faces ringing the doorbell, then graduate to having strangers come to the door. With each exercise, the dog should maintain a sit and stay when guests arrive. ""Learning how to do this will also resolve the issue of humping humans,"" Zbeeb says. ""Dogs that hump humans don't have boundaries and are saying, 'I'm the boss.'""

"(CNN) -- Pioneering gay rights activist Frank Kameny died Tuesday evening at home in Washington, a spokesman said. He was 86. ""He said everyone needs to know they are of value and respected, and by saying, 'Gay is good,' he thought that reflected that feeling. He wanted dignity and self-respect, and that's what he fought for,"" according to Bob Witeck of the Kameny Papers Project. Kameny died peacefully of natural causes, according to his sister Edna Kameny Lavey. He was at a Human Rights Campaign dinner a week ago in a wheelchair, she said. ""Frank Kameny led an extraordinary life marked by heroic activism that set a path for the modern LGBT civil rights movement,"" Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese said in a statement. ""From his early days fighting institutionalized discrimination in the federal workforce, Dr. Kameny taught us all that 'Gay is Good.' ""As we say goodbye to this trailblazer on National Coming Out Day, we remember the remarkable power we all have to change the world by living our lives like Frank -- openly, honestly and authentically,"" said Solmonese, whose group works for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. A seat at the front of the audience was reserved for Kameny when President Barack Obama in December 2010 signed into law the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" which banned gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the U.S. armed forces. Kameny attended the ceremony wearing the Combat Infantryman Badge that he was awarded for his service in World War II. Kameny recalled his service fighting in the wake of the Battle of the Bulge: ""I dug my way across Europe slit trench by slit trench, practically."" But Kameny was not invited because of his heroism in World War II, but for his work toward changing the military policy of discharging homosexuals. Kameny, who had been discharged from the Army Map Service in 1957 for being gay, led a demonstration at the Pentagon in 1965. Kameny called upon the nascent gay rights movement to model itself upon the civil rights movement. The homophile movement, as it was called at the time, said that homosexuals were triply condemned: The medical establishment deemed them mentally ill, the law made them criminals and religions branded them sinners. At a time when lesbians and gay men were so ostracized, the homophile movement decided its best tactic was to embrace the label of sickness: at least that seemed a half-step up from being criminals. But Kameny argued that such an approach was counterproductive, and that gay people should demand equality with heterosexuals. To gain equality, he argued, the movement needed to assert itself. Kameny led the way in tactics such as public demonstrations, went on the attack against the Civil Service Commission for its policy of firing homosexuals, and spearheaded an effort to get the homophile movement to take the position that homosexuality was not only not a mental illness but was on a par with heterosexuality. In 1968, he got the only existing national association of gay rights organizations to adopt as its slogan a phrase that Kameny had coined, ""Gay is Good.""","NEW: Frank Kameny died peacefully of natural causes, his sister says .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- After emerging from the rubble of Moammar Gadhafi's Baba az' Azia palace late in August, Abdul Hakim Belhaj seized control as the military commander of Tripoli. An Islamist who had taken little public part in the spring uprising against Gadhafi, he claimed his soldiers had won the symbolic battle for the palace, the heart of the Libyan strongman's regime. By taking control of Tripoli, Belhaj gained authority over a third of the country's population and a major slice of its wealth. It was a power play that other opposition fighters bitterly resented. Abdullah Naker, one of several rival commanders, claims his fighters endured far tougher and more significant battles than the siege of Gadhafi's palace, not least the struggle to win control of Tripoli's main international airport that lasted several days. In an interview with CNN he downplayed Belhaj's success and threatened confrontation, as internal divisions threaten to pull apart the coalition that brought Gadhafi down. ""Who is Abdulhakim Belhaj and who appointed him?"" Naker asks. ""We don't know him. We are the leaders, we are the revolutionists, we know everything."" Naker echoes a much wider complaint that Belhaj is actually a stooge of the Qataris. ""We know that Abdulhakim Belhaj was in a school and Qatar sends him money to buy weapons,"" he said. In Tripoli today it's a commonly held belief that Belhaj's Tripoli Military Council is getting direct funding from Qatar. These concerns come amid reports that a NATO delegation traveled to Qatar last week to raise the issue. Qatar has been a principal player in pushing the revolution forward as part of the NATO alliance. Now there's growing unease in the Libyan capital that fractures among the groups controlling the country could have roots in divisions among the international coalition that overthrew Gadhafi. Belhaj, also known by his nom de guerre, Abu Abdullah Assadaq, was the military leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, LIFG, and denies any nefarious ties to Qatar. But Libya's rumor mill quickly turns suspicion into fact and he is finding it hard to shake the slur. His LIFG began fighting Gadhafi in the 1980s. After Gadhafi successfully crushed the LIFG, the group went underground and scattered. At its peak, the LIFG had underground cells in more than 20 countries, including Afghanistan, where it shared training camps with Al Qaeda. Belhaj had joined the new revolution with a ready-made army and a political religious ideology to boot. I know this because in 2009 I was trying to interview him when he was an inmate inside the notorious Abu Salim jail in Tripoli. In his writings then, he was trying to lead the group away from violent jihad towards a more political ideology. The so-called recantation theories, a 400-page manifesto he and several other fighting group leaders wrote from within the walls of the high security prison was the first ever direct jihadist challenge to Osama Bin Laden's nihilistic ideology. Bin Laden and Belhaj had never been natural bedfellows, but now they were enemies. Still, none of this cuts the mustard in Tripoli today; he's just another leader with an agenda. Gadhafi himself predicted his detractors had little in common and would soon fight among themselves. Sure enough, as weeks of street uprisings dragged out into months of NATO bombing, fractures appeared. Abdel Fattah Younis, Gadhafi's old ally and military chief who deserted him for the rebels was murdered in suspicious circumstances. Many feared it was the handiwork of the Islamists cutting down a moderate who might have made deals with some of his former boss's friends. Today the fight is a war of words played out in the newly liberated conference halls of the capital. At the weekend, National Transitional Council (NTC) chairman Abdul Jalil tried to reconcile the growing differences. After a contentious group meeting with all the commanders, the atmosphere became so heated that he was forced to meet the next day with individual factions seperately. On the capital's streets, the power struggle has more sinister overtones. First, Belhaj, citing the Jalil and the NTC's backing, called for all heavy weapons to be put under his command or moved out of the city. ""We call on all the revolutionary brigades and small local councils to join this framework as acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the transitional council,"" he said. It is statements like this that rankle with Naker. Naker claims it is his group, the Tripoli Revolution Council, that has the authority to have the weapons rounded up. Legitimacy in the capital, he says, is garnered from the neighborhood councils established to funnel weapons to fighters before the final push to over throw Gadhafi. But his challenge extends beyond Belhaj to the NTC and Jalil, the man who many regard as the very glue holding the disparate groups together. ""We gave this council the legitimacy and if we want we can withdraw the legitimacy from the transitional council....then we have no problem with withdrawing its legitimacy,"" Naker said. The root of the problem is that many Libyan's are loyal to family, tribe, village and town before nation. They've fought often isolated in their towns, Zintan in the western mountains, Misrata under siege on the coast for 6 months and Benghazi, its own large fiefdom in the east. Tripoli's patchwork of neighborhood councils is but a minor mirror of that. Tajoura, Souk al Juma and Fashloom -- to name but a few -- saw many of the weapons smuggled in to the city over the summer. It's given them muscle and the power to punch above their weight, as well as some freedom to choose sides. Belhaj claims many are loyal to him. ""We have met with all the local revolutionary councils and other small councils and we have agreed on a written statement we will show it to media soon,"" he claimed. Trouble is Naker claims loyalty from some of the same councils. Meanwhile, the overnight thump of heavy guns being fired off for fun across many of Tripoli's neighborhoods has dwindled. But no-one here is fooled that they've gone silent for good. Tensions are leading to uncertainty. No-one wants to be boxed in like they were with Gadhafi, lives bounded by parameters. Revolution has given a taste of freedom and the capital's citizens desperately want that seductive flavor on tap for good, enshrined in a genuine democracy before Islamists or anyone else starts taking their choices away. When the men in uniforms with guns and not the politicians in suits start to argue, people get afraid. Both Belhaj and Naker say they want to resolve their differences by talking. But over the past few weeks since Gadhafi's family fled his Babal az Azia palace, misunderstanding and distrust have grown. Reversing it is proving to be a formidable challenge.","Abdul Hakim Belhaj seized control as the military commander of Tripoli .
