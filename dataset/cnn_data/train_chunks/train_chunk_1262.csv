"A coalition row over the tax rate for high earners erupted today as Lib Dem Danny Alexander insisting it will be cut to 40p ‘over my dead body’. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury said he would never allow it to happen ahead of the 2015 election. But Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson said the current 45p rate was not reasonable, and warned the Lib Dems about make bold threats because the last thing he wanted to see was ‘the dead body of Danny Alexander’. Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander (left) said he would not allow Tory Chancellor George Osborne to give in to pressure from senior Conservatives to signal a further cut in the top rate of tax to 40p . The future of the tax rate paid by people earning more than £150,000 has become a major political battleground. In the last weeks of the Labour government then-Chancellor Alistair Darling increased it from 40p to 50p. Tory Chancellor George Osborne then cut it to 45p in 2012, claiming the measure had raised ‘next to nothing’ for the Treasury. Ed Balls has vowed to return it to 50p if Labour wins the next election, but Tories are pushing for it to be reduced further to 40p. However Mr Alexander, the second most senior Lib Dem in the government, refused to yield to the Conservative demands. London Mayor Boris Johnson said the Lib Dems should not make hollow threats that they cannot keep . ‘I think it is right at 45 per cent. I wouldn't go to cutting below 45 per cent,’ he told the Daily Mirror. ‘I would say that would happen over my dead body.’ At Prime Minister’s Questions last week David Cameron refused to rule out a further cut, insisting only that his priority for expensive tax cuts were those on low and middle incomes. Asked about the Tories’ ambiguity, Mr Alexander said: ‘You'll have to ask them why they answer those questions in those ways. ‘If you ask me would I cut the top rate below 45p the answer is “no”. In this Parliament we will not allow that to happen.’ However, the Conservatives have refused to rule out promising a further cut, believing it will help to attract investors and entrepreneurs to the UK. Mr Johnson warned the Lib Dems against threats about blocking a cut which might be difficult tostand by. ‘The last thing I want to see is pointless sacrifice from the Liberal Democrats, let alone the dead body of Danny Alexander,’ the London mayor told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘Who can say what will happen to Danny Alexander? Stranger things have happened at sea. ‘I don’t think it is reasonable always to keep UK tax rates higher than those of competitor countries. ‘UK income tax is now higher than the average in the EU; that never used to be the case, I don’t see why that should be the case for the long term and I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t bring it down.’ He said he could not ‘believe’ that the Tories will go into the next election in 2015 promising to keep tax rates higher than other countries. However Labour attacked Mr Alexander for supporting the cut from 50p to 45p. Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: 'Danny Alexander seems to have forgotten that just 10 months ago he cut the top rate of tax for the top 1 per cent of earners. 'And that was after saying anybody who wanted to do this was living in ""cloud cuckoo land"". 'Labour will reverse this tax cut for millionaires as we balance the books in the next Parliament in a fairer way. It tells you everything you need to know about David Cameron and George Osborne that they haven't ruled out cutting the top rate of tax again.'","Chief Secretary to the Treasury vows to block any Tory moves to cut more .

"Monolith: An artist's impression of the new 73-story skyscraper that could be built in London's Docklands. If the plan is green-lit, it will be Britain's tallest residential tower . A 73-storey skyscraper is set to become the tallest residential tower in Britain. A British architectural firm have submitted plans for a slim £400 million, 250 metre skyscraper in London's Docklands that will break the record for the nation's tallest block of flats. Foster and Partners have submitted plans to the local authority, Tower Hamlets Council, for the towering building to add to the capital's soaring skyline. If built it will take the record from St George Wharf Tower, also known as the Vauxhall Tower or The Tower, a 181 metre, 50-storey residential skyscraper in Vauxhall. The proposed apartment block will involve the demolition of office blocks on the South Quay Plaza on the Isle of Dogs to create 947 new homes. The development also includes a 36-storey tower fronting onto Marsh Wall to accompany the South Dock building. The proposals also outline approximately 20,000 sq. ft. of new retail, dining and entertainment space and will also include a public open space with a riverside walkway. Harry Lewis, Managing Director of Berkeley Homes, which is working with the architects, said: 'South Quay Plaza has a vital role to play in revitalising this dockside location - we have been working closely with the Borough and the Greater London Authority and, with their support, aim to create over 900 homes and more than 1.5 acres of landscaped open space. 'Opportunities to deliver such significant public realm in Canary Wharf are few and far between.' The planning application was submitted in early April and Berkeley will be working with London Borough of Tower Hamlets to secure planning permission later in the year. Construction is likely to start in January 2015. Compared to many other world-class cities, London had very few tall buildings until the development of Canary Wharf in 1988 and, later, the Gherkin and the Shard. As well as the 73-storey building, the plans include retail and entertainment space and a walkway . If it is approved by council planners, work on the scheme could start early next year . In March an architectural think-tank claimed 236 buildings of more than 20 storeys could be on the way, four fifths of them intended as high-rise blocks of flats. They are set to drastically reshape the London skyline, with 33 of them between 40 and 49 floors, and 22 with 50 or more. The building boom is concentrated in London's centre and the east, which together account for 77 per cent of the new skyscrapers. Tower Hamlets, Lambeth, Greenwich, Newham and Southwark will between them have 140 of the 236 towers. Ever skyward: The capital is experiencing a boom in skyscrapers. The Shard (left), London's tallest building and the 37-storey 20 Fenchurch Street (right), better known as the 'Walkie-Talkie',  is currently under construction . Foreign investors from east Asia, who . are buying into London property in unprecedented numbers, are also . having an effect as they are comfortable with tall buildings which have . long been part of the urban landscape in that region. The . Mayor's office is trying to strike a balance between protection of the . city's historic skyline and the need to house a million more people and . create half-a-million new jobs, said sir Edward Lister, deputy mayor for . planning. 'Tall buildings . will not be appropriate in many locations,' Shaun Andrews, head of . Investor and Developer planning from GL Hearn told MailOnline. 'However, . we cannot freeze the skyline and suspend the capital in stasis. The . strength of London is in its diversity and its ability to respond and . adapt to opportunities originating from both home and abroad.'","The slimline £400m Docklands building will break the record if approved .

"These extraordinary photographs show the moment two of Australia's richest men started brawling in the street after falling out when one of them left his wife and started dating model Miranda Kerr. James Packer and David Gyngell, both media moguls, have been friends since childhood, and Mr Gyngell was best man at Mr Packer's wedding to wife Erica. But last year Mr Packer, 46 - son of pioneering broadcaster Kerry Packer - announced that he had separated from his wife, and allegedly began a relationship with Ms Kerr, Orlando Bloom's ex-wife. Scroll down for video . Fight club: James Packer, left, and David Gyngell, right, were pictured brawling on the street in Sydney . Quiet word: Packer and Gyngell infamously brawled outside the billionaire's mansion last Sunday, caught by paparazzi waiting for a shot of the casino mogul and his girlfriend Miranda Kerr . Rumble in the burbs: Packer sported a black eye for days following his very public wrestling match with Gyngell . Mr Gyngell, 48, apparently confronted . his friend outside his Sydney home, and the pair began rowing about Mr . Packer's treatment of his estranged spouse. The . two men, who both own extensive entertainment businesses, had to be . separated by bodyguards, and were later fined $500 (£280) each for . 'offensive behaviour'. Mr Gyngell accepted responsibility for the fight and pledged to co-operate with the police investigation into the incident. 'He . fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident,' a spokesman . said. 'Clearly, had he not turned up at Packer's premises in an angry . mood then the confrontation would never have occurred.' Wrestle: The two men grappled with each other in broad daylight . Money punch: The fight between gambling billionaire and Channel 9 boss made headlines around the world . The pair have told friends that they regret the fight and insist they will remain on good terms. Mr . Gyngell's wife Leila McKinnon today poked fun at the controversy, . comparing it to the fight between Beyoncé's wife Jay-Z and her sister . Solange Knowles. 'Ok . so they're much better dressed and a little more discreet but I feel a . kinship with Beyonce, Solange, and Jay Z today,' she tweeted. Solange was caught on camera in New York's Standard Hotel wildly attacking Jay Z after the Met Gala after-party, requiring burly security guards to break up the fracas. Beach bums: Packer and Gyngell's dress code gave no hint of what they are both worth . Love fight: Mr Gyngell's wife Leila McKinnon, left, has joked about the quarrel which apparently started after Mr Packer started dating model Miranda Kerr, right . Ms McKinnon's light-hearted stab at her husband and his best man was well received by her Twitter followers and has so far been retweeted more than 80 times. A Channel 9 publicist said: 'Leila is on maternity leave and not doing interviews as such... she really doesn’t have anything to add.' James Packer and David Gyngell are both the scions of families which created television in Australia and - at least until now - had been friends for much of their lives. Mr Packer, 46, is the grandson of Sir Frank Packer, who founded the station which would eventually become the Nine Network, Australia's first commercial TV network. His father was Kerry Packer, notorious for transforming the world of cricket when he paid many of the world's top stars to join a breakaway league in the 1970s. When James inherited the business empire, he invested in a number of casinos in Australia and south-east Asia, and he also owns the Aspinalls Club in Mayfair. Pals: James Packer, left, and David Gyngell, right, have been friends since they were at school together . He married Erica in 2007 and the couple have three children together, but they announced they would separate in September last year and Mr Packer is now believed to be dating Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr. The mogul is friends with Tom Cruise, and has publicly flirted with adopting the actor's Scientology faither. Mr Gyngell, 48, is the son of Bruce Gyngell, who helped Sir Frank Packer set up the Nine Network and became the first person ever to appear on a national television broadcast in 1956. He became friends with Mr Packer when the pair attended the private Cranbrook School in Sydney, and they have remained close since. Mr Gyngell is chairman of Nine Entertainment Co., which owns Nine Network as well as a number of other media businesses. He is married to Leila McKinnon, a presenter on the same network, and his sister Skye Gyngell is a celebrity chef based in London.","James Packer and David Gyngell were seen fighting on street in Sydney .

"Greek political leaders were locked in talks this evening as they bid to hammer out a historic power-sharing deal to secure a 130billion euro bailout package. Outgoing Prime Minister George Papandreou and his opposite number Antonis Samara held fresh negotiations by telephone hours after reaching the agreement to form a coalition government. The new government’s first job will be to the passing of the latest bailout, agreed on October 27, before holding elections. Papandreou, who could resign later this evening, also spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders. Embattled: Greece's Prime Minister George Papandreou is struggling to agree who will be his replacement . President Papoulias (right) welcomes the Mr Papandreou at the beginning of their hour-long meeting . The leaders were said to be wary of the latest announcement from Athens. Mrs Merkel’s spokesman Steffen . Seibert said: ‘Europe, and the German government too, must be able to . see that the Greeks are serious, that it is not just about announcements . but about actions.’ And French Foreign Minister Alain . Juppe added: ‘Things are heading in the right direction... but what's . important is that the bailout plan for Greece gets ratified.’ Europe's markets also remained . cautious that the power deal would resolve the country's political . turmoil and alleviate concerns over Greece's membership of the euro. Former European Central Bank vice . president Lucas Papademos, 64, is being tipped as the most likely new . head of the government that would serve until a February 19 general . election. He will step in after Athens gave in to EU demands to install a coalition government of ‘national salvation’ last night. All European markets opened sharply lower today, though shares on the stock exchange in Athens were trading around 2 per cent higher. The interim government is expected to . be in place for three to four months to ensure a new European debt deal . and secure a vital instalment of bailout loans that Greece needs to . avoid default. Opposition leader Antonis Samaras snubbed the idea of a coalition government insisting what Greece needs is 'immediate elections' G20 in Cannes: David Cameron calls for action from the Eurozone to solve its debt crisis yesterday . A member of Mr Papandreou’s Pasok . party, Telemachos Hitiris, had warned: ‘Everything must be done within . the day, otherwise tomorrow it will be hell.’ The EU has been accused of carrying . out a coup d’etat in Greece, after the head of the European Commission . threatened the country with ‘paralysis’ unless MPs removed their prime . minister. Jose Manuel Barroso, the EC . president, had warned that Greece would not get its next payment from . the EU and International Monetary Fund unless Mr Papandreou was toppled. EU leaders were horrified that Mr . Papandreou said a referendum should be held to approve a 100billion euro . bailout deal, which will result in a decade of tax rises and spending . cuts. German politician Peter Altmaier . insisted that Greece’s future in the eurozone would depend on the . implementation of long-term economic reforms. ‘We have made it clear we want to . preserve the euro,’ the deputy parliamentary leader of Chancellor Angela . Merkel’s Christian Democrats said. ‘At the final stage, it depends what . happens inside Greece.’ Warm greeting: U.S President Barack Obama and French President Nicolas Sarkozy shake hands as they attend a French - United States alliance ceremony at the Cannes City Hall yesterday . Demonstration: Anti-globalisation activists lie down outside a bank in Nice yesterday as they protest against the G20 summit . Meanwhile, Joachim Fels, of Morgan . Stanley Research, warned that the admission by EU leaders that countries . could leave out of the eurozone threatened even more turmoil. ‘Chancellor Merkel and [French . president Nicolas] Sarkozy, in response to the idea of a Greek . referendum on the bailout package, raised the possibility of a country . leaving the euro – so far a taboo in European political circles,’ he . said in a note to investors. ‘By raising the possibility that a . country might leave the euro, core European governments may have set in . motion a sequence of events which could potentially lead to runs on . sovereigns and banks in peripheral countries that make everything we . have seen so far in this crisis look benign.’ Now that one stricken eurozone leader . has been ousted, EU officials are said to be seeking Silvio Berlusconi’s . head amid mounting concerns over his country’s failure to get to grips . with its huge debts. Yves Mersch, a member of the ECB’s . governing council, warned yesterday that it may stop buying Italy’s debt . if its government  does not adopt promised finan- cial reforms. ‘Our job is not to remedy the errors . of politicians,’ he said. The head of the International Monetary Fund, . Christine Lagarde, has claimed that Italy’s plans to reduce its debts . ‘lack credibility’. Mr Berlusconi yesterday insisted he . had enough support to continue as leader, even as 20 government MPs . threatened to break ranks in a key vote on the country’s budget. Turmoil: Greece's government is in chaos as it tries to create a coalition . One newspaper, Corriere della Sera, . compared the atmosphere in his People of Freedom Party to ‘the end of . Pompeii’, but despite the rebellion Mr Berlusconi insisted: ‘I have . checked the numbers, and even with the defections we still have a . majority in parliament.’ Insiders said that the billionaire . media tycoon spent the weekend speaking to rebels and waiverers, urging . them to back him in the crucial vote – despite having labelled  them . ‘traitors’. Many believe Mr Berlusconi is spending . too much time focusing on his four ongoing trials, including one . relating to sex with an underage prostitute, instead of trying to . resolve the situation in the eurozone’s third-largest economy. The Italian premier is widely seen as . incapable of saving Italy from economic meltdown, with the country’s . public debt standing at 1.9trillion euros – the equivalent of 120 per . cent of GDP.","Greece to create a coalition government of 'national salvation'

"Dr Nick Ovenden has produced a mathematical formula that will guarantee the perfect tennis serve, first time and every time . A maths professor has created an equation that he claims is key to the 'perfect' tennis serve - a fast, flat serve that hits the same spot every time, but with unpredictable top spin. Dr Nick Ovenden has produced a mathematical formula that will guarantee the perfect tennis serve, first time and every time. But although he knows what the players need to produce in maths terms, he has no plans to replace their coaches. Dr Ovenden, a lecturer in applied mathematics at University College London, said: ‘I was given a question about what is the perfect tennis serve so I thought about how professional tennis players win games. ‘A fast tennis serve is great, if you have a fast serve that's wonderful but if you keep doing the same serve over and over again your opponents will be able to respond to it. ‘You need to put some degree of uncertainty into it whilst still having control.’ Players use spin to create that uncertainty, adding either top spin or side spin to their serve, he said. He said that spin changes the trajectory of the ball through the air, something called the ‘Magnus effect’. Varying degrees of spin either pull the ball down to the ground faster, giving a higher bounce, or cause it to curve. According to Dr Ovenden, a typical player can spin the ball at 2,000-2,500 revolutions per minute. And despite a difference in service speeds between men and women, their spin rates are often similar. He said he has calculated an equation that will help players serve a ball into the same spot of the service box as if they played a fast flat serve - but with topspin. ‘You want to add this uncertainty of spin, but you want to put the ball in the same place,’ he said. Andy Murray in action during his win over Marcos Baghdatis . ‘You want the ball to go in the far corner of the service box but you want spin on it. ‘The equation doesn't tell you how you should move the racquet, it tells you how the ball should be moving when it leaves the racquet. ‘It gives you a nice relationship between the speed you hit the ball at, the spin you put on it, and the angle you aim it up and down.‘It tells you which way the ball goes and how.’ The equation relates to serve speed, height of the ball when it is hit, and the ball's angle of elevation as it leaves the racket, along with the top spin in revolutions per second. Other fixed parameters are the horizontal distance the ball has to cover, around 18-19 metres, the impact of aerodynamic drag per metre travelled, and the Magnus force effect. Dr Ovenden said the formula shows how putting top spin on the ball reduces the left-hand side of the equation so the player has to alter the serve in another way to rebalance it. Serving with top spin must be compensated for, he said, either by stretching the height of the serve, increasing the speed, or slightly increasing the elevation angle. But he said despite finding the mathematical formula, he does not plan on replacing tennis coaches. ‘I'm not aiming to replace tennis coaches, because they can tell you exactly how to do this. ‘I've not modelled what the racquet should be doing, just the ball, so I won't be starting to give tennis lessons any time soon.’ Dr Ovenden worked with Acer and Intel on the equation as part of a series of activities to celebrate the launch of the new Acer Intel Ultrabook series.","Formula 'guarantees' fast, flat serve with top spin .

"Order: Michaela Hutchings, 23, was spared jail but given six months to pay back the money she spent in a two-day spree after finding £52,000 in her account . A single mother who went on a huge shopping spree after discovering £52,000 had mistakenly been put into her bank account has been ordered to pay it back - or face prison. Michaela Hutchings, 23, spent £9,000 on designer shoes, handbags and sunglasses in a two-day spending splurge after finding the transfer from her local council. She also gave her mother £1,000 in cash and put £40,000 into a savings account, before she was caught by police on April 24 last year. A judge spared her prison when she admitted dishonesty and retaining a wrongly-credited bank transfer when she appeared at Stafford Crown Court. However, she now has six months to repay the money or serve 20 months in prison. She was also given a 12-month community order and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. A confiscation hearing at Stafford Crown Court on Tuesday ordered her to repay £52,465.21 - the £51,821.34 bank transfer plus £643.87 interest. Most of the money has been recovered but Hutchings still owes a total of £5,733.77 from the designer clothes and interest which was accrued. If she fails to repay the money by Christmas Eve she will be jailed for one year and eight months. A police spokesman said: 'The clothing and accessories will now be sold at auction in order to help pay the Confiscation Order. 'The Crown asked that a Compensation Order be made so that the entire sum could be paid back to Lichfield District Council.' An administrative error meant Lichfield District Council accidentally transferred £51,821.34 into her account instead of Bromford Housing Association. The council managed to stop a further £44,500 being transferred into Hutchings’ account and desperately tried to trace her to explain the error. But by the time they caught Hutchings, . she had already spent over £9,000 after going on a shopping spree at . Birmingham’s Bullring centre with her partner. She bought almost £5,000 worth of goods by Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Ralph Lauren and Dior. Designer: The single mother, pictured left in Gucci sunglasses, spent £9,000 on shoes, bags and sunglasses . Sentenced: If she fails to repay the money and do 150 hours unpaid work, she faces 20 months in prison . The court heard Hutchings and her partner bought designer clothes, shoes, jeans, sunglasses and other luxuries. When she was caught officers discovered she had transferred £40,000 into an investment account after taking advice from her bank who were unaware of the mistake. Hutchings sparked fury when she defended her actions, claiming that 'anyone would have done the same.' Speaking shortly after conviction, she said: 'All this is my fault and I feel so sorry. I put my family in a position where they are being looked down on by everyone. 'I’m sorry but before you judge me put yourself in my shoes.' Out of the £51,821.34 wrongly put into her account, the police have recovered £46,087.57 - leaving a shortfall of £5,733.77. After her designer clothes have been auctioned, Hutchings will be ordered to pay back the difference or face Christmas - and the January Sales - behind bars.","Michaela Hutchings spent £9,000 on shopping and gave mother £1,000 .

"France's luxury property market has hit a selling 'panic' as millionaires rush to flee the socialist government's looming tax hikes, a leading estate agent has revealed. More than 400 Paris homes worth more than €1million have been put on the market since President Francois Hollande came to power in May - more than double the same period last year. Many of France's super-rich want to escape to 'wealth-friendly' countries like Britain, Switzerland and Luxembourg. Exodus: The super-wealthy appear to be abandoning Paris (pictured) for wealth-friendly countries. A total of 400 homes worth more than 1million euro in the French capital have been put on the market since May . The exodus has been triggered by a new higher tax of 75 per cent on all earnings over €1million - £780,000 - which will come into force later this year. They also fear more tough new taxes on moving money overseas and sales of company shares. Paris estate agent Daniel Feau said: 'It's nearly a general panic. Some 400 to 500 residences worth more than €1million have come onto the Paris market since May. 'And the profile of those who are leaving has changed, from the idle rich to managers of major international corporations and entrepreneurs who are scared of a marginal tax rate of 62.21 percent on sales of stock.' Thibault de Saint Vincent, president of Barnes France estate agents, added: 'With the Internet it is now possible to work in any corner of the world. 'Those who are going abroad fear a future taxes on income and capital movements.' Looming tax rise: France's super-wealthy have been looking to relocate since Francois Hollande (pictured) came to power . In London, recruitment agency Astbury Martin - which specialises in highly-paid banking jobs - said it had seen a 51 per cent in applications from French jobseekers. Managing director Jonathan Nicholson said: 'There is a definite spike in French-speaking candidates. 'We have not seen similar increases in candidates from other countries, so it may well be connected to May's change in government in France.' A separate survey by website Totaljobs.com revealed 42 percent of French workers were willing to move to the UK, compared to only 32 percent of the global workforce which would be happy to work in France. And British estate agent Sotherby's said its French offices sold more than 100 properties over €1.7 million between April and June this year - a marked increase on the same period in 2011. Sotheby's French boss Alexander Kraft said: 'The result of the presidential election has had a real impact on our sales. 'Now a large number of wealthy French families are leaving the country as a direct result of the proposals of the new government. 'These properties are then bought up by foreign investors looking for a stable real estate market like France to invest in. 'It shows the high-end property market is holding up very well, even in these difficult times.' And a report earlier this year by British estate agent Knight Frank said the tax plans had sent French interest in luxury London homes rocketing. Inquiries from wealthy French for London homes worth more than five million pounds soared by 30 per cent in the first three months of this year, the statistics showed. And interest in homes worth between one and five million rose by 11 per cent, it was found. Heading for the UK? London recruitment agencies that specialise in highly-paid banking jobs had seen a 51 per cent rise in applications from French jobseekers . Liam Bailey, Knight Frank's global head of residential research, said: 'Evidence from web search activity backs up a noticeable spike in anecdotal comments from our office network, where French applicants have become much more noticeable in recent months.' Prime minister David Cameron angered the French in June when he said he would 'roll out the red carpet to wealthy French citizens and firms who wanted move out and pay their taxes in Britain. He told the B20 business summit in Mexico: 'If the French go ahead with a 75 per cent top rate of tax we will roll out the red carpet and welcome more French businesses to Britain and they can pay tax in Britain and pay for our health service and schools and everything else.' The comments left one French politician so offended he suggested Mr Cameron must have been 'drunk' when he made them. Gallic MP Claude Bartolone, a staunch ally of President Hollande, said: 'I hope that it was an after-dinner remark and that he didn't have all his wits about him when he said these things.' France's European Affairs Minister Bernard Cazeneuve insisted there was no 'exodus', adding: 'What I can answer to this statement from the British prime minister is that French bosses are patriots. 'There is a range of measures we will take in favour of business, measures that will support investment and encourage business to stay in France.'","Selling 'panic' on France's luxury property market as millionaires rush to flee looming tax hikes .

"A bumper crop of new potatoes has left growers in Jersey with a bumper problem – their spuds are too big for fussy British consumers. A combination of rain, sun and mild temperatures created perfect growing conditions. But as a result, many are larger than the ideal size of 2.5cm to 5cm – with some twice as big. Supermarkets are refusing to buy them and frustrated farmers are having to give tons of cast-offs to charity or leave them rotting in the fields. Waste: Good growing conditions has meant this year's crop of Jersey Royals have grown larger than usual. Now, piles of the potatoes are going to waste, pictured, because supermarkets won't by the bigger spuds . Tim Ward, sales and distribution director at Albert Bartlett potatoes, said his firm aims to produce potatoes no bigger than 50mm in diameter. He said any larger and customers gripe about having to slice them into pieces to cook them. He said: 'We’re producing plenty of potatoes the right size but a good percentage have gone beyond that. 'The quality is exceptional but sadly people don’t want new potatoes the size of baking potatoes. 'There is high wastage. Some of it gets returned to fields and a small amount for dairy fodder. There isn’t a lot we can do with it.' Mr Ward said the problem was being exacerbated by a huge surplus of potatoes across Europe and the rest of the UK, which has also enjoyed perfect growing conditions. The massive crop is in stark contrast to last year, when snow, frost and rain caused major delays to the Jersey Royal season and led to 10,000 tonnes fewer being exported. The crop was still worth £30m to the island in exports last year, however, in spite of the setbacks.Mr Ward said: 'This has been the best growing season since 1997, when they generated 58,000 tonnes of crop. Crop: Peak season for growing Royals, one field ready for harvest pictured, is in May - when 1,500 tonnes of the potatoes are exported . 'It’s been incredible and there has been nothing to stop the crop growing. 'Normally you’d get frost or north-easterly winds or really wet or really dry weather, but we’ve had a perfect growing season. This year has been the best growing year for the Jersey Royal since 1997 - when 58,000 tonnes of the potato were exported from the Channel Island. This year, thanks to excellent growing conditions, the average potato plant has produced 10 to 12 potatoes - compared to four to six normally. Producers do not like to sell potatoes of over 55mm in diameter to the supermarkets - as then customers are more likely to have to chop them up in order to cook them properly. The crop accounts for around 70 per cent of the island's agricultural turnover - with 99 per cent of produce exported to the UK. Up to 1,500 tonnes of potatoes are exported from Jersey during peak season - which usually falls in May. 'It has meant a bumper crop but unfortunately it hasn’t just been confined to Jersey - the whole of Europe has experienced the same and there are potatoes coming from every conceivable area.' William Church, director of sales and marketing at the Jersey Royal Company, said his firm is experiencing a similar problem, with his potatoes growing so large that up to 50 percent could be wasted. He said: 'Last year each plant was producing between four and six potatoes but this year plants are producing between 10 and 12. 'It’s been a little bit of rain, little bit of warmth, no frost or harsh winds so the quality and availability has been fantastic. 'This time last year, the crops were really hammered by weather conditions - we’ve gone from chalk to cheese. 'We have a lot of competition coming in from the markets and there are a huge amount of English potatoes also being offered.' Jersey Royals account for around 70 percent of Jersey’s annual agricultural turnover and 99 percent of the channel island’s production is exported to the UK. The peak of the season is May, when up to 1,500 tonnes of Royals can be exported daily. The kidney-shaped spuds enjoys the same EU designation of origin protection as Champagne, Stilton cheese and Cumberland sausages.","Good weather has meant Jersey Royals have grown larger than normal .

"Barack Obama claimed that the AARP had endorsed his plans to reform Medicare during the first presidential debate in Denver last night. But just a few hours later the senior citizens' group spoke out to deny that it was supporting the President, and insisted that it did not wish to be drawn into the political horse-race. The rejection of his message came as another blow for Mr Obama, who has been widely pilloried for his underwhelming performance in a debate which most commentators agreed was won by Mitt Romney. Under fire: Barack Obama has been criticised for enlisting the support of the AARP during Wednesday's debate . Clash: The President criticised Mitt Romney's plans to reform Medicare and introduce a voucher system . The Republican challenger repeated a well-rehearsed argument that the President had cut $716billion from Medicare in order to fund his own 'Obamacare' health reform. In response, Mr Obama denounced his opponent's plan to replace part of Medicare with a voucher programme for future retirees. 'I don’t think vouchers are the right way to go,' the President said. 'And this is not only my opinion. 'AARP thinks that the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.' Greeting: But the candidates had harsh words for each other before this family get-together at the end . Minutes later, he made another reference to the powerful organisation which represents close to 40million elderly Americans. 'When you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of insurance companies,' Mr Obama argued. 'And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck. 'And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.' But in a statement issued late on Wednesday night, senior vice-president John Hishta rejected the link between the AARP and the President's re-election campaign. Jeered: Mr Romney's running mate Paul Ryan received a hostile reception when he pledged to repeal Obamacare during the AARP convention in New Orleans last month . 'While we respect the rights of each campaign to make its case to voters, AARP has never consented to the use of its name by any candidate or political campaign,' he said. 'AARP is a non-partisan organisation and we do not endorse political candidates nor co-ordinate with any candidate or political party.' The group drew controversy in 2009 when it publicly pledged support for Mr Obama's signature healthcare reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. And its members entered the political fray once again last month when they booed Mr Romney's running mate Paul Ryan after he promised to repeal Obamacare while addressing the AARP convention in New Orleans. The elderly are considered a crucial voting bloc, as they are disproportionately likely to make it to the polls on November 6 and make up a large part of the population of key swing states such as Florida.","President claims AARP supports Obamacare and opposes Republicans' voucher-based reform of Medicare during first presidential debate in Denver .

"They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But for one man from northern China, this was not the case. Earlier this year, Jian Feng, divorced and sued his wife for being ugly. Before and after: Jian Feng's wife spent US$100,000 on plastic surgery before she got married . He won his case and was awarded a little under £75,000 by the judge, Fox 31 reported. Mr Feng said he took issue with his wife’s looks only after the couple’s daughter was born. He was shocked by the child’s appearance, calling her ‘incredibly ugly’ and saying she looked like neither one of her parents. Mr Feng was so outraged that he initially accused his wife of cheating. Faced with the accusation, his wife admitted to spending around £62,000 on plastic surgery which had altered her appearance drastically. She had the work done before she met her husband and never told him about it after they met. Mr Feng filed for divorce saying his wife had deceived him and convinced him to marry her under false pretenses.

Brutal: Students holding replica 95 semi-automatic rifles practice during bodyguard training school . 'When we started our business, most of our clients were celebrities,' said Chen, 30. 'Most of our clients now are rich entrepreneurs. It's all related to their business because I think bodyguards are also a status symbol.' China's new wealthy are not generally targeted by criminals and kidnappers - as happens in countries such as Venezuela - but anger is growing about the widening gap between rich and poor.

Tianjiao has hired trainers from Israel and Russia, and is looking to France and Britain as well, Chen said, although the company also works closely with the Chinese military. 'We provide a better platform for retired soldiers, of whom there are thousands every year, so they can get a better job. It would be a waste of talent if these soldiers work as security guards for 2,000 yuan a month,' he said. 'Also if they commit crimes and do bad things, it would be a terrible thing for society. But getting high-end training with us and getting a job as a bodyguard is much better, so the army is very grateful for this kind of arrangement we offer.'

"Last year Nasa revealed plans to capture an asteroid and bring it closer to Earth for future astronauts to study. And in a series of new papers the agency has revealed just how - and why - it might be done. They explain the various technologies that will be needed for such a mission, and also say that it could help save Earth from a catastrophic impact in future. Scroll down for video . Papers from Nasa HQ in Washington DC have revealed how the agency intends to capture an asteroid by the end of this decade. And they also explain how astronauts will visit the asteroid (illustrated) in the 2020s . The six papers are available from the agency at the Asteroid Initiative Related Documents page. Nasa’s ultimate goal is to send humans to Mars, and they say the Asteroid Redirect Mission (Arm) will be an important stepping stone towards getting there. A number of new spaceflight capabilities will be tested in the 2020s as part of the mission, which will involve redirecting an asteroid to orbit the moon and sending humans to explore it. Nasa plans to launch an Arm robotic spacecraft to rendezvous with, capture and redirect an asteroid by the end of this decade. The mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. After the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object. Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows. After the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loops around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean - likely the Pacific - 10 days later. The mission is seen as an important step towards eventually sending humans to Mars and returning them safely. The spacecraft will redirect it to a stable orbit around the moon called a 'Distant Retrograde Orbit' - one that orbits the moon very widely, coming quite close before extending out much further away. Astronauts aboard Nasa's Orion spacecraft, launched from the upcoming Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, will then explore the asteroid in the mid-2020s at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon. Within the papers, authors explain the current work taking place across the country to examine options for these robotic and crewed missions. This includes advanced Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) - one of the critical technologies needed to send larger payloads into deep space and to the Mars system. SEP - or ion propulsion - creates thrust powered by solar arrays, which transforms sunlight into electromagnetic fields that accelerate and expel charged atoms (ions). This is a very efficient way to power a spacecraft and significantly cuts down on the amount of fuel a spacecraft needs to carry, which can be heavy and expensive to launch from Earth. Current studies at Nasa detailed in the papers are examining ways SEP will be used to power the Arm robotic mission. Nasa is also working on two mission concepts for asteroid capture: one would fully enclose a large asteroid using an inflatable system and the other would capture a smaller boulder from of a much larger asteroid using robotic arms. The agency will choose one of the two concepts to go ahead with later this year. The agency is considering two options for the Asteroid Redirect Mission. One involves picking up a boulder from a large asteroid (shown) and taking it to lunar orbit, where it would be studied by astronauts . The other method would grab an asteroid in an inflatable bag (illustrated). Both mission concepts would bring their respective asteroids back to lunar orbit. Here they would be visited by astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft. The astronauts would study the asteroid and collect samples before returning to Earth . The Arm crewed mission, in which astronauts will explore the redirected asteroid around the moon, provides unique opportunities to test human spaceflight capabilities as well. The papers detail current work underway at Nasa to upgrade spacesuits in preparation for the first spacewalks in deep space since the 1960s and farther from Earth than ever before. Concepts for new hardware to dock the crewed and uncrewed spacecraft together are also in development. This will allow the crew aboard Orion to attach to the Arm robotic spacecraft and study the asteroid. This could be later used to connect Orion with a deep space habitat or 'stepping stone' on its way to Mars, or even station cargo and fuel depots in strategic places such as lunar orbit. Astronauts returning home with samples from Mars will hold a treasure trove of research scientists will study to unlock new knowledge about Mars and the solar system's history. Various techniques for deflecting a potentially hazardous asteroid could be tested on Arm to enable planetary defense capabilities. These techniques include Ion Beam Deflection, Enhanced Gravity Tractor, and kinetic impactors. In Ion Beam Deflection, the plumes from the thrusters would be directed towards the asteroid to gently push on its surface over a wide area. A thruster firing in the opposite direction would be needed to keep the spacecraft at a constant distance from the asteroid. The Ion Beam Deflection approach is independent of the size of the asteroid, and it could be demonstrated on either mission option. In the Enhanced Gravity Tractor approach, the spacecraft would first pick up a boulder from the asteroid’s surface as in mission Option B. The spacecraft with the collected boulder would then orbit in a circular halo around the asteroid’s velocity vector. The mass of the boulder coupled with the mass of the spacecraft would increase the gravitational attraction between the spacecraft and the asteroid. By flying the spacecraft in close formation with the asteroid for several months the very small gravitational forces would produce a measurable change in the asteroid’s trajectory. A kinetic impactor could also be launched as a secondary payload with the spacecraft or on a separate launch vehicle, and it would collide with the target asteroid at high velocity while the spacecraft observed the impact. Nasa is currently developing the huge Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, illustration shown, which will be the largest rocket ever when it flies later this decade. SLS is seen as a vital component for a future mission to Mars as a large lifting capability will needed to take all the equipment required for such a mission . Nasa says this the Asteroid Redirect Mission is an important way to test new technologies that will be needed for an eventual mission to Mars (illustrated). It could also help us test the methods that would be needed to redirect a planet-destroying asteroid if one was heading towards Earth . As well as this, returning asteroid samples will help Nasa develop  tools and techniques for future space exploration. This early experience with raw materials could also help advance our ability to make use of natural resources in space. Rocky bodies like asteroids and our moon could hold enough oxygen and hydrogen to create breathable air, drinkable water or even components for rocket fuel. There also is growing interest in the commercial space industry to potentially mine asteroids for resources in the future. With this in mind some of the papers outline ways in which Arm might benefit future commercial activities at asteroids - namely collecting resources for use back on Earth or in space. The Asteroid Redirect Mission will provide humans with the first chance to study asteroids in situ space. After the mission is completed the astronauts will return safely to Earth (illustrated)","Papers from Nasa HQ in Washington DC have revealed how the agency intends to capture an asteroid by the end of this decade .

"Sarah Storey stormed to victory in the women's cycling road race today to claim her eleventh Paralympic gold medal, prompting speculation she could be in line for a damehood. The swimmer-turned-cyclist took first place at Brands Hatch with an imperious performance in the women's C4-5 road race for her fourth gold of the London 2012. With the win Storey completed a clean sweep of her cycling events at the Games. Her career total of 11 gold medals matches the achievements of Paralympic greats Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson and Dave Roberts. Another great Briton: Sarah Storey celebrates winning the Women's C4-5 Individual Road Race on day 8 of the London 2012 Paralympic Games at Brands Hatch . Riding into the record books: Storey holds aloft the Union Flag as she cycles a victory lap around the Brands Hatch course. Her victory means she has equalled the record set by Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson . The 34-year-old's achievement is particularly impressive because she has earned her medals in two different sports. She won the first of her five Paralympic golds in swimming at the Barcelona Games of 1992, when she was only 14 years old. She switched to cycling in 2005 following an ear infection, and today's victory brought her sixth gold medal in the sport. Storey attacked from the start of the eight-lap event and finished in one hour 40 minutes, ahead of the men's C1-3 field which started in front of her. Speaking after the race, the . Manchester-based cyclist said: 'I can't believe I pulled it off today. I'm just so chuffed, it was amazing.' She hailed the fans who lined the track, adding: 'I wanted to say thank you to the crowds but had to keep my head down. 'I just can't get over it.' The only Briton to have more success . in the Paralympics is swimmer Mike Kenny, who won 16 gold medals from 1976 to 1988, with some of his successes coming in a 25-metre pool. Phenomenon: Storey finished in one hour 40 minutes, ahead of the men's C1-3 field which started in front of her . Speaking before Storey's latest gold, Baroness Grey-Thompson praised Storey's versatility and dedication to her 'second sport'. 'She's been such an amazing athlete for years,' she said. 'I've known Sarah since she was 14, . since her first Paralympics. We go back a long way. I've been around . when she's had ups and downs. 'As a friend, you want her to do the best she can and I want her to do really well. 'It's good for her and for cycling that she's going well. With two track, two road, it's a pretty tough schedule.' Storey's win comes just a day after . she romped to victory in the women's C5 cycling time trial with a time . of 22 minutes 40 seconds, also at Brands Hatch. During this year's Games she has also . taken two golds in the velodrome. Well done, auntie! Eleven-time champion Sarah Storey shows her gold medal to her nephew Gethin Crayford . Storey also competes against able-bodied . athletes and this year only just missed on a place in the Olympic team . for the women's team pursuit. Speaking about matching Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson's Paralympic medal haul, Storey said: 'It is fantastic, a . great feeling. I didn't expect to be able to catch her as quickly. 'I . suppose it did look easy but mentally you have to prepare and make it . happen. I have to respect all my competitors.' She . said of her success yesterday in the time trial: ‘To compete in a home Games like this with . all the crowds is a dream come true and I feel honoured to have been . here.’ Meanwhile, Great Britain's Mark Colbourne had to settle for silver in the men's C1 time-trial. Colbourne, . who won individual pursuit gold in the velodrome, clocked 25mins 29secs . on the 16km course, but Michael Teuber of Germany pipped him to . victory, finishing first in 25:16. It . was the 42-year-old Welshman's third medal of his first Games after . breaking his back in a paragliding accident three years ago. 'I gave it everything, I'm happy with my silver,' Colbourne said. 'I'm very proud of what I've done today.' You're not supposed to eat it! Storey lets her nephew Gethin Crayford, who will be two later this month, play with her medal . by ROB PREECE . Twenty years ago, a shy and nervous 14-year-old called Sarah Bailey took part in her first Paralympics in Barcelona - and immediately became a star by winning two gold medals in the pool. Now known by her married name, Sarah Storey has gone on to win an incredible 11 golds, excelling in cycling as well as swimming. As Storey takes the plaudits for another stunning performance in the women's C4-5 cycling road race, Mail Online recalls how she won her first 10 Olympic titles. In the pool: Sarah Storey, then known by her maiden name Bailey, competes in the women's S10 100m backstroke final in Sydney. She finished second to claim silver . Barcelona 1992 . Storey, who was born without a functioning left hand after her arm became entangled in the umbilical cord in the womb, was one of Britain's youngest competitors at the Barcelona Paralympics.

"ISIS is plotting to smuggle militants into Western Europe disguised as refugees so that they can launch devastating terror attacks, according to US intelligence sources. Encrypted communications unravelled by American military intelligence have revealed that Islamic State leaders are planning to take advantage of the 'chaotic conditions' on the Syria-Turkey crossing. Relaxed border controls would allow IS militants to blend in with the thousands of genuine refugees spilling over the border in search of safety, reports International Business Times. Hundreds of Kurdish refugees cross the Syria-Turkey border every day as they flee to safety - now ISIS plans to disguise its militants as refugees in the hope that they can eventually infiltrate Western Europe . The Trojan Horse tactic would see fighters equipped with fake passports, leaving them free to travel around European countries and plot terrorist attacks unchecked. A US intelligence source, speaking to German newspaper Bild,  said that ISIS was moving away from plans to conduct aircraft hijackings  for fear of tight security - and that they were looking to land a new strategy. 'In view of the chaotic conditions on the Syria-Turkey border, it is nearly impossible to catch Isis terrorists in the wave of refugees,' wrote Bild. Because hundreds of refugees cross the Syrian-Turkish border every day, the jihadists have a good chance of remaining unnoticed in the crowds. Kurdish refugees seen fleeing the city of Kobane, just six miles away from the Turkish border . Turkey is also used by jihadists who want to join ISIS in Syria, as they do not require a visa to get there. They go on vacations as tourists and upon arrival have almost no trouble finding a way to cross the border. The discovery by US intelligence comes as the Syrian border city of Kobane continues to to bear the brunt of an ISIS offensive. Militants raised their flag over a building in the outskirts of the town this morning following an assault lasting almost three weeks, amid fears the town could fall to the jihadists within hours. A black flag belonging to ISIS was visible from across the Turkish border atop a four-storey building close to the scene of some of the most intense clashes in recent days. Despite the symbolic raising of the flag, the town's brave Kurdish defenders said the terrorists had not reached Kobane city centre and would not be allowed to do so 'for as long as we live'. A photograph taken from inside Turkey shows an ISIS flag on the hill overlooking the town of Kobane - also known as Ayn al-Arab - this morning. Just visible beyond the Turkish tank (right) is a small barbed wire fence. The fence marks the extent of the Turkish-Syrian border in the area . ISIS militants wave their black flag on a hill on the outskirts of Kobane. Another flag was later seen raised over a four-storey building inside the Kurdish city . Local sources inside Kobane confirmed the group had planted its flag but said that Kurdish forces had repelled their advances so far. At least 20 ISIS militants have so far been killed in their assault on the city today - following the deaths of more than 45 fighters on each side yesterday. Kobane is a town of key strategic importance to both ISIS and the Kurdish resistance due to its close proximity to the largely porous Turkish border. While the city centre is roughly six miles from the barbed wire fence that separates Turkey from Syria, the city's northern suburbs are so close to Turkey that civilians in the Turkish town of Mursitpinar have been able to watch the fighting with binoculars. This morning Kurdish fighters inside Kobane - which is also known as Ayn al-Arab and situated right on the Turkish border - declared that U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS targets in northern Syria have had little impact on the militant group, who have continued to seize swathes of territory . On the Turkish side of the border at least 14 Turkish army tanks took up positions on a hilltop near Kobane . Since the ISIS offensive on the areas surrounding Kobane began, approximately 160,000 civilians - mainly Syrian Kurds - have fled across the border into Turkey. There are fears ISIS will embark on another mass slaughter - as it did with the Yazidi Kurds in the Iraqi town of Sinjar - if it captures Kobane. Despite the mass exodus into Turkish territory, 100,000 people remain in the city. Esmat al-Sheikh, head of the Kobani Defence Authority, said: 'If they enter, it will be a graveyard for us and for them. We either win or die. We will resist to the end.' On the Turkish side of the border, at least 14 Turkish army tanks took up defensive positions on a hilltop near Kobane. Heavy bombardment could be heard down below as plumes of smoke rose from the town.","ISIS militants plan to enter Turkey disguised as refugees fleeing the fighting .

"Human traffickers are receiving £15,000 a time for forcing women to have babies following sham marriages. Detectives investigating an organised crime group suspected of bringing women into Greater Manchester from Eastern Europe believe the traffickers are selling them for £3,000. But the price increases to £15,000 if they will agree to have a child with their bogus husband. The shocking price of women emerged as officers arrested eight men and three women during raids in Rochdale, Oldham and Cheetham Hill as part of Operation Retriever. Eight men and three women were arrested by Greater Manchester Police during raids in Rochdale, Oldham and Cheetham Hill . They were arrested after police went to properties in Greater Manchester as part of Operation Retriever . They were arrested over a trafficking ring which saw a pregnant woman almost tricked into an abortion following a sham marriage. The 20-year-old from Slovakia was sold for up to £15,000 by a gang in Greater Manchester who organised a marriage to a 38-year-old man facing deportation, police said. Officers were alerted when the woman told an interpreter she had been 'sold against her will' and was 'appalled' by the idea of an abortion. The group of men and three women, aged between 24 and 57, were arrested after police and officers from the Home Office went to properties in Greater Manchester yesterday. The offences for which they have been arrested include trafficking people for exploitation, conspiracy to facilitate breach of immigration law, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration into a member state. Two people were arrested over being overstayers in the UK. A 20-year-old woman from Slovakia was being 'sold against her will' into a sham marriage in Rochdale . The Slovakian woman was first held in London before being taken to Wesley Street in Falisworth (pictured) From there she was transferred to Ashfield Road, Rochdale, where she was forced to marry a 38-year-old man . The NCA’s United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre (UKHTC) estimates that 2,744, people, including 602 children, were potential victims of trafficking for exploitation in 2013. This represented an increase of 22 per cent on 2012. The report lists the 10 most common countries of origin for victims, which shows Romania as the most prevalent country overall, and Poland as the most likely nation for labour trafficking. The number of British victims increased 124 per cent to 193, of whom three quarters had been trafficked around the country for sexual exploitation. Nearly seven out of 10 of the British people found to be potential victims of trafficking were children, or 128 of the total, an increase of 236 per cent year-on-year. In May the woman, who was 25 weeks pregnant, was flown to Luton, believing she was going to visit her sister. She was met by a man at Luton Airport, claiming to be her sister's friend and she was initially held in London before being taken to Wesley Street in Failsworth, Oldham. He was paid between £10,000 and £15,000 by the trafficking gang to arrange the sham marriage, police said. She was then moved to Ashfield Road, Rochdale where she was forced to marry a 38-year-old man. In July, the pair married under Sharia law in Rochdale. The woman was later taken the Royal Oldham hospital for an appointment by another woman, who acted as an interpreter and told staff she wanted an abortion. But medical tests revealed the victim, 20, was more than 25 weeks pregnant - and it would have been illegal to abort the baby. The hospital alerted social services who made her unborn baby subject to a child protection plan. After she failed to attend medical appointments the police became involved and an independent interpreter was hired to interview the woman. She confessed that she had been sold to an Asian family and subject to a forced marriage after entering the country on the belief that she would be meeting her sister in the UK. Police said it became clear 'she was being sold into a marriage against her will.' Mr Faulkner, Detective Inspector of Greater Manchester Police said there were as many as 400 cases involving women being trafficked for sham marriages in the Manchester area . DI Jim Faulkner, who is leading Operation Retriever, said: 'It transpired that she never wanted an abortion and the marriage was carried out in a local house that was used as a mosque. 'As part of this investigation we found that the going rate for a standard female was around £3,000. 'The going rate for a pregnant female rose from between £10,000 and £15,000, because it virtually guarantees leave to remain.' The investigation linked addresses across Greater Manchester with women being brought into the country under false pretences and promises of a new life before being forced into marriage. The team identified potential suspects who were involved in arranging the trafficking of women and facilitating the marriages. Mr Faulkner said there are currently as many as 400 cases involving women being trafficked for sham marriages in the Manchester area. He added: 'Each sham marriage costs the UK economy £40,000. 'That’s a Rochdale figure of £15m through benefits and cost to public services. The national picture is billions.' The details of the sham marriage come in the wake of a fake bride who was caught with 'crib sheets' listing her husband's height, weight, shoe size, how they met and how often they had sex. The claim was revealed at Sheffield Crown Court yesterday as seven men and women stood trial over an alleged plot to gain visas for four Pakistani men - by pairing them off with British brides. The women were allegedly paid up to £7,000 each to take part in bogus ceremonies in Nottingham, Leicester and Hertfordshire arranged by 38-year-old Masoud Rasab. Rasab, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, is said to have run a bride delivery service for almost four years until July last year, helping the four desperate men stay in Britain.

"Attacked: Gary Cranley, 40, feared for his son Jake when he was slashed in the ribs by a pair of thugs with a six inch knife after he told them off for swearing at KFC staff . A pair of thugs stabbed a father in front of his pregnant fiancée  and baby outside a KFC takeaway after he told them off for swearing at staff. Workshop manager Gary Cranley, 40, was knifed in the ribs after telling the two yobs to 'show some respect' after they began hurling vile abuse and demanding to be served more quickly. They waited for him in the car park of the KFC in Trafford Retail Park, Manchester, before launching a vicious attack. As Mr Cranley walked to the car with his food, the thugs confronted him and challenged him to a fight claiming he had 'disrespected' them. When he refused and got into his car with his partner Jennie Coen, 29, and seven-month old son Jake, they smashed the driver's side window. Mr Cranley jumped out to protect his family but was then punched in the head before one of the men lunged at him with a six-inch blade. He only narrowly avoided a life-threatening injury because he jumped back and the knife hit his ribs before the pair fled. Mr Cranley, who has been left with two-inch gash in his stomach, cuts to his hands and a swollen ear, said: 'It's very frightening in this day and age to think that somebody would try to kill you over a petty argument about getting a takeaway dinner. Thugs: Police have released these CCTV images of the two yobs who carried out the attack . 'I simply told them off because they were being being thoroughly unpleasant to the staff who were doing a good job and these guys simply over-reacted because they felt I had 'disrespected' them by ticking them off for swearing. 'I just don't know what these people would stop at. My family could have been hurt or even killed.' Despite his ordeal, Mr Cranley said he doesn't regret confronting the yobs. 'I . wasn't scared of them,' he said. 'I wasn't going to . let them behave like that. I just don't like people who behave like . that.' 'My . adrenaline kicked straight in and I jumped straight out of the car,' added Mr Cranley, of Eccles, Greater Manchester. 'I said ""My fiancee and . baby son are in the car"" but they didn't care. I could see one of the . men had something behind his back. Then he just lunged at me with the . knife. 'Luckily I reacted . and jumped out of the way. The knife still caught me but the blade hit . my rib and the guys ran off. I know I was lucky that when he stabbed me . it hit my rib. It could have been a lot worse.' Miss Coen said: 'It really was scary. I just had . my eye on Jake the whole time but luckily he slept through it and the . glass from the window missed him. 'I had to go for an emergency scan the next day. I'm only 16 weeks pregnant but the stress brought about stomach pains. 'Fortunately everything is fine and we're just hoping they're caught before they do somebody serious harm.' Lucky escape: Mr Cranley suffered a cut to his ribs after one of the thugs lunged at him with the blade but the injury could have been far worse if he hadn't jumped back . Terrifying: Mr Cranley was left with cuts to his hand, ribs and a swollen ear after the vicious attack . Police . have released CCTV images of two men they want to speak to with in connection with the attack. Detective Constable Stu Brown of . Greater Manchester Police said: 'What happened to this man was both . senseless but also outrageous. 'He . intervened like any good-natured person would when they heard these two . thugs verbally abusing staff, and for one simple act of kindness, he . was violently attacked by these men who were clearly lying in wait to . exact their ""revenge"".

"Four people have died and at least 11 were seriously injured after a fire . broke out in the early hours of this morning at a Thai nightclub. Police are appealing for hotel owners to report any missing guests as they desperately try to identify the charred remains of the victims in the club on the holiday island of Phuket. One of four people who died in the blaze is believed to be a French national but it cannot be confirmed because the only item identified was the man's wristwatch. Scroll down for video . Battling to control: A fireman tries to extinguish the flames blazing at the Tiger Disco on the resort island of Phuket, southern Thailand . Investigation: This morning's fire was being initially blamed on a lightning strike . A police source said the remaining victims were believed to be two Japanese men and a Thai 'man or woman'. The officer was unwilling to confirm the Thai's gender as the only evidence they had was a silicone breast implant and the area is known for having a high population of transsexual 'lady boys'. A Patong hospital spokesman said: 'We cannot even tell whether the bodies are male or female.' The fire in the Tiger Disco in Patong .

"A bus inspector risked the lives of dozens of passengers when he arranged for a double-decker to crash in a £500,000 attempted insurance fraud. Asan Akram, 45, staged an accident between the bus and a car driven by his friend in one of the biggest crash-for-cash cons police had ever seen. Convicted thief and drug dealer Akram had lied about his criminal record to get a job as night inspector for a bus firm, a court heard. Asan Akram, 45, (pictured) staged an accident between the bus and a car in one of the biggest crash-for-cash cons police had ever seen . He arranged the insurance fraud by recruiting his friend Tariq Iqbal, 42, to drive in front of the bus in his Mercedes and slam on the brakes, causing the bus to plough into the back of the car on a busy Manchester street. None of the 30 passengers was seriously hurt, but insurers were suspicious when they received Akram’s report of the accident in February 2011, followed by 29 personal injury claims for whiplash, totalling £500,000. It is unclear how many of the passengers Akram knew, but all the claims were judged to be bogus. Nine were arrested, but all were released without charge. Convicted thief and drug dealer Akram had lied about his criminal record to get a job as night inspector - pictured is a Finglands No 42 bus similar to the one used in the crash for cash scam . Akram was jailed for 16 months, while Iqbal received a 12-month suspended sentence and 250 hours of unpaid work after both admitted conspiracy to commit fraud at Manchester Crown Court. An investigation revealed the bus inspector arrived at the scene within minutes, interviewing the unwitting driver and taking passengers’ names. Akram has been jailed for 16 months after admitting conspiracy to commit fraud . But it was all an act. In the days before the crash he had been in contact with Iqbal more than 100 times to plan it. The report Akram filed was so vague that bus firm Finglands’ insurers became suspicious and employed private investigators. When the scam was uncovered a year later Akram, of Manchester, had vanished after being fired by Finglands for lying in his job application. But police in London tracked him down in December 2013 after a tip-off he was seeking work at another bus firm – and thought to be planning a similar scheme. By then, Iqbal, of Cheadle near Stockport, had scammed an insurance payout of £12,500, and Finglands had paid £42,000 in legal fees. Defending Akram, Max Saffman said the bus official had turned to fraud in ‘financial desperation’. City of London Police tracked Akram down in December 2013 when they got a tip-off he was seeking work at another bus company where he was thought to be planning a similar scheme. Detective Constable Mark Reynolds from the City of London Police's Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department, who led the investigation, said: ‘This was a long-running and complex investigation which has ultimately proved that Akram and Iqbal meticulously planned to commit insurance fraud on a massive scale. ‘The fact that their attempted scam put lives at risk by causing a crash with a packed double-decker bus on a busy road at night was inconsequential to them. ‘They wanted half a million pounds from an insurer and were prepared to go to any length to get it. ‘But what both men did not reckon on was IFED and the insurance industry working together to identify and track down criminals and have them brought to justice.’ The conviction comes just days after insurer Aviva warned crash-for-cash scams are adding £400 million to motorists’ premiums.","Asan Akram, 45, staged accident between bus and car driven by his friend .

"In a former life Rose Black was a professional swimmer and track and field athlete. Now the 33-year-old, from Narromine near Dubbo in central-west NSW is a multi-awarding winning bodybuilder and has her sights set on one of the sport's largest and most prestigious international competitions. Ms Black trains every morning and night - even on the weekends - and gives herself just two afternoons off a week. She consumes between five and ten meals a day, and all this on top of holding down a full-time job as a public servant. Scroll down for video . Rose Black (centre) is hoping to compete in the Natural Olympus bodybuildinhg competition help in San Diego next month . From central-west NSW, Ms Black started competing just a few years ago and already has a series of titles under her belt . Earlier this month the 33-year-old won three titles at the International Natural Bodybuilding Association (INBA) Australian titles . Just a few weeks ago the athlete took out three International Natural Bodybuilding Association (INBA) Australian titles; Ms Figure International (over 165cm), Ms Figure (over 165cm) and Overall Ms Figure International. Also under her belt are a World Championship title for the over 165cm and open divisions. However Ms Black's biggest feat will be raising enough money to get to San Diego next month for the Natural Olympia - which would be her debut competition after gaining professional status. Ms Black trains twice a day on almost every single day of the week, but gives herself two afternoons off . She also eats up to ten meals a day so she can keep up her energy levels and muscle mass . The athlete used to be a professional swimmer but took on bodybuilding when she retired from that . A week in the life of a bodybuilder may seem exhausting for one not involved in the sport, but Ms Black described it as a 'lifestyle' she began only a few years ago. 'I train morning and afternoon, I train every day,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I do have two afternoons off a week (Sunday and Tuesday),' she said before adding sometimes she would switch up her routine and take all of Sunday off. 'I just have to fit it around work, I train early in the morning. Monday AM: Shoulders and chest . Monday PM: Strength and conditioning class . Tuesday AM: Legs (quads, calves, glutes) Tuesday PM: Hight intensity interval training (HIIT) and biceps . Wednesday AM: Triceps; shoulders and chest . Wednesday PM: Back . Thursday AM: legs/ Glutes and hams . Thursday PM: HIIT and shoulders and biceps . Friday AM: Back and abs . Friday PM: Free session to work on lagging parts or areas . Saturday AM: Legs . Saturday PM: Hight intensity interval training . Sunday: Rest day . Back: Chin ups - Start hanging on a bar and end up with your chin over it . Legs: Squats - A full body exercise which can have weight added to increase the difficulty . Shoulders: Arnie press - a variation of a shoulder press where you lift weights above the head . Abs: Hanging leg raise - Start hanging on a bar and raise straight legs as high as possible . Chest: Incline press - Lay on a bench which is inclined and lift dumbells . Glutes: Glute ham raises - Using the bench this works your entire posterior range . Biceps: Barbell bicep curls . Triceps: Dips with weight . Calves: Standing calf raises . Quads: Leg press - Varying weights can be used depending on ability . 'It takes a lot of commitment - either that or I'm insane,' Ms Black joked. As for finding motivation to jump out of bed and hit the weights bright and early every single day of the week, the bodybuilder admitted even she struggles with it sometimes - 'like any human'. 'In the winter it's tough, (but) once you're set in a routine you just do it', Ms Black said. 'There are days when I find it tough and question what I'm doing.' Ms Black admits while it is tough to get motivated sometimes it's all about getting into a routine . She also said the only way to get lean and build muscle is to lift weights regularly . Some of her top tips for keeping fit include drinking lemon in warm water every morning . Throughout her 12 training sessions a week Ms Black makes sure each session focuses on a different part of the body. Some day she will focus on just her legs, others will work her core, and a few more sessions will be dedicated to her arms and chest. To keep up the energy levels and bulk needed to train at such high intensity and frequency all the time the athlete eats up to ten meals a day. These are all relatively small and are about the 'macro breakdown' and include foods high in protein, low in carbohydrates and with good fats. In an average day Ms Black would eat oats sprinkled with some protein powder for breakfast, barramundi with vegetables for one of her lunchtime meals and kangaroo with a salad later in the day, with other small meals dispersed in between. In terms of the tips she swears by the bodybuilder revealed she starts every day with some lemon in warm water. Ms Black has completely transformed her body shape from a few years ago, seen here in 2012 . During her sessions she will often focus on one muscle group such as her legs or core . The 33-year-old works as a public servant in central-west NSW . 'It dealcoholizes your body and helps you metabolise fat faster', Ms Black said. Breakfast: Oats with protein powder . Meal two:  Fish with vegetables . Meal three: Kangaroo salad with baby spinach, capsicum and mushrooms . Meal four: Tuna and broccoli . Meal five: Egg Whites . Repeat: Meals two-five . Meal ten: A different type of fish with different vegetables . She also likes to add 'fat-burning' foods to each meal such as capsicum, chilli flakes or garlic. Each week Ms Black has two to three 'high carb' days where she consumes more foods such as sweet potato, quinoa and brown rice. On these days she also includes more fruits such as berries and kiwi fruit. In preparation for competitions under the guidance of her coach Ken Ross, Ms Black takes her body through a range of processes. Initially she 'carb cycles' - which means varying the amount of carbohydrates consumed on any given day - and then ups her intake in the days leading up to a comp. Ms Black also pointed out that despite what many people think, if anyone is looking to get leaner the only way to do it is by lifting weights. 'I do feel cardio is important to keep your cardiovascular fitness ... For me I like to do intense sessions (a few times a week) to keep fit.'

"A flourishing ecosystem has been found a mile and a half beneath Antarctic ice in a lake cut off from the outside world for millions of years. The discovery was made by US scientists who found tiny organisms that generate energy for growth from the natural ammonium and methane in the environment. This is the first direct evidence that life can be found deep below the Antarctic ice sheet and could have implications for finding life in extreme environments in our solar system. A flourishing ecosystem has been found a mile and a half beneath Antarctic ice in a lake that has been cut off from the outside world for millions of years. The discovery was made by US scientists who found tiny organisms that generate energy for growth from the natural ammonium and methane in the environment . 'We were able to prove unequivocally to the world that Antarctica is not a dead continent,’ said lead scientist Professor John Priscu, from Montana State University. Many of the organisms found belong to a primitive extended family of microbes, distinct from bacteria, called the Archaea. The team drilled through half a mile of ice to reach the sub-glacial Lake Whillans in January last year. Archaea form one of the three great 'domains' of life on Earth, the other two being bacteria and eukayotes - organisms with their DNA contained in a cell nucleus - to which humans belong. Many of the sub-glacial archaea survived by harnessing energy in the chemical bonds of ammonium, the research showed. The US team drilled through half a mile of ice to reach the sub-glacial Lake Whillans in January last year . In March last year, scientists thought they had discovered new life forms sealed off for 14 millions years in a subglacial lake deep in Arctic ice. Scientists believed the icy darkness of Lake Vostok, under 3,700 metres of ice, could provide a glimpse of the planet before the Ice Age and clues to life on other planets. The Russian discovery came from analysing water that froze onto the end of the drill bit used to bore through to Vostok - the largest of a network of hundreds of lakes under the ice cap that acts like a blanket trapping the Earth's geothermal heat. But the research at Subglacial Lake Vostok has now been called into question due to potential contamination, primarily from hydrocarbon-based drilling fluid. Another group of micro-organisms in the same area relied on the energy and methane locked into carbon to survive. The scientists insisted that the microbes originated in Lake Whillans and were not introduced by contaminated equipment. Previous research at Subglacial Lake Vostok, the largest subglacial lake in Antarctica, has been called into question due to potential contamination, primarily from hydrocarbon-based drilling fluid. 'We went to great extremes to ensure that we did not contaminate one of the most pristine environments on our planet while at the same time ensuring that our samples were of the highest integrity,' said Professor Priscu. ‘Because Antarctica is basically a microbial continent, exploring below its thick ice sheet can help us understand how life has evolved to survive in cold darkness,’ said Jill Mikucki from the University of Tennessee, who was also involved in the project. ‘I hope our findings motivate new research on the role of these extreme microorganisms in the function of our planet and other icy worlds in our solar system.’ The team drilled through half a mile of ice to reach the sub-glacial Lake Whillans in January last year .","This is first direct evidence that life can be found below Antarctic ice .

"Ed Miliband pitched Labour into disarray on the economy and welfare yesterday when he was unable to answer basic questions about his party’s policies. The Labour leader’s performance in a radio interview was described as ‘a car crash’ and ‘a Milishambles’. Mr Miliband refused on ten occasions to admit that his party would increase government borrowing, despite outlining plans that would require more than £28billion of borrowing. Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured campaigning in Worcester, refused to admit he would be borrowing more if he was in power . He then revealed that Labour’s policy review would investigate whether . to axe universal benefits for pensioners such as the winter fuel . allowance and free bus and television licences. His aides were later forced to insist that they would stay. The Labour leader lost his temper in an interview with Martha Kearney, host of Radio 4’s World at One. At one point, he snapped ‘You don’t understand’ to Miss Kearney as she . pressed him on Labour’s position on the economy – while failing to spell . out what it is. The interview came as Mr Miliband unveiled Labour’s alternative Queen’s . Speech, which repeated the party’s pledge to bring in a temporary VAT . cut to 17.5 per cent, which would cost £13 billion. Labour published an Alternative Queen's Speech today, but the Tories suggested it contained £28.1billion in unfunded spending promises . It also outlined . pledges to reintroduce the 10p tax rate, at a cost of £7.3billion paid . for with a mansion tax that would only raise £2billion. The Tories claim . there is a £28billion black hole in the plans. Borrowing fell only slightly last year to £120.6billion, just £300million lower than in 2011-12. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has previously admitted that Labour would . have to raise borrowing in an attempt to foster economic growth, in the . hope that means borrowing can be cut later. But Mr Miliband flatly . refused to admit that borrowing would increase, angrily dodging ten . different questions on the subject. Asked whether he thinks the Government needs to borrow more now, Mr . Miliband said: ‘No, well [what] I would say is that we need to get . borrowing down.’ Pressed again, he added: ‘I don’t accept that borrowing . would be higher under a Labour government because borrowing would be . lower over the medium term.’ Asked to agree with Mr Balls that borrowing would rise in the short-term he refused. Tory MP Brooks Newmark branded Mr Miliband’s performance ‘a . Milishambles’, while the Liberal Democrat press office tweeted that it . was ‘a car crash’. Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Ed Miliband is too weak to admit . what his Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, has already said: that Labour’s . plans mean more spending, more borrowing and more debt, exactly how . Labour got us into this mess in the first place.’ The grilling of Ed Miliband by Radio 4’s World at One presenter Martha Kearney was described as a ‘car crash’ interview. Here is an edited transcript:MK: Would it be fair to say, looking at your plans overall, that you think that the Government needs to borrow more now and that’s in order to boost growth in the economy.EM: No, well [what] I would say is that we need to get borrowing down.MK: In order to produce more growth, if you were PM at the moment you would be spending and borrowing more wouldn’t you? EM: Well I don’t accept that borrowing would be higher under Labour… because borrowing would be lower over the medium term.MK: When Ed Balls was asked about this very question he was more open. He answered it. When he was asked if he would borrow more if he were chancellor he said now and I quote ‘that is what I would do right now’.EM: Look the Government is cutting too far and too fast. Ed Balls is absolutely right about that.MK: All I am asking you is to explain how you are going to boost growth and that is by spending more and that is by borrowing more if you were PM at the moment, straight answer to that? EM: Well I am giving you a very straight answer. I think borrowing would be lower under a Labour government over the medium term.MK: In the medium term, but I am asking you what you would do right now? If I made you PM right now.EM: What we would do right now is the five-point plan for growth and jobs. A VAT cut which I think would get our economy moving.MK: [That] Wouldn’t contribute to growth tomorrow. If you were PM now cut VAT for a year you are going to spend £12billion and you hope you will get the money back in the medium term but you don’t know that. So you will have to borrow more wouldn’t you?EM: No you don’t understand Martha, I don’t think you are quite accepting this point. Why has George Osborne’s borrowing gone from nought to £61billion? Why do you think that is? MK: I’m asking you about your plans....EM: No, no, but it’s very relevant.MK: I want to ask you....EM: But it’s very relevant. It’s very relevant to this point.MK: I understand you want to change the subject.EM: I am not changing the subject at all...","Labour leader under pressure over expensive spending promises .

"Premier League tickets are not just the most expensive in the world in absolute terms - at £28.80 on average for a ‘cheap’ adult seat - but take up a larger chunk of the average fan’s wages than virtually any league globally. An exclusive Mail on Sunday study of the world’s football leagues reveals fans in only two countries, Brazil and China, need spend a bigger portion of their weekly income to watch top-flight-football. And they are only dearer than the Premier League by a whisker. Our analysis considers the average price of a ‘typical’ top-flight ticket in 34 countries and weighs it against local income. Using the most recent data, the study shows a supporter in England could buy just 14.3 tickets with a week’s pay (£411). Premier League tickets take a larger chuck of the averga fan's wages than almost any other league . In Brazil the average seat costs £12.73, or 14.2 tickets for a week’s pay, and in China the income is £140 and the average seat, according to a spokesman, is £10, or just 14 tickets. Statistics on these pages and available in full online show the extraordinary range of prices that fans pay around the world - and indicate where the beautiful game truly remains the people’s game. The cheapest tickets when weighted to income are in Algeria, where a £1.40 seat means the average fan could buy as many as 118 tickets with a week’s pay. Prices in Nigeria, Ukraine, Poland, Chile, South Africa and Sweden are also among the most affordable. Germany’s Bundesliga is often lauded as a bargain - but 22 countries offer better value against local wages. A typical Bundesliga seat costs £19.17, meaning a fan there can buy 27 tickets with a week’s pay. The study shows a supporter in England could buy just 14.3 tickets with a week’s pay (£411) Ticket prices vary enormously within each country and even at each club. Our average (or ‘typical’) seat prices are either the official figure provided by each league or an average price for the cheapest available adult non-concessionary tickets from a selection of clubs in each league. ‘Ticket pricing, especially at the top clubs, is the standout factor in order of magnitude among fans’ concerns,’ says Malcolm Clarke of the Footballer Supporters’ Federation. ‘This is a league with money coming out of its ears, so rich from TV deals that the clubs could give every seat away for nothing and still have more money now than they did before the current TV deal. ‘That clubs have failed to make an impact in this area is scandalous.’ While the Premier League is the most expensive to watch live, it clearly has positives that make it hugely popular at home and abroad. The Mail on Sunday’s groundbreaking in-depth study of world leagues has analysed a wide range of factors from all 34, from income and wages, to ‘star’ quality and goals, attendance, talent production, trophies, calibre of managers, competitive balance and each league’s contribution to its national game. Premier League clubs have the highest average incomes in the world, at around £155m each, and the highest average wages, at £2.3m player per year. Both these figures put the League’s closest rival, Germany’s Bundesliga, in the shade, on £1.46m and £90m comparatively. And Germany are clear of the next league. Spain’s La Liga is indisputably home to the game’s most stellar names — Ronaldo, Messi, Bale, Suarez and James — but the Premier League is home to the most stars at the summer’s World Cup, 112 of them. The Bundesliga beats the Premier League in average attendance per match, at 42,609 for last year, but the Premier League (36,695) had more fans overall, at 13.94m to 13m in Germany’s top flight. With an average fan attendance of 42,609 the Bundesliga boasts the highest amount in world football . The French lead the way in one category — talent production. Our study shows French clubs produce more ‘top class’ footballers for teams across Europe’s ‘Big 5’ leagues than those anywhere else in the world. When 118 French-produced exports to rival leagues are added to 75 international-standard players still within France, they have ‘made’ 193 such players. Spain’s La Liga (133) plus the top divisions in Argentina (111), Brazil (103), Germany (95) and the Premier League (94) make up the top six producers. Spain is the best league in terms of their clubs winning ‘continental’ trophies over the past decade, with four Champions League wins, and five UEFA Cup/Europa League titles. The Premier League is next best (3 CL, 1 UC). Using a similar formula to determine which league has the best calibre of managers, overall, England comes out on top because of the global and continental trophy hauls amassed collectively by Jose Mourinho, Louis Van Gaal, Arsene Wenger and Manuel Pellegrini. Jose Mourinho's trophy haul boosts the Premier League's calibre of managers . The Bundesliga has the second best calibre of managers thanks to the likes of Pep Guardiola (above) The Bundesliga is second thanks to Pep Guardiola, Roberto Di Matteo, Jurgen Klopp and others. Spain’s La Liga is third and a surprise fourth place goes to China’s Super League, home in 2014 to World Cup winner Marcello Lippi and Sven Goran Eriksson among an international cast of bosses. The Premier League performs poorly on competitive balance, with just three different winners in a decade and a global low of five teams in the top three over a decade. Leagues in Sweden, Japan and across the Americas have had as many as seven different winners in a decade. Germany’s domestic league famously assists their World Cup-winning national team and when fan-ownership and stable finances are considered, Germany comes out on top in the ‘contribution to national game’ category. When all things are considered, scoring each category winner as 10 points and all other league relative to the winner, the Premier League pips the Bundesliga by a fraction, literally. On penalties, as it were. For a change. For now.","Premier League tickets take up larger chunk of average fan's wage than most other leagues .

"The results from the latest round of Premier League football have left an intriguing tussle for the final two Champions League places as five teams concertina together. Just four points separate Arsenal in third from Tottenham Hotspur in seventh, with Manchester United, Southampton, and Liverpool in between. Chelsea and Manchester City are removed at the top, battling for the title, leaving that quintet jostling to make the cut into Europe’s elite club competition. Here, Sportsmail looks at 10 key fixtures that could decide who will be mixing it with the continent’s best next season. MANCHESTER UNITED vs TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR, March 15 . A struggle for life, is how Louis Van Gaal termed the second half of the sides’ 0-0 draw at White Hart Lane on December 28. Hopefully this match provides a little more entertainment. Spurs have come away from Old Trafford victorious on the past two occasions. Now is perhaps the time for the Dutch manager to show Spurs what they missed out on. Louis van Gaal (centre) sits dejected on the Manchester United bench as they were beaten by Swansea . SWANSEA vs LIVERPOOL, March 16 . Brendan Rodgers heading back once more to the club where he made his name, taking on the manager he made captain during his tenure. What price Garry Monk derailing his former mentor? Liverpool have not won at the Liberty Stadium in three attempts – two draws and one defeat. Swansea have already beaten Arsenal and Manchester United there this season. Liverpool players celebrates as they beat Swansea 4-1 at Anfield in December . LIVERPOOL vs MANCHESTER UNITED, March 22 . The reverse fixture marked the turning point in Liverpool’s campaign, as well as one of the few high points for Van Gaal. A 3-0 scoreline illustrated David De Gea’s form more than United’s superiority as Rodgers found some success trialling three at the back. Liverpool have not lost over 90 minutes in 18 games since. They will want revenge. Juan Mata (left), Robin van Persie (centre) and Wayne Rooney celebrate as United beat Liverpool 3-0 . ARSENAL vs LIVERPOOL, April 4 . An enduring duel in recent years, the match at Anfield back in December added another chapter. The 2-2 draw saw Fabio Borini sent off in the second minute of stoppage time, before Martin Skrtel found a dramatic equaliser four minutes and 20 seconds later. Any result at the Emirates is conceivable, with a draw and a win for each side in the last three meetings. Liverpool's Martin Skrtel scored a late header in their 2-2 draw with Arsenal at Anfield in December . STOKE vs SOUTHAMPTON, April 18 . Ronald Koeman was in the Barcelona team that lost to Manchester United in the 1991 Cup Winners' Cup final when Mark Hughes scored a brace. The two tangle again at the Britannia, with Europe on the agenda again. They enjoyed a topsy-turvey Capital One Cup encounter there in October, Asmir Begovic scored from his own half inside 13 seconds last season, while a 3-3 draw was shared the campaign before that. Could be interesting. Graziano Pelle (left) celebrates with Shane Long as Southampton beat Stoke 3-2 in the Capital One Cup . SOUTHAMPTON vs TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR, April 25 . Mauricio Pochettino returns to St Mary’s for the first time since leaving last summer and is probably in for a frosty reception, if the response from home fans to Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana is anything to go by. Koeman has shown losing the Argentine was not as cataclysmic as first appeared and would love to inflict a costly defeat to prove the point. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman greets former Saints boss Mauricio Pochettino (right) ARSENAL vs CHELSEA, April 26 . Just imagine Arsene Wenger’s post-match words were Arsenal to cement their Champions League ambitions and dent Jose Mourinho’s title aspirations. The man labelled a ‘specialist in failure’ and ‘voyeur’ by Mourinho could be forgiven for sneaking a glance at this game already. Twelve times Wenger has failed to beat the Portuguese – five draws, seven defeats – so 13th time lucky? Diego Costa scores the second as Chelsea beat Arsenal 2-0 at Stamford Bridge earlier this season . TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR vs MANCHESTER CITY, May 2 . Spurs are in the midst of an unfortunate run against City – three successive defeats with a cumulative 15 goals conceded and two scored. But Pochettino’s side did at least trouble the reigning champions at the Etihad and now have Harry Kane in full swing. Will Manuel Pellegrini be the next victim of the 'Hurrikane'? Harry Kane celebrates scoring late against West Ham to level the scores at 2-2 for Tottenham last Sunday . MANCHESTER UNITED vs ARSENAL, May 16 . The old rivalry should be refuelled in the penultimate round of fixtures, in a match that could have a significant influence on finishing positions. United won at the Emirates earlier this season in a smash and grab of criminal proportions. That was when Angel Di Maria and Wayne Rooney looked an exciting duo. They will need to reprise that understanding against Wenger's side. Arsene Wenger looks dejected on the touchline as Arsenal were beaten 2-0 by Man United last November . MANCHESTER CITY vs SOUTHAMPTON, May 24 . The Etihad has seen final day action for the past three seasons with various outcomes. Drama of an unimaginable kind culminated the 2011-12 season, Norwich inflicted shock defeat in 2012-13, while West Ham were vanquished to secure the title last season. This fixture promises intrigue, with City hoping to still be pushing Chelsea and Southampton aiming for a climactic flourish into Europe.

"Detectives leading the search for missing mother Samantha Henderson are appealing for the public's help . A desperate search was under way last night for a devoted young mother of four whom police fear has been murdered. Samantha Henderson, 25, whose children are one, two, four and six, was last seen in Corfe Castle, Dorset, on Wednesday. Detectives said they ‘strongly believe [Miss Henderson] may have come to some harm’. Police helicopters have scoured the area, while 35 major crime officers and forensics experts combed allotments, outbuildings and the missing mother’s home. A 27-year-old man from the village, believed to be her boyfriend, was arrested on Friday on suspicion of her murder. Last night detectives were granted more time to question him. At least 30 friends and neighbours joined the search and put up hundreds of posters. Detectives seized Miss Henderson’s blue Peugeot from her home last night and asked the public to help trace the car’s movements – especially between 3pm on Wednesday and 10.25am on Thursday. Dorset Police said she was a ‘prolific phone user’ but that her mobile had not been found. Miss Henderson lives in a £325,000 four-bedroom cottage. It is believed her partner lived there for several years, but there is a ‘for sale’ sign outside and she had arranged to meet a house clearance firm yesterday. The mother, who was described by neighbours as a ‘nice and bubbly girl’, was last seen collecting her children from Corfe Castle Primary School at 3pm on Wednesday. She is thought to have vanished from her home at about 4.30pm. She was not reported missing until 8.43am the next day. Miss Henderson is described as 5ft 3in and very slim, with blonde hair. Yesterday her friend Lisa Jane Bonfield, who organised the poster campaign, said: ‘Hopefully someone will see it and recognise her or maybe she will see it and know we are looking for her and just want her back.’ 'Devoted' mother-of-four Miss Henderson was last seen in Corfe Castle, Dorset, on Wednesday . Dorset Police are asking for help in tracing the movement's of Miss Henderson's car, pictured, which is a blue Peugeot 307 estate . The young woman's family described her as 'a loving mother' and said her disappearance was 'out of character' Another friend, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Samantha is such a devoted mum … She and her partner have worked hard to give everything to [the children] … We’re still hoping she will be found alive.’ Miss Henderson’s family said: ‘Sam is a homely, private, loving mother … hardworking, always presentable and this is completely out of character … she would never walk out and leave her children.’ They added: ‘No one is upset or thinks anything badly of you, Sam. We just want you to come home as everyone wants to help and support you.’ Detective Inspector Neil Devoto said Miss Henderson had never gone missing before and that police had grave concerns for her. Anyone with information should call Dorset Police on 101, quoting Operation Cavalier. Or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"Kimberley Wallwork would watch her son Oliver scratch his skin until it bled and then cry in pain . Every night Kimberley Wallwork would watch in despair as her son Oliver scratched his skin until it bled and he then cried in pain. Her little boy had suffered from eczema since he was a year old and his condition meant he barely slept through the night. 'His skin was red raw and he would wake up screaming - he was understandably incredibly grumpy,' says Kimberly, 26. 'This had been happening for two years and as a family, we were at our wit's end. 'As a mother, I felt helpless and exhausted. It felt like we'd tried everything,' she told MailOnline. It was only through sheer chance that she stumbled across a skincare range online called Bioskin Junior, which, to her relief, has cleared up her son's skin almost completely. For the first time ever, four-year-old Oliver can now swim, sleep through the night - and his parents' life has improved too. Kimberley is far from alone in experiencing the hell that eczema brings to all members a household. One in five children in the UK currently suffer from the skin condition, with eight out of ten cases occurring before a child reaches the age of five. And last year, a committee of MPs acknowledged it caused a 'major disruption to family life'. Now, one of the largest studies ever carried out into the impact of child eczema has revealed the true scale the condition can have on families - and the feelings of helplessness and frustration many parents face. In the poll of 800 parents, 72 per cent said their children with eczema have troubled sleep and 35 per cent said this affected their behaviour at school. And 86 per cent admitted to feeling 'helpless and upset' when their child is suffering from an eczema flare up. A lack of sleep and frustration impacts other parts of life, too. Sixty-seven per cent of parents have suffered disturbed sleep as a result of their children’s eczema and 32 per cent have had to take time off work to deal with the condition. Nearly half said the stress and trauma of eczema has caused friction and arguments with their partner. However, the condition still remains largely under the radar, with parents struggling to find suitable advice or treatment. 'Oliver would scratch his skin red raw and wake up screaming every night - he was understandably incredibly grumpy,' says his mother Kimberly, 26. 'As a family, we were at our wit's end' One in five children in the UK currently suffer from the skin condition, with eight out of ten cases occurring before a child reaches the age of five. Oliver (pictured) began suffering when he was a year old . The range, called Salcura Bioskin Junior, is based on the principles of homeostasis - the self-healing capacity of the skin, which is dependent on the supply of nutrients. Other ingredients in the range, such as sea buckthorn, chamomile and lavender, also help to improve the skin's natural healing process, says the product's creator, Dr Martin Schiele. 'For the first time, these ingredients have now been formulated at levels which are gentle enough to be used on children and babies from three months,' he says. In a study, 96 per cent of consumers rated their children’s skin as better after using the range. Sixty per cent of parents believe the current treatments for eczema on offer are not effective and two-thirds consider the advice they get from GPs to be inadequate. For Kimberley, the findings rang very true. 'I was always going into work tired, and would often argue with my fiancé as life was so stressful.' Oliver's eczema, . which began when he was a year old, started as a small patch on his . back and then spread rapidly, recalls Kimberley who lives in Bury, . Lancashire with fiancé Darren and their other child, one-year-old . Jessica. 'We went to the GP and were given aqueous cream to apply. 'When . that didn't work, we tried various other creams, but his skin just got . worse and worse - especially when we tried steroid creams,' says . Kimberley, who works as an assistant at Tesco. Then one night last year she was online, when an advert popped up on Facebook. 'It said it was looking for patients to complete and survey and try out eczema products, and I thought ""why not""? 'A few days later some samples turned up in the post - a body wash, lotions and an outbreak rescue cream. 'The information said they contained ingredients that would help repair the skin through its natural healing process.' The range, . called Salcura Bioskin Junior, is based on the principles of homeostasis . - the self-healing capacity of the skin, which is dependent on the . supply of nutrients. It . was only through sheer chance that Oliver's mother stumbled across a . skincare range online which, to her relief, has cleared up her son's . skin almost completely. For the first time ever, four-year-old Oliver . can now swim, sleep through the night - and his parents' life has . improved too . Mrs Wallwork, with fiancée Darren, says Oliver is now a 'happy, lively little boy' who can enjoy life . Other ingredients in the range, such as sea . buckthorn, chamomile and lavender, also help to improve the skin's . natural healing process, says the product's creator, Dr Martin Schiele. 'For the . first time, these ingredients have now been formulated at levels which . are gentle enough to be used on children and babies from three months,' he says. In a study, 96 per cent of consumers rated their children’s skin as better after using the range. Skin diseases such as eczema are the most common reason we go to the GP, according to figures from the British Skin Foundation. The . condition, characterised by dry, itchy red skin, is now estimated to . affect up to 20 per cent of school children and up to 10 per cent of . adults. Experts advise not using aqueous cream for eczema — not even to wash with. It’s . incredibly damaging to skin, especially children’s, because it contains . sodium lauryl sulphate, which is the harshest possible detergent. As a consequence, it breaks the skin down, making eczema worse. Worryingly, many people are still given it by GPs as a moisturiser as it’s the cheapest option. Research has shown that more than half of children who used it suffered an immediate bad reaction, such as stinging. It . is caused by a lack of fat between the skin cells; as a result, water . is lost from the skin cells — this causes them to shrink, and cracks . open up between them. Allergens, the substances that can trigger an allergic reaction, can then get into the skin, causing inflammation. The . problem with leaving the condition untreated is that the longer . allergens penetrate the skin, the more allergic the immune system . becomes and the worse. 'Within days, Oliver's skin began to improve and he began sleeping better. I couldn't believe it,' says Kimberley. 'Within a week he was sleeping through the night and I can honestly say he is now 100 per cent better. 'He is a happy, lively little boy and for the first time, we can do things as as family, such as swimming. 'Previously, during an outbreak, the chlorine would sting his skin and leave him in tears. 'What I liked was they could all be used daily and didn't have a harsh smell like many of the products we have tried. Oliver just won't go near them. 'These smell slightly of lavender and help calm him and get him off to sleep. It's wonderful. His favourite product is the spray as he can apply it himself - it's easy to use and soaks in quickly.' For the first time, a dedicated online support resource for parents of children with eczema has also been launched - www.childeczemahelp.co.uk. It includes information on independent research and a forum where parents can share their experiences and advice on child eczema.","Kimberley Wallwork's son Oliver developed eczema at the age of one .

"The older girl's face - which showed red ochre markings - was creased from the place it rested on her shawl . A 500-year-old frozen Incan mummy known as 'The Maiden' was suffering from a bacterial infection when she died - and being able to 'diagnose' the disease could lead to new insights into diseases of the past. The discovery could help defend against new illnesses - or the re-emergence of diseases of the past. The mummy was suffering from an illness similar to tuberculosis when she was sacrificed on the Argentinian volcano Llullaillaco, 22,100 feet above sea level. The find - using a new technique of swabbing the lips and comparing the swabs with those of current patients - is the first time a disease has been 'diagnosed' in such an ancient body. ‘Pathogen detection in ancient . tissues isn't new, but until now it's been impossible to say whether the . infectious agent was latent or active,’ says Corthals. ‘Our technique opens a new door to . solving some of history's biggest mysteries, such as the reasons why the . flu of 1918 was so devastating. It will also enhance our understanding . of our future's greatest threats, such as the emergence of new . infectious agents or re-emergence of known infectious diseases.’ The analysis was possible because of the incredible preservation of the mummy, which is so well-preserved there were still lice in her hair. The team swabbed the lips of two . Andean Inca mummies, buried at 22,000-feet elevation and originally . discovered in 1999, and compared the proteins they found to large . databases of the human genome. The view from the summit of Llullaillaco volcano where the children were found. The children were plucked from these slopes in 1999 by a team who battled for three days through driving blizzards and 70mph winds to reach the summit . Child sacrifice was called capacocha.  The process of capacocha could begin years before the selected person was killed. A mummified body of a child who was killed during one such sacrifice is pictured here . Along with the remains of two younger children, the teenager was plucked . from the slopes of a cloudswept volcano in 1999 by a team who battled . for three days through driving blizzards and 70mph winds to reach the . summit 22,000ft above sea level. There, the archaeologists spotted a rectangular walled area, dug down . through five feet of rocks and soil and finally uncovered an Incan . burial platform. One of the team was lowered headfirst into the icy pit, his colleagues . hanging onto his ankles, so that he could scrape away the soil and pull . the dead children out with his hands. The three Children of Llullaillaco, as the mummies came . to be known after the mountain on which they met their death, were . found with an extraordinary collection of elaborate gold, silver and . shell statues, textiles, pots containing food and even an extravagant . headdress made from the white feathers of an unidentified bird. But it was the state of the bodies, preserved not by embalming, like . Egyptian mummies, but simply by the natural deep-freeze in which they . were abandoned, that scientists found most remarkable. They found that the protein profile . from the mummy of a 15-year old girl, called ‘The Maiden,’ was similar . to that of chronic respiratory infection patients, and the analysis of . the DNA showed the presence of probably pathogenic bacteria in the genus . Mycobacterium, responsible for upper respiratory tract infections and . tuberculosis. In addition, X-rays of the lungs of the Maiden showed signs of lung infection at the time of death. The mummies were found in 1999. ‘The . doctors have been shaking their heads and saying they sure don't look . 500 years old but as if they'd died a few weeks ago,’ said U.S. archaeologist and expedition member Johan Reinhard at the time. ‘And a chill went down my spine the first time I saw her hands because they look like those of a person who is alive.’ It's thought that the children were chosen by the Incas for their beauty and sacrificed in a ceremony called a capacocha. ‘The Incas didn't do this very often,’ according to Reinhard. ‘The sacrifices were children because they were considered to be the most pure.’ They . were not sacrificed to feed or appease the gods but, rather, ‘to enter . the realm of the gods and live in paradise with them. It was considered a . great honour, a transition to a better life from which they would be . expected to remain in contact with the community through shamans (holy . men)’. The place of sacrifice: The burial site of the three children  on top of Llullaillaco Volcano . Ritual killings were common within the Incan culture. In 1999 three Children of Llullaillaco, who found deep frozen were found with an extraordinary collection of elaborate gold, silver and shell statues, textiles and pots containing food The children included a 13-year-old known as the 'Llullaillaco Maiden' The Incas believed that by scaling . the snow-topped heights of the mountains they could get closer to the . heavens and communicate better with the gods. Detecting diseases in ancient remains is often fraught with difficulty, especially because of contamination. Techniques based on microbe DNA can . easily be confused by environmental contamination, and they can only . confirm that the pathogen was present, not that the person was infected, . but the researchers behind the study, led by Angelique Corthals of the . John Jay College of Criminal Justice, City University of New York, found . a way around this problem. They used proteomics, focusing on . protein rather than DNA remains, to profile immune system response from . degraded samples taken from 500 year-old mummies. Proteomics, DNA, and x-rays from another mummy found together with the Maiden did not show signs of respiratory infection. 'Our study is the first of its kind since rather than looking for the pathogen, which is notoriously difficult to do in historical samples, we are looking at the immune system protein profile of the ‘patient’, which more accurately tells us that there was indeed an infection at the time of death.’ or . ‘Our study opens the door to solving many historical and current biomedical and forensic mysteries, from understanding why the plague of 1918 was so lethal, to finding out which pathogen is responsible for death in cases of multiple infections.’","First time infection has been diagnosed in ancient body .

"From his ship, he had witnessed the heroism and the horrors of D-Day at first hand. So come hell or high water, Bernard Jordan was determined to take part in the 70th anniversary celebrations. And his escapades ended up making almost as many headlines as the commemorations. Safely back in Blighty: Staff at Pines Care Home in Hove, East Sussex give Bernard Jordan, 89, a special welcome on his return . Last night the 89-year-old care home resident revealed the thinking behind his mission to Normandy – an adventure dubbed The Great Escape that has enchanted the nation. Giving his first full interview to a newspaper, he told the Daily Mail: ‘When I set my mind to do something, I do it. This is what Normandy veterans are like. 'Sometimes younger folk underestimate the capabilities and spirit of my generation.’ Mr Jordan had lied about his age to get into the Royal Navy at 17 – a year early. Less than three years later, on June 6 1944, he was an electrical engineer on the Endeavour, supplying tanks to the British troops invading northern France. Memories: Pictured with his wife Irene on their wedding day in 1946 (left) and during his service (right), Mr Jordan revealed in his first full interview that he lied about his age to get into the Royal Navy  at 17 . ‘My job was to make sure the doors of the ship opened properly to let the tanks out. Any electrical job that went wrong, it was my job to put right,’ he said. ‘We released the tanks from the ship, and out of 20, two or three got badly damaged straight away, but the remaining 17 ploughed up the beach.’ He and his comrades worked on, as thousands of servicemen died on the beaches. ‘I was scared – of course I was scared – but you deal with it with pride,’ Mr Jordan said. ‘I used to keep up morale as best I could. I’m no comedian but we tried to keep each other laughing.’ Return: He arrived in Portsmouth to a hero's welcome on Saturday after attending the D-Day commemorations in Normandy on Friday . Grin: He waved to photographers as he was driven away from the ferry port . It was no surprise, then, that he felt he had to be in France for last week’s ceremonies. ‘I’d . tried to get on an official trip and my care home staff were helping . me. Everyone had done their best,’ said Mr Jordan, who turns 90 this . week. He had resigned . himself to following the commemorations from home until his bulldog . spirit got the better of him as he watched the daily TV reports of the . build-up last week. ‘I . decided whatever it took I’d get to Normandy. I suppose I was rather . secretive, but I was anxious nobody would try to deter me,’ he said. Last Thursday, he dressed and put on his medals, making sure to hide them under his blue mac before he said goodbye to his disabled wife, Irene, 88, who lives with him at the Pines Care Home in Hove, East Sussex. ‘I didn’t want to make a fuss,’ he said. ‘I squeezed her hand and gave her a kiss. I told her, “You’ll miss me for a bit, but I’ll be back shortly.' Then I went downstairs and told the care home staff I was going out. I gave them a wave and just walked out. ‘I went down to the bus stop, showed my pensioner’s pass and took the first bus to town.’ Hero: The 89-year-old care home resident got a friendly reception when he arrived in Normandy from Adele Leatham and Julie Maguire . Joyful: The former Royal Navy Lieutenant is pictured with cousins Anne-Sophie and Aude Corbin in Ouistreham . Mr . Jordan, who was mayor of Hove in the 1990s, knew no one would miss him . for hours. He had planned to attend D-Day commemorations in Portsmouth, . so took a train along the coast. ‘At this stage I hadn’t planned to go further afield,’ he said. ‘I . was looking forward to meeting some old pals and talking over our . memories.’ What happened next, he insisted, was spontaneous. Talking to . other veterans who were heading for Normandy, he decided to join them. ‘I’d made the journey in far more . hazardous circumstances during the war. I couldn’t see that any harm . would come from hopping on to a ferry,’ he said. He . bought a £30 Brittany Ferries ticket to Caen, boarded and settled into . his berth for the night – a welcome change from the conditions he had . experienced aboard the Endeavour. ‘I was out like a light,’ he said. ‘I used to sleep in a hammock during the war, so this was very comfortable.’ Before . the boat reached port, retired teacher Christine Orrell saw him sitting . alone, carrying the two carrier bags of essential rations he’d brought . for the trip, and invited him to join her party. Mrs . Orrell, from Sevenoaks, Kent, was with her family accompanying three . other veterans to France. They were planning to visit Sword Beach at . Ouistreham, in memory of her late father. Happy: As he arrived back at his care home following his escapade to France, he sat back in a leather chair and shared his experiences . By now, staff at the Pines were growing increasingly worried about Mr Jordan. His wife admitted he had told her he was going to Portsmouth and police were alerted. Coincidentally, it had occurred to Mrs Orrell that there may be people back in England anxious about the veteran. She contacted the Pines to say he was safe – in France. On Friday, although he had no ticket, Mr Jordan managed to get into the stadium where world leaders including the Queen, David Cameron and President Obama, were gathering. ‘I enjoyed every minute. It was a jolly good day,’ he said, although he admitted he was by now keen to get back home to his wife. Brittany Ferries agreed to take him on the 11pm crossing and gave him star treatment. By the time Mr Jordan arrived back in Portsmouth on Saturday morning, he was front page news. Popular: As he made his way to northern France he posed for a photo with female crew members . ‘I was quite surprised. I don’t want people to think I’m trying to play a hero,’ he said. ‘I went across because I felt like it and felt it was the right thing to do. That’s our age group – it’s not a big deal for us, we just get on with things.’ Mr Jordan’s wartime exploits, in which he also served on a ship involved in a successful mission to seize a German Enigma code machine from a U-boat, saw him earn five medals and promotion. By the time he left the Navy in 1948, he was a lieutenant. ‘I’ve always felt this great country’s worth fighting for and I’d fight for it again and again,’ he said. ‘If there was ever another war, God forbid, I hope those who fought in it would do the same as I did to remember it.’ Cunning: Mr Jordan was reported missing from his care home last week. Hours later, staff realised he had crept out to attend the D-Day commemorations .","Bernard Jordan, 89, revealed his thinking behind the mission to Normandy .

"It’s the dappled brown fur many of us first laid eyes on watching Disney’s Bambi. But now the same soft hide has been turned into a luxury fashion accessory – to the horror of animal rights campaigners. Marketed as ‘for the individualist’, a collection of deer fur clutch bags and iPad cases has been designed by Rosemary Hobrough – whose husband is a deer stalker. Her Dorset-based company Rah & Co launched this year and sells the bags online for up to £110. Controversial: Deer fur handbags from Rah & Co, which have angered animal rights campaigners . But a spokesman from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) has urged people to boycott the products. He said: ‘People would rather be caught dead than wearing Bambi. ‘Deer are beautiful animals, in contrast to the ugly nature of people who would sport their skin as an accessory to their own heartlessness.’ Managed deer culling is legal in the UK, and is used as a form of population control to prevent the animals starving or falling victim to disease. But the Peta spokesman added: ‘Selling bags made of animals who were gunned down while enjoying a natural life... results only in greedy, arrogant deer skin sellers keeping deer alive each year just long enough to kill them so as to sell more deer skin products.’ Designer: Rosemary Hobrough . However Mrs Hobrough, who is in her fifties, said her creations were a mark of respect to the animals. She explained that she had the idea when she took a course in venison butchery and discovered the skins were simply incinerated. ‘[It] is a great shame considering how beautiful the material is,’  she said. The grandmother-of-four makes her designs from the hide of animals killed by her 70-year-old husband Martyn. He added: ‘It’s a good idea on Rosemary’s part because we eat the deer meat but the hide is wasted.’","The collection has been designed by Rosemary Hobrough, of Rah & Co .

"A £15 million wooden chemistry laboratory will continue to burn for a further 24 hours, firefighters confirmed today. The Carbon Neutral Laboratory for Sustainable Chemistry at Nottingham University was destroyed after it several fires broke out inside the state-of-the-art building on Friday night. The laboratory, which was part-funded by a £12 million grant from pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline was due to open for the first time next year. Scroll down for video . The University of Nottingham's Carbon Neutral Laboratory for Sustainable Chemistry was completely destroyed by last night's blaze and continued to smolder today . The £15 million laboratory was constructed from environmentally sustainable materials such as wood in order to make it carbon neutral over the building's lifetime . Lighting up the sky: Some 60 firefighters were last night battling an ‘explosive’ blaze at a new £15million laboratory at Nottingham University . Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service were called to the scene at 8.30pm after residents spotted the blaze. Joanne Wooler-Ward, who was the Incident Commander from NFRS, said: 'No other buildings have been affected, fortunately no people were involved in this fire and we've had 12 crews here, that's over 60 firefighters. 'Credit to those firefighters who pulled out all the stops to prevent this fire spreading. 'When we arrived, the fire was a significant size - it could be seen from quite a distance - and there was a smoke plume spreading towards the campus area so we sent out a message for people to keep doors and windows closed. 'The firefighters have worked hard to contain that fire and stop it from spreading to any other buildings. 'Members of the public might have been quite alarmed when they heard a loud bang that some thought was an explosion - that's something that happens to buildings when they're exposed to extreme heat and pressure but that's a risk that we manage and are trained to deal with.' Fire officers remained on the scene today to continue spraying water at that the remains of the building which was completely destroyed by last night's fire . Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service deployed 60 firefighters from 8.30pm last night to battle the blaze and stop it from spreading to adjacent buildings . University of Nottingham Registrar Dr Paul Greatrix admitted the fire was a massive setback but said the college would rebuild the chemistry laboratory . Eyewitnesses reported seeing the bright orange flames from as far as seven miles away. Student Pollyanna Ward said: 'It just looked like a really bright light was coming from the building, then the building burst into flames.' Claire Chubb, 19, added: 'We rushed back to see how bad it was. We could just see it glowing in the sky.' And Joe Jones, a 33-year-old PhD student at the university, said: 'I thought my friend was joking when he told me how big the fire was. 'I know people who are due to move into that building when it opens. It will be a major setback for them and the university as a whole.' Dr Paul Greatrix, registrar at the university, said: 'We are incredibly grateful to our staff and students for their fantastic response in dealing with this major incident and would like to express our gratitude to Nottinghamshire Fire Service. 'It was the quick action of their fire crews which prevented this incident from being much more serious. We have also been extremely touched by the messages and best wishes from our close neighbours out in the community. 'We would like to thank the wider higher education community across the UK for its support - we have had many offers of help from other universities around the country, for which we are extremely grateful. 'To put this loss into perspective, we need to remember that this was one building, that thankfully no one was injured and that the fire was prevented from spreading further on to campus.' Battle: Some 60 firefighters were at the university site, which had been due to open next month. Onlookers reported hearing the sound of several explosions . Inferno: The huge fire - which has devastated the building - could be seen for several miles around. Thousands study on the Jubilee Campus each day . The building was designed to reach carbon neutral status in 25 years to make up the energy expended during its construction. Mr Greatrix added: 'This is a setback for us but one from which we have no doubt we will recover. 'The GlaxoSmithKline Carbon Neutral Laboratory for Sustainable Chemistry is a landmark building which is the embodiment of the University's commitment to sustainability in all its forms, particularly in the area of green chemistry and we will be working closely with our partners at GSK, and the contractors Morgan Sindall, to develop a positive plan of action for rebuilding.' Crews from Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service, Nottinghamshire Police and East Midlands Ambulance Service were also at the scene to ensure the public's safety. It is not yet known what caused the blaze and a spokesperson for NFRS said work to establish the cause of the blaze can only begin fully once the fire is entirely out. Newark fire station manager Seth Armstrong, who took over as the incident commander said firefighters were still 'going in aggressively'. He said: 'It's a very serious incident. I got here about 3am. The first responsibility was to check all the peripheral buildings. 'We're now at the stage where we're can go in there and help with the situation. 'Because it's a timber base, four or five secondary fires were around the scene. There were 12 fire engines and an average of five firefighters per engine. 'We're now trying to ramp it up and going in aggressively and get into the fire site. It will be at least 24 or 26 hours before we can make that massive difference. 'The investigation will follow. It's not safe enough to go in there yet. 'There are lots of pits, shafts and ladders that make it unsafe to go on the site.' After watching the fire rip through the building, student Pollyanna Ward said: ‘It just looked like a really bright light, then the building burst into flames' After more than a 40 firefighters were dispatched to the scene, a fire service spokesman said: 'We were called at 8.36pm to a building under construction'. Charred remains: The skeletal frame of the £15million building - which was due to be opened next month - appeared to be all that remained after the fire . Mr Armstrong confirmed the cause of the blaze was still unknown. The University of Nottingham continued with their open day as planned today with staff saying it was 'business as usual'. Senior security officer at the university, Steve Garrod, said: 'I got called back again to work prior to 9pm. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. 'The firefighters are just dampening down. It's business as usual. The open day is still going ahead and so is the badminton competition. 'We are going to conduct an investigation into the building opposite. 'Once it was opened, running it was going to cost nothing to run because it's made out of sustainable sources. 'We are trying to open the surrounding businesses as well.' A spokesman for Morgan Sindall, the main contractors for the building, added: 'Everyone on the project team has been working hard to deliver this state-of-the-art low carbon laboratory for the university and we are of course greatly saddened to see the devastation caused by the fire. 'We are supporting the fire service investigation into the cause of the incident and thank its officers for their efforts last night to tackle and contain the blaze.' Residents living near the university campus have also reacted in shock after flames ripped through the new science building. Carolyn Wilkinson, 41, who could see the drama unfolding from her home, said: 'It was at about quarter to ten I was first alerted to it. 'I had a loft conversion and looked out the sky light. At first I thought my neighbour had a log fire. There were massive bangs. 'We went to bed about quarter past midnight. It was still ablaze but the roof had gone. The building had disappeared. 'It was horrible and it's very sad. I hope it wasn't deliberate.' Jean Dunhan, 69, and David Fallows, 69, who live together in nearby Radford, Nottinghamshire, also witnessed the blaze. Mrs Dunhan said: 'My son phoned me yesterday evening to say he had seen it on the internet. I didn't know anything before that. 'We walk around here regularly and we've seen the building being built.' Mr Fallows added: 'I looked out of the back garden window looking out onto the university. I could see flames and sparks. It was just like fireworks going off. 'We went outside out at about 10pm to The Plough pub which is even closer. 'I can't believe what was there before and what is there now. All the workers, all those jobs and money - it's a shame.'","The Carbon Neutral Laboratory for Sustainable Chemistry at Nottingham University caught fire at 8.30pm Friday .

"They normally inhabit the deep waters far off our coast, but thanks to our warm weather huge barrel jellyfish, weighing up to 35kg, have been spotted just off the beaches of Cornwall. Attracted by plentiful plankton the creatures have ventured closer to shore as they feed and reproduce in vast numbers, forming dense groups known as blooms. Scuba diving photographer Charles Hood captured this creature with his 6’3' tall son Will, just off St Michael’s Mount, Penzance, Mr Hood was stunned to find a massive group of barrel jellyfish spread out over an area of eight square miles towards Lands End. Leviathan: Will Hood, who for reference to scale is 6ft 3in, swims with a barrel jellyfish off Cornwall . Beast from the deep: The jellyfish was pictured close to St Michael's Mount, Penzance, Cornwall . ‘We usually get perhaps a dozen sightings a year,’ said Mr Hood. ‘But at the moment they are everywhere, itís like a super bloom with some of them a metre and a half in size. ‘There is a massive amount of plankton forming which they seem to be feeding on.’ The Marine Conservation Society said it had received reports of jellyfish being spotted across the south coast and west coast of England, as well as parts of Scotland because of the warmer weather. Easily identified by their distinctive smooth bell and cauliflower-shaped mass of tentacles that house hundreds of tiny mouths, a digestive system and stinging cells, the jellyfish feed only on microscopic plankton but thankfully pose no threat to swimmers as their sting is not strong enough to harm humans. Last month one of the dustbin-lid-sized creatures was spotted swimming up the Hereford Estuary in Cornwall, fuelling predictions that this summer would see a barrage of the animals . Photographer Charles Hood was stunned to find a massive group of barrel jellyfish spread out over an area of eight square miles towards Lands End . Will, 16, said: ‘It was my first encounter swimming with them and although there’s nothing to fear from their sting I felt fine as I was in a drysuit. ‘There was a tiny little fish living in the tentacles that appeared to be immune to the sting, They could swim relatively quickly for a jellyfish, perhaps about half a kilometre per hour.’ Last month one of the dustbin-lid-sized creatures was spotted swimming up the Hereford Estuary in Cornwall, fuelling predictions that this summer would see a barrage of the animals. Both humans and jellyfish will be glad to know continuous sunshine could be on the way for the . next 40 days – if British folklore is to be believed. Many . will welcome the fact the Met Office is forecasting bright sunshine and . temperatures of 25C, as superstition states that if the sun shines on . July 15, it will continue to do so for the next 40 days. Temperatures were expected to reach 25C across many parts of the country yesterday before soaring to the late twenties on Thursday and Friday making Britain hotter than some European holiday destinations including Ibiza, Nice and Barcelona.

Forecasters say there is is a 'very good chance' the hottest day of the year so far could be surpassed by Friday. The hottest day of 2014 so far was July 4, when 28.7C (83.7F) was detected in Norfolk and Essex. Pictured: One lady cycles past cattle on Midsummer Common in Cambridge, where the sun peeped through the grey clouds . However, . the balmy conditions towards the end of the week – which could see the . hottest day of the year so far surpassed – could bring ‘thundery’ rain. Mr . Williams said there was a chance heavy showers could develop in parts . of the UK on Thursday before it clears later in the afternoon.

While legend states that rain on July 15 means it will rain for the next 40 days, it also says that if it remains dry for the day, the country will be in for 40 days of sun. Pictured: Ellie Wimshurt, 22, wanders through Barley Wood Walled Garden in Somerset .

Pictured: Ken Roberts cuts daisies at Somerset Flower Farm in Wrington, Somerset where temperatures reached up to 25C today . The conditions, which should . ease when a band of fresher air sweeps in on Sunday, are not expected to . trigger the Met Office's official threshold for a heatwave. While . the legend states that rain on July 15 means it will rain for the next . 40 days, it also says that if it remains dry for the day, the country . will be in for 40 days of sunshine. The British folklore dates back to c.800, when St Swithun was a Saxon bishop at Winchester Cathedral. As he lay on his deathbed he asked to be buried outside where he would be trodden on and rained on. His . wishes were followed for nine years, then on July 15, 971, the monks of . Winchester attempted to remove his remains to a shrine inside the . cathedral. This week's warm weather heralds the start of another hot spell in Britain, where temperatures could exceed those in popular European holiday destinations such as Barcelona, Ibiza and Nice. Pictured: A man enjoys a walk through Midsummer Common in Cambridge this afternoon as the sun makes a break through the clouds . According to legend, the . removal was accompanied by ferocious and violent rain storms which . lasted 40 days and nights and were said to indicate the saint's . displeasure at being moved. The . story soon became British folklore and ever since the weather patterns . on July 15 have been closely followed by the superstitious. The . folklore’s rhyme reads: 'St Swithin’s day if thou dost rain, For 40 . days it will remain. St Swithin’s day if thou be fair, For 40 days . ’twill rain no more.' However, . the Met Office has routinely said there is no ‘scientific evidence’ supporting the folklore and said numerous studies have been carried out . on past weather observations, with none proving the legend to be true. It . also said that since the start of records in 1861, there has been . neither 40 dry or 40 wet days following the corresponding weather on St . Swithun's Day. While . it is unlikely that any one location will see rain fall every day for . the next 40, there is some element of truth to weather patterns . continuing. By this point in the summer, the jet stream is usually set in a pattern which tends to last until the end of August. The jet stream is a fast-flowing current of air located around four to seven miles up in the atmosphere. It . tends to steer the areas of high and low pressure around the globe and . marks a boundary between cold air to the north and warmer air to the . south. If it is . sitting to the north of the UK, then warm air tends to invade from the . south, usually associated with high pressure building in from the . Azores, leading to fine and settled weather for the British Isles.

"Air crash investigators searching for Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 hope to further narrow down the planned search area to find the doomed Boeing 777 within the next year. The aircraft vanished on March 8 with 239 passengers and crew on board after it departed Kuala Lumpar in Malaysia to Beijing in China. Over the past six months, international experts searched for the aircraft using a range of data in a bid to narrow down the crash site. Scroll down for video . The Australian government has released an updated map showing the new, smaller search area for MH370 . Experts have spent the past six months remapping large areas of the sea floor to facilitate the search . Extensive aerial searches failed to spot any wreckage from the airliner, but experts have studied radar and satellite data in a bid to close in on the crash site. Martin Dolan of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau is leading the search and feels confident that he will be able to announce a smaller search area shortly based on satellite data and the use of flight simulators. He said new seabed surveys have also produced some interesting findings including hard objects that seem inconsistent with their surroundings, although there is no guarantee that this is the aircraft. He told The Times: ' There is nothing that has screamed out and said ""I look like an aircraft"". 'It's still a hell of an area. The area is horribly, horribly complicated.' The Boeing 777 jet departed Kuala Lumpar and vanished without a trace after disappearing from radar, file pic . Australian deputy PM Warren Truss, right, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Malaysian transport minister Dato' Seri Liow Tiong Lai in Canberra last night to agree to fund the renewed search . Mr Dolan earlier wrote on his blog that the new search will concentrate on a 60,000 square kilometre area of the southern Indian Ocean. 'The complexities surrounding the search cannot be understated. It involves vast areas of the Indian Ocean with only limited known data and aircraft flight information. 'While it is impossible to determine with certainty where the aircraft may have entered the water, all the available data indicates a highly probable search area close to a long but narrow arc of the southern Indian Ocean. 'The search will be a major undertaking. The complexities and challenges involved are immense, but not impossible. 'The best minds from around the world have been reviewing, refining and localising the most likely area where the aircraft entered the water, which is why we remain confident of finding the aircraft.' Last month the Malaysian and Australian governments signed a memorandum of understanding where they both agreed to fund the renewed search effort.","Experts have spent six months remapping the sea floor to help searchers .

"Former Conservative communications chief Andy Coulson is still being held in a high-security prison alongside terrorists and murderers - despite a judge recommending that he be sent to an open prison. The 46-year-old ex-News of the World editor was sent to the notorious maximum-security Belmarsh prison in south east London after being convicted of conspiracy to hack phones on July 4. His lawyers had been expecting him to be moved to an open prison. Former Conservative communications chief Andy Coulson, pictured, is still being held in a high-security prison alongside terrorists and murderers - despite a judge recommending that he be sent to an open prison . But six weeks later Mr Coulson, who was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones, has still not been categorised, meaning he is not yet eligible for a move. At a costs hearing last month, Mr Justice Saunders, who presided over the phone hacking trial, expressed concern that Mr Coulson remained in Belmarsh, a category A prison holding high-risk prisoners. He offered to write to the prison governor, Phil Wragg, more than a fortnight ago. However, despite having done this, it emerged last night that the authorities still haven’t completed the paperwork for Mr Coulson’s move to another establishment. By comparison, disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris, who was found guilty of a series of child sex offences, has already been downgraded to the Bullingdon Category C jail in Oxfordshire – despite being sentenced on the same day as Mr Coulson. Ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson was sent to the notorious maximum-security Belmarsh prison, pictured,  in south east London after being convicted of conspiracy to hack phones on July 4 . Mr Couslon, a father-of-three, is being held alongside a number of Islamic terrorists and convicted killers. Neville Thurlbeck, the News of the World’s former chief reporter who was also jailed in Belmarsh for phone-hacking, wrote this week on a blog that ‘despite being left in a Category A prison, Andy Coulson is in good spirits and is getting on well with his fellow inmates’. He added: ‘Reports that he has been attacked are totally untrue. 'We have been in each other’s company for between 22 to 24 hours per day and I have witnessed nothing other than the hand of friendship to both of us. We would like to put the record straight on this.’ It is believed that if and when Mr Coulson is transferred, it would be to Standford Hill open prison in Kent, near his home.","Andy Coulson was sent to notorious Belmarsh prison after conviction .

"Two former students at British universities are among those missing following the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, it has emerged. One, Huan Peen Chan, 46, studied engineering and computing at the University of Sunderland between 1992 and 1995, while Yue Wenchao, 26, went to Hull University Business School. Popular Mr Chan - known as Jesse - played the church organ at Sunderland Free Church while he was a student in the city. British connection: Yue Wenchao, one of the passengers of the missing Malaysian jetliner, was a student at the University of Hull . Missing: Mr Chan was one of 239 people on board flight MH370, which vanished on March 8 . Following his return to Malaysia, friends he made in the UK would regularly visit him and his wife Janet, and children Xanthus and Lukas, in Kuala Lumpur. Church pastor and close friend John Cropley, 66, said: ‘When we heard that Jesse was onboard, we felt a combination of disbelief and shock but knew his faith would remain strong. ‘At present we still want to cry with sadness at the thought of what Janet and the children are going through, her pain must be intense - the unknown is much more frightening as we are all left to the mercy of our imagination. A map showing the possible routes MH370 could have taken after it vanished from radar on March 8 . UK contribution: Survey ship HMS Echo is being sent to help with the search for MH370 . ‘Jesse is a very gentle and humble person, with an infectious smile and the ability to paint pictures with his music. He was never grumpy, always the same and you could depend on him - just a gentle soul. ‘He became, and remains, a very close friend to my wife and I and many others in Sunderland.’ A spokesperson for the University of Sunderland said: ‘We are deeply concerned to hear reports that one of our graduates, Huan Peen Chan may be one of the passengers on board the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. ‘Although we are not able to confirm these reports at this time, we wish to pass on our thoughts to the family at this difficult time.’ Relentless: Royal Australian Air Force crew members discuss the search area aboard the Royal Australian Airforce AP-3C Orion on Friday . Team effort: A Royal Australian Air Force AP-3C Orion search plane passes over the Norwegian car transport ship Hoegh St Petersburg, which has joined the search operation . Jesse, an engineer at Malaysian business Freescale Semiconductor, was among 26 of the company's employees who were onboard the flight. Yue Wenchao, of University of Hull Business School, had written ‘see you in Beijing’ next to a photo of his girlfriend on a website an hour before he boarded. The agency co-ordinating the . exhaustive search operation for MH370 still holds out hope of finding . people alive, as authorities scramble to cover the massive 600,000 . square-kilometre (230,000 square-mile) search area. The . Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) revealed on Friday that . they were preparing for the remote possibility of a human rescue . mission, should the two large objects spotted by satellite some 2,500 . kilometres (1,500 miles) off the coast of Perth be related to the . missing Malaysian Airlines flight. John . Young, the general manager of AMSA's Emergency Response Division, said . the focus of the massive search operation - which now includes 29 . planes, 21 ships and six helicopters from more than 20 contributor . countries - was first and foremost on trying to locate the large pieces . of debris, one up to 24 metres (78ft) in length, the other five metres . (16 feet). 'We want to find these objects because they might be the best lead to where we might find people to be rescued,' Mr Young said. 'We have done some work on that area and we're still focused on that task, to find people to be rescued. Hi-tech: Royal Australian Air Force crew members monitor their instruments aboard an AP-3C Orion, 1500 miles southwest of Perth . Scouring: Royal Australian Air Force pilot Russell Adams searches an area some 2,500 kilometres southwest of Perth for debris possibly from MH370 . 'It is a very large team effort... with the international community providing technical support and . information and we're all very grateful for that.' The . two objects are in one of the most remote areas of the world - about . the same distance from Perth as London is from Moscow - which means that . aircraft only have a limited time to conduct searches. And it takes them four hours to get there. What's more, the area is renowned for shipping debris - so much so that it's dubbed 'the maritime dustbin'. There is a strong chance, therefore, that the objects in fact fell off a ship. Australian . Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who announced news of the objects on . Thursday, warned: 'It could just be a container that has fallen off a . ship. We just don't know.' Treacherous weather hampered . Thursday's search effort, but the operation resumed on Friday in much . clearer weather, with planes scouring an area slightly to the north of . the zone that was combed initially. This is because strong currents may have moved the objects. 'It's . about the most inaccessible spot that you can imagine on the face of . the earth, but if there is anything down there, we will find it,' Mr  Abbott told reporters in Papua New . Guineau, where he is on a visit. 'We owe it to the families of those people (on board) to do no less.' The . pilot from the first RAAF P3 Orion to return from its second sweep of . the search area told a press gathering at Pearce RAAF air base: 'We've . got a lot of hope.' 'We got out there and had really good weather,' he said. 'Compared to yesterday the visibility was great, more than 10km visibility, we had a really opportunity to see. 'There are more aircraft out there, still searching, and with any luck we'll find something shortly. We've got a lot of hope.'","Huan Peen Chan, 46, studied at the University of Sunderland .

"Turning on the out-of-office email response before going on holiday is often the final ceremonial step in the build-up to a break, yet even on the beach a pinging inbox is difficult to ignore. Now, one of the world's biggest car manufacturers has gone one step further to ensure its employees can truly switch off – by automatically deleting any emails that land in their inboxes. Daimler, the German car manufacturer, has guaranteed its 100,000 staff members a blissed-out break as they can now choose to have all their new emails deleted while they are away. German car manufacturer Daimler has guaranteed its 100,000 staff members a blissed-out break by offering to automatically deleting any emails that land in their inboxes . Those who send an email to the vacationing employee are notified by a 'Mail on Holiday' message that the email has not been received, and are invited to contact a nominated substitute instead. 'Our employees should relax on holiday and not read work-related emails,' Daimler board member Wilfried Porth told the Financial Times. 'With 'Mail on Holiday' they start back after the holidays with a clean desk. There is no traffic jam in their inbox. That is an emotional relief.' Daimler said its employees are free to decide whether they wish to use the 'Mail on Holiday' system, but assured staff it would not record who had done so. For many who receive hundreds, if not thousands of emails in the space of a few days, the prospect of returning from a break to an empty inbox is tantalising, but it raises questions of office etiquette and being branded work-shy. While it may not catch on so quickly in Britain, the German government has has pushed for initiatives to improve work-life balance, and its labour ministry has told managers to stop emailing or calling staff out-of-hours except in an emergency. Managers at Deutsche Telekom also agreed to stop sending emails to staff during the evenings, weekends and holidays, while in 2011 Volkswagen announced that company servers would stop routing emails to employee BlackBerrys during the evenings. Daimler said those who send an email to the vacationing employee are notified by a 'Mail on Holiday' message that the email has not been received, and are invited to contact a nominated substitute instead . The trend comes as more than half of office staff admit to checking their their emails while on a break abroad, according to a survey from online travel agent Travel Republic It found that 52 per cent will log in for work when they should officially be chilling out and 26 per cent of those said they would respond to emails. Women were also more relaxed than men during their time off, with 54 per cent saying they never looked at work emails, compared with 42 per cent of men. Reading work emails had caused 36 per cent of couples to fall out and 70 per cent of women confessed to having a problem with their other halves checking their emails on holiday compared with 58 per cent of men who saw it as an issue. Researchers, who quizzed 1,000 UK-based office workers, found that younger employees were the most conscientious, with 38 per cent of them claiming to read and respond to emails when they are away, compared with 29 per cent of those aged 45-54. Among those aged between 35-44, 45 per cent said they let their out-of-office message do what it's intended for and never checked their emails. Travel Republic's chief marketing officer Elliott Pritchard said most people felt relief when they took a break from work, but added: 'We initially wanted to understand the emotions people experience when preparing to leave the office for annual leave, and the biggest emotion is relief (46 per cent). 'As workplaces become busier, annual leave becomes more of a luxury, but the reality is that many office workers cannot completely turn off.'","Daimler has guaranteed its 100,000 staff members a blissed-out break .

"It's been nearly six months since Danica Weeks lost the love of her life. What happened to him? Where did he go? Is he dead? Or could he possibly be alive? These are just some of the questions which remain unanswered not just for Paul Weeks' wife but also their two little boys Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 1. How can life go on when all a grieving family has to go by are the conspiracy theories about how a plane somehow disappeared off the face of the earth. In an interview with Anne Barrowclough, for The Weekend Australian Magazine, the Perth mother-of-two spoke of her continual disbelief and utter despair ever since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 mysteriously vanished on March 8. All she's left with are the memories and his final parting gift - his wedding ring. Scroll down for video . Danica Weeks still can't fathom how Malaysia Flight 370 disappeared and took away her husband on March 8 . 'Every morning I wake up and think, ""How do you lose a plane?"" I can't even begin to grieve yet,' Mrs Weeks said. She waited for days, weeks and months - still, nothing. Paul Weeks is among the 239 lost souls on the MH370 aircraft, which still remains missing . The 40-year-old says her life stopped the moment she was informed that her 39-year-old husband was among the 239 lost souls when Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 crashed into a remote area of the southern Indian Ocean. This wasn't part of their grand plan - of moving to Perth, leading a simple family life and most importantly growing old together. The couple first met 14 years ago at Oktoberfest in Munich. From then on, romance was born and they pair lived together in London for a couple of years until they relocated to Christchurch in New Zealand - Mr Weeks' hometown. But following the earthquakes, they decided to make the move to Perth in 2011 where they wanted to settle down and raise their two kids. On March 8, Mr Weeks boarded MH370 so he could make his way to Mongolia to start his new fly-in-fly-out job as a mechanical engineer. His precious final moments are ingrained in Mrs Weeks' memories, as she revealed that her husband gave her his watch and wedding ring amid concerns that something may happen to him at the mining site. He requested the wedding ring was to go to the first son who gets married and the watch to the second. But for now, Mrs Weeks keeps the ring close to her heart by wearing it around her neck. 'Every night now I go home and it's lonely, it’s very lonely. When you've had someone there for 14 years, how do you keep going when they're gone?' The mother-of-two with her boys Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 1 at their Perth home . Yet the grieving mother tries to keep it together, for the sake of her children. And while Mrs Weeks herself isn't able to put piece the puzzle together herself, she was left with the harrowing task of explaining to her two sons what happened to their father. For eldest son Lincoln, who's understood that his daddy has gone to work forever, he's left anxious that the same will happen to his mother. Witnessing how the tragedy has affected her child, Mrs Weeks is determined more than ever to bring closure to all suffering families. 'That's why I won't rest until I find out what happened to Pauly. That's why I won't let [Malaysia Airlines] treat him like a seat number. I have to keep him alive. And I won't rest until we find out what happened to him and to everyone else on that plane,' she said. As for the second devastating Malaysia Airlines disaster, where a plane flying over the Russian-Ukraine conflict was shot down on July 17 and claimed 298 lives, the pain of loss and bewilderment hit too close to home for Mrs Week. 'Just feel so heart broken, all over again, for all the families of MH17,' she wrote on her Facebook. The 39-year-old mechanical engineer, from New Zealand, was a dedicated father to his two sons . On board the missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 were 12 crew members and 227 passengers . Meanwhile, the search continues for the doomed Boeing 777 as air crash investigators hope to further narrow down the planned search area to find the aircraft within the next year. The plane vanished with 12 crew members and 227 passengers on board after it departed Kuala Lumpar in Malaysia to Beijing in China.

"Maybe this artist is hoping to build on his reputation for creating shocking installations.

Biancoshock is developing a growing following of fans with his 'pop up' installations which appear randomly in streets around Europe. Explaining the idea behind his latest concept, He said: 'Biancoshock is a different concept from being an artist and further still, from being a street artist. 'My ""experiences"" are not showcases to promote my activities, they do not require any description. 'They are simply opportunities to communicate and provoke reactions from common people.

'Fra Biancoshock is convinced that acting in the streets is the best way to get to as many persons as he can, and that irony and provocation are the sharpest weapons one can use.'

"Rhea Holley, pictured, was with a friend, both with new babies, in Costa Coffee in Purley, south London, when her son Arthur began to cry for a feed . A new mother was reduced to tears by a couple who called her a slut for breastfeeding her baby in a coffee shop. Rhea Holley was feeding her  son Arthur, 11 months, when nearby Costa customers said she was ‘disgusting’ and should  ‘control herself’. Mrs Holley, 27, had arranged to visit the coffee shop with a friend who also had a baby. Yesterday she said: ‘Arthur was asleep so I went in and ordered us some drinks and cake. While we sat there he woke up and was quite upset so I started to breastfeed. ‘A couple were on a table facing in such a way that they did not have to look at me. I heard one of them say “it is disgusting” and I was a “slut”.’ Writing on her blog, she added that her friend had confronted the couple, who were in their late 60s. They told her it was ‘offensive’ and she should breastfeed in the cafe’s toilet. The woman added: ‘You know what time babies need feeding. Go home if you can’t control yourself.’ Mrs Holley, an account manager, said the incident was ‘probably the most humiliating thing that’s ever happened to me’. She is the latest in a series of women to be abused for breastfeeding in public. Last month, the head of the Royal College of Midwives said it  suggested that nursing mothers were being demonised. Support: Staff at this Costa Coffee in Purley, south London, pictured, 'reprimanded the couple' who had made the abusive remarks to new mother Rhea Holley . Rhea Holley, pictured right with son Arthur, praised staff at Costa Coffee (file picture left) for supporting her after she was branded 'disgusting' by a pair of elderly customers while she was breast-feeding . Professor Cathy Warwick said that . overstretched health professionals were struggling to give mothers the . individual help they sometimes need to breastfeed for longer, which is . generally considered the healthiest choice for the baby. Mrs . Holley, who lives with husband Christopher, 32, in Faversham, Kent, . said the couple made her feel ‘broken’ but praised Costa Coffee workers . at the branch in Purley, South London. She . said she spoke to staff, who then ‘reprimanded’ the couple. She added: . ‘It was so good of them not only to stand by the law on breastfeeding . but also to be so supportive of someone feeling so upset.’ The . Equality Act 2010 makes it an offence for staff to ask a breastfeeding . woman to leave a public place, such as a park, cafe or bus. Emma . Pickett, of the Association of Breastfeeding Mothers, said the Act left . a loophole open because it only applied to staff and business owners, . not other customers. A . spokesman for the charity Maternity Action agreed, adding: ‘We regularly . hear from women who experience harassment because they have breastfed . in public. ‘It’s time the . Government started educating businesses and the wider community to . support breastfeeding women, rather than shaming them. ‘Service . providers have to intervene and support women if they are  experiencing . difficulties with other customers, but legislation does not . specifically outlaw customers from making comments such as those . directed at Mrs Holley.’ A spokesman for Costa said: ‘We have always been very happy for mothers to breastfeed in stores.’ In . March, Heather Vaughan, 29, said she was left in tears after a male . staff member at the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth . ordered her to stop breastfeeding in its creche, saying: ‘We don’t  do . that here.’ The same month, Emily Slough was branded a ‘tramp’ by . internet trolls after somebody took a photograph of her breastfeeding in . public in Rugeley, Staffordshire. Elsewhere, nurses stopped Gemma . Murphy, 37, from feeding her infant daughter in a waiting room at St . Cross Hospital in Rugby. The . Equality Act 2010 made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding . woman to leave a public place such as a cafe, shop or public transport . It states that a business cannot discriminate against mothers who are breastfeeding a child of any age. In . Government guidelines, companies are advised to make sure women they . are providing a service to 'are allowed to breast feed on your premises . if they want to'. It also advises that staff are trained to understand the rights of breast feeding mothers. Under the Act 2010, discriminating against someone because they are with a breastfeeding mother is also prohibited.","Rhea Holley verbally abused by couple in their 60s as she fed baby Arthur .

"The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, pictured, has accused payday lenders of practising usury and lending money at unreasonable rates . Shutting down payday lenders such as Wonga could leave society at the hands of men who ‘send people round with baseball bats’, according to the Archbishop of Canterbury – who previously condemned the company. The Church of England last week defended its decision to invest in Wonga saying it believed its money could improve the behaviour of companies that are less than ‘morally perfect’. It came after the City of London Police announced it is considering launching a criminal investigation into the controversial payday loan firm’s bogus legal letters sent to tens of thousands of customers. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby has accused payday lenders of practising usury and lending money at unreasonable rates. But at a lecture in Westminster earlier this month he warned that putting such firms out of business before an alternative is in place could make things worse by leaving poor people at the mercy of criminal loan sharks. ‘Of course I am concerned – and this has a lot to do with the future of the City, the future of the financial services industry in this country – that if you knock payday lenders on the head before there is a viable alternative, in many parts of the country, the only place people can go is loan sharks’, he said. ‘Those are the criminal lenders as opposed to the payday lenders about whom we may argue amongst ourselves, but I would argue are charging usurious rates of interest but are perfectly legal and overseen. ‘They do not send people round with baseball bats. One of the worries at the moment is if payday lending declines very rapidly and credit unions do not take up the slack, where will people turn? There is a danger of a gap in the market.’ The Archbishop’s comments are the latest revelations in the turbulent relationship between the Church of England and Wonga. He was previously one of the most vocal critics of payday lenders and publicly declared that he would compete Wonga out of business with a network of church-backed credit unions. But in an embarrassing U-turn the Church changed its stance this week when it was revealed that it will continue investing in Wonga, after the Archbishop realised that the CofE’s financial arm, the Church Commissioners, had holdings in the firm, which are believed to amount to between £75,000 and £90,000. The church’s decision came after a review by its Ethical Investment Advisory Group, the body which counsels church financiers on the morality of their investments. Last week City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority revealed Wonga would have to pay £2.6million compensation to 45,000 people sent letters from two invented debt recovery firms (file picture) The Church commissioners are said to have calculated that they will lose between £3 million and £9 million if they take their money out of Wonga. And a review by its Ethical Investment Advisory Group, the body which counsels church financiers on the morality of their investments also justified its continued investment in the morally unscrupulous company. In the report, group chairman James Featherby said that the row had ‘highlighted some misconceptions about ethical investment, and in particular that its objective is to achieve a morally perfect portfolio’. He said: ‘It is no more realistic to desire that they invest only in morally perfect companies than it is to desire that any of us should relate only to morally perfect individuals. ‘When engaging with companies the investing bodies seek positive momentum not perfection. We usually only recommend divestment where we see no genuine desire for change.’ Wonga was publicly castigated and was forced to pay out £2.6m in compensation this week when it was found to have sent out letters from fake law firms to tens of thousands of customers chasing them for money. The Financial Conduct Authority is meeting with officers from the City of London Police this week to discuss whether there is enough evidence to start a criminal investigation into the firm.","Most Rev Justin Welby accuses payday lenders of lending at unreasonable rates .

"A Chinese man has a basketball sized 'head' growing from the left side of his chest as doctors attempt to create him a new face. Yan Jianbin suffered severe burns to his face when he was electrocuted. As he opened the door of a high-voltage transformer to peer inside, he suffered the powerful shock. The technician was left severely disfigured having lost his right eye and nose. Scroll down for video . Yan Jianbin suffered severe burns when he was electrocuted. Doctors are in the process of growing him a new face on the left side of his chest, (right) after he lost his right eye and nose . Surgeons have, for the last six months, been injecting saline into Yan's chest to stretch the skin. They now hope to create new facial features, using the guide, above . But doctors at the Shenyang Army General Hospital, in Liaoning Province, said they hope to create a new face for Yan. Six months ago they embarked on a detailed procedure to stretch the skin on the left side of his chest. The aim was to create a head-shaped mound, by injecting saline water into his chest to expand the skin. The skin has now expanded to the point where plastic surgeons can begin the task of creating new facial features for Yan. The next stage will involve reattaching his new face to his damaged skin. Thanks to the saline injections, the skin has now expanded to the point where plastic surgeons can begin the task of creating new facial features for Yan . Doctors said the whole procedures will be broken down into five complex stages. The first two phases involve building Yan a new nose. Surgeons will use part of his rib cartilage and newly created skin to form his new nose. The third phase involves creating new blood vessels and arteries. The fourth is the face transplantation, while the last phase will involve details carving to finish the process, and fine-tune Yan's new facial features. Surgeons said the whole process will take at least two years. A team of Chinese doctors gave a teenage girl a new face after growing a graft on her breast. Xu Jianmei, 17, had been left disfigured by a fire when she was five years old. Last year it emerged she had surgery in the city of Fuzhou, in Fujian province, in the southeast of the country. Waking from the operation the teenage discovered she once again had a chin, eyelids and an ear. Xu Jianmei, 17, was left disfigured by a fire when she was five years old. Last year surgeons gave her a new face, allowing her to smile for the first time in 12 years . Doctors stretched the skin on her chest to create enough to make a new face . But she said the best thing about having the surgery, was gaining the ability to smile for the first time in 12 years. Ms Xu's parents could not afford the operation but she was given hope when doctors offered to carry out the pioneering procedure free. The transplant team implanted a blood vessel from her leg into her chest and used a water-filled balloon to expand her skin, to create enough to make a new face. ‘With her new face she will be able to express herself in a more precise way. She will even be able to blush when her emotions change, but it will take a long time,’ her surgeon, Jiang Chenhong, said at the time. ‘First, we took a piece of blood vessel fascia from her thigh and implanted it in her chest. ‘Then we inserted a skin expander beneath the part of skin where the blood vessel fascia was planted, so that the part could expand and produce enough skin for her new face,’ he added.","Yan Jianbin was working in northern China when he was electrocuted .

"One of the last people to see Lord Lucan has claimed that the missing peer was driven to kill after a pet kitten he bought for his children had its throat cut and was posted through his letter box. George Weiss  said that Lucan, who vanished in 1974, had bought the kitten from Harrods and sent it to his estranged wife Veronica and their children at their home in London's Belgravia. However, when Lucan discovered the animal had been posted back through his letter box with its throat cut, it pushed him into attacking Lady Lucan and killing his children's nanny Sandra Rivett, according to Mr Weiss. Friend: George Weiss (left), one of the last people to see Lord Lucan (right), claims that the missing peer was driven to kill after a pet kitten he bought for his children had its throat cut and was posted through his letter box . 'He saw no way back into family life and the life of his children. It tipped him over the edge and it made him decide to uncreate his wife,' Mr Weiss, now 74, told the Daily Mirror's David Collins. Mr Weiss had seen Lucan at the Clermont Club in Mayfair on November 6, 1974 - the day before the murder - and the pair had played backgammon. He said Lucan, who was facing heavy gambling losses at the time, hardly spoke, and had been acting strangely when he saw him at the club, and when he asked what was the matter, Lucan had replied nothing was wrong. Theory: It is believed that Lucan, a professional gambler, mistook Sandra Rivett (left) for his wife Veronica (right) and hit her with lead piping. Lady Lucan was also attacked and later identified Lucan as her assailant . Couple: Lord and Lady Lucan had married in 1963 and had three children together, but the marriage collapsed in 1972 and he moved put of the family home and into a house on a neighbouring street . Victim: Mrs Rivett's body was found hidden in an old U.S. mail sack in the basement of the house . 'And seeing him sitting across from me on our usual backgammon table the day before the murder is an image that has stayed with me for the last 40 years,' said Mr Weiss, who was also friends with the late comedian Peter Cook and Charles Saatchi. 'I believe he was plotting his wife’s murder. He was in a world of his own, playing as if he were on autopilot.' Mr Weiss then asked another friend, financier Stephen Raphael, if he knew why Lucan seemed so distant. Venue: Mr Weiss had seen Lucan at the Clermont Club in Mayfair on November 6, 1974 - the day before the murder - and the pair had played backgammon . Suspicions: Mr Weiss (pictured) says he believes Lucan was plotting his wife's murder while he at the club . Family: Mr Weiss says the cat had been purchased by Lucan for his three children, pictured with their mother the month after their father's disappearance . He said Mr Raphael then told him that Lucan had bought the kitten for his children to cheer them up during the acrimonious separation from Lady Lucan and their bitter custody battle. The couple had married in 1963 and had three children together, but the marriage collapsed in 1972 and he moved put of the family home and into a house on a neighbouring street. Mr Weiss said Lucan had taken the cat to the family home, but just hours later it was posted through his letter box  with its throat cut. Wife: Lady Lucan, pictured earlier this year, believes her husband took his own life after the crime . Mr Weiss said Lucan had been at the Clermont from 4.30pm until 7.30pm when he left for a restaurant. It was the last time he ever saw him. The next day, November 7, 1974, Mrs Rivett's murder and Lucan's subsequent disappearance would spark Scotland Yard's biggest ever manhunt. It is believed that Lucan, a professional gambler, mistook Mrs Rivett for his wife and hit her with lead piping. Her body was found hidden in an old U.S. mail sack in the basement of the house. Lady Lucan was also attacked and later identified Lucan as her assailant. As the police began their murder investigation he telephoned his mother, asking her to collect the children, and then drove a borrowed Ford Corsair to a friend's house in Uckfield, Sussex. Hours later, he left the property and was never seen again. The Corsair was later found abandoned in Newhaven, its interior stained with blood and its boot containing a piece of bandaged lead pipe similar to one found at the crime scene. A warrant for his arrest was issued a few days later and in his absence, the inquest into Mrs Rivett's death named him as her murderer - the last occasion in Britain a coroner's court was allowed to do so. Lucan, who would  be celebrating his 80th birthday next month, was never seen again. In 1999 his family was granted probate over his estate, although no death certificate was issued. However, there have been reported sightings of him as far afield as Australia, Ireland and South Africa as the mystery continues to capture the public's imagination. His half-brother Hugh Bingham said last year that Lucan died in 2004 and is buried in Africa, while his son George Bingham has said that he believes his father drowned in the English channel. His youngest daughter, Lady Camilla Bloch QC, who was four at the time of the murder, said last year that it was important to remember that her father had never stood trial and insisted that evidence against him was ‘circumstantial’. Lady Lucan, now 76, has said she is bored with the constant claims that her husband might still be alive and of the numerous unconfirmed sightings of him. She is adamant her husband took his own life shortly after the crime and that she had long ago learned to forgive him.","George Weiss says Lucan had bought the cat for his children as a present .

"A 13-year-old who lost a leg to cancer will get a new life-changing prosthetic limb from Britain's biggest-ever lottery jackpot winners. Heartrendingly Kieran Maxwell had to be helped from the ground after he fell carrying the Olympic torch last month in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, because of his current heavy artificial leg. But now he will be able to 'walk, run and climb just like his friends,' his emotional mother Nicola said today, thanks to Euromillionaires Colin and Chris Weir. Scroll down for video . Brave: Kieran Maxwell carrying the Olympic Flame on the Torch Relay soon before he stumbled and fell because of a heavy prosthetic and now he is aiming for Paralympic glory . Despite undergoing gruelling chemotherapy the brave 13-year-old had his left leg amputated below the knee in March last year. He was diagnosed with the rare and aggressive cancer called Ewings Sarcoma, which affects around than 50 children a year, in October 2010. Since then Kieran has been determined to remain active but his current replacement limb is heavy and slows him down, so his parents Nicola and Alistair decided to try to raise the cash to buy him a lighter model from the US. But Euromillions winners Colin and Chris Weir from Ayrshire - who scooped £161 million in a draw a year ago - heard about Kieran's battle and stepped in with a five-figure donation to buy the new leg outright. And Kieran is said to have 'screamed with delight' at the life-changing news and will have his leg within six weeks. The unexpected donation came after the grandmother of Kieran’s school friend, who lives in the same village as the Weirs, contacted them to ask if they could help. Happy: EuroMillions lottery winners Chris Weir and her husband Colin Weir say it was a privilege to spend a little of their £161m on Kieran . Hero: His mother and family are incredibly proud of the happy teenager who lost a leg to cancer but has rebuilt his life . Mum Nicola Maxwell said: 'Kieran is our hero and we have been touched by all the support and kindness we’ve received since he was diagnosed with cancer. 'We thought it was going to take a long time to raise the money for a new prosthetic leg, but this donation from Chris and Colin means Kieran can get his new leg within six weeks. We can’t explain how much this means to us and Kieran. 'He screamed when he heard the news because it means that not only will he be able to walk again like all his friends, he will be able to run and climb too. 'We can’t thank the Weirs enough, because this will really change his life. Heartbreaking: Kieran's bravery was clear for all to see when he fell while holding the Olympic torch because of his current artificial limb. He got up and dusted himself off in yet another incredible show of strength . 'Kieran started yelling and dancing around when he heard. He couldn't believe it. I am still pinching myself. 'What they have done for Kieran will be a small drop in the ocean for them but for him it will change his life. 'He can go back to being a normal boy. He can be himself. Words cannot describe what they have done.' The Lottery winners paid tribute to his bravery and said it was privilege to help. Mrs Weir said: 'When we heard about Kieran and his family’s fantastic efforts to raise money for a new prosthetic leg, we had to help. 'It is a privilege to support him and, with this new leg, we hope he will continue to be determined to remain active and live life to the full.' Kieran's parents will continue to fundraise, but will now hand over proceeds to the Toma Fund, which helps teenagers with cancer.","Kieran Maxwell had his left leg amputated after getting rare and aggressive cancer Ewings Sarcoma .

"Beverley Hardman pictured leaving Manchester Crown Court yesterday where she is on trial for allegations she helped her boyfriend evade police after he brutally beat and burgled an elderly man . A young mother took selfies of herself with her boyfriend while he was on the run for leaving a pensioner to die following a burglary, a court heard. Beverley Hardman, 25, also helped Daniel Crompton, 24, evade capture during a police manhunt by acting as his 'eyes on the ground,' it was alleged. Yesterday a jury at Manchester Crown Court heard that she hid Crompton in her home from detectives and then drove  Crompton to a friend's house using a story that the pair had fallen out and needed some time apart. Earlier, Crompton had attacked 87-year old widower Frank Worsley during a raid when the pensioner awoke to find him in his bedroom standing over him and demanding cash. During the attack Crompton wrapped his vest around his fist and punched him repeatedly around the face before fleeing with his wallet and bank book. The victim, a grandfather-of-two, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, died in hospital less than three weeks later. Crompton was subsequently convicted of murder. Hardman, a mother-of-one, admitted knowing Crompton had burgled the house of a nearby acquaintance on the night of August 3 last year but denied having any knowledge of the attack on Mr Worsley. But the jury were shown phone transcripts where she asked her boyfriend 'where are the passports?' after police came knocking. Prosecuting, Rob Hall said: 'On the face of it this suggests they are going to get out of the Bolton area completely. Is that the sort of response you might expect of a boyfriend and girlfriend as a consequence of the knowledge of just one burglary where a touch screen computer was taken? Or a burglary where an 87-year-old man was beaten to the point where he died a few weeks later?' They were also shown 'selfies' the pair snapped together hours after the robbery of widower Mr Worsley - which prove her 'motivation' for hiding him, it was said. Mr Hall added: 'Her loyalty was such she wanted to protect him at all costs, possibly even ahead of her own self. 'There is a snapshot of the state of mind between them through two photos taken on her phone. At 5.17am on August 3 you can quite clearly see the defendant and Daniel Crompton. 'The Crown say of these photographs that whatever difficulties there might have been from the relationship, they were surmounted by the strength of the bond between the two of them. 'When one is hoping to consider the motivation to help Daniel Crompton avoid the police and avoid responsibility for what he has done, these two photos demonstrate this defendant's attitude at a time so shortly after two burglaries and an assault - and you will be assessing this defendant's knowledge of those events - but these two photos do give some insight into the mood that morning.' Frank Worsley pictured with his late wife Mary. Mr Worsley was killed by Daniel Crompton during a burglary last year. It's alleged Crompton's girlfriend helped him evade police . Daniel Crompton wrapped his vest around his fist and repeatedly punched Mr Worsley (pictured with his late wife Mary) in the head. He died in hospital from the injuries less than three weeks later . Beverley Hardman (pictured right leaving Manchester Crown Court) is alleged to have helped her boyfriend Crompton (left) evade police capture following the deadly burglary . The court heard Crompton went to a friend's house minutes after the robbery of Mr Worsley where Hardman was believed to be present. He was showing signs of a 'scuffle' and with stolen items in hand. He was confronted as to where they had come from, so he left the house and returned a short time later, saying he had binned them. Police first visited Hardman's home on August 4 when the victims of another burglary during which a computer and TV were stolen pointed them in Crompton's direction. But the couple kept their heads down and didn't answer the door, before Hardman took her boyfriend to the home of his friend Ryan Holman in a different area of Bolton, it was said. Police called again later that day and Hardman this time answered. The house was searched and she was asked where her boyfriend was but lied and said she didn't know. She then travelled to the flat Crompton was staying in, when he sent her a text saying: 'don't mention anything about anything when you get here xxxx'. The jury heard a 'tracker' device fitted to her Vauxhall Corsa by her insurance company to monitor mileage had recorded her movements. Days after the burglary incident, police again turned up to Miss Hardman's home on Caverleigh Close, Bolton, and explicitly told her that her boyfriend had violently robbed an 87-year-old man in his own home, it was said. Frank Worsley (pictured) served with the Royal Navy Medical Corps. He was a grandfather and father-of-two and had lived alone since the death of his wife Mary in 2012 . Mr Worsley's former home in Bolton where he was living at the time of the attack . Pictured is Longfield Road, where pensioner Frank Worsley was burgled in his home by Crompton . But Mr Hall added: 'She was not showing any of the sense of surprise you might expect if your knowledge was more limited. They arrested her and at that point there was a one second call from Mr Crompton to the defendant and then a text from Miss Hardman to him to say 'ring me', in the throes of the officers asking questions. 'Both of the defendant's mobile phones were seized. What followed was Daniel Crompton repeatedly telephoning the defendant's phones in an attempt to find out what was going on. She was, after all, his eyes on the ground.' The jury heard police examined a 'tracker' device fitted to her Vauxhall Corsa by her insurance company to monitor mileage and it recorded her movements. She told police after she was arrested following their third visit she had driven to Wigan, but the device showed her repeatedly driving across Bolton, it was alleged. Crompton was eventually arrested at Mr Holman's home on August 5 where he was later charged with robbery and remanded in custody. Mr Worsley died on August 20 which meant Hardman had to be called back to the station for interview nine days later - to which she answered 'no comment' or remained silent to all questions. Hardman denies assisting an offender. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Beverley Hardman accused of helping her boyfriend evade police capture .

"An unemployed alcoholic mother who locked her dog in a toilet and left it to die has walked free from court. Laura Shaw, 23, abandoned her pet Lulu for six weeks, and has now been banned from keeping animals for the next 10 years. Horrific images shown in court revealed how the animal was found covered in swarms of flies, surrounded by the empty food bowls it tried to eat. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Heartless: Laura Shaw has been convicted of animal cruelty after leaving her pet dog to die . The mother of two was prosecuted by the RSPCA, but escaped jail after a hearing at Grimsby Magistrates' Court. The court heard how the dog was found dead last August in a downstairs toilet at Shaw's former home in Grimsby, surrounded by faeces and urine. Prosecutor Nigel Burn said there was an 'overpowering foul stench' and the house was swarming with large flies. Empty plates and a bowl were found and it looked as though they had been bitten by the black cross-bred dog in a desperate attempt to satisfy its hunger. Horror: Lulu the dog was found dead locked in a small toilet surrounded by faeces and urine . Shaw, now of no fixed address, admitted two offences of causing unnecessary suffering to a dog by failing to provide veterinary care and leaving it unattended without adequate food and water. She claimed that she was scared to seek help after the dog became ill, but when she was asked about the animal's death she admitted: 'It must have been traumatic and it must have been lonely and scared.' Lauren Fisher, mitigating, said the dog stopped eating and drinking and that she tried giving it milk and different dog food brands, without succes. 'Things spiralled out of control,' she said. 'She did not get the help that was necessary for the dog and neglected her duty as an owner to take the dog to the vet's.' Tragic: The dog was apparently abandoned after she fell ill and started refusing the food she was given . Ms Fisher added that Shaw's former home had been burgled after her windows were smashed and that a large amount of her property had been stolen, causing her 'extreme unhappiness'. She left the house 'feeling scared and unable to cope' and abandoned the dog, who was aged about 18 months to two years. Probation officer Graham Marshall said Shaw had been a mental health support worker but lost her job and later 'drank to oblivion every day whenever she could'. The court heard that the defendant also had more than £10,000 of debts. Squalid: The house in Grimsby was filled with an overwhelming stink when the dog was found last year . Judge Sam Goozee told Shaw: 'You have committed a cruel and despicable offence. The pictures I have seen show the horror and pain that Lulu must have gone through in what was a very slow death. 'The conditions in which she was found are disgusting and she clearly had been dead for a while. 'Looking after an animal brings responsibility and you simply ignored those responsibilities. 'Can you imagine what it would be like if a child went through what Lulu did? As an adult, you would never place a child in that position and you should not place an animal in that position.' Shaw was handed 200 hours of unpaid work, banned from keeping animals for ten years and ordered to pay £150 costs. Speaking after the verdict, an RSPCA spokesman said: 'This was a shocking incident. The poor animal would have suffered terribly, and it is terrible to leave a living creature to die like this. 'We hope this sends a clear to message to people that neglect or abuse of animals is not acceptable.'","Laura Shaw, 23, abandoned pet Lulu when the animal fell ill .

"Joelle Amery is the face of a new Alopecia UK campaign, after losing all her hair when she was eight years old . As a child she endured the cruel taunts of her peers labelling her 'cancer girl' and making light of the fact she had no hair. But Joelle Amery has never been diagnosed with cancer and she's never had to undergo chemotherapy. When she was eight she started to notice her hair was falling out in the shower. Within a few months she was completely bald. Like more and more women across the UK, the teenager, who is now 15, lives with alopecia - the medical term for hair loss. And today she is fronting a new campaign with Alopecia UK to raise awareness as experts say an increasing number of people are being diagnosed with the condition. She said: ‘I am thrilled and honoured to be part of this charity which is close to my heart, as I feel the work of the charity is so valuable.’ Joelle developed alopecia universalis - the most extreme form of the condition which results in complete hair loss from the whole body - at the age of eight. She was bullied as a result and it was not until last summer, six years after developing the condition, that she revealed herself without a wig for the first time. She became an internet sensation when a video she released of her music video went viral and received 200,000 hits on YouTube. However, she told her story to MailOnline, explaining that her flowing brown locks in the video were actually a wig. She also spoke about the condition and the bullying she experienced as a result. Her story was shared across the world and she features on news channels in the UK, China, Brazil the U.S. and Vietnam. Since speaking so openly about her condition, Joelle said she is now finally comfortable in her own skin. She said: 'I have accepted that alopecia is a big part of my life, but it doesn't define me.' Scroll down for video . The 15-year-old endured the cruel taunts of bullies, being labeled 'cancer girl', by youngsters who did not understand the hair loss disease . Joelle said: 'I have accepted that alopecia is a big part of my life, but it doesn't define me' The teenager became an internet sensation after releasing a music video on YouTube last year. She revealed the long brunette locks in the video were in fact her wig when she spoke about her condition for the first time to MailOnline . Alopecia is a hair-loss disease that affects, men, women and children. The onset is often sudden, random and frequently recurrent. Although the disease does not damage a person's physical health, it can have severe effects on quality of life and emotional health through its impact on confidence and self-esteem. Alopecia affects around 1.7 per cent of the population, with men and women equally affected. About 25 per cent of people affected have a family history of the condition. The exact cause of alopecia is not known, although experts generally agree it is a disease of the immune system. There is believed to be a genetic component and in some cases it is linked to stress. In alopecia, the immune system attacks the affected hair follicles by mistake. That halts hair growth and causes hairs to abruptly shed. There are several different types of alopecia, ranging in severity. Alopecia Universalis is the total loss of hair across the body, while Alopecia Totalis is loss of hair on the head alone. The vast degree of sufferers will experience some re-growth, some complete re-growth. To find out more about the condition visit Alopecia UK here. As a result of her experiences she now wants to help normalise hair loss and increase awareness of alopecia. She says it would have been easier if she had had role models to look up to but that she did not know anyone else with the condition. This is something she wants to change in her new role as an Alopecia UK ambassador. She also wants to increase understanding of hair loss in women so it is no longer always associated with cancer. She says some of her biggest challenges as an alopecia patient have come from not wanting to be pitied by people who have mistakenly thought she is seriously ill. She added: ‘People living with alopecia can feel helpless - losing the hair that has made them feel beautiful can lead to serious depression, anxiety and trauma, to self-esteem issues and lack of confidence as well as bullying both at school and in the workplace.’ Experts say that hair loss in women is becoming increasingly common. Dr David Fenton said: ‘Public awareness of hair loss in women has increased, but there is still not enough medical funding and research.’ Joelle added: ‘Hair loss in women has been “covered up” by society, forcing women to hide it more, while it is acceptable for a grown man to be bald. ‘The ultimate goal with all this publicity is to glean as much information about facts and figures, in the hope that more money will be spent on research and ultimately one day, a possible cure.’","Joelle Amery realised clumps of hair were falling out when she was eight .

"When great-grandmother  Maureen Holt asked the man behind the counter at . her local shop to check her EuroMillions ticket, he told her she had . won nothing. Farrakh Nizzar, however, was being somewhat economical with the truth. For the ticket was actually a £1million jackpot winner. In for the win: Maureen Holt, 77, and husband Fred could not believe that 'Lucky' had tried to dupe them and they could be millionaires . After lying to the 77-year-old, he asked: ‘Do you want me to throw the ticket away?’ and Mrs Holt replied: ‘Well, if there’s nothing on it you may as well.’ Nizzar, 30, later phoned the lottery hotline and tried to claim the fortune for himself, claiming he had bought the ticket at the Best One shop. He boasted about his amazing win to the managers of the shop and said the win was ‘life-changing’. He claimed he had already drawn up a shopping list. But Camelot questioned Nizzar after discovering the winning lottery ticket had actually been bought at a nearby supermarket in Oldham. Realising he was not the genuine winner, investigators called in the police before launching a hunt for the legitimate owner. Luckily, they were able to trace Mrs Holt because she had used her Tesco Clubcard when she bought the ticket, and the store had her contact details. CCTV footage also confirmed she had bought it and yesterday Camelot was able to confirm Mrs Holt and her husband were the rightful winners. Caught out: Farrakh Nizzar told  Maureen Holt that her prize ticket was worthless and then started planning what he would spend her winnings on . The mother of seven, whose husband Fred, 80, still works for a security firm, said: ‘I just can’t believe he did this, but at least he got caught. This money will mean my husband can finally give up work and we can enjoy our retirement.’ Nizzar, of Manchester, went on the run when he realised his deceit had been exposed, telling his bosses he was going away on a long holiday. He was eventually arrested by police and appeared before Oldham Magistrates’ Court this week, where he admitted fraud by false representation. He will be sentenced on August 20. The couple had known Nizzar – who they knew as Lucky – for about a year and considered the shop worker trustworthy and friendly. Mrs Holt said: ‘I thought he was a nice young man. He knew me and my husband by name. Everyone calls him Lucky but he wasn’t very lucky this time.’ She said they had been on holiday when the EuroMillions draw was made on June 22. On their return from Spain Mrs Holt went into the Best One convenience store and asked Nizzar to check the numbers for her. She explained: ‘He said “Do you want me to throw it away?” and I said “Well, if there’s nothing on it you may as well”. ‘Then a few days later a lady from Camelot knocked on the door and asked about the ticket. She said there’s a possibility a winning ticket has been presented that’s yours. I couldn’t believe it.’ The couple, who have seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, said they have been so upset by the investigation that they haven’t been able to sleep. Mr Holt said: ‘It’s kept us awake at night. I was really terribly shocked when I found out what happened. It was unbelievable. We feel let down.’ Furious: Musood Ahmed 29, boss of the convenience store where Mrs Holt was tricked, says he thought 'something was not right' when Nizzar said he had won the lottery . The couple aim to buy a new car, make some improvements to their small terraced house in Oldham, and spoil their large family. Mrs Holt said: 'It's such a relief that it's over. It's still all a bit surreal.' Mr . Holt added: 'I officially retired 15 years ago but I've still been . working but I'm only doing two days a week because they said I should . wind down. But I'm going to give up work now. It's just a dream.' The owners of the shop, brothers Mohammed Yasin, 42, and Musood Ahmed, 29, said they were furious at the betrayal of their customers. Mr Ahmed said: ‘He was talking about buying cars and all sorts. But something didn’t sound right. Eventually we sat him down and said if that ticket isn’t yours you are in trouble. He swore on the Koran and on his mum and dad’s life it was his ticket.’ Mr Yasin and Mr Ahmed said they would now look at improving staff training and CCTV coverage. Mr Yasin said: 'I feel absolutely gutted. Especially because it's happened to Fred and Maureen - we've known them for years. 'They are some of the nicest people you will ever meet.' Camelot said it had rigorous security checks in place to ensure the identity of legitimate ticket holders.","Shopkeeper offered to bin 'worthless' winning ticket from pensioner .

"Aldo shoes has announced that it has cut ties with Terry Richardson as the fashion industry continues to distance itself from the controversial photographer. PR director Wendie Godbout told BuzzFeed today: '[We] are not currently working with Terry Richardson and we have no plan to work with him in the future.' Richardson, who has faced numerous accusations of sexual assault over the past few years, has worked for the Canadian shoe and accessories brand since 2010, shooting nine campaigns altogether. Breaking away: Canadian shoe and accessories brand Aldo has cut ties with Terry Richardson as the fashion industry continues to distance itself from the controversial photographer . Aldo follows in the footsteps of Target and H&M, who also recently announced that they would no longer work with the 48-year-old. Vogue, Equinox and the New York Times have also cut ties with him. Last week, New York magazine ran a cover story about the photographer, sparking new interest in the sexual assault claims made by models and other women he has worked with. The story also prompted yet another victim to come forward. In an e-mail to Jezebel, a New York-based writer and stylist named Anna wrote that she was 23 when the controversial photographer invited her to a photo shoot at his home, where he proceeded to ask her to reveal her 'tits' while he posed next to her. He then apparently asked her to crouch down on the floor, and 'suddenly, I felt a d*** pressing into the side of my face,' she revealed. 'He pressed it to my lips. He clearly wanted a blow job and wanted it documented on camera.' Richardson has strongly denied previous accusations that he has acted inappropriately towards them. In a letter obtained by Page Six in March, he called the allegations 'lies' and said the claims were nothing more than an 'emotionally-charged witch-hunt'. Parting ways: The most recent campaign the controversial photographer did for Aldo is somewhat more conservative than his usual style . His work: Richardson has photographed campaigns for the Canadian shoe and accessories brand since 2010. His fall 2013 campaign starred model Jessica Stam (pictured) 'People . have become comfortable concocting hate-filled and libelous tales,' he . said. 'In writing this, I make a humble attempt at correcting these . rumors. Without my voice, all that remain are the lies.' Yet the allegations continue, coming from high profile celebrities and actresses, as well younger, more anonymous models. 'We are not currently working with him and we have no plan to work with him in the future' Supermodel Coco Rocha told Fashion magazine in July 2010: 'I've shot with [Richardson] but I didn't feel comfortable and I won't do it again.' In April of this year, British model Emma Appleton claimed he offered her a shoot with Vogue magazine in exchange for sex. And Danish model Rie Rasmussen said that the girls who work with Richardson 'are too afraid to say no because their agency booked them on the job and are too young to stand up for themselves.' Richardson stated in the New York Magazine piece that despite all the controversy, he feels 'okay with myself about everything.'","The Canadian shoe and accessories brand follows in the footsteps of H&M, Target and Vogue, all of whom have distanced themselves from him ."
"The most common time to have a heart attack or a stroke is 6.30am. Now scientists think they have found out why this is – and it is all down to the body clock. Researchers discovered that levels of a protein in people’s blood that slows the breakdown of clots peaks at 6.30am. People are most likely to have a heart attack or a stroke at 6.30am because of a peak in a protein in the blood . The team, from Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston, and Oregon Health and Science University, looked into why the number of heart attacks and strokes peak in the morning. They studied the protein levels in the bodies of 12 healthy adult volunteers for two weeks. The participants were assessed while their daily routines were desynchronised from their natural body clocks. The aim of this was to establish whether it is the natural body clock or the person’s activities that causes protein levels to fluctuate. Researchers specifically studied changes in the body’s level of the protein Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which inhibits the breakdown of blood clots. These are a major contributor to heart attack and some strokes. The research, published in the journal Blood, found a strict rhythm in body’s level of PAI-1 with a peak at about 6.30am. This protein slows the breakdown of blood clots meaning strokes and heart attacks are more likely . Study author Dr Frank Scheer, director of the Medical Chronobiology Programme at Brigham and . Women's Hospital, said: ‘Our findings suggest that the circadian system, . or the internal body clock, contributes to the increased risk for . cardiovascular events in the morning.’ His . colleague and co-author, Dr Steven Shea, director of the Oregon . Institute of Occupational Health Sciences, added: ‘Our findings indicate . that the human circadian system causes a morning peak in circulating . levels of PAI-1, independent of any behavioural or environmental . influences. ‘Indeed, the circadian system determined to a large extent the PAI-1 rhythm observed during a regular sleep/wake cycle. ‘This morning peak in PAI-1 could help explain adverse cardiovascular events in vulnerable individuals.’ The researchers added that these studies established the circadian control of PAI-1 in healthy individuals and that future research is required to test whether this rhythm is amplified, blunted or shifted in vulnerable individuals, such as those with obesity, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease.","The level of a specific protein in the blood peaks in the early morning .

"A mother of two from Massachusetts says a JetBlue flight attendant did nothing to help when her 3-year-old had a bathroom emergency on the plane - and then publicly humiliated her when the child could not hold it in. Jennifer Devereaux, a photographer from West Newton, was returning home from New York Monday when she says the 30-minute trip aboard JetBlue Flight 518 turned into a nightmare for her and her two daughters. The plane was sitting on the tarmac at John F Kennedy International Airport for about 30 minutes when Devereaux's daughter Summer said she needed to use the restroom. Scroll down for video . Nightmare scenario: Jennifer Devereaux (right) says when her 3-year-old daughter Summer (left) had a bathroom emergency aboard a JetBlue flight, she was yelled at and embarrassed by the crew . Family trip: The mother of two, a photographer from Newton, Massachusetts, was returning home from New York with her daughters when the incident happened . The mother asked a flight attendant if her toddler could use the bathroom, but in response the woman allegedly 'snapped' at Devereaux, ordering her to 'sit down.' But little Summer could not wait any longer and ended up relieving herself in her seat. ‘It wasn’t about bad customer service at that point, it was about bad human decency. My daughter was sitting in a pool of urine and I couldn’t do anything about it,’ Deveraux told CBS Boston. ‘And as a mom it just broke my heart.’ The married mother of two had no napkins or towels on hand, so she was forced to use her own sweater to soak up the mess. As she was trying to tidy up, Mrs Devereaux said the flight attendant yelled at her. ‘And I said, “Please give me a break. My daughter had an accident because you wouldn’t let me take her to the bathroom. After I clean it up I will sit down.” She turned around and reported it to the pilot,’ said Devereaux. Delay: JetBlue fFlight 518 (not pictured) was sitting on the tarmac in JFK for 30 minutes when her toddler declared she needed to go to the bathroom . As the plane was turned around and returned to the gate, the captain’s voice came on the PA system announcing that there is a non-compliant passenger who will be removed by security guards. Jennifer Devereaux, who was traveling alone with her two daughters, grew fearful, but fortunately for her an off-duty pilot who was sitting in front of her was able to convince his colleagues in the cockpit to let her stay. Verbal spat: when the mother of two asked a flight attendant if summer could use the restroom, the woman allegedly snapped at her and told her to sit down . Upon returning home to West Newton, the mother of two penned a complaint to the airline demanding an apology for the flight crew's behavior towards her family. JetBlue responded with a statement saying that they are investigating the incident. Mrs Devereaux also took to Twitter, saying that in the 10 years she has been flying JetBlue, Monday's trip was the worst experience of her life. She also called on the airline to fire the flight attendant, whom she identified as 'Karen,’ for treating her family 'like garbage.' The company tweeted back at Devereaux, apologizing for failing to provide her 'the JetBlue experience' and asking to hear more details. In a later tweet, JetBlue promised to have a customer representative reach out to her as soon as possible. ‘They can't treat kids and families like this,’ she told the station WCVB. ’It's completely crazy.’ Other Twitter users came to the mother’s defense, calling out the airline for the staffer’s conduct. Twitter tiff: The outraged mother demanded on Twitter that JetBlue fire the staffer who turned what was supposed to be a brisk 30-minute flight home into a nightmare . In response to a tweet by user Greg Zollo, who inquired if it was a normal operating procedure to have a 3-year-old pee in the seat, JetBlue responded that they are bound by very strict FAA regulations when a plane is on the tarmac. Jennifer Devereaux said JetBlue eventually offered her a $50 credit, but it will likely go unused since she has vowed never to fly with the airline again.","Jennifer Devereaux was flying from New York to Boston on JetBlue Flight 518 Monday with her two daughters .

"Anderson Cooper is opening up one of his Hamptons homes to renters this summer for a cool $150,000. And because the CNN anchor owns the home next door, there's always the chance to share a few beers come the Fourth of July. Living like a blueblood in the quaint hamlet of Quiogue will cost you though.  While renting the home from Memorial Day to Labor Day is $150,000 - the home can also be rented on a monthly basis. The cost for June is $30,000 while July goes for 60,000 and August to Labor Day is $80,000. This six-bedroom home in the tony Hamptons could be yours for $150,000. CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, who luckily owns TWO homes, is renting his newer purchase out . Neighbors: Cooper also owns the home next door which means prospective renters can look forward to being the CNN anchor's neighbor - at least for three months . Cooper, who is the son of socialite and jeans designer Gloria Vanderbilt, purchased the home two years ago, talking down the asking price of $3.5million to a steal of $1.7million. A source told the New York Post at the time that Cooper bought to property to make sure it wasn't torn down and replaced by a McMansion. The home was built in 1946 and was previously owned by Hollywood screen writer Budd Schulberg who penned 1954's 'On the Waterfront' there. In 2003 he paid $1,150,000 for his first home, next door to the rental. Since becoming the new owner of the pedigreed Quogue home, Cooper has completely renovated the six-bedroomsh the help of a 'well-known' designer, according to listing agents at Douglas Elliman. Features of the home include views of Aspatuck Creek, a heated pool, white chef's kitchen and a separate above-garage apartment. The waterfront great room comes with a brick fireplace, vaulted ceiling and french doors which lead out to the patio on the creek. To escape the blistering summer heat, renters can chill in the air conditioning in the den while watching a movie on the 60-inch television or take a dip in the gunite pool. The shingle style  home, seen top, features views of Aspatuck Creek, a heated pool, a separate above-garage apartment and a great room. It is being rented furnished . Anderson reportedly purchased the home for rent two years ago, seen left, in order to prevent a McMansion from being put up in its place. He has owned the home next door for over a decade . The pool area also has a Jacuzzi and pool house with bathroom and a sitting room. The home has one master suite and three other bedrooms for guests. In addition to the rooms inside the home, a breezeway leads to an above-garage apartment with its own living area, bedroom and full bathroom. The home up for rent is just one in Cooper's expanding real estate portfolio. In the New York City, Cooper lives in a renovated firehouse in Greenwich Village with boyfriend Benjamin Maisani. He purchased the home in September 2009 for $4.3million. Main stay: Cooper's main home is a re-purposed fire house in New York's Greenwich Village neighborhood .","The CNN anchor also owns the home next door in Quogue .

"If stacking the dishwasher is a chore you dread, help may soon be at hand. British scientists have developed a robot which they are training to complete that very task. The robot - which they have named Boris - is the first to have enough intelligence to work out how to grip any single item put in front of it. Scroll down for video . A Birmingham University project has created a robot that can grab plates and cups. It can work out how to pick up different objects placed in front of it. Called 'Boris' (shown) it is controlled by three separate computers . While that is sufficient for most factory production, creating a robot which can pick up and manipulate any single item hugely increases its potential use for industry, surgery, or in the home. The development marks a huge step forward in robotics. Until now robots could only pick up items of a fixed size, placed in a fixed location. Boris - who was publicly unveiled at the British Science Festival in Birmingham today - is controlled by three different computers and has cost £350,000 ($570,000) to build. Professor Jeremy Wyatt, the Birmingham University computing expert who led the project, said loading a dishwasher was his main goal. ‘The scenario that we've got is to get the robot to load a dishwasher,’ he said. ‘That's not because I think that dishwasher-loading robots are an economic, social necessity right now. It's because it encapsulates an incredibly hard range of general manipulation tasks. ‘Once you can crack that, once you can manipulate an object that you've never seen before, you can do a whole bunch of different things. ‘Loading a dishwasher is a really hard task.’ The Boris robot has been created by British scientists . Boris has thick multi-jointed arms that enable it to pick up objects. The robot can learn various grips and costs £350,000 ($570,000) to build . Boris the robot's hands can learn the dexterity needed to pick up objects of different shapes and sizes . Boris performed in public for the first time in front of a festival audience yesterday. Safely confined to a basement laboratory, he reached out with a thick multi-jointed aluminium arm and picked up a measuring jug followed by a dustpan before depositing them in a tray. Significantly, Boris has been programmed to figure out different ways to handle each object, by curling round his fingers to use the whole hand, using the palm of the hand in a power-grip, or adopting a more delicate pinch-grip to grasp an edge. Boris is able to learn the different grips and adapt them to other unfamiliar objects without breaking or dropping them. ‘You've got all the freedom of having all these fingers, so now your brain has got to work really hard,’ said Prof Wyatt. ‘The robot comes up with about 1,000 different grasps in its head in about 10 seconds.’ Boris performed in public for the first time in front of a festival audience yesterday . Boris has been programmed to figure out different ways to handle each object, by curling round his fingers to use the whole hand, using the palm of the hand in a power-grip, or adopting a more delicate pinch-grip . He added: ‘It is fairly commonplace to programme robots to pick up particular objects and move them around - factory production lines are a good example of this. But when those objects vary in size or shape, robots tend to get clumsy. ‘The system we have developed allows the robot to assess the object and generate hundreds of different grasp options. That means the robot is able to make choices about the best grasp for the object it has been told to pick up, and it doesn't have to be re-trained each time the object changes.’ This could have major applications in industry. The project, called Pacman, has been carried out in collaboration with the universities of Pisa in Italy and Innsbruck in Austria, and is funded by the European Commission. The team has already patented the technology, and is working with a firm in Coventry to develop a version of Boris that co-operates with humans on the factory floor. Boris is able to learn the different grips and adapt them to other unfamiliar objects without breaking them . Professor Jeremy Wyatt, the Birmingham University computing expert who led the project, said loading a dishwasher was his main goal . ‘It might be five or 10 years in the future, but you're going to have robots working with humans, and that means they're going to have to cope with all the uncertainty that humans introduce into the environment,’ he said. ‘One of the really big problems on robot assembly lines is if you want to change the part shapes. At the moment, when the world changes, the whole system breaks down. You want to be able to change the parts on short runs very, very quickly.’ A lot more work is needed before a new generation of Boris robots is sent into the real world. The next big step for the scientists is to get Boris to use both his arms and transfer objects from one hand to another. ‘Being bi-manual is a real advantage for all sorts of purposes,’ said Prof Wyatt, who hopes to see the robot stacking plates by next April.","Birmingham University project creates robot that can grab plates and cups .

"Facebook is apologizing to drag queens and the transgender community for deleting accounts that used drag names like Lil Miss Hot Mess rather than legal names such as Bob Smith. The world's biggest online social network caught heat recently when it deleted several hundred accounts belonging to self-described drag queens, other performers and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Facebook has long required its users to go by their 'real names' on the site for security purposes, to stand out from other social networks and so it can better target advertising to people. Drag queens (from left) Lil Ms Hot Mess, Sister Roma and Heklina spoke of their disappointment earlier this month after Facebook executives met with them and refused to change the policy banning stage names. Facebook apologized - altough the real names policy isn't changing, the way Facebook enforces it might . Now, the company says the spirit of its policy doesn't mean a person's legal name but 'the authentic name they use in real life.' Though the real names policy isn't changing, the way Facebook enforces it might. Last month, the company suggested that performers such as drag queens have other ways of maintaining their stage identities on the site, such as creating pages that are meant for businesses and public figures. Identity: The performers told a conference at San Francisco city hall the ban 'wipes them out of existence' Heklina (left) said: 'I have been Heklina for 20 years, and I have Facebook telling me Heklina does not exist. So they're basically wiping you out of existence' Anger: Sister Roma and Heklina are two of hundreds whose had profiles have been blocked by the social network . But a fan page is not the same as a regular Facebook account and users were not happy with the suggestion. And a group of transvestites in San Francisco claimed it was their human right to identify as their alter-egos. Supervisor David Campos, who is representing the drag queens, told a news conference: 'If we're going to work together on this, we want acknowledgement that this policy is misguided.' He was flanked by the movement's instigator, Sister Roma, and fellow cross dressers Heklina, Bebe Sweetbriar, and Lil Miss Hot Mess. Heklina said: 'I have been Heklina for 20 years, and I have Facebook telling me Heklina does not exist. So they're basically wiping you out of existence.' Facebook has long required its users to go by their 'real names' on the site for security purposes, to stand out from other social networks and so it can better target advertising to people . Jinkx Monsoon, star of RuPaul's Drag Race, condemned the policy as a distraction from other more important issues in the community, telling MailOnline: 'Can Facebook just get this figured out quickly please? Aliases have existed for ages, it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone! 'While we squabble over this, we're wasting time we could be spending on more important issues affecting our community.' Christopher Cox, Facebook's chief production officer, explained that part of the issue was that a user had flagged the accounts as fake. He said in a blog post: 'The stories of mass impersonation, trolling, domestic abuse and higher rates of bullying and intolerance are oftentimes the result of people hiding behind fake names, and it's both terrifying and sad. 'Our ability to successfully protect against them with this policy has borne out the reality that this policy, on balance and when applied carefully, is a very powerful force for good.' Cox accepted that many people had endured a 'painful' experience and said they will be able to use their stage names on Facebook. He continued: 'I want to apologise to the affected community of drag queens, drag kings, transgender, and extensive community of our friends, neighbours, and members of the LGBT community for the hardship that we've put you through in dealing with your Facebook accounts over the past few weeks. 'The spirit of our policy is that everyone on Facebook uses the authentic name they use in real life. For Sister Roma, that's Sister Roma. For Lil Miss Hot Mess, that's Lil Miss Hot Mess.' He said the issue had shown up the fact that 'there's lots of room for improvement in the reporting and enforcement mechanisms, tools for understanding who's real and who's not'.","Facebook recently deleted several hundred accounts belonging to self-described drag queens and members of the LGBT community .

"Amid a flurry of lawsuits over Facebook's initial public offering, the company’s top underwriter says it's prepared to pay back investors who were burned when they bought shares. Morgan Stanley announced in a memo on Wednesday that it is reviewing Facebook trades and would adjust prices for some retail customers who overpaid. The IPO mishaps have sparked numerous lawsuits against Morgan Stanley, the Nasdaq stock exchange and Facebook itself by shareholders who claimed they hid the social networking company's weakened growth forecasts just before it went public, . The allegations raised questions about whether top investors profited at the expense of smaller buyers. Zucked: Mark Zuckerberg saved $174 million by cashing out tens of millions of shares of Facebook stock early Friday when the price was above $38 a share . Meanwhile, Facebook is in talks with the New York Stock Exchange to move its stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market after the botched IPO on Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Facebook's much-anticipated IPO was delayed by a half-hour on Friday because of technical glitches on the Nasdaq. After pricing at $38, Facebook's stock closed up 23 cents on Friday and has been down since. On Wednesday, it closed up $1, at $32, still down nearly 16 per cent from the IPO price. Decline: One prominent plaintiffs lawyer said what happened with Facebook was reminiscent of the dot-com bubble . NYSE declined to comment. A Nasdaq spokesman did not immediately return a call for comment. The news comes as even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg dumped his own shares in the company, making $1.13billion as the stock nosedived, according to company filings. On Wednesday, shareholders filed a lawsuit against Facebook and the banks behind the company's stock, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Additionally, both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have begun looking into the matter. The U.S. Senate Banking Committee has also launched an inquiry and the state of Massachusetts has subpenaed Morgan Stanley, demanding answers. The House Financial Services Committee said that it was also gathering information for their own review. Facebook stock rose 3.3 percent in trading on Wednesday, rising to $32 a share. However, a new analysis said the stock could fall to as low as $9.59. That's a far cry from the $37.58 that Zuckerberg fetched for 30.2 million shares he unloaded on Friday. By the end of trading on Tuesday however the price had dropped to $31 meaning Zuckerberg saved himself a cool $174 million by getting out early. The 28-year-old still holds a vast amount of Facebook stock but his decision to sell off so much will leave investors wondering about his confidence in the company. The drop is based around the realization that Facebook might not be growing as quickly as initially thought. And the company's second-quarter growth will likely fall short of expectations as fewer new users join the social networking giant. Faceplant: Nasdaq may lose the Facebook listing entirely after having just obtained it . Shareholders filed a lawsuit on Wednesday, alleging that Zuckerberg, Facebook and the banks that backed the Initial Public Offering, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, knew this information, but weren't forthcoming with it. On Tuesday, Reuters revealed that the banks' analysts downgraded their estimates about the future earnings of the company while they were rolling out the IPO. Business Insider called the move 'unprecedented.' Furthermore, the website reported that the banks revealed to privileged major investors that the share price was likely to tank, but left smaller stock buyers in the dark about this information. The Securities and Exchange commission is investigating these allegations and the state of Massachusetts has filed a subpoena demanding Morgan Stanley release information about the IPO. Zuckerberg’s plans to sell were revealed in documents filed in advance of the IPO on Friday, but the problems that have happened since cast them in a new light. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel also announced his plans early too but his return was beyond anything he could have hoped for. He wrote Zuckerberg a cheque for $500,000 in 2004 but has offloaded 16.8 million shares for the tidy profit of $633 million. Among the others to cash out was Mark Pincus, the chief executive of online gaming company Zynga. Big returns: Peter Thiel (left), the co-founder of PayPal, earned $633 million for an initial investment of $500,000. Zynga CEO Mark Pincus gave Zuckerberg a check for $40,000 in 2004 and cashed in $38 million in stock . Eight years ago he gave Facebook a cheque for $40,000 but now has sold $38 million worth of stock. Venture capitalists Accel Partners, which handed over $12.7million back in 2005, sold $1.9billion of stock but retained $5.8billion. Whilst the big players were making a fortune however, small investors have seen their attempts to get in on the Facebook bubble fall flat. As of close of trading on Tuesday shares were a staggering 18 per cent below what they had been at the opening on Friday. At one point they had slumped 31 per cent from the $45 peak hit shortly after they started trading. But according to analysts StarMine this could not be the end of it and the slide could carry on until stocks are just $9.59 each. It has examined estimates from Wall Street experts and concluded that Facebook is currently vastly overpriced, though its forecasts do tend to be gloomier than others. Eddy Elfenbein, editor at finance website Crossing Wall Street, said: ‘Facebook right now is going for far more than what it's worth, it's like buying $1 for $1.98, it just doesn't make sense at this price. ‘Just from basic modelling the stock should be around $17 to $20, and that is with a lot of variables. Cleaning up: Facebook's IPO has caused a mess that is being investigated by two congressional panels . ‘I would call that an ideal price. I would be interested in buying and I think that is a good deal for investors.’ Among those who did not cash out on Friday when Facebook shares were trading at $38 each was the company’s former president Sean Parker. His stock is still worth over $2billion but the price slump meant his fortune decreased by a staggering $300million. In a sign of how feeling is changing against Facebook, some commentators have begun comparing its activities to the most reckless behaviour of Wall Street banks. They have also coined the word ‘Zucked’, which means to get shafted on the sale of Facebook shares. In a withering article in Time magazine Sam Gustin wrote: ‘Facebook’s highly-vaunted IPO -- which was supposed to be a shining moment for the social network, as well as its lead banker Morgan Stanley and the Nasdaq exchange - has morphed into a debacle that’s reinforced some of the worst stereotypes about Wall Street: that corporate executives and their bankers engineer IPOs to maximize profits at the public’s expense; that Wall Street’s own systems have become too complex for its personnel to handle; and that the entire game is a hype-fueled casino, rigged for the house with a sucker played by the average investor.’ Hyped: The Facebook IPO was one of the most widely-anticipated stock offers in recent history . These major sell-offs comes as new allegations are emerging the the over-hyped Facebook stock sale may have been rigged against small, every-day buyers. Two separates lawsuits have been filed against the company and the banks that organized the IPO, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, alleging the executives knew second-quarter revenue would not meet expectations as Facebook's growth slows. Business Insider says this information was shared with the banks by a Facebook insider. As Zuckerberg went on his pre-IPO roadshow, touting his company, the banks downgraded their revenue projections for Facebook. This information could have reduced the value of Facebook's initial stock offering. In turn, this could have decreased the amount of money Zuckerberg and his early investors made when they dumped tens of millions of Facebook shares on Friday as trading opened. However, the banks failed to widely disclose the downgrade, the lawsuits say. Business Insider says they told only large, institutional investors so they would know to stay away from Facebook stock on the first day of trading. Facebook denies the allegations in the lawsuit and said it will 'vigorously defense itself.' Morgan Stanley says it followed the same procedure it would for any IPO. Here is a list of the early investors in Facebook who made a bundle by cashing in portions of their stock Friday before share prices tumbled. Value is estimated at $38 a share.

"Holiday nightmare: Paul and Xanta Watts, pictured on their wedding day, are suing after the bride fell ill on their honeymoon . A newly married couple are suing a four-star hotel after the bride fell violently ill and was hospitalised after contracting a serious infection while on their dream honeymoon in Asia. Paul, 36, and Xanta Watts, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, spent £10,000 on a three-week tour of Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand - where the bride started to feel unwell. While staying at the four-star Paradise Koh Yao Resort Boutique Beach Resort & Spa on Koh Yao Noi Island near Phuket, Xanta, 29, suffered diarrhoea, vomiting and severe stomach cramps. She fell . violently ill and was hospitalised for seven days after contracting . Paratyphoid - a disease caused by the salmonella bacteria - diagnosed . when she returned to the UK. The . couple claim they saw worm-like creatures in the swimming pools and . fresh food being piled on top of old dishes at the luxury resort. The disease is commonly caused by eating contaminated food and water. The Watts are now taking legal action against the resort and tour operator Kuoni after their ‘honeymoon from hell’. Care worker Xanta, said: ‘We were devastated that our so called luxury holiday was completely ruined. Newlyweds: Paul and Xanta Watts claim their £10,000 honeymoon ended in disaster after the bride contracted a serious infection . ‘I couldn't believe that my dreams of a perfect start to my married life had been shattered by the illness we suffered. ‘I was still so ill when I got home that I was hospitalised and had to have a month off work. ‘We, our families and friends spent so long planning our perfect wedding and honeymoon. ‘It therefore seems so unfair to think that our honeymoon is something we'd rather forget. ‘Although we cannot turn back time and nothing can make up for what we suffered, we want answers over what caused our illness. 'Honeymoon from hell': The couple, pictured on their trip around Asia, claim their £10,000 holiday was ruined . 'Holiday from hell': Xanta, pictured left, claims she was unwell for a month after falling ill on honeymoon . ‘We experienced some horrible sights at the resort, such as seeing wormlike creatures in the pool on occasions during our stay, the food was undercooked on occasions, flies were often seen hovering around the fresh food, utensils were often being used for a number of dishes in the restaurant and fresh food was often piled on top of existing food rather than the trays being replaced.’ Amandeep . Dhillon, from law firm Irwin Mitchell, who is representing the couple, . said: ‘Paul and Xanta feel that the standards which they experienced at . this hotel, completely destroyed what was meant to be one of the most . special and cherished experiences of their lives. ‘To spend part of your holiday, never mind your honeymoon, suffering such gastric symptoms is clearly disastrous. Answers: The couple, pictured on their honeymoon, say they want to know what caused illness . ‘We are currently carrying out investigations into the standards at the hotel following the reports from our clients. ‘Paratyphoid is a type of salmonella. It is not an infection to be taken lightly and we are keen to determine its source.' A spokesman for Kuoni said: 'We take any claims surrounding the health and well-being of our customers very seriously indeed and we are currently investigating this case.'

"He had only just moved back in with his fiancée in a bid to rekindle their relationship. But now, boxing legend Ricky Hatton has reportedly moved out of his £3million family home for a second time. The former two-weight world champion allegedly had a bust-up with Jennifer Dooley during a holiday in Tenerife with their children, Millie, two, and ten-month-old Fearne. Scroll down for video . Bust-up: Ricky Hatton allegedly had a bust-up with his fiancée Jennifer Dooley during a holiday in Tenerife . He had flown to Lanzarote to watch a boxing fight, but 'went off the radar' after going out for a drink, a source told Richard Moriarty of The Sun. He eventually showed up at the family mansion in Hyde, Greater Manchester, two days later, where he was greeted by his 'furious' fiancée. 'Jennifer stood at the airport desperately ringing his mobile,' said the unnnamed source. 'She was humiliated and furious.' Last month, Hatton, 35, who received an MBE in 2010, returned to the family home after moving out last December following a row with Miss Dooley. Home: Hatton reportedly flew to Lanzarote to watch a boxing fight, but 'went off the radar' after having a drink. He has now moved out of his £3million family home (pictured) in Hyde, Greater Manchester, for a second time . Former world champion: The 35-year-old is pictured in the ring in 2009 (left) and drinking in Manchester (right) In January, he spoke about his desire to save his engagement, telling the Manchester Evening News: 'Me and Jennifer are working through our difficulties. 'We are no different to anybody else except my life is under the spotlight because of who I am.' After moving out for a second time, Hatton is reportedly now living in a £150,000 semi-detached house in Hyde.

"Confronting and hurtful comments faced every day by people with a disability are at the centre of a new campaign to raise awareness about disabilities. People living with a disability and their families, friends and carers are being asked to share the worst thing they've heard people say about someone who is disabled. The results, which are being shared on social media with the hashtag #heardwhilstdisabled as part of the Chatterbox Challenge charity, are confronting and at times stupid. Scroll down for video . People living with a disability and those around them, like carer Ana Maria Martinez, have shared the worst things they've heard about someone who is disabled for a charity campaign . Australian Paralympic swimmer Karni Liddell is encouraging the campaign and says dealing with hurtful, disrespectful and insulting comments was one of the greatest challenges faced by those with a disability. 'I've had some doozies over the years,' Liddell, who has spent 20 years in a wheelchair, told Daily Mail Australia. 'Overseas you get a lot about (a disability) being karma. Places like Buddhist or Hindu countries believe people with disabilities have done something bad in a past life. They say it's a curse, and it's quite confronting. The results, including that of carerJennifer Skerry, are being shared on social media with the hashtag #heardwhilstdisabled as part of the Chatterbox Challenge charity . David Smith says he has been asked if he can walk, despite being confined to a wheelchair . Helen Keogh overheard someone being asked if they sleep in their wheelchair . 'Random people here in Australia also feel really comfortable asking me if I can have kids. I'm 35, it's a sensitive topic. Most women my age wouldn't appreciate it.' Liddell, who has a degenerative muscle wasting disease, said she also gets regularly asked whether her disease is genetic and if she can die from it. 'There's a 50 percent chance I'm going to say yes and then the people end up feeling like s***,' she said. 'People also say 'it must be really hard for you to find a partner', but how do they know that's the reason I'm single? It's just amazing how people feel comfortable saying that to your face. Australian Paralympic swimmer Karni Liddell is encouraging the campaign and says dealing with insensitive comments is one of the greatest challenges faced by people with a disability . Comments like 'They say I'm stupid' overhead by people like Liam Smith are often confronting and hurtful . Others who are participating in the campaign, including Michelle Simonds, say they're often treated differently to able-bodied people . Leslie Sherry says he is treated differently because he is in a wheelchair and claims to have had a bad experience with authorities . 'I was born with my disability, so there wasn't really any trauma behind it. But some people had really traumatic experiences and people constantly ask them about it.' Others who have shared their stories in the #heardwhilstdisabled campaign have been asked if they can walk despite being in a wheelchair and if their disability is curable. Comments like 'Why do they let them live?', 'Look at those spasos' and 'Do you sleep in your wheelchair?' have also been shared. #heardwhilstdisabled is just one of the initiatives of the 2014 Chatterbox Challenge. Joshua Bradshaw shared his experience with the campaign . 'Is he fixable?' was overheard by Bradley Cresswell and raises questions about what is socially acceptable to ask someone with a disability . Special education teacher Tracey Newton was once asked if she was a vegetable keeper in reference to people with a disability . Judi Shields, pictured here with her brother, says she has constantly been told her parents must have sinned because her brother is in a wheelchair . 'What people don't realise it that I don't wheel around all day wishing I could walk. That doesn't even enter my head until someone asks about it or brings it up,' Liddell said. 'For people that use a wheelchair to get around it feels as natural and normal for us as it is to walk. 'But people still say 'you're really good at manoeuvring that, you must have been doing that for a long time'. 'I do understand people are just curious. But I know I can't just go up to random people on the street and ask about their relationship or family life. It's the same for people with a disability. There a limit and many just don't understand that.' Carer Bianca Fourie says she overheard a person asking how someone could put up with a particular disabled woman . Corrine Poynterhas has overheard people asking if disabilities can be passed on to her children . Terry Donaldson, who is in a wheelchair, says his dentist assumed he must have Down's Syndrome because he couldn't walk . Christine Schvlze, Kylie Greenwood and Kim Duffen put in a combined effort when they shared their overheard post on social media . Liddell said it was important for people to realise those with a disability are the same as others and shouldn't be treated different when it came to conversations. 'Just because we have a disability doesn't mean we don't have the exact same issues, likes and dislikes as an able-bodied person,' she said. 'I'd really love to live in a society where disability is not the worst thing that could happen to someone. We can't control it, we've been dealt this card.' #heardwhilstdisabled is just one of the initiatives of the 2014 Chatterbox Challenge.

"A sky-diving pensioner who refused to get out of the plane was left hanging precariously from her instructor as a tandem dive went dangerously wrong. The 80-year-old desperately tried to cling onto the door after apparently deciding she no longer wanted to do the jump. As her harness came loose the woman, named Laverne, was left dangling from her instructor as she hurtled towards the ground at 125mph. Scroll down for video . 'Stop': The woman, 80, appears to yell 'no' as she tries to avoid jumping out of the plane in California . Skydiving goes wrong: The woman's back is exposed as she clings to her instructor after her harness slipped. The tandem diver grasps her tightly as they plummet towards the ground at 125mph . Tumble: With the woman dangling from the skydiver they plummet towards the ground in California . In the dramatic video, the woman's tandem diver can be seen clinging onto her safety harness which had slipped down her legs during the jump in California. As they plummet towards the ground, the woman's top flies up exposing her back to the high-speed winds. The cameraman - a separate jumper filming the whole experience - comes over to help as the pair get into difficulties. Just before the jump happened, the woman appears to yell 'no!' - telling her instructor to stop her getting out of the aircraft. It was her first skydive, which she had been planning for a decade, she says on the video which was published on TheChive.com. Tony Butler, technical officer at the British Parachute Association, said the pensioner could easily have slipped out of the harness. High spirits: Laverne, 80, the tandem skydiver, said it was her first ever jump as she is filmed before take-off. She said she had been planning the leap for a decade . Smiling: Laverne looks at the camera as the plane makes it ascent in preparation for the jump . 'She was very close to slipping out,' he said. 'You can see from the video the instructor was trying to get to the harness and cling on to it. The person with the video camera was also trying to help. 'It looks that she is a pretty frail and light woman which would have helped.' 'At the start of the clip she is reluctant to jump and they were in a bad position with her holding onto the door frame as they left the plane. 'Things like this have happened in the United States before and there have been two fatalities. Struggle: After making the ascent, the woman apparently decided she did not want to make the jump which she had been planning for the last decade . Jump: With the woman appearing to resist, she plunges out of the plane. A British Parachute expert said the problems started because they were in the wrong position when they left the aircraft . 'There has never been a similar incident in Britain, and safety checks here are a lot more rigorous.' He added that the light-aircraft would have been travelling at around 70mph as the divers exited the aircraft. He said that in Britain, if a skydiver wants to pull out at the last minute the plane should return them to the ground and they should not be made to leap out. At the end of the video the woman can be seen on the ground apparently uninjured but is seen being given some careful attention. Even the instructor is traumatised and has to be consoled by a colleague. Parachute jump: The woman, 80, and her tandem diver leap from the plane over California.

"Samir Nasri has warned that the future of Manchester City’s stars and their manager Manuel Pellegrini are at stake in Tuesday’s crucial Champions League clash with Bayern Munich. City will almost certainly go out of the competition if they lose to the Group E winners at the Etihad after picking up just two points from their first four games. And Nasri fears the Premier League champions will stage a ruthless clearout next summer if the current squad cannot justify Sheik Mansour’s huge investment by joining Europe’s elite in the knockout stage. Samir Nasri (right), in training on Monday, has warned his team-mates they are playing for their futures . City captain Vincent Kompany has his head in his hands after defeat to CSKA Moscow earlier this month . Nasri and his City colleagues were all smiles in training as they prepared to take on Bayern Munich . ‘Let’s be honest, we need to do something or otherwise next year it’s going to be new players, it’s going to be everything,’ said the Frenchman. ‘That’s how it works when you play for a big club. With the salary of every player and the level of those players, 90 per cent of the team is world class. ‘Then not to qualify from the first round of the Champions League would be a huge blow for the club — and for us as well. With the players we have and everything, the owner gives us his trust, we have to return it in the Champions League. It’s the perfect scene to show we can compete with the best team in the world. The Premier League champions have struggled again in the Champions League this season . Manuel Pellegrini's Manchester City side have not won a Champions League match this season . ‘We have a chance to play for a big club and we are treated the right way. Sometimes it’s not good to talk too much, it’s better to talk with your feet. We have leaders in the squad and the manager talks a lot as well. So stop talking. ‘In the last three years I have been here we have won the Premier League twice and been runners-up, but now we have to improve in the Champions League if we want to be a top club. It’s not enough to be top in your league if you don’t do anything in the Champions League. ‘We need to show that we are smart players and to use what happened in the last couple of years to improve. We still have a chance and we need to take it. Now is the moment.’ Champions League Group E as it stands going into matchday five, with City in danger of crashing out . Yaya Toure proved Manchester City's match winner as they defeated Swansea 2-1 on Saturday . Bayern welcomed back Bastian Schweinsteiger at the weekend after four months out injured . The Bayern Munich squad was in a relaxed mood in training, having already qualified for the knockout stages . Bayern manager Pep Guardiola, instructing his squad in training, takes his side to the Etihad on Tuesday . Pellegrini was hired to take City forward in Europe and guided the club to the knockout stage for the first time last season, but they are bottom of Group E and face an uphill battle to beat CSKA Moscow and Roma to second place. Only two teams in Champions League history — FC Porto and Lokomotiv Moscow — have qualified after taking two points or less from the opening four games, and Nasri believes City are lucky to still have a chance of going through. ‘For the moment we haven’t performed in the Champions League and that is a reality,’ he added. ‘We need to take it (their chance) now because we are not going to have any favours from anyone else anymore.’ The Bayern Munich squad share a joke in training ahead of facing Manchester City on Tuesday .

'I soon realised that the only thing always around was me so I began taking pictures of myself every day doing or wearing strange things.' Mr Reed began the project in 2010 and often spent up to five hours getting ready for the photo. In the two years of the project he has amassed a room full of fancy dress clothes, make-up, wigs and props. He said: 'I collect bits and pieces from car boot sales and eBay. Sometimes it can take hours to do a photo and once it took a whole day when I buried myself in compost in the living room.'

"The suspected ringleader and seven members of a gang behind a £1.3million cyber raid on a leading bank were arrested yesterday. Scotland Yard detectives say the 47-year-old Mr Big led the operation that siphoned off cash from the accounts of Barclays customers. One of the gang posed as an IT engineer at the bank’s branch in Swiss Cottage, north London, to install a device that hacked into its computer systems. Scroll down for video . Cyber-attack:  Scotland Yard said today it had held eight men who they believed hacked a branch in Swiss Cottage, north London (pictured) to get £1.3m . Hacking: The Met Police has said a device similar to this was used by criminals, which when plugged into a computer transmits screen contents to a remote PC . But staff spotted the fraud and . tipped off police. Following a lengthy surveillance operation, the trail . led to a flat in nearby Marylebone, which was crammed with hi-tech . equipment. Eight men, including Chinese and . Romanians, were in custody last night. Thousands of credit cards and . financial records were seized at addresses across the capital. Santander raid: How the Mail reported it on September 14 . The gang is thought to be linked to . the criminals behind last week’s raid on a London branch of Santander . using an identical spying device.Detective Superintendent Terry Wilson, . who is a specialist in electronic crime, said: ‘This was a . highly-organised criminal network with each individual filling a . specific role. ‘All criminal networks have a head . and we very much believe we have now apprehended our Mr Big as part of . this operation. We believe this has put a major dent in this network’s . ability to commit cyber-crime in this country. We believe this was a . top-tier criminal network.’ Similarities: Last week a gang allegedly attempted to plug a discreet gizmo into a Santander computer to spy on its contents. He said his officers were working with banks to stop further thefts. Barclays has been able to recover a . ‘significant amount’ of the money stolen in the Swiss Cottage operation . by tracing the accounts into which the cash was moved. A . 'big mixture of nerdiness and having some nerves' would be needed to . try to pull off this type of fraud, according to internet security . expert Graham Cluley. Since . part of the crime involves walking into a branch and attaching the . gadget to a computer, this would need 'a bit of bottle on the part of . the criminal but you would have to be technical on the other end to be . able to get the information'. Valuable data such as access to keyboard strokes and what is happening on-screen could be obtained, according to Mr Cluley. A . KVM would be about 8ins by 6ins by 3ins in size and would probably look . like 'another anonymous box with loads of wires', he noted. He . said: 'They (would-be criminals) would need physical access to your . computer and the best way to do that is to be part of the cleaning staff . or part of the IT team and to just work in the office and plug the . thing in. 'With human nature being what it is, people do not often confront people they see as new in these roles in their office. 'Organisations . need to have proper physical security in place and foster an attitude . so staff can challenge people and say 'Where is your pass?'. 'It is not just money that could be stolen, but also data.' But customers are angry they were not told about the breach, which took place in April. Speaking outside the branch, Joseph . Mendy, 52, said: ‘I thought this would be something we would’ve been . informed about. I am shocked to hear about it.’ Alex Grant, of Barclays, insisted the protection and security of its customers was its highest priority. ‘We identified the fraud and acted swiftly to recover funds on the same day,’ he added.Graham Cluley, a technology expert, says cyber criminals are combining ‘nerdiness with nerves’ to carry out the thefts. ‘It takes a certain degree of bravery . to walk into a bank and do this posing as an IT technician,’ he said. ‘While these people no longer carry the physical threat of the bank . robbers of the 70s armed with a gun and a stocking over their head, they . are putting themselves at risk. It raises questions about whether . Barclays had enough security in place to spot the unusual movement of . money, as well as the physical security of its branches.’ The hackers planted spying hardware . known as a ‘kvm switch’, standing for keyboard, video and mouse. Purchased online for less than £100, this allows a single user to . control several computers from a remote location. Four men, from Hounslow, west London, have appeared in court charged with conspiracy to steal in the Santander raid.

"Brown Ideye’s proposed move to Qatar club Al Gharafa has taken an intriguing twist with West Bromwich Albion now willing to lower their demands for the striker from £6million to an initial €5million – around £3.8million. Negotiations are ongoing and they suggest frantic work is taking place to recoup cash for a fresh face at centre-forward. A short-term package of greater expense than chairman Jeremy Peace would usually countenance could be put together for the right player – given the huge financial reward of staying in the Premier League. West Brom record signing Brown Ideye (left) has been made available for an initial £3.8million . Tony Pulis is looking at West Ham's Carlton Cole (left) and Liverpool's Rickie Lambert as replacements . Albion paid a club record £10m for Ideye from Dinamo Kiev but were discussing a transfer with Qatari club, Al Gharafa, on Sunday night. Manager Tony Pulis made enquiries for West Ham striker Carlton Cole as he laid the groundwork for Ideye's departure. West Ham, however, are reluctant to let Cole go without having a replacement. Andy Carroll also picked up an injury in Saturday's defeat to Liverpool. Rickie Lambert of Liverpool remains an alternative option for Albion.

"Gordon Brown wanted 30 would-be Labour MPs to stand down at the last election, in the hope of cutting a deal with the Liberal Democrats. The embattled prime minister suggested to aides they make way for Nick Clegg’s party in marginal seats to stop the Tories getting in, a new book claims. But the plan was rejected by his inner circle, who said the Lib Dems would not agree to an alliance. The scheme is detailed in ‘Five Days in May’ by former Labour minister Lord Adonis. Deal: The prime minister Gordon Brown wanted 30 would-be Labour MPs to stand down to make way for Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrat representatives . It tells of the inner turmoil of the Labour Party in the run-up to the creation of the Coalition. It says that on Friday May 7, the day after polling day, a ‘crestfallen’ Mr Brown learned of the Tory gains as he jetted in to Stansted airport from his constituency. Lord Adonis wrote: ‘When mobiles were switched on as the plane taxied to a stand…the bad news was uppermost. ‘A Tory swathe was being cut through the East and West Midlands and southern England. A succession of Lib Dems were also falling to the Tories. It looked to be slipping away after all. ‘GB himself looked crestfallen – ‘the only time I remember him like this in the whole election’, said one aide. ‘Our problem is that the Liberals are just too weak against the Tories’, Gordon said to me on the phone as his convoy left Stansted. Silence: It became clear Gordon Brown's plan may have fallen though when Danny Alexander refused to return calls to himself and Peter Mandelson, Lord Adonis writes . ‘I always knew this would be our big problem which is why I wanted to do that deal with them’, he added. He was referring to his pre-election idea of standing Labour candidates down in 30 Lib-Dem-Conservative marginal, a suggestion rebuffed strongly by his campaign team.’ Lord Adonis said his boss was keen to make a swift overture to Nick Clegg to form a pact which would have given the two parties 315 seats - short of an overall majority of 326 but with the support of smaller parties on crucial votes. Mr Brown told his team: ‘We’ve got to get . this going with the Liberals – there’ s got to be movement today and . something settled over the weekend or Cameron will simply take . possession.’ Unveiling: Lord Adonis reveals Gordon Brown's coalition plans in his new book . But the Lib Dems were not forthcoming. Lord Adonis, who wanted to make a deal, wrote of an ‘ominous silence’ on the first day. ‘Danny Alexander hadn’t got back to Peter or me with any suggested first step, and he wasn’t returning calls’, he said. He revealed Mr Mr Brown agonised more about the location his first public statement after the election defeat than its content. While he wanted to speak from Number 10 as Prime Minister, there were suggestions the address should be made from Victoria Street as leader of the Labour party. In the end, following the advice of Alistair Darling who said ‘you’re not fleeing to no man’s land’, he did it from outside Downing Street on a lectern as a ‘compromise.’ The former minister claims Mr Brown’s first 20 minute phone call with Nick Clegg, who he ‘barely knew’ outside formal exchanges in the Commons, was ‘civil and workmanlike’. Although he said Mr Brown congratulated him Nick Clegg on his elections results ‘rather like an uncle congratulating a nephew on good exam results’ in the word of one Number 10 aide. But without their knowledge, a senior Liberal Democrat, he believed to be Paddy Ashdown, leaked a story to the BBC that the talk had been ‘terrible.’ Talks then foundered over when Gordon Brown would be willing to stand down, as the Lib Dems insisted there needed to be a change of leadership by the end of the year. During negotiations between the Lib Dems and Labour on the Saturday afternoon, when Danny Alexander asked if there were any issues to raise, shamed former minister Chris Huhne said: ‘Yes, Gordon Brown and your leadership. This is the biggest issue for us.’ Lib Dem minister David Law’s book ‘22 Days in May: The Birth of the Lib Dem-Conservative Coalition’ was the first account of the talks, published six months after the election. He revealed the Lib Dems never wanted a deal with Mr Brown who infuriated Mr Clegg during his phone calls, and Danny Alexander called him ‘absolutely barmy.’ Calls to Gordon Brown’s office were not returned last night.","Gordon Brown wanted his own MPs to step aside to make way for Lib Dems .

"Britain's most unloved dog who was nicknamed 'Boomerang' after he was returned to a rescue centre three times by potential new owners has finally found a home. Six-year-old Flynn had lived at the shelter since he was found wandering the streets in April 2010. It took just two months for the brown Staffordshire bull terrier cross to find his first home in June that year. Six-year-old Flynn was nicknamed Boomerang by the staff at Worcestershire Animal Rescue Centre in Malvern because potential owners kept returning him . But, barely a week later, he was returned after his new owners decided that they did not have time to look after a dog. Flynn left the home again in 2011 but was returned when his second set of owners separated and last year he was brought back after a third owner developed terminal cancer. This led to desperate staff nicknaming Flynn 'Boomerang' because he always came back to the Worcestershire Animal Rescue Centre in Malvern. Lovable: Flynn is always smiling and wagging his tail. He is really good around children and as long as he has a comfy bed and a football he will be very happy . Finally last Thursday a new family arrived at the centre and took Flynn home. Speaking yesterday Jackie Turner, the animal welfare coordinator at the shelter, said: 'Flynn is such a lovely, loving dog. 'It was really sad that we weren't able to find a forever home to settle in through no fault of his own. 'We wanted to find him a family to live with because he is such a loving dog. 'When people come to look at the dogs he sat in the window with his ears flapping away. 'We are all wondering why he hasn't gone because he is so adorable and such a loving boy - he doesn't bark and jump up. 'All the staff fell in love with Flynn, he is always smiling and wagging his tail so I can't understand why he hasn't found a home. 'He's just so affectionate, he craves fuss and cuddles and will be a lovely edition to the new family. 'He was so excited when he went home with them, you could see he looked so happy and the family seemed lovely. 'They had seen his picture on our website and said they just fell in love straight away. 'Fingers crossed now we won't see him back here again. 'He loves to play with a ball and can often be found with a tennis ball in his mouth. 'He is really good around children and as long as he has a comfy bed and a football he will be very happy.'","Six-year-old Flynn had lived at the Malvern, Worcs shelter since  April 2010 .

"A mother says she will never dye her hair again after she suffered a horrific allergic reaction to her hair dye. The reaction was so severe that the mother-of-one had to be prescribed steroids and it took eight weeks for her skin to heal. Lyn Gregory, 56, from Poole, in Dorset, claims she suffered the reaction to Schwarzkopf Live Colour despite having completed a skin test 48 hours earlier. Lyn Gregory (pictured before the allergic reaction) has vowed never to use hair dye again after claiming she had a severe reaction to Schwarzkopf Live Colour which left her with agonising blisters . Ms Gregory said: ‘I’ve been dying my hair for as long as I can remember. My hair is very white now so I just dye the underneath. ‘I’ve even used this brand of dye before and not had a reaction, and I always do a patch test first. It left me in agony. I had to cut my hair to stop it brushing on my neck and irritating it. ‘I will never dye my hair again.’ Ms Gregory claims she was prescribed steroids by her GP for blistering skin reaction she suffered. She was forced to take time off from her job as housing officer for the local authority as the reaction worsened. She said: ‘I did the test on Friday ready to dye my hair on Sunday. I was using blue dye. The reaction was so severe that the mother-of-one had to be prescribed steroids and it took eight weeks for her skin to heal . ‘When I used the dye it felt a bit itchy, but nothing bad. On Monday it was a bit worse, then on Tuesday it went mad. ‘I went to the doctors who prescribed antibiotics and a cream, but it got worse before it got better and I had to have steroids. ‘The skin blistered all along my neck line. It was agony - I couldn’t even go to work or sleep. Ms Gregory said: 'The skin blistered all along my neck line. It was agony - I couldn't even go to work or sleep' ‘I only left the house to go to the doctors or the supermarket. Everyone would stare at me like I was a freak. ‘It made me feel awful in myself as well. Everyone was very worried about me.’ Ms Gregory says she did not suffer any sign of a reaction from the test or previously when she used the same brand of dye. Ms Gregory says that she did a skin test and that it showed no sign of a reaction. She says that she had also used the brand before without any problems . Ms Gregory has now recovered but she is hoping to be awarded compensation by Schwarzkopf . She is now looking to claim compensation from Schwarzkopf. Nicky Hastings, a representative from Schwarzkopf, said: ‘We are sorry to hear about Ms Gregory’s reaction and hope that she has now fully recovered. ‘We were advised of Ms Gregory’s reaction by her solicitor.

"They went on to become the biggest band of all time, selling millions of records and earning millions of pounds, but a house that is going up for auction in Liverpool shows the humble beginnings of The Beatles. It was the childhood home of George Harrison - where he first met Paul McCartney and John Lennon - and has a guide price of just £100,000. Harrison moved into 25 Upton Green in Speke, Liverpool, when he was six, and lived in the three-bedroom council house for the next 12 years. The childhood home of George Harrison in Liverpool is going to auction with a guide price of just £100,000 . A young George Harrison, who lived in the house for 12 years from the age of six . The house's guide price is £80,000 less than the average house price in England and Wales . It was at a nearby bus stop that he met and became friends with a young McCartney. McCartney introduced him to his friend John Lennon, and invited him to join Lennon's band, The Quarrymen. They would regularly rehearse at 25 Upton Green and it was from the doorstep that a famous photo was taken of Harrison, then 15, heading off to a Quarrymen gig holding his guitar. A portrait of an older Harrison while in The Beatles . But it wasn't long before they had outgrown the small, terraced house. They went on to form The Beatles, becoming the best known and most successful musicians in the world. The family home, which also has a back garden, has a guide price £80,000 less than the average price of a home in England and Wales. But Beatlemania could cause the price to skyrocket, as fans of the band look to get their hands on the home. Last year, John Lennon's first home, 9 Newcastle Road, was sold for £480,000, despite having a guide price of just £150,000. The house was sold by Countrywide Property Auctions, who will also sell the Harrison house at the Cavern Club in Liverpool on October 20. The auction house described the sale of a piece of 'Liverpool's musical heritage' as a 'momentous occasion'. It said: 'Countrywide Property Auctions are delighted and honoured to once again be invited to offer at auction, another piece of Beatles history.' George Harrison's childhood home is not the only Beatles property for sale at the moment - but it is the most affordable. A posh London flat which was lived in by both Harrison and Ringo Starr in the 1960s is on the market for £2.5million. And John Lennon's old six-bedroom home in Weybridge, Surrey, is available for £13.75 million. The three-bedroom, mid-terrace house has recently been refurbished, so is in good condition . Though the guide price is low, it could actually sell for much more because of fans creating a bidding war . Harrison was The Beatles' lead guitarist, and also composed many of their songs, including 'Here Comes the Sun' and 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'. He also found success as a solo performer after the band's break-up in 1970, before his death from lung cancer in 2001. He left almost £100million in his will - 1,000 times more than the value of 25 Upton Green.

"Just when a girl has her high-heel sashay perfected, along comes an escalator. Moments earlier this young lady had been click-clacking confidently along in her stilettos. But all it took was one step on the escalator for her day to go seriously downhill – or make that uphill. Somehow her heel became caught on a step and although she battled gamely to free herself, she eventually toppled backwards and was carried in a rather undignified fashion all the way to the top.

"Sing-a-long star: Babies are more likely to drift off to Adele, above, than rock-a-bye baby, parents claimed . Parents are ditching traditional lullabies to sing their children to sleep in favour of chart-topping pop songs, a study revealed yesterday.. A feeling that songs such as 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' are 'old-fashioned' and 'silly' emerged as the reasons with other mums and dads admitting they struggle to recall latter verses of the old favourites. Instead, with many parents now listening to modern pop tunes on the radio or television, youngsters now favour Adele, Bruno Mars or Rihanna tunes over classics like Rock a Bye Baby. Half of the 2,000 parents polled even admitted their children preferred singing along to chart toppers, with just 15 per cent still favouring nursery rhymes and lullabies. The survey for the makers of the award winning musical toy Symphony in B also revealed Bruno Mars' 'Just the Way You Are' and Adele's 'Someone Like You' are the most popular songs for children. Robbie Williams' 'Angels' and 'Diamonds' and 'Umbrella', by Rihanna completed the top five. Other songs to feature in the poll include 'Sweet Child of Mine' by the Guns 'N' Roses, Taylor Swift's 'I Knew You Were Trouble' and Emeli Sande's 'Next to Me'. Managing Director Jonathan Thorpe of John Crane Ltd, distributors of Symphony in B, said: 'It's only natural that parents are singing more modern songs to their children nowadays. 'We are surrounded by music every day, either on the radio, TV or in films, and often once you hear a song, you end up singing it without even realising. 'Many parents also seem to be more familiar with pop songs compared to the more traditional ones so it's only natural they end up singing what they know to their children. 'Any way that parents engage with their children over music is a good thing, and it's great that so many mums and dads sing to or with their children, whether that song is one or 100 years old. 'Evidence shows that children who listen to music are more likely to develop good language skills and all children find music and rhyme safe and comforting. 'They experience a release in dopamine which helps them sleep more soundly, cope with pain better and generally be calmer. The study found that 88 per cent of children like to listen to music with half most likely to choose a modern pop song over a nursery rhyme or lullaby. Eighty-five per cent of parents also reckon their children tend to prefer songs from their favourite TV shows. Almost eight in ten parents also sing to their youngsters, with 64 per cent of those usually opting for a chart hit. While 45 per cent put it down to the fact that they have usually just heard the song so it's in their head, more than a quarter said their children just prefer them to traditional nursery rhymes. Another one in five admitted it's because they know more of the words to modern songs than nursery rhymes, while more than one in twenty claimed they don't know any traditional children's songs. The modern music isn't always a good thing though as a third of parents admit their child is more likely to settle down with a traditional nursery rhyme. And more than half have let their children, intentionally or accidently, listen to a pop song which contained inappropriate lyrics. It also emerged that 89 per cent of parents think it is important that their children listen to music. And another 83 per cent of parents hope that encouraging their children to listen to music from a young age means they will have an interest in listening to or playing music as they get older. Jonathan Thorpe, from Symphony in B, added: 'We always knew that music was important to children and our toy allows children to appreciate music from a very early age. 'Thankfully these results show that over 70 per cent of children still like to sing along to classic nursery songs at least twice a week.' 1. Bruno Mars - Just the way you are2.

"Stations in cities like London and New York are traditionally vast, cathedral like structures. However, a new proposal calls for trains to climb up the side of skyscrapers to form the first vertical stations. This would free up space in city centres, and allow passengers to be routed out of the station more effectively, its inventors say. The future of stations? Its inventors say the vertical station would free up space in major cities . As the train travels close to the tower it  transitions from its horizontal formation, and ascends up the facade vertically. The individual compartments pivot similar to a ‘Ferris wheel’, allowing the passengers within the carriage to remain in an upright position and facing towards the cityscape. The carriages will be supported by a magnetic structure located at either side. This eliminates the need for rails beneath, and allowing the carriages and its passengers to connect to the tower. Passengers will travel into the main lobby allowing travelers to ascend through the atrium and through the platforms and onto the carriages. Called the Hyper Speed Vertical Train Hub, it could replace stations with a giant skyscraper, according to Christopher Christophi and Lucas Mazarrasa, the Londoners who came up with the idea. Train carriages pivot like a Ferris wheel when they approach, and magnets on the side of the building allow them to rise up. 'The Hyper Speed Vertical Train Hub, aims to resolve the inevitable challenges that cities will face by 2075, and offers a deliverable and sustainable solution for the future of the transport generation,' they say. The project will become a ‘repeatable’ piece of infrastructure that can be implemented to support any city around the world, connecting to a new Hyper Speed under and over ground network, with trains covering an average distance of 300miles in 30 minutes, they hope. The huge towers would be as large as the Empire State building. Called Hyper Speed Vertical Train Hub, it could replace stations with a giant skyscraper.

'The Hyper-Speed Vertical Train Hub aims to replace existing flagship train stations and create new key connective points for the exchange of people and goods with the new hyper speed network. ' The proposal will ‘flip’ the traditional form and function of the current train station design vertically, and re-form it into a cylindrical mass to increase the towers train capacity. The train tower aims to eliminate the current impact that traditional stations have currently on land use. Passengers will travel into the main lobby allowing travelers to ascend through the atrium and through the platforms and onto the carriages. The base of the tower will become a park, with bridge to connect people to the station's main lobby . Each carriage will contain ten passengers . 'The trains will also create a dynamic and kinetic facade, one that will be continuously evolving and responsive to the workings of the vertical hub, a language that can be read by the whole city,' the team say. As the train travels and transitions from its horizontal formation, and ascends up the facade vertically, the carriages will pivot similar to that on a ‘Ferris wheel’, allowing the passengers within the carriage to remain in an upright position and facing towards the cityscape. The carriages will be supported by a magnetic structure located at either side, eliminating the need for rails beneath, and allowing the carriages and its passengers to connect to the tower.","Trains are able pivot like a Ferris wheel as they reach tower .

"You might think mobiles and computers are taking over our lives for the worse. But scientists have revealed our addiction to gadgetry has made us all into touch typists. In experiments, the average person could type 72 words a minute, hitting six keys a second with an accuracy rate of 94 per cent. This is despite the fact that we don't know where the keys are, suggesting that we're able to perform complicated tasks even when we don't know what we're doing. 21st century life: A team of cognitive psychologists from Vanderbilt and Kobe Universities in the US and Japan found the average person to have the skills associated with touch typists . A team of cognitive psychologists . from Vanderbilt and Kobe Universities were studying automatism, the . ability to perform actions without conscious thought or intention, when they made their discovery. The research, published in the journal . Attention, Perception & Psychophysics, found that skilled typists . can't identify the positions of many of the keys on the QWERTY keyboard while novice typists don't appear to learn key locations in the first . place. Lead author of the study, Vanderbilt . University's Dr Kristy Snyder, said: ""When you are typing away at your . computer, you don't know what your fingers do. ""This demonstrates that we're capable of doing extremely complicated things without knowing explicitly what we are doing."" One hundred students and locals completed the short typing test. Then, they were shown a blank QWERTY keyboard and given 80 seconds to write the letters in the correct location. On average, they typed 72 words per minute with 94 percent accuracy. But they could accurately place an average of only 15 letters on a blank keyboard. But the study also found the average person was only able to identify an average of 15 keys on a blank keyboard, suggesting we're capable of doing complicated tasks without knowing what we're doing . For more than a century, scientists have recognised the existence of automatic behaviours of this type such as tying shoelaces to making coffee to factory assembly-line work to riding a bicycle and driving a car. Scientists had assumed that typing also fell into this category, but had not tested it. What surprised them was evidence that conflicts with the basic theory of automatic learning which holds that it starts out as a conscious process and gradually becomes unconscious with repetition. According to the widely held theory, as you repeat the task, it becomes increasingly automatic. The QWERTY keyboard was invented by  Christopher Sholes, a Milwaukee port official, senator, and newspaper editor. The first attempt by Sholes was alphabetical, but soon hit a snag -  the typebars clashed because of the key arrangements. He rearranged the proximity of the most used letters to arrange them in a way to make the machine work. Frequency . and combinations of letters had to be considered to prevent key clashes . - in essence he rejigged the letters on the machine in order to keep . speeds down. In 1873, QWERTY was taken on by Remington, which then manufactured typewriters. It soon became adopted as the basis not only for English but the majority of European languages as well. This allows you to think about other things while you performing the task but your conscious recollection of the details gradually fades away. But the researchers were surprised when they found evidence that the typists never appear to memorise the key positions, not even when they are first learning to type. Evidence for this conclusion came from another experiment included in the study. The researchers recruited 24 typists who were skilled on the QWERTY keyboard and had them learn to type on a Dvorak keyboard, which places keys in different locations. After the participants developed a reasonable proficiency with the alternative keyboard, they were asked to identify the placement of the keys on a blank Dvorak keyboard. On average, they could locate only 17 letters correctly, comparable to participants' performance with the QWERTY keyboard. Centennial Professor of Psychology at Vanderbilt Gordon Logan, who supervised the experiments said: 'It appears that not only don't we know much about what we are doing but we can't know it because we don't consciously learn how to do it in the first place. 'When I was a boy, you learned to type by taking a typing class and one of the first assignments was to memorise the keyboard. 'The lack of explicit knowledge of the keyboard may be due to the fact that computers and keyboards have become so ubiquitous that students learn how to use them in an informal, trial-and-error fashion when they are very young.'","In the study, 100 students completed a short typing test .
In the experiments the average person was able to hit six keys a second.
Each word was typed with a 94 per cent accuracy .
But when the students were asked to label the keys on a blank keyboard, they could only identify an average of 15 letters .

"The shocking mugshots of the Mississippi parents who fled to Georgia with their young daughter after their infant was found dead shed light on the couple's shocking decline. Police captured Donald Boyd Harris, 34, and Allison Studdard, 31, early Thursday in Sylvester, Ga., about 170 miles south of Atlanta. The couple's two-year-old daughter was unharmed during their time on the lam. Harris and Studdard are being held on felony drug warrants, and deputies are heading Friday to Georgia to bring them back to Mississippi. It is not clear if they will face additional charges. Shocking: Allison Studdard (left) and Donald Harris (right) were arrested Thursday in Georgia . Better days: Harris shown with one of his children and an older relative . The newly-released pictures show the transformation from what was a clean-cut, all-American couple to a strung-out, frazzled life on the run from police. 'It's too early in the investigation to say,' a police spokesperson told WXIA. 'That will be part of the investigation process.' A search of the home found crystal meth, the spokesperson added. Mississippi authorities say it could be . weeks before they know what caused the death of 7-month-old Alyssa . Harris. Lowndes County (Mississippi) Coroner Greg Merchant said an autopsy was completed Wednesday but it did not reveal a cause of death, and also that it would be weeks before toxicology results would be available. Her body is being held in the morgue until her parents are able to discuss funeral plans. Authorities have yet to file charges in the bay's death. The apparently drug addicted couple was living with their children at the home of Studdard's father about a mile from the Alabama state line, authorities said. Roger Studdard told police he was woken by noises made while the couple frantically tried to revive their unresponsive baby. They fled when he called 911, cops said. Healthier days: The pair is shown years ago before their reported drug addictions ruined their lives . Not so long ago: Studdard shown with her young child before it appears the drugs took hold . Innocent victim: Baby Maliah was taken on the couple's flight from the law, but was found unharmed . It is not clear what caused the baby's death, but violence is not suspected. 'It doesn't look like there are apparent injuries,' another official told the station. Deputies arrived to find the lifeless infant in it's bassinet, and also found the drugs in the home. Authorities do not believe the home was a meth lab, but do suspect the illicit substances were being consumed on the property. 'It was a fairly clean home,' a police spokesperson said. 'It is a nice single-family dwelling.' The pair was mostly unemployed, with Harris finding some work repairing cell phones inside the home, said police. Studdard is said to have assisted him. The spokesperson said he was not aware of any prior incidents requiring a police presence at the home. Previous pictures of the couple found on Facebook showed no indication of their current state of affairs. Where it happened: The couple's infant was found dead in this Mississippi home . Doting: Studdard appears every but the loving mother in this picture . 'We're still working on trying to pull records,' he added. 'We never really had any contact with them, up until yesterday.' Mississippi issued an Amber Alert on Wednesday for the couple's 2-year-old daughter, Maliah Harris, after Donald Harris and Studdard fled with her. She was with them and unharmed when they were captured. A police officer told WALB he sang to the confused, distraught young girl to try to calm her down. 'The only thing I could think of was to sing songs I sing to my little girl and try to calm her down,' said Sylvester Police Department officer Paul Klein. Six years ago: The couple was all smiles in 2008 only two days after New Year's Eve . Police said they also found more drugs in the couple's car. 'The female suspect, she really didn't say too much. She broke down and started crying. The male suspect, Donald, he knew what it was in reference to,' Klein added. Authorities released Maliah to the Georgia Department of Family and Children Services. The couple reportedly has ties to the state in the form of expired driver's licenses and a Georgia plates on the car they were driving. They were spotted by locals who notified local officials. It is not clear if more charges will be filed in the case.","Allison Studdard and Donald Harris went on the run after their infant was found Wednesday unresponsive .

"A  63-stone teenage girl had to be rescued from her own home after calling out to her mother from her bedroom that she could not stand up, it emerged today. Her stepfather Arthur Treloar revealed how 19-year-old Georgia Davis's desperate plea for help sparked the dramatic operation to smash into her house to get her to hospital. She needed urgent care last week but had to wait eight hours as walls were knocked down before she could be carried from her home into an ambulance. Mr Treloar blames himself for his stepdaughter's condition because she quit a fat camp in America and piled on the pounds after he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Heartache: 63 stone Georgia Davis, 19, from Aberdare, South Wales, was struggling with the guilt of dumping a mystery boyfriend . He said: 'It breaks my heart to think of what poor Georgia has been through. It's all my fault. 'She had watched her own dad die of a heart attack when she was a toddler. One day she turned to me and said: 'I've lost one dad - I can't lose another.' It cost an estimated £100,000 as emergency workers spent eight hours cutting her free as two walls of her home in Aberdare, South Wales, were demolished to remove her from her first-floor bedroom. She remained at the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil over the weekend while doctors continued to test for medical complaints including diabetes, kidney disease, spinal problems and respiratory failure. Her heart rate and blood pressure are being constantly monitored. Britain's fattest teenager had told friends on Facebook of her fears for her life because of her diet of junk food, chocolate and fizzy drinks. She said: 'We all die in the end...but food will inevitably kill me. I can't handle losing weight, my stepdad's lung cancer, mum's sickness and my depression all at once.' A 10ft by 10ft space was cut into to the top floor of the house in Aberdare, South Wales, so that the emergency services could remove the teenager . The scene as Miss Davis was removed from her home and loaded into an ambulance last week . Mr Treloar, 73, told the Sun on Sunday how his step-daughter had been gaining weight since her return from fat camp - staying in her bedroom watching television or messaging her friends. He said she managed to come downstairs to eat or talk to her family by sliding down on her bottom, but last Monday she confessed she could no longer stand up. 'Georgia had been in terrible pain for a long time from sores and swelling in her feet, but as usual she was trying to protect me and her mum so she kept if from us, ' added Mr Treloar. Over 40 firemen, medics and engineers took part in the operation last Thursday to rescue Georgia and take her to hospital in a reinforced ambulance after her mother Lesley called a doctor. It was the first time she had been out of the house in six months. Ambulance men, paramedics, contractors from RCT homes, police, firemen, social workers all helped in the operation . A bridge was also built from the roadside to the top floor with between 30 to 40 people involved in the operation . Friends and neighbours claim Mrs Davis, 57, bought all her daughter's food which included processed ready-meals, sandwiches and packs of peanuts and crisps. She is also partial to sausages, pasties, chips, chocolate and chunks of cheese with bottles of coke or pints of milk.’ She has previously spoken of her guilt over the teenager’s obesity. She has said of Georgia’s weight: ‘I feel guilty, of course I do.’ In an interview, she said she and her daughter had started comfort eating after her husband Geoff died when Georgia was five. But she said she had later made a determined effort to change their diets – such as making her own chips instead of buying them from the takeaway. She said in the interview: ‘I wish I could turn back the clock. But if you’ve never had food addiction, you can’t understand. You try to fight it but it’s like a drug.’ The cost of removing Miss Davis is estimated to cost £100,000 to cover manpower, plus the emergency call-out and the reconstruction of the demolished walls . The operation began just after 9am, and she was seen leaving the scene in an ambulance just after 5pm . In 2008, Georgia told reporters: ‘Some people choose heroin but I’ve chosen food and it’s killing me.’ In the past, she has spoken of eating ‘a couple of loaves-worth of sandwiches filled with jam or cheese or meat’ every day. This was in addition to five bags of cheese and onion crisps, two packets of chocolate bourbons, sponge cake, trifle chocolate cake, and four sausages with mashed potato and baked beans for dinner, as well as fizzy drinks. She consumed as much as 13,000 calories a day. Georgia returned from the Wellspring Academy in North Carolina, in June 2009, weighing around 19st after losing 14st 6lbs by ditching her diet of cheese, biscuits and chocolate for regular exercise salads and lean meat. But when she learned of her stepfather's cancer, she would not go back to the fat camp. Mr Treloar told the Sun: 'It was the beginning of the end because she refused to return to America and for that I blame myself. It was difficult for Georgia to maintain her weight loss because she couldn't find the right foods in the supermarket in Aberdare.' Georgia lost 15 stone after her visit to a U.S. weight loss camp (left) but was piling on the pounds by September last year (right) Georgia Davis, aged 17, was weighing around 40st. Pictured with her mother Lesley . Mr Treloar revealed that Georgia had been forced to wear a bed sheet because clothes no longer fitted her. Now doctors have told her she can only have 2,000 calories a day to ensure she loses weight. He said: 'She is feeling depressed but we're doing our best to keep her spirits up. She's sick and we're worried sick.' On Facebook, Georgia told friends she was not coping with her family's health.  She said: 'I have my issues. At the moment dealing with everything is too much. 'I need to take it one step at a time, but I will fix all this.' She confessed that she was smoking heavily to avoid comfort eating and had contracted an infection. 'My life cannot get possibly worse,' she said. 'I have needs sorting out because it's added loads more weight on to me. It's unbearable now.' Her mother says Georgia was always a large child, pictured here eating a lolly as a toddler . Early signs: Miss Davis was an overweight toddler, and the rapid growth has continued to this day . A hospital spokesman said: ‘This young lady has had a settled night and has been seen this morning by the consultant in charge of her care. ‘Initial assessments have been undertaken and she will be undergoing further assessment during the day to assist in her plan of care.’","Stepfather reveals Britain's fattest teenager screamed to her mother for help after piling on the pounds .

"While our own moon may be thought of as difficult for man to visit, researchers say Saturn's has a whole lot more to kill off any unsuspecting visitors. Researchers have found gigantic polar clouds of hydrogen cyanide roughly four times the area of the UK on Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. Astronomers say the find was 'totally unexpected'. Nasa's Cassini spacecraft spotted the development of the gigantic polar cloud covering over one million square kilometres – roughly four times the area of the UK. Titan is unique in our solar system because of its dense nitrogen-methane atmosphere, which is very similar to Earth's in some ways, but very different in others. For example, air temperatures are around 200 degrees colder and, in contrast to the warm salt water seas of Earth, frigid hydrocarbon lakes populate Titan's surface. Titan has seasons just like Earth, only each season lasts over seven years instead of three months due to its ponderous orbit around the Sun. After equinox in 2009, Titan's south pole entered the perpetual darkness of polar winter. The new study led by Leiden Observatory, the Netherlands Institute for Space Research and the University of Bristol  is published today in Nature. Titan has seasons just like Earth, only each season lasts over seven years instead of three months due to its ponderous orbit around the Sun. After equinox in 2009, Titan's south pole entered the perpetual darkness of polar winter. Soon after, instruments on Nasa's Cassini spacecraft observed the development of a gigantic polar cloud covering over one million square kilometres – roughly four times the area of the UK. Bristol researcher and co-author Dr Nick Teanby said: 'The cloud was first seen in images from Cassini's cameras taken in 2012. 'It started off quite small but soon grew to cover the entire south polar region. This was totally unexpected and set us puzzling over what the cloud could be made of. Unfortunately, while the images showed that the cloud was very high up, at over 250km above the surface, they did not allow us to figure out what the cloud was actually made of or why it was there. 'For the next two years Cassini gathered more data including infrared spectra of the cloudy region. Lead author Remco de Kok said: 'When we looked at the spectra, we saw two large peaks that weren't present in spectra of other places on Titan. Saturn's biggest and brightest moons are visible in this portrait. Titan (5,150 kilometers, or 3,200 miles across) is Saturn's largest moon and appears at the lower left. Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949 miles across) is the planet's second largest moon and is seen above center. Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across) has the brightest surface in the solar system, reflecting nearly all of the sunlight that falls upon it. Enceladus is just above the rings, right of center. These peaks coincided exactly with the peaks you'd expect from ice particles of hydrogen cyanide, or 'blauwzuur' (blue acid) as it's known in the Netherlands, which is highly toxic. This was very surprising to us, since we did not expect HCN ice to be able to form so high in Titan's atmosphere. 'This new research suggests that Titan's south pole must be extremely cold to allow hydrogen cyanide to condense. In fact, the upper atmosphere must have cooled by over 50 degrees in less than a year to reach a blisteringly cold -150C. Remco de Kok concluded: 'This is a very rapid change given Titan's long annual cycle and is much colder than previously thought possible. It suggests that once the pole is in shadow the upper atmosphere acts as a very efficient radiator of heat, perhaps due to the high abundance of exotic hydrocarbon and nitrogen based compounds, which emit strongly in the infrared. This artist's rendition shows the Huygens probe floating in a methane/ethane lake on Titan. A probe due to land on Saturn's moon, Titan, could discover a world that looks 'a little bit like Sweden or Northern Canada', one of the mission's scientists said. 'Cassini is set to continue observing Titan until it takes a dive into Saturn at the end of its mission in 2017. It will be fascinating to see how the cloud will develop.' Titan is unique in our solar system because of its dense nitrogen-methane atmosphere, which is very similar to Earth's in some ways, but very different in others. For example, air temperatures are around 200 degrees colder and, in contrast to the warm salt water seas of Earth, frigid hydrocarbon lakes populate Titan's surface.","Gigantic polar clouds of hydrogen cyanide spotted high in atmosphere .

"Danny Alexander, the top Liberal Democrat at the Treasury, has ‘gone native’ and now gets on ‘famously well’ with the Tories, an aide to Chancellor George Osborne has claimed. Nick Clegg was forced to defend his close colleague, insisting his ‘heart is exactly where it should be.’ But privately many Lib Dems fear that Mr Alexander has grown rather too comfortable with the Conservatives. Lib Dem Danny Alexander (left) faces accusations that he has got too close to Tory Chancellor George Osborne while working at the Treasury . Tory MP Rob Wilson, a backbench aide to Mr Osborne, made the claim about Mr Alexander at an event for Conservatives in Westminster yesterday. According to Huffington Post, Mr Wilson said: ‘The Treasury team gets on famously well. Everybody is friends. The relationship between George and Danny Alexander is very, very good. ‘I think Nick Clegg complains quite often that Danny Alexander has gone native in the Treasury. I think there is some truth in the fact he has gone native in the Treasury. The relationship is very good within the Treasury team.’ However, the comments will provoke alarm in Lib Dem ranks at a time when the party is desperate to differentiate themselves from their Tory coalition partners. In the Commons today, Mr Clegg was forced to defend his closest ally from claims of being a closet Tory taken hostage by Mr Osborne. The Deputy Prime Minister dismissed the reports, telling the Commons that Mr Wilson was as good a ‘wing man’ as the Greek legend Icarus, who famously fell in to the sea when the wax in his wings melted in the sun. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted Mr Alexander's heart is in the right place . And he insisted that Mr Alexander's resistance to cutting the top rate of tax for the wealthiest earners showed he was a true Liberal Democrat, at a time when Tories want it reduced from 45p to 40p. Mr Clegg said: ‘I have just see these quotes from Mr Wilson. He claims he is extremely close to the Chancellor, that he knows his mind, that he is the Chancellor's wing man. Well, he is as good a wing man as Icarus was in flying off on his own to judge by his comments. ‘The Chief Secretary to the Treasury is doing an outstanding job on behalf of the Government and on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. ‘Only last week he was saying that further cuts for the very wealthiest in society will happen over “his dead body”. That, and so many other examples, show his Liberal Democrat heart is exactly where it should be.’ Mr Clegg's comments followed a question from Labour MP Kevin Brennan who asked: ‘I know you will be aware of the concept of Stockholm Syndrome, where captives increasingly empathise with their captors. What are you going to do to de-programme the Treasury one?’ A coalition row erupted last week when Mr Alexander insisted that the top rate of tax for highest earners would be cut to 40p ‘over my dead body’. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury said he would never allow it to happen ahead of the 2015 election. But Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson said the current 45p rate was not reasonable, and warned the Lib Dems about make bold threats because the last thing he wanted to see was ‘the dead body of Danny Alexander’. The future of the tax rate paid by people earning more than £150,000 has become a major political battleground. The Treasury team gets on 'famously well', according to Tory MP Rob Wilson, a backbench aide to Mr Osborne . In the last weeks of the Labour government then-Chancellor Alistair Darling increased it from 40p to 50p. Mr Osborne then cut it to 45p in 2012, claiming the measure had raised ‘next to nothing’ for the Treasury. Ed Balls has vowed to return it to 50p if Labour wins the next election, but Tories are pushing for it to be reduced further to 40p. However Mr Alexander, the second most senior Lib Dem in the government, refused to yield to the Conservative demands. ‘I think it is right at 45 per cent. I wouldn't go to cutting below 45 per cent,’ he told the Daily Mirror. ‘I would say that would happen over my dead body.’","Tory aide to George Osborne claims Treasury team 'gets on famously'

The artist is raising cash on the crowd funding website to make the exhibition possible. ‘For 24 hours a day for 28 days, artist Mark Farid will wear a Virtual Reality Headset through which he will experience life through another person’s eyes and ears - this person will be referred to as ‘the other’, according to the Kickstarter website. He is shown sleeping in an Oculus Rift headset, in a test run . He will have no previous relationship with the person through whom he will experience the world, but will be aware that ‘the other’ is a heterosexual male, who is in a relationship. ‘The other’ person living outside the gallery,  will have to wear a pair of glasses that covertly capture audio and video. This footage will then be watched back by Mr Faird, who will inhabit a space consisting of only a bed, a toilet and shower area, and will be on constant display to the public apart from one hour after he goes to sleep. Mark Faird (pictured) will have no contact with any other real humans during the time of isolation and will eat what ‘the other’ eats and shower when ‘the other’ showers, for example . During this time, a psychologist will check on Mr Faird’s welfare and the headset will also act as a ‘verbal diary’ to capture his mental health, the website says. The artist will have no contact with any other real humans during the time of isolation and will eat what ‘the other’ eats and shower when ‘the other’ showers, for example. Presumably the artist will see the most intimate details of the 'other's' life through his eyes. The team of artists and video directors behind the project write: ‘Over the course of the project, it will become apparent whether Mark will begin to lose his own sense of self, and start to inhabit the reality of the other.’ ‘With no one to talk to, and no one to validate any of Mark’s thoughts, will his only source of validation - the other’s life - become the life which makes sense to Mark?’ The artist could alternatively retain his own sense of self and exist in a strange ‘no man’s land’ they explained. The findings of the arty experiment will be made into a documentary which will include commentary by psychiatrists, psychologists, neuroscientists, philosophers and artists. So far the group of artists behind the project have raised just over £2,000 of their ambitious £150,000 goal, with 29 days to go. The exhibition seeks to find out whether the artist will lose his sense of self and experience life though another person’s eyes. The end result of the experiment is unknown to everyone, and has the potential for a variety of implications to the artist’s physical and mental health. A psychologist will check on Mark Faird’s health throughout the 28 days and if he is not coping it will be cut short. His physical and mental health will be constantly monitored to ensure his eyesight is not harmed by wearing a virtual reality headset for so long, for example. He is undergoing sessions with a psychologist in preparation for this project so it is possible to assess how the project has affected him.","Mark Faird will live in an art gallery comprising a bed and bathroom area .

"As the 100,000th car rolled past his tollbooth this week, Mike Watts probably allowed himself a moment of quiet satisfaction. It meant that a rather audacious gamble – using his life savings to set up a private road – was well on its way to paying off. Mr Watts built the 400-yard track through a field in order to spare drivers months of misery while a council repairs a busy commuter route. Scroll down for video . Mike Watts, 62, built a private toll road in Somerset after the A431 Kelston Road - a popular commuter route -was shut in February following a landslip . The toll road in Kelston, Somerset (pictured) - which charges £2 for each car - has now been used by 100,000 vehicles . Two months in, he has welcomed 100,000 motorists, each paying £2 to avoid a 14-mile detour on country lanes and all the stress – and fuel costs – that entails. His toll road cost £150,000 to build, with running costs of £150,000, so he is now two-thirds of the way to breaking even. It was built without planning permission, but a retrospective application, which cost £25,000 in surveyors’ fees and ecological reports, is due to be assessed soon. It has so captured the public imagination that it has become something of a tourist attraction. But its main success has been helping drivers as the A431 Kelston Road between Bath and Bristol is fixed after a landslip in February. Bath and North East Somerset council aims to reopen the road by Christmas, and recently spent £660,000 to fast-track the repairs – taking the cost to £2.66million. Mr Watts, 62, believes they could be complete by mid-November. As part of the planing application, his road must then be dismantled. The businessman was initially concerned he would be left out of pocket if he did not make £300,000 by the end of the year . The father-of-four, who came up with the idea while in his local pub, sought to recoup the £300,000 cost of building and upkeeping the road by charging £2 per car and £3 per caravan and trailer . But he is feeling fairly confident of recouping his money. ‘It is very much a race against time,’ he said. ‘But we estimate this could be achieved by the beginning of November. ‘I’m absolutely delighted and overwhelmed by the support. I want to thank each and every person who has used the toll road. ‘It really does do what it says on the can – saves people stress, time and driving on the diversion.’ Father-of-four Mr Watts and his wife Wendy, 52, who run party shops in Bath, faced having to sell their cottage if the toll road flopped. The hilly field is usually home to herds of cows, flocks of sheep or crops but is now occupied by the temporary road - which Mr Watts says has attracted motorists from all over the world . Mr Watts says he has already raised two thirds of the amount required and believes he will be able to cover all his costs by early November . A431 closed: The suggested route after the closure of the Kelston Road was the A4, which took in a 14-mile detour . The father-of-four came up with the idea after a section of the A431 near Bath was closed following a landslide, sparking a 14-mile detour (pictured) This aerial view showing the Kelston Toll road on the left and the main road on the right.

"They are esteemed badges of honour to commemorate a building where important people throughout history lived and worked. And the London blue plaques scheme – administered by English Heritage since 1986 – has been running for nearly 150 years and is thought to be the oldest of its kind in the world. But English Heritage has come under fire for choosing a blue plaques panel of celebrity ‘white men off the telly’, prompting a slew of resignations from the existing panel. Involved: The new panel now boasts the likes of arts council chair Sir Peter Bazalgette (left), who brought Big Brother to the UK, and FA chairman Greg Dyke (right) Famed: The panel, which is responsible for selecting the historical figures to be honoured with the famous plaques, also features broadcaster and art dealer Philip Mould (left), and scientist and TV presenter professor Lord (Robert) Winston (right) The new panel, which is responsible . for selecting the historical figures to be honoured with the famous . plaques, now boasts the likes of arts council chair Sir Peter . Bazalgette, who brought Big Brother to the UK; FA chairman Greg Dyke; . broadcaster and art dealer Philip Mould; scientist and TV presenter . professor Lord (Robert) Winston; TV host and physicist Professor Brian . Cox and banker Rupert Hambro. These . appointments saw two existing members of the panel, David Edgerton, . professor of the history of science and technology at King’s College, . London, and architectural journalist Gillian Darley, quit three weeks . ago. Professor Edgerton slammed the new appointments and told The Observer: ‘Instead of a blue plaques panel, English Heritage are creating a white-men-off-the-telly panel, with a banker added. ‘It . is hardly expert, especially in history, and is not representative. Such a panel may wish to fund its own plaque scheme, but it should not . call itself the blue plaques panel, nor should a scheme advised by such a . panel be in receipt of public money. ‘People are not so dumb that they want their blue plaques decided on by people they might have seen on television.’ Appointments: TV host and physicist Professor Brian Cox (left) and banker Rupert Hambro (right) are also on the new panel . Famous: What was once the home of author A A Milne, at 13 Mallord St, in Chelsea, south-west London . Professor Edgerton had been a member of the panel for six years – yet only discovered the new appointments when reading the addressees of the agenda to the next meeting. He said he feared the appointments had been made purely to encourage donations, adding: ‘English Heritage is the custodian of the blue plaques panel, not its owner. ‘Proposers, supporters and the public will rightly expect the blue plaques panel to be expert, particularly in history. ‘They will also expect it to be representative so that plaques are awarded to people distinguished in all fields, including those currently under-represented.’ The new blue plaque panel appointments have also been condemned for being entirely male. Ms Darley said she was appalled by the lack of females on the panel and said: ‘The appointments are all male and, with the exception of Brian Cox, they are all over 60. ‘And the other point is that they are all busy people. I doubt they will find time to scrutinise these decisions. ‘Bonnie Greer was appointed to the panel last year and they make a lot of that. But, well, let’s just say her attendance record hasn’t been very good. I’ve met her. Once.’ Professor Edgerton and Ms Darley were asked whether they wished to assist in the appointment of their replacements, but declined. In a letter to Professor Ronald Hutton, chairman of the panel, Professor Edgerton said: ‘I don’t feel able to recommend anyone, nor indeed to recommend that anyone accept an invitation to serve. ‘I am sorry to be blunt, but English Heritage have clearly made up their mind what panel they want, and have got it.’ Example: The master of suspense, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, was honoured in 1999 with an English Heritage blue plaque being unveiled by his daughter Patricia at 153 Cromwell Road, London, where he lived for 13 years . Author: An English Heritage blue plaque marking a former home of writer PG Wodehouse in Mayfair, London .

A spokesman for English Heritage said further appointments were being made, including that of Professor Martin Daunton, master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He told the Observer: ‘We were disappointed to receive the resignations of two blue plaque panel members. ‘We are confident that, once complete, the panel will represent the full range of in-depth knowledge and expertise required to consider all the different blue plaque nominations.’","Slew of resignations from English Heritage's existing blue plaques panel .

"If you cry with happiness at weddings you are responding to a happy experience with a negative reaction, researchers claim. And they believe the unusual reaction may help restore emotional equilibrium in us and keep intense emotions under control. Experts say that their work helps to shed light on how people express and control their emotions, which could help advance their understanding of people’s mental health. Scroll down for video . People who cry at weddings (illustrated with a stock image) are responding to a happy experience with a negative reaction, and this response may help restore emotional equilibrium in us, scientists claim . Oriana Aragon, the Yale psychologist who led the study, set out to explore the phrase ‘tears of joy,’ which she said never made sense to her. But after conducting a series of studies into seemingly incongruous expressions, she now understands better why people cry when they are happy. ‘People may be restoring emotional equilibrium with these expressions,’ she explained. ‘They seem to take place when people are overwhelmed with strong positive emotions and people who do this seem to recover better from those strong emotions.’ The report, which is published in the journal Psychological Science, cites various examples of responding to a positive experience with a negative emotion, such as: a crying spouse being reunited with a soldier returning from war and teenage girls scream at a Justin Bieber concert. The study cites various examples of responding to a positive experience with a negative emotion, such as a crying spouse being reunited with a soldier returning from war, and when people can't help pinching babies' cheeks (stock image) who they consider cute . The study found that responding to a happy experience with a negative reaction, may help restore a person’s emotional equilibrium. In this way it helps people manage extremely emotional, overwhelming, moments. People who cry with happiness are able to moderate intense emotions more quickly. Examples also include a baseball player who hits a home run, only to be slapped on the back by teammates and when people can't help pinching babies’ cheeks who they consider cute. Dr Aragon and her colleagues ran study participants through some of these scenarios and measured their responses to cute babies or happy reunions. They discovered that individuals who express negative reactions to positive news were able to moderate intense emotions more quickly. They found that people who are most likely to cry at their child’s graduation are most likely to want to pinch a cute baby’s cheeks. There is also some evidence that strong negative feelings may provoke positive expressions. The study revealed that individuals who express negative reactions to positive news - shown here by a happy woman crying after voting in the first election since former President Mohamed Morsi was ousted in Egypt - were able to moderate intense emotions more quickly . For example, nervous laughter often occurs when people are confronted with a difficult or frightening situations, and psychologists have seen people smiling during times of extreme sadness. These new discoveries begin to explain common things that many people do but don’t even understand themselves, Dr Aragon said. ‘These insights advance our understanding of how people express and control their emotions, which is importantly related to mental and physical health, the quality of relationships with others, and even how well people work together,’ she said.","Psychologists at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, have explored why people shed 'tears of joy'

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has opened up about his management style, using the analogy of making a suit to measure to describe his role, whilst also suggesting being a coach in England is ‘paradise’. The Blues boss, since returning to Chelsea in the summer of 2013, has assembled a star studded squad which is perched at the top of the Premier League and in the last 16 of the Champions League. Mourinho, who has won league titles in Portugal, Spain and Italy, insists you need to treat each player differently to harness their potential. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho talks to Sports Illustrated about his reign at Stamford Bridge . ‘To manage a player is like to make a suit by measure, because all of them are different I cannot go to a shop and buy some 38, some 40, some 42, some 44 and arrive in the dressing room. No. It has to be by measure, it has to be perfect,’ Mourinho told Sports Illustrated. ‘So the personal relationship with the players is something very very important. Obviously there is also the collective leadership and I have to try and adapt my collective leadership to the profile of group I have,’ added the Blues boss. ‘But I think the suit by measure is the perfect way to explain what I think is fundamental – every man is a man, I read them and the better I can interact with them the better the team can be.’ Mourinho watches on as his new recruit Juan Cuadrado (centre) control the ball at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho told Grant Wahl Chelsea have been a success in the transfer market because they don't panic . Chelsea had a strong summer in the transfer market with the acquisitions of Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic proving excellent additions and have propelled the Blues to the top of the Premier League. The 52-year-old puts his transfer success down to composure and research: . ‘First of all we didn’t panic. I came here in the first season (2013-14) and we decided not to buy just because we want to win desperately,’ added Mourinho. ‘If we have to wait one year ok, to be more sure about the profile of the type of player we want to bring. We had to be very sure of what we wanted to do. ‘After that it’s a lot easier not to make mistakes, analyse everything, try everything, know the players deeply, know if the players have the potential to improve or not under your guidance. Chelsea's midfielder Cesc Fabregas, a £30m summer signing, has been in fine form so far this season . ‘So when the summer market arrived we were in a great condition to make the right decisions to improve our team. Mourinho is clearly relishing life back in London despite disputes with officials and an apparent ‘campaign’ against his Chelsea side. ‘Firstly it’s paradise for the social life, In Europe the power of football made our lives complicated and in England people look at you in a normal way. You can walk in the street, shop with your family, go to a restaurant,’ said the Portuguese. ‘The social life is much more relaxed. There is an expression in England that the passion for the game lasts 90 minutes a week and after that everything is calm.’ The 52-year-old returned to the 'paradise' of coaching in  West London in the summer of 2013 .","Chelsea are currently top of the Premier League by five points .

"Patricia Krentcil, the New Jersey woman dubbed 'tanning mom', has demanded that the media 'leave her family alone' - during a TV interview. The 44-year-old made the appearance to defend her reputation as a good mother after she allegedly took her five-year-old daughter to a tanning salon last month. She had posed provocatively wearing a skin-tight orange bandage skirt and fitted white cardigan that revealed her midriff outside her home in Nutley, New Jersey last week. Scroll down for video . Defiant: Patricia Krentcil, 44, said her children were 'mad' that the media were attacking her after she was accused of taking her daughter, 5, to a tanning booth in New Jersey . Smile: Tanning Mom enjoying her time in the limelight last week in a tight orange skirt and white cardigan. She asked for privacy this week during a TV interview . She then proceeded to pose for the cameras before her teenage daughter eventually forced her to go back inside and stop talking to the press. She also hitched up her skirt to reveal her underwear to photographers while out with a friend. The mother-of-five told the Today show: 'Every allegation was completely wrong and I just want people to leave us alone. 'And I’m sorry I'm tan. I can be tan; it just feels good. But I really think that these moms and dads or whoever, need to step off and step away.' She went on to say that her five children were angry that the public was picking on their mother because of her bronzed appearance. Camera shy? Mrs Krentcil (pictured left with a friend) has demanded that the media leave her family alone after revealing her underwear to waiting photographers . Since accusations surfaced that she had taken her fair-skinned, red-haired daughter to a tanning booth - leaving her severely burned - Krentcil has appeared to enjoy her time in the limelight, contrary to her pleas. She has also managing to maintain her dark complexion despite being banned from a string of tanning salons near her home. According to reports, eight Planet Sun Tanning Salon locations have posted pictures of the tanning mom in their salons so staff can recognize her and kick her out. The salon where she is alleged to have taken her young daughter - City Tropics Tanning - is set to be inspected by the New Jersey Department of Health in the near future. The leathery mom made her first appearance on the Today Show last week, where she sported a shockingly dark tan and claimed: 'This whole thing has been blown out of proportion.' Days later, she was seen watering her garden in a skimpy out - making obscene signs at the waiting press and attempting to douse them with water. Angry: Krentcil's teenage daughter eventually forced her to back inside and stop talking to the press . She popped her head through her home's window to sneer at those below and stopped to chat during a shopping trip in Target. And, in a sign she has really caught the nation's attention, she was the subject of a Saturday Night Live sketch and played by actress Kristen Wiig. Wiig plastered herself in fake tan and was wearing a tight leather jacket and white flowery headpiece to mimic the New Jersey woman's look. Smoke billowing around her, she said: 'Sorry about all the smoke. I just came from the tanning salon.' The faux Krentcil said that tanning should only be done by 'responsible adults'. 'Because you may not know this, some people over tan,' she said to laughs from the audience. The sketch went on to highlight the real-life Krentcil's comments that people who judge her for her tanning are fat, ugly and jealous. Wiig said: 'I can't blame them for being jealous. I am alluring in a way they'll never be. Trust me, there are plenty of men in New Jersey who would love to snap into this Slim Jim.' Krentcil told the New York Post she watched the three-minute comedy sketch and found it 'hysterical'. 'It was well done,' she said. The nation's obsession with Tanning Mom began when Krentcil's five-year-old daughter's teacher called authorities after she noticed the girl had painful burns when she arrived at school. Krentcil said that while she did take her daughter Anna to the tanning salon, the little girl never got in the booth and was only there waiting for her mother to finish her session. She instead argued that Anna got her sunburn from playing in the yard and not breaking the law. Doctors say tanning booths, which emit UV radiation, are known carcinogens. Court: Patricia Krentcil appeared at her arraignment on May 2 charged with child endangerment for allegedly taking her 5-year-old daughter tanning . Krentcil's daughter apparently received enough of the radiation to burn her skin and leave her with painful damage, police said. Her attorney, John Caruso, disagrees and said that Krentcil will be exonerated as the evidence will show the child never entered the booth. 'Forget about the presumption of innocence; my client is 150 per cent innocent,' Caruso said. 'She loves that child more than her whole life. She would never allow her child to go inside a tanning bed.' Krentcil is due back in court on June 4.

"Families are being advised to double-bag their chicken and store it away from other food in the fridge as poisonous bacteria has been found on the outside of packaging. Campylobacter, a common group of dangerous bacteria found on raw chicken, is present on the external packaging of thousands of British chickens sold in the UK, according to a Food Standards Agency (FSA) report to be published this week. It will warn that chicken, even if it is packaged, will now need to be kept away from children and in a separate bag in the fridge. Scroll down for video . Families have been told to double-bag their chicken and store it away from other food in the fridge (stock) ‘The biggest risk is in food preparation, as this is when campylobacter is most likely to spread to surfaces or hands,’ a spokesman told the Daily Telegraph. ‘But you could put raw poultry in a separate bag as well, as there is always a small risk that the bacteria is also on the packaging.’ Earlier this year, the FSA named campylobacter as the biggest cause of food poisoning, ahead of Clostridium perfringens and the norovirus, which is commonly associated with shellfish. A preliminary study by the FSA in August found that the potentially lethal bacteria was on the outside of chicken packaging in 4 per cent of cases. Agency officials were so concerned about campylobacter contamination of chicken that it launched a survey of the meat on sale in supermarkets with the intention of regularly publishing a ‘name and shame’ list, and said: ‘Poultry meat was the food linked to the most cases of food poisoning, with an estimated 244,000 cases every year.’ Campylobacter, a common group of dangerous bacteria found on raw chicken, is present on the external packaging of thousands of British chickens sold in the UK, according to a Food Standards Agency . The British Retail Consortium said it supported the FSA’s objective to reduce campylobacter and added that ‘retailers… are investing in their supply chains working with farmers and processors to identify controls. ‘Measures implemented include introducing leak-proof packaging on all whole birds to control the spread of any contamination and provision of on-pack labelling which advises consumers on how to handle and prepare poultry.’ When the FSA announced the studies in August, it said that the main objective was to shame traders, forcing them to take more action to protect their customers. The packaging warning comes just days after the Mail reported that Public Health England suggested consumers could help protect themselves against food poisoning by freezing chicken after buying it fresh and defrosting it before cooking. Six in every ten chickens sold by supermarkets contain potentially lethal bugs that infect half a million people a year, and around 100 of the victims die.","Families are being advised to double-bag their chicken in the fridge .

"Passengers on a luxury cruise liner were terrified when a fire plunged it into darkness. The Boudicca was sailing off the coast of Morocco at 4am on Sunday when the engine room caught alight. Fred Olsen Cruise Lines tweeted this photo of sunbathing passengers about ten hours after the emergency . The Boudicca, carrying more than 1,000 passengers and crew, became stranded off Casablanca (file photo) Fred Olsen Cruise Lines said the cruise ship began to list after  a fire broke out inside an engine room . As the ship lost power and drifted in the darkness, the 784 passengers, including many Britons, contacted their loved ones back home. Dave Tonkin, a father of two from Burnham-on-Sea who had relatives on board, wrote on Twitter: ‘Boudicca listing hard and engineless off coast of Africa after engine fire. Ship left in pitch black. Worrying texts from family on board.’ Lucy Birch, from Sheffield, wrote on Twitter how she had received ‘a panicked phone call of love from relatives who fear for their life’. Other Britons used the social media site to contact the cruise liner’s owner to report the distraught phone calls they had received from family members in the night. However,  the crew managed to bring the fire under control. Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, which manages the Boudicca, yesterday said: ‘The fire was in the engine room, but [was] extinguished, and no guests or crew have been injured. ‘Following the loss of propulsion system, Boudicca listed for a short period, but is now fully stable. Guests’ services have now been restored, and guests have been kept informed of the situation at all times. It said: 'The ship’s Master has confirmed that at no point were guests asked to don their lifejackets and gather at the muster stations, as the situation was contained within the engine room by our crew members. Services are operating normally, and guests are enjoying the usual activities on board, both inside and out on deck.' Boudicca, which boasts 356 crew members, three pools, two Jacuzzis, seven restaurants, a jewellery store and a casino, departed from Southampton on January 20 for a cruise around Cape Verde and the Canaries, and was scheduled to arrive in Lanzarote this morning after leaving Cadiz, Spain, on Saturday. Passengers had shelled out between £1,199 and £2,049 for the 18-night experience. The cruise itinerary included stop-offs at Madeira and Tenerife and promised ‘lush mountain ranges and deserted beaches to volcanic landscapes and vibrant towns’.

"With their luxurious interiors and powerful engines they are the cars of choice for the rich and famous. But now Range Rover owners in London may not be able to insure their cars after high-end motor insurers have refused to insure expensive vehicles following a series of thefts across the capital. Now, underwriters are understood to be refusing to insure Range Rovers unless owners have underground or secure parking. Scroll down for video . Spree: Underwriters are understood to be refusing to insure Range Rovers unless owners have underground or secure parking. Pictured, a Range Rover Evoque . In the past three months, insurers and insurance brokers have asked to meet Jaguar Land Rover to discuss the issue. The cars are being targeted because of their ‘keyless ignition’ systems. Thieves have now found hand-held electronic devices available on eBay which can bypass the security feature. Thatcham Research, the motor insurers’ automotive research centre, said that between January and July this year, 294 Range Rover Evoque and Sport vehicles were stolen in London. During the same period, 63 BMW X5s, a rival to the Range Rover, were taken. Between January and July this year, 63 BMW X5s, a rival to the Range Rover, were taken in the capital . Among those refused cover was Keith Dowley, a commercial property adviser from south west London, who bought a Range Rover this month after his previous one was stolen.

He eventually secured cover from another provider.

"Pensioners and middle-class workers are being hit by taxes that discourage them from earning more, according to the Government’s champion for older workers. Ros Altmann, the former director general of Saga, branded the inheritance tax, 40p tax rate and increased stamp duty ‘draconian and penal’ because they were stinging those who did not consider themselves ‘remotely wealthy’. ‘After all that we’ve been through it would be wise from a social perspective to recognise that people deserve a break,’ she said. ‘ . Hard times: Pensioners and middle-class workers are being hit by taxes that discourage them from earning more, according to the Government's champion for older workers . 'The ordinary people who work hard and try to get on and live a good life deserve to get something back. These taxes are hitting people and their families who are not in any way even close to being rich,' Miss Altmann said. ‘I would like to see a proper overhaul of the tax system and a detailed study of how we can make it fairer,’ she told the Daily Telegraph. Savings: One in ten people will pay inheritance tax by 2018, compared with one in 20 this year . Economist and consumer champion Mrs Altmann was appointed Business Champion for Older Workers by the Government last month. The number of Britons paying inheritance tax is expected to rise by more than a third this year and double over the next five years. Critics say this is unfair because it taxes assets such as homes which are typically bought with income that has already been taxed. Mrs Altmann urged the Government to give pensioners a break and reward them for working hard. She said inheritance tax ‘was supposed to be a tax on the very rich, but it is now hitting anyone in the South-East who has a house’. She added: ‘It is a disincentive to build up savings or assets in later life if you worry you are going to lose nearly half of it in tax. Anybody who has a house is likely to risk losing 40 per cent of its value to the taxman.’ One in ten people will pay inheritance tax by 2018, compared with one in 20 this year.","Government champion for older workers calls taxes 'draconian and penal'

"Do you find yourself checking your phone every few seconds, waiting for the ping of an email or the beep of a text? If so, chances are that you’re an addict. And as with all addictions, the best thing to do is seek treatment. Luckily, the first digital device detox centre to rehabilitate phone and internet addicts has sprung up in the Welsh countryside. Unplugged Weekend is designed as a digital detox for people stressed out with lives attached to their phones, and includes activities such as life drawing, hiking and yoga . Aptly called ‘Unplugged Weekend’, it is nestled in the heart of the Brecon Beacons and runs festival-style weekends to help phone obsessives reconnect with real life. The camp-style set-up, which is imported from the US where it has taken off, is designed to help wean addicts off their devices and discover nature. But deliverance from your digital demons doesn’t come cheap. A weekend at the retreat in the Brecon Beacons will set you back £199. However, for many parents with teenagers who are constantly glued to their phones, it may be the best option, given worrying statistics on phone use. Last week, communications watchdog Ofcom revealed that we spend nearly nine hours a day using our smartphones, laptops, tablets and other devices. Other stats show that we check our phones an average of 150 times a day, according to a Nokia survey. The rehab begins on a Friday with everyone dropping their smartphones into a black trunk which is passed around the group. Set in the Brecon Beacons in Wales, the retreat begins with everyone handing over their phones which are kept in a locked black box until they leave again . Days at the retreat begin with yoga and meditation at 7am, followed by a ‘group sharing experience’ in which everyone talks about their addiction. Life drawing, rambling walks through the Beacons and laughter therapy are just a few of the activities on offer to help distract visitors from their phones. Describing the weekend, the website says: ‘Unplugged Weekend is a digital detox set in the countryside, so we’ll all be locking away our phones for a couple of days while we get on with having a good time. ‘We will do a group phone surrendering ceremony on the Friday evening to mark the start of the weekend and you will be reunited with your devices on Sunday when you leave. This is a tech free weekend.’ The rehab centre was set up by Lucy Pearson, 26, and Vikki Bates, 28, from London, after they met on a retreat in the Sahara desert earlier this year. Unable to use their phones due to lack of signal, the advertising workers realised how liberating it was and quit their jobs to start the retreat. ‘Being in the middle of the dunes, we didn't have any phone signal for a week- it was great. That's when we realised the benefits of having a break from being constantly tuned in,’ they said. Research shows that on average people now spend more time per day on digital devices than they do on sleep . ‘So when we got back to London we put our heads together and Unplugged was born.’ ‘We realised that the differentiating thing about our experience [in the Sahara] was that we didn’t have our phones and nobody was chasing us for anything,’ Miss Bates told the Times. ‘You’re so caught up in the stress of life and you’re thinking all the time but not about the important stuff - like whether you’re happy.’ One visitor to the centre, Tilly, who has just finished her first year at Cambridge University, told the Times: ‘You realise how much of a social barrier having a phone is. ‘Any time I’m anxious in a social situation I get my phone out and pretend to play a game or reply to all these text messages I’m supposed to have got, but because you can’t do that here you actually talk to people.’ Another visitor, Tracey, said: ‘The first thing I do in the morning is check Facebook in bed, then I get distracted and I can be on it for hours without realising.'","Guests at Unplugged Weekend lock their mobiles in a box at start of retreat .

"The consumer version of the much anticipated Oculus Rift virtual reality headset is just months away, the company has revealed. CEO Brendan Iribe told the audience at Web Summit 2014 in Dublin, that a consumer-version of the company's VR headset is 'close'. He admitted the latest prototype, codenamed Crescent Bay, is 'largely finalized for a consumer product.' Scroll down for video . CEO Brendan Iribe told the audience at Web Summit 2014 in Dublin, that a consumer-version of the company's Rift VR headset is 'close'. 'We're all hungry for it to happen,' he told the audience. 'We're getting very close. It's months, not years away, but many months.' He also revealed one area holding back the product was the lack of a controller. He said keyboards, mice and gamepads aren't up to the job and neither is gesture-control. 'You want to feel it when you touch a button,' he said. Oculus acquired Carbon Design, the designers of the Xbox 360 controller in March. Iribe also revealed that although the technology is currently similar to ski goggles, future versions will look like sunglasses. Iribe also revealed the company has changed significantly since it was acquired by Facebook in March. Operating as an independent subsidiary, Oculus has grown from 75 people to over 200 employees and now operates a separate R&D division. Asked about the threat of rival VR products, Iribe said his main concern is shoddy implementation. In recent months dozens of firms have revealed low cost headsets using a movbile phone as the display. 'We're a little worried about bigger companies putting out products that aren't ready. 'Disorientation and motion sickness is the elephant in the room. 'We're encouraging big companies not to put out a product before it's ready. 'We want to get it right, we don't want it to be four or five years. We're eager for this to happen.' Earlier this year the Facebook-owned firm has unveiled its Crescent Bay model of the virtual reality technology that is lighter than its predecessor, and now features 360-degree tracking. Reports claimed the consumer version of the device will launch in 2015 and could cost as little as $200 (£122). Iribe says it is too early to say what the 'killer app' is - but said it could even be face to face talking. 'One that resonates with us internally is that this will have a big aspect of gaming, where you feel like you're in the game or movie. 'But when we can have face to face conversations, that's a big change'If in the future you can throw in a pair on sunglasses and have the same conversation we are having, that's really transformative.' The Crescent Bay virtual reality headset (pictured) was unveiled at the Oculus Connect conference in Hollywood at the weekend. It is lighter than its predecessor and features 360-degree tracking, but Oculus VR is yet to release the full list of specifications for the device . MailOnline has been using the latest version of the headset, the $350 (£215) DK2 version aimed at developers wanting to write VR apps. At first we were skeptical - the headset looks bulky, although it is surprisingly light when attached via straps. However, once you are immersed in a virtual world, doubts were quickly forgotten. The technology, still just a developer's version, is breathtakingly good. While the resolution still doesn't give the feeling of quite being in the real world, it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world. The number of demos and games is already growing by the day, and feature everything from virtual rollercoaster rides to being lost in space, all made more immersive with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as your head moves. It's not quite ready for primetime yet, but is almost there - and the Oculus Rift headset finally delivers on the long awaited promise of virtual reality. The 360-degree tracking means the headset will be able to more accurately monitor a wearer's head movements, which in turn will make games more immersive and true-to-life. Elsewhere, the headset has a higher resolution, per eye, than the current second-generation development kit – DK2 - and these displays are powered by Samsung devices. A teardown of the DK2 revealed that the headset uses Samsung Galaxy Note 3 displays, and experts claim the latest generation device will feature screens from the flagship Note 4. By comparison, the DK2 has a resolution of 960 x 1080 per eye, and the Note 4 screens would give the latest model 1280 x 1440 resolution. Aside from these specifications, Oculus VR is yet to release the rest of Crescent Bay's features. 'There are plenty of technical challenges left to solve for the consumer Rift, but Crescent Bay is truly the best virtual reality headset we've ever built,' said Mr Iribe. The price of the Oculus Rift consumer model, which does not have a release date yet, was revealed by Oculus VR co-founder Nate Mitchell. Speaking with Eurogamer, Mr Mitchell said the price could go up to $400 (£240), but that the price range was an estimate. He also cautioned that nothing is set in stone. 'That could slide in either direction depending on scale, pre-orders, the components we end up using, [or] business negotiations,' he said. Previously, Oculus VR said it was aiming to launch the consumer model for around $300 (£185). Developers can currently buy protoype versions of the headset for $350 (£215). Crescent Bay (pictured) has a higher resolution, per eye, than the current second-generation development kit – DK2 - and these displays are powered by the Samsung devices. A consumer model of the headset is expected to launch next year with price estimates ranging from $200 (£122) up to $400 (£240) The firm also revealed earlier this month it has been working with Samsung on a mobile version of the headset, which will go on sale this year, but will not feature the advanced head tracking or high resolution display the Oculus version is expected to have. Facebook purchased the company earlier this year when its $2bn (£1.2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved. It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg. A commercial version is rumoured to launch in 2015. The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, which has already unveiled its own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year.","Oculus VR is yet to release the full list of specifications for the device .

"They say the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach. And it seems that even after a woman has charmed her husband, she just can’t resist feeding him up. A study commissioned by the Men’s Health Forum has shown that getting married can change men’s eating habits and their waistlines. A study commissioned by the Men’s Health Forum has shown that getting married can change men’s eating habits and their waistlines . A team of researchers from Leeds Metropolitan University found that married men are fatter than their single counterparts. This could be because they develop a sweet tooth – with married men treating themselves to more buns, cakes, pastries and fruit pies than single men. And those who have tied the knot were also likely to drink ‘significantly’ more wine, the study found. Scientists were not sure why marriage made such a difference to men’s attitude to their weight, but one suggestion was that they felt they could relax after their wedding day. Another theory was that men who marry a good cook might find they are eating richer food than in the past. Cakes, buns and other treats could also be in easy reach if they have a wife with a sweet tooth doing the shopping. And the study even suggested that some wives deliberately overfeed their husbands, with the aim of making them less attractive to other women. Tam Fry, an obesity expert who has been married for almost 50 years, said: ‘The problem is that men have done all the hard work. ‘They’ve taken the woman out to dinner and made a fuss of her and all that stuff and now it’s payback time. ‘The woman looks after her husband and the man just sits back and gets fat.’ Mr Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, went on to say: ‘I have to think of my own circumstances. My wife cooks for a small army and I have to be very careful how much I eat. The woman wants to please the man. ‘You can get to a man through his stomach – but it’s really up to the man to work out whether he wants to be a slob.’ However despite all the dispiriting news for married men, the results of the study were not all bad. The team found married men ate more fruit and wholemeal bread than single ones. Researchers also discovered that men who were coupled up ate more yoghurt than men who had gone through a divorce, and that married men ate more chocolate than widowers . And, unsurprisingly, those who have left their single days behind them got through fewer fatty kebabs and burgers. Researchers also discovered that men who were coupled up ate more yoghurt than men who had gone through a divorce, and that married men ate more chocolate than widowers. Previous research has found that women also pile on the pounds after getting married. US scientists tracked the lives of 10,000 people, and found that women had less time to exercise once they were married and were more likely to put on weight.","Researchers from Leeds Metropolitan University found married men are fatter than their single counterparts .

"More witnesses in the death of Trayvon Martin have changed their stories about what happened on the night he was shot dead by George Zimmerman in a gated community in Florida. At least four key witnesses have changed their story and more may come forward as the case moves closer to trial, according to the Orlando Sentinel. A report from the paper comes after state prosecutors released about half the evidence they have in their second-degree murder case against Zimmerman, 28. Final picture: As part of the ongoing court preparations, George Zimmerman's team submitted photos last week of Trayvon caught on the convenience store's camera . In his favor: Public opinion has shifted so that now 40 per cent of Americans believe George Zimmerman acted in self defense, which is up from only 15 per cent who believe such in March . The witnesses - who are only identified by numbers - first made statements to the Sanford Police on or close to the night of February 26. Later, around mid-March, they had to repeat their statements to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and state prosecutors. Three of the witnesses altered what they thought had happened. One changed her story completely. Witness two - a young woman who lives in the Retreat at Twin Lakes community, where Trayvon was shot - was interviewed three times and each time her account was different. She did not have her contact lenses in at the time but said she saw two men running and then a fist fight. The second time she said she saw two men standing ten feet apart. When she was interviewed the final time, by an FDLE agent, she said she saw just one person running away and could not tell if it was a man or woman, black or white. Witness six - a man who lived at a home a few feet away from where Trayvon was shot - first told police he saw the teen on top of Zimmerman and said he was raining punches down on him 'mixed martial arts-style'. He also said Zimmerman was yelling for help. Weeks later however, he said, he was not sure who was yelling for help or if Tryavon was punching him or simply pinning him to the ground. The only thing he was sure of was that the teenager was on top. Witness 12 - a young mother from the same community - told police she saw two figures on the ground but was not sure who was on top. But at the end of March she said she was sure it was Zimmerman on top as she recognized his shape and build from seeing him on the TV. Witness 13 - another man who lived close by - did not see the altercation between the pair but gave an account of Zimmerman's demeanor when he spoke to him after he heard the gun shot fire. He said he came out to see the neighborhood watchman with blood on the back of his head and a body next to him. The 28-year-old said Trayvon had been 'beating up on me, so I had to shoot him'. Then he asked him to call his wife to let her know. Weeks later he described Zimmernman's tone as being 'no big deal'. 'It wasn't like, ""I can't believe I shot someone"", but just, ""tell my wife"", like it was nothing,' the witness said. All the witnesses will likely be interviewed again before the trial starts. Surrounding area: In the weeks and months following the February 26 altercation, many neighbors have given their stories as witnesses . Difficult to tell: Some witnesses said that the dark night made it difficult to tell who was straddling whom . Their changes reflect a softening view of Trayvon Martin, likely due to the massive media attention the case has received, and the fact they have become aware of the circumstances around what they saw at the time of the attack. The changing opinions of both the public and the key witnesses in the case confirm that the trial of the teen's killer will be constantly evolving. A new poll says that public opinion is shifting as 40 per cent Americans believe that the unarmed 17-year-old was killed in self defense. That number shows a significant jump up from only 15 per cent of people siding with Zimmerman's version of events when asked in March when the attack sparked a national firestorm. According to the Rasmussen Report released yesterday, only 24 per cent say the fatal incident was murder, denoting a decrease since the last poll when 33 per cent believed that to be the case in March. Regardless, Zimmerman was been charged with second-degree murder and his trial will unfold in the coming months as he waived his right to a speedy trial in an effort to guarantee that his legal team can be fully prepared when it does go to court. Preparations: Both sides are submitting evidence in the coming days as Zimmerman is in hiding . While Zimmerman's lawyers entered in their extensive list of witnesses and evidence last week, the specifics of the witness changes came as a preview of the evidence due to be used by the prosecution. Special prosecutor Angela Corey turned a eight-page document to the Seminole County clerk on Monday which spelled out the changed testimony.","New poll says 40 per cent of Americans think Zimmerman acted in self defense, up from only 15 per cent two months ago .
Comes as four witnesses have changed their story or added details that support Trayvon Martin's side of the story ."
"Newcastle United midfielder Moussa Sissoko has again spoken of his Arsenal ‘dream’ - but it would take an offer of more than £20million to trigger any deal before Monday night’s deadline. The Magpies have made it known that they would only entertain a ‘ridiculous’ approach for their star player, with Arsenal, PSG and Liverpool all interested. But in making that stance public, supporters fear they are courting such a sum. Moussa Sissoko joined Newcastle United from Ligue 1 side Toulouse in 2013 but could leave for a big fee . Sissoko (right) chases down Hull City full back Andrew Robertson during Newcastle's 3-0 win on Saturday . Newcastle caretaker manager John Carver will be keeping his fingers crossed Sissoko does not leave . Head coach John Carver joked that it would take a bid of £50m to land Sissoko, but a figure of less than half that amount is more realistic for a player who only cost £1.5m when he signed from Toulouse two years ago. It is more likely, however, that Sissoko will leave Tyneside in the summer. And the 25-year-old has again spoken of his admiration for Arsenal. The France international is reportedly attracting interest from Paris Saint-Germain . ‘Arsenal made me dream when I was a youngster. Patrick Vieira was my idol. I saw myself in him,’ he said. ‘For now, I'm a Newcastle player and I am happy at the club. I want to play in major competitions and I want to do it with this team.' Newcastle left back Davide Santon is set to return to Inter Milan on loan for the remainder of the season, with a view to a permanent move, while the club look set to have missed out on the signature of Milton Keynes Dons youngster Dele Alli - who is at Tottenham Hotspur for a medical.

"A family of eleven who spent almost £7,000 on a four-star holiday turned up at the airport with their suitcases to find that they had been conned by their travel agent who never booked the trip. Maureen Kay and her family were told that their tickets to Turkey bought from the Turkish Riviera Travel agency in Hull were forgeries when they arrived at the departure hall at Manchester Airport. Despite paying £6,800 for flights and accommodation at the Titanic Beach Lara Hotel near Antalaya, travel agency owner Ellen Harrison, 49, spent the money and failed to make the booking. Stranded: Maureen Kay, left, and ten members of her family arrived at Manchester Airport in October last year having paid almost £7,000 for a trip to Turkey, only to find that travel agent Ellen Harrison, right, hadn't made their booking . She had tried to put the Kays off travelling the day before by telling them that the hotel had cancelled the booking and that there was trouble in Turkey, but her text messages didn't arrive until the party had reached the airport. When confronted by the family, Harrison then tried to blame Flightline for losing the booking in October last year. The family then spent a further £8,700 at the airport to rearrange their holiday. Harrison, who pleaded guilty to a single count of fraud, was given a suspended prison sentence and sentenced to 150 hours community service at Hull Crown Court. The court heard that Mrs Kay had booked holidays through the Turkish Riviera Travel agency before without any problems. But the company had run into financial trouble and while Harrison hoped funds would come in to pay for the Kays holiday, she had spent the money covering other party's trips. Spared jail: Harrison's travel agency had run into financial difficulties and she had spent the Kay's money covering other party's trips . Although Mrs Kay, her three children and their partners, and two grandchildren, were given flight tickets and an accommodation voucher by Harrison. The court heard that Harrison text the family with a guilty conscience the day before they were due to travel, claiming that a bomb had gone off in Turkey and that a terror alert made it unsafe to travel. Harrison, whose brochures boasted that the firm provided ' exceptional levels of customer enjoying clients to enjoy a stress-free holiday in Turkey', also claimed that the hotel had cancelled the flights. After re-booking a holiday to a separate hotel with Thomas Cook at the airport, the family travelled to Turkey using some of Mrs Kay's life savings. When they returned, they confronted Harrison who blamed the Flightline booking service and promised the family a full refund. But her cheque bounced and the family only received £720 before Harrison's business collapsed. Defence barrister Stephen Robinson said: 'She was having financial difficulties in 2012 and she didn’t book the holiday. 'She thought she may be able to pay for it in the future. She admits she strung them along and caused them unnecessary distress by them arriving at the airport. 'She knew the Kays, and didn’t pick them out, it was just they had booked a long way in advance. 'She is now working as an NHS cook and is hoping to pay some money back.' Recorder Anthony Hawks told Harrison: 'This was a mean and unpleasant offence. The fact is this family, including two children turned up at the airport only to find out they were not going. Desired destination: The family had been due to stay at the four-star Titanic Beach Lara Hotel in Turkey . 'It must be every holidaymaker’s worst nightmare. You should be ashamed of yourself. 'Even the day before you were telling them a bomb had gone off and there was some terror alert. 'You have brought disgrace on yourself and lost your business. I have thought about sending you to prison. 'I cannot see how sending you to prison for a short time would be of any assistance to anyone, particularly the Kays.' He ordered she should be given an eight-month suspended prison sentence, complete 150 hours unpaid work and pay £1,000 compensation to the Kays. Duped: The family only realised that their tickets were forgeries when they arrived at Manchester Airport, pictured, with their tickets . He added: 'I would like to be able to order you to repay all the money to the Kay family. I cannot do that because you don’t have the money to do so.' Mrs Kay, 67, a care worker from Hull said after the sentencing: 'Ellen Harrison ruined my holiday and has not expressed any remorse. She is a woman I knew and she betrayed me. 'She thinks she has got away with it. I want her naming and shaming. I also don’t think I will see the money again. 'She is supposed to pay me £40 a month, but she will find a way out of that. 'You cannot imagine the feeling we had when we arrived at Manchester Airport to find our tickets were forgeries. Suspended sentence: A Judge at Hull Crown Court, pictured, decided not to send Harrison to jail . 'The airport staff said that it had never happened before in their memory. I could not talk. 'She literally text us as we walked into the departure hall. The text said: “It’s cancelled. She you tonight.” 'It was so cruel. It was not the money, it is what she did to me and my family. It was to be our first holiday away together and I had sold my house to pay for it. 'It took some thinking, but I decided there was no way we were not going on holiday. It cost me £8,000 from my life savings, but I did not want to let the children down. 'We booked a holiday with Thomas Cook, but I didn’t enjoy it. The kids said they did, but I think they are just saying that.' Her daughter Debbie Kay, 45, said: 'Can you imagine being stood with nine adults and two babies and then finding out your holiday has not been booked? It was totally devastating for all of us.'","Maureen Kay and family were due to fly to turkey from Manchester Airport .

"At the Miss Michigan pageant Friday, a bevy of home-grown beauties charmed the audience with their grace and poise, but it was a special 14-year-old boy who stole everyone's heart. Drew Foster was wheeled onto the stage at the Frauenthal Center for the Performing Arts in Muskegon to be honored by 2008 Miss Michigan Ashlee Baracy. 'He is Mr Michigan,' Baracy, who was acting as Mistress of Ceremonies, said of the teen. Guest of honor: Drew Foster, 14, acknowledges the crowd while sitting next to Mistress of Ceremony Ashlee Baracy during the Children's Miracle Network presentation at the second night of the Miss Michigan Friday .

All smiles: Emily Smith, (face showing) Miss Greater Kalamazoo is congratulated by 2013 Miss Michigan Haley WIlliams after winning the talent category during the opening night of the Miss Michigan Scholarship Pageant competition June 12 . Drew was born with two rare medical conditions: Osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bones disease, and neurocutaneous hypermelanosis - a central nervous system disorder that causes birthmarks all over a patient's body, Mlive.com reported. During the second night of the contest Friday night, Julie Stephens, a coordinator at the Miss Michigan pageant, performed the Rascal Flatts song 'My wish' in Drew's honor with her daughters. Ashlee Baracy later shared a photo on her Facebook page of her posing with a smiling Drew along with 2013 Miss Michigan Haley WIlliam. Drew, pictured left with an elk he has killed, suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bones disease, and neurocutaneous hypermelanosis - a disorder that causes birthmarks all over a patient's body; despite his ailments, the 14-year-old is an avid outdoorsman and hunter . Drew's plight has inspired the creation of the non-profit DREW Foundation which stands for 'Discovering Recreation and Enjoying Wildlife' Drew, a sweet, bespectacled boy with a mop of dirty-blonde hair, has become a favorite on the local pageant circuit. In 2011, Foster, then aged 11, was brought on stage at the Miss America contest in Las Vegas and recognized as a special person who touched many lives. In the summer of 2010, the child, who lives with his parents, Chad and Angela in Flint, Michigan, was also named honorary Mr Bay County. Drew Foster has been treated at the Hurley Medical Center in Flint, which is part of Children's Miracle Network Hospital - one of the partners of the Miss Michigan beauty contest. Drew's plight has inspired the creation of the DREW Foundation, which stands for ‘Discovering Recreation and Enjoying Wildlife.’ Hot wheels: Drew has been gifted an Action Trackchair allowing to move around with greater ease . The non-profit organization’s website explains that when Drew was born, his parents were told that he would not live past the age of three, but he has beaten those odds. Over the past 13 years, he has broken over 50 bones in his body, but Drew stills enjoys the great outdoors and hunting, which he does with a crossbow since he cannot hold a rifle in his fragile hands. The winner of the 2014 Miss Michigan will be selected from 34 contestants Saturday night, receiving a $10,000 scholarship and a ticket to the Miss America pageant, which will be held in September in Atlantic City.","Drew Foster suffers from brittle-bones disease and a central nervous system disorder that causes birthmarks all over his body .

"They were the 18th century equivalent of a glitzy night out at the Chiltern Firehouse, beloved by the great, the good and the royal. But while today's society parties are fuelled by nothing more than alcohol, Georgian 'Pleasure Gardens' were decidedly risqué - to say the least. Now the Georgian love of public fancy dress promenades is the focus of a display at the Museum of London, with beautiful colour plates revealing a glamorous - and seedy - side of 18th century life. Entertaining: The Jubilee Ball  of 1759 was held in front of the house and rotunda at Ranelagh Gardens . Pleasure Gardens were large areas of land made for lavish entertainment, which first became popular following the Restoration in 1660 and remained so until well into the 19th century. Fringed by elaborate colonnades, the elaborate public spaces, most of which were in London, were a place to see and be seen and the location for everything from balls to public breakfasts, fireworks displays and, most infamous of all, masquerade balls. 'The popularity of fancy dress seems to coincide with periods when the structures of society are very rigid, to provide a relief from strict hierarchies,' explains curator Beatrice Behlen. 'But masquerades are also popular in times when society is in flux or our notions of gender are changing. Illicit: Walks like those seen in this 1750 depiction of Ranelagh Gardens were seen as hotbeds of illicit romance . Risque: The costumes worn by revellers, in particularly the female ones, tended to be revealing . Fan: As Prince of Wales, the future George IV adored attending masked balls and masquerades . 'The latter was probably the case in the second half of the eighteenth century, with the rise of the middle classes and their different perception of the role of men and women.' At the balls, revellers, among them the future George IV, would dress up in a variety of revealing outfits and dance the night away - often going home with partners who weren't their spouses. Unsurprisingly, the antics of Pleasure Garden revellers led to outrage in some quarters, with many commentators pointing to disguise as a means of indulging in all kinds of debauchery without being recognised. And they weren't entirely wrong. One of the most scandalous events of the 18th century took place at the Ranelagh May Ball of 1749. Elizabeth Chudleigh (later the Duchess of Kingston), appeared as the tragic Iphigenia of ancient Greek mythology, undressed for sacrifice, in a costume so transparent she appeared almost naked. Chudleigh certainly wasn't the only one. According to Behlen, women often used masquerade balls as a means of dispensing with the restrictive fashions of the day, replacing them with ensembles that were both more comfortable and less concealing. As a result, milkmaid styles with their shorter skirts and low bodices became hugely popular as did sweeping Turkish styles, including harem pants. 'Masquerades allowed trying out different roles but also, on a more prosaic level, gave licence for wearing more revealing clothes,' explains Behlen. 'Popular ‘characters’ were shepherdesses and milkmaids which allowed wearing shorter skirts, revealing some leg. 'Costumes inspired by Turkish dress, involving the use of trousers, were also popular. And apparently some women event went as far as dressing as men.' Worse still, in the moralist's eyes, were the many dark nooks within the gardens, all of which - whether mazes or shaded walks - lent themselves to secret romances and extracurricular liaisons. Particularly notorious was Vauxhall Gardens’ Dark Walk. 'The most experienced mothers have often lost themselves in looking for their daughters,' noted society commentator Tom Brown of the walkway in 1700’ Elaborate: Although in theory open to all classes, balls were very much the preserve of the upper classes . Striking: An entrance ticket for the Vauxhall Jubliee festivities of 1786 (left) and a scene inside the gardens . The gardens were known to be rife with prostitution, while Samuel Pepys mentions in his diaries ‘young gallants misbehaving and insulting the ladies’. Drunken nights fuelled gossip and excitement that was widely reported in newspapers and periodicals. 'The Pleasure Gardens were said to be swarming with prostitutes and while in 1766 ""pickpockets, sharpers, and common prostitutes"" were indeed caught executing ""the respective branches of their trades"", sometimes one wonders whether the talk of loose woman was a marketing ploy by the owner of Vauxhall,' says Behlen. But while the many prostitutes fuelled scandal, what was even worse in society's eyes was the idea of different classes mixing. 'The owners of the Pleasure Gardens were aware of the confusion that masquerade outfits could bring and usually were strict in not allowing any actual masks to be worn,' explains Belen. 'What was most feared was a mingling of the different strata of society and on one occasion one journalist remarked that ""several of the music"", had mixed with the rest of the company - a sign of ""rudeness and impropriety of conduct"".'","Pleasure Gardens became a popular part of London life from 1660 onwards .

"An archaeological site excavated by Lawrence of Arabia more than 100 years ago is set to open as a tourist attraction despite being metres from ISIS territory. The site of biblical Carchemish was once fought over by the likes of the Babylonians and the Egyptians, but now it is the battleground of ISIS, the Assad regime and the Free Syrian Army. The city was lost for centuries but was rediscovered by British scholars in the 19th century and excavated by Lawrence of Arabia shortly before the First World War. Now, just metres from the front line, the historic town on the Turkish-Syrian border is set to open to the public. Battleground: The ISIS flag flies above a building which overlooks the biblical site of Carchemish, excavated by Lawrence of Arabia and now set to become a tourist attraction . Lawrence of Arabia was among the first dig team to excavate the historic site after it was uncovered in the 19th century . Now, one hundred years after T.E. Lawrence left Carchemis, the site is being excavated by a group of Italian archaelogists . The archaeological site lies on Syrian-Turkish border and is in an area under the control of militant group ISIS . The archaeological site lies just 20 metres away from the border, with a 13ft high blast wall to be built to block the view, and the line of fire, to and from Syria. Carchemish, which lies between the modern towns of Karkamis and Jarablus, straddles the border between Turkey and Syria. The Syrian side has been excavated since 2011 but the Turkish side is cut off because of its dangerous location. The old Tel, or hill, in the middle of the town is a Turkish army look-out point and has been a military outpost for 5,000 years. Professor Nicolo Marchetti, the leader of the dig team from Bologna University, told the Telegraph: 'To be frank it's been a front line - over the border 20 metres away we see normal life and we also see these people [ISIS] coming and going. 'We hear the shooting at the front in the distance and in September it was quite close to us - perhaps two kilometres away. But it's still very different from what's going on in Kobane. 'Still, we have had no problem at all. We work in a military area. It is very well protected.' Professor Nicolo Marchetti is leading the dig at the site, which lies just 20 metres from the border with Syria . Prof Marchetti said he hoped the area could be opened up for tourists by next spring - despite it neighbouring ISIS territory . Turkish authorities allowed researchers to access the site in 2011 for the first time in more than 90 years . Almost a century ago, Lawrence of Arabia spent time excavating the historically important site in Turkey. Now his house on the site is being excavated itself . Turkish authorities say tourists will not be put in danger by visiting the site, despite the fact ISIS are just metres away and the border is guarded by 500 Turkish soldiers and heavy artillery . The town, on the border between the two nations, has been fought over by ISIS, Assad's Syrian regime and the Free Syrian Army in recent years . Nearby town Jarablus has been a battleground for the last few years, firstly when it was seized by the Free Syrian Army. Since then it has been bombed by the Syrian air force and overrun by ISIS, who have beheaded people with links to rebel forces. The area is guarded by 500 Turkish soldiers and is covered by artillery. Despite the soon-to-be tourist attraction's nearby dangers, Turkish authorities say visitors have nothing to fear. District governor Yusuf Osman Diktas said he did not expect any danger 'for now'. British George Smith recognised the small town in 1876, but died shortly afterwards. Decades later TE Lawrence, then 23, and an excavation team were given permission to dig. Among the artifacts uncovered at the site is this Roman statue which now lies at the Archaeology Museum in Gaziantep, Turkey . Despite the danger posed by the ISIS fanatics just a few metres away, archaeologists continued their work . Excavated: Among the artifacts recovered from the site is this bath tub and a pair of ancient jugs . The area around the ancient city had been off-limits to archaeologists for more than 90 years until 2011 . The Syrian side has been excavated since 2011 but the Turkish side is cut off because of its dangerous location . Intricate basalt reliefs showing ancient deities were found, some of which are now on display at the British Museum, before the team left after the outbreak of WWI. Lawrence's house on the site is now being excavated and is thought be where he learned Arabic and began his obsession with the Middle East. Underneath the floorboards, the dig team found hundreds of stone inscriptions and small statues, which, fortunately, had not been damaged by soldiers who used the house after Lawrence left. Lawrence's house, once restored, will be the focal point of the site when tourists begin to visit the site in spring next year. A letter from the British Army officer to his mother is one of the relics that will be put on display. Prof Marchetti said: 'When you reflect on the contemporary history here, you see this site is also a powerful symbol.'","Archaeological site 20m from ISIS territory set to become tourist attraction .

"In the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, there exists a commodity that is worth more than gold - virginity. Wealthy men will pay thousands to have sex with an innocent girl and, as a result, 'virgin trafficking' has become big business. But not every girl is trafficked. Many others sell their virginity because they are desperate for money - and then often fall into a life of prostitution. Scroll down for video . Victim: Sukhon, 23, was forced to sell her virginity in order to pay for an operation that saved her father's life . Ordeal: Sukhon recalls her terrible experience to the former glamour model in her latest documentary . Even though many of them do it to financially support their families, many are ostracised by their relatives and by the local community. Now the shocking story of Cambodia's virgin prostitutes is to feature in a new Jodie Marsh documentary which meets some of the victims. Although her own career was built on selling sex as a glamour model, the 35-year-old says she is grateful she never had to do more than sell pictures of her body. 'Girls like Sukhon are forced to sell themselves for money time and time again,' she said. 'I have the choice to abstain from sex and I have realised what a huge privilege that is.' 23-year-old Sukhon lives in Cambodian capital Phnom Penh and now works as a prostitute after being forced to sell her virginity to pay for an operation that saved her ailing father's life. Shocking statistics: Jodie travelled to Camodia where she learnt there are 50-70,000 sex workers 40 percent of them are under age . 'I received the news that my father was ill back home,' she reveals. 'I had nowhere to go so I decided to sell my virginity. It was three years ago when I was 20 and I was paid $3,000 (£1,877) by a Chinese man. 'I was taken to a restaurant first and then a hotel. I was told to undress and take a shower. Afterwards I was told to keep my clothes off so I was covered only by a towel. 'I was shivering and didn't know what to do because I had already agreed to have sex.' Tragically, as a result of what happened, Sukhon says she is no longer close to her family - even though she did it for them. 'I'm in pain because my family keeps their distance. It hurts me but I understand because they didn't ask me to sell my virginity, they didn't want me to do that.' While Sukhon's father, who also appears in the documentary, says he is grateful that his daughter's sacrifice saved his life, he wishes there had been another way. He said after learning his daughter had sold her virginity, he felt 'anger, sadness and sorry as a parent but there was nothing I could do because it had already happened'. 'I love my daughter just like when she was born,' he added. 'I blame the mamasan [female pimp] and the situation that we are in.' Mamasans, or female pimps, are a common sight in Cambodia and care little about the women they exploit. One, who appeared on camera but asked not to be named, revealed that there is nothing that cannot be arranged for paying clients. 'If a client wants to have sex, we'll arrange the girl for them,' she said. 'Also if the client has a special request and they want to sleep with a virgin I will find the girl for them. 'I get a commission from client and girl. Sometimes the girl is very grateful for my hard work so gives me extra money.' Desperate situation: Jodie said more needs to be done to help vulnerable women like Sukhon . She admits that her career does make her feel 'bad' but she does it for the money. 'Sometimes I don't feel good about selling a virgin but I just think about the money,' she explained. 'Sometimes as a mamasan I am hit or tortured by the client if I don't find them a girl. I do have morals and sometimes I feel bad for the girl. 'When I see the client walk away with the girl I think that I have become a very bad person.' Sadly, sex trafficking and prostitution is booming in Cambodia, where an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 sex workers - 40 per cent of whom are under age - ply their trade. One charity which is trying to do something to help the underage victims of sex trafficking is Childsafe, which operates safe houses in Phnom Penh. 'Lots of young girls gather here from Kampot Province and they don't know what the city is like,' explains Sunni, an aid worker at the charity. 'They are an easy target for criminals. You can spot vulnerable people simply by their facial expressions. They might look naive or sad with problems.' But Sunni said working for the charity can be fraught with danger. 'I had a situation with a pimp when I tried to stop him taking a girl,' he recalled. 'The pimp was very angry and he threatened to shoot me. 'I was very fortunate as there was a lot of people from the charity here.' But while Sunni is safe, for Cambodia's thousands of virgin prostitutes, their ordeal goes on.","Virginity is a valuable commodity in Cambodia and other Asian countries .

"It’s the vegetable that kids the length and breadth of the country do their best to avoid on Christmas Day, so they’re bound to approve of sprouts being served up as an alternative power source for tree lights instead of being served up on their dinner plates. One thousand of the raw vegetables have been used by scientists from The Big Bang UK Young Scientists and Engineers Fair to create the unusual battery for the decorations. It is the world’s first Christmas tree to be powered by these vegetables and it’s been placed on London’s Southbank area – a sight that’ll give sprout-haters everywhere a warm glow. Way to glow: The eight-foot Christmas tree is on display on the Southbank in London with the lights powered by 1,000 Brussels sprouts . The grand unveiling ceremony took place on Tuesday morning, with pupils from the City of London Academy flicking the switch. The battery for the eight-foot tree was created using five power cells, each holding 200 sprouts, producing 63 volts from the 1,000 Brussels sprouts. This comes into the 'extra-low voltage' category – like a telephone – and is safe to touch. Switched-on kids: Pupils from City of London Academy turned on the lights . Green energy: The battery was created using five power cells, each holding 200 sprouts . Essentially the battery works like electrolysis. Copper and Zinc electrodes are placed in each Brussels sprout to create a chemical reaction between the electrodes using the acid in the sprout - generating a current which can be stored and used to power the LEDs on the tree. The battery was created using five power cells, each holding 200 sprouts. These in turn produce 63 volts from the 1,000 Brussels sprouts. The power is stored in a capacitor and released through 100 high efficiency LEDs. The Big Bang scientists are able to monitor the voltage on a separate display, which shows how much energy is being produced by the sprouts. The battery will last for as long as the sprouts stay fresh. Copper and Zinc electrodes are placed in each Brussels sprout to create a chemical reaction between the electrodes, generating a current which can be stored and used to power the LEDs on the tree.

The Big Bang scientists are able to monitor the voltage on a separate display, which shows how much energy is being produced by the sprouts. Sean Miles, Director of Prototyping at Windsor-based Designworks, which made the installation, explained that how long the battery lasts depends on how long the sprouts stay fresh. He said: 'They will keep generating a current for as long as the vegetables stay fresh, and not decomposed. As long as they're fresh they will keep providing the electrolytes for the chemical reaction that generates the current.' The sprouts powering this tree should last a month, but more can always be added if it runs out of juice. In theory, he explained, any fruit or vegetable could be used to power the lights, but sprouts are actually the least efficient. He added: 'Sprouts are probably the worst vegetables to use, which makes the feat even more amazing. The more moist and fluid, the better they are at conducting electricity.' Paul Jackson, the CEO of Engineering UK, which runs The Big Bang UK Young Scientists & Engineers Fair, said: ‘We want young people to think about STEM subjects in an interesting way and are always looking for different ways to do that. 'It being the festive time of year – and kids’ dislike of sprouts being well documented – using them to create a battery seemed like a unique way to achieve that aim. ‘Every year thousands of pupils and teachers attend the Fair, which exists to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. 'We want to extend the buzz of the Fair further and wider, so that even those who can’t attend are encouraged to consider careers in science, technology, engineering and maths.’","The eight-foot tree is on Southbank in London and was lit up on Tuesday .

"The prison population could swell by 15 per cent by 2020 as jails struggle to cope with a surge in violent and sexual offenders. The Ministry of Justice today predicted the number of prisoners in England and Wales will rise every year until the end of the decade, despite predicting a fall just 12 months ago. Labour branded the u-turn a sign of 'utter incompetence' but Tory minister Chris Grayling said it was proof that on his watch 'criminals are more likely to go prison and go there for longer'. Scroll down for video . New forecasts from the Ministry of Justice show they now expect the number of prisoners in England and Wales will rise every year until the end of the decade, despite predicting a fall in the 2013 forecast . New projections of the prison population show that on the 'Central Scenario' of what is most likely to happen, the numbers behind bars will rise from 85,925 now to 90,200 in June 2020. However, under 'Scenario 2' which includes the possibility of more criminals being jailed and judges handing down longer sentences, the prison population could hit 98,900 by 2020 - a 15 per cent increase. When the same forecasts were published last year, the Ministry of Justice expected the prison population to fall from 83,400 to 81,000 by 2019. It means thousands more prison places will be needed, because the current capacity is only 88,015. Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'Today's data exposes the utter incompetence of David Cameron's Government. 'It is embarrassing that they are having to throw in the bin previous projections due to a prisons crisis of their own making. It is humiliating for the Government but will be costly to taxpayers. 'What this latest revelation shows is that Chris Grayling has lost control of the prison system. Not only are prisons more overcrowded and violent, with less rehabilitation taking place, but they are storing up monumental problems at huge expense for the future because of their incompetence.' Officials say the sharp change in direction comes after a rise in recent months in the number of people being handed custodial sentences. 'Despite the fact that overall crime is falling there has been an increase in recorded crime for certain offence types,' the MoJ said. In particular, in the wake of high profile cases of sex abuse including Jimmy Savile, prosecutions for sexual offences are the highest in the decade. The number of cases increased by 19 per cent in the 12 months ending June 2014. Among celebrities jailed in recent months are broadcaster Stuart Hall, who is serving a total of five years in prison for sex offences, and entertainer Rolf Harris, who was handed a sentence of five years and nine months in July this year. Tory Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the rising forecasts were proof that on his watch 'criminals are more likely to go prison and go there for longer' Celebrities serving prison sentences for sex offences include Stuart Hall (left) and Rolf Harris (right) Sex offenders are also being jailed for longer, with average sentences increasing by 2.4 months to almost six years when compared to 2013. Cases of violence against the person have also risen, leading to more attackers being imprisoned. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'Some people aren't in favour of sending offenders to prison. I'm not one of them, and I think the public will be reassured by the fact that under this Government criminals are more likely to go prison and go there for longer. 'We will always have enough places for those sent to us by the courts. By 2015 this Government will have increased the adult male prison capacity. We will have many more places than we inherited from the previous Government. 'I remain committed to modernising the prison estate so that it delivers best value for hardworking taxpayers.' The projections published today do not take into account any new laws which might be passed by future governments after the next election, which means they 'become less certain over time'.","Numbers behind bars will rise from 85,925 now to 90,200 in June 2020 .

"Britain and Germany are on a collision course as the row over the future of the eurozone and the UK's EU membership intensified. Chancellor George Osborne has given the biggest hint yet there may be a referendum, and to her clear anger, David Cameron told Angela Merkel last night Britain will not join her proposed European superstate. During yesterday's Berlin crisis talks the Prime Minister openly rejected the German chancellor's plan to save the eurozone from oblivion by forming a single Euro-country, calling the idea 'nonsense'. But in return Mr Cameron was publicly mocked by Mrs Merkel for being 'impatient' and telling her to put German cash behind an ‘immediate’ rescue plan for the . euro or start planning for the break-up of the single currency. Row: David Cameron and Angela Merkel have got involved in a war of words over the future of the eurozone as they met in Berlin yesterday . In a clear snub to the PM she said last night: 'It is human to think the euro crisis could be solved in one fell swoop - but I don't think this would work. 'The euro crisis developed over ten years and it is going to take several years before we can repair the system and make it viable again. With everybody getting so impatient here it is a good job that I am one of the people staying patient.' Mr Cameron has repeatedly clashed with the German chancellor on the future of Europe as she outlined plans for what she called ‘more Europe’ - a euro-superstate in all but name. They were discussing the crisis that has left Spanish banks teetering on the edge of collapse and Greece bankrupt, but it appears the two powers are still far apart on a solution. Britain is backing European Commission plans for a common ‘banking union’ across the eurozone but Mr Cameron has demanded ‘safeguards’ for Britain and pledged that no British money would be spent on propping up these institutions. Warm greeting: David Cameron met his German counterpart Angela Merkel with a warm kiss but their talks appear to have left them far apart . Sit down: Mrs Merkel wants a European superstate but Mr Cameron has called the idea 'nonsense' Making the point: The pair have clear views and although they both want to save the eurozone both appear to be suspicious of their own country's plans . He even threatened to use the veto to ensure no UK taxpayers' money is used to foot the bill. ‘I can sense why some eurozone countries want to look at elements of banking union. But because we are not in the single currency, we won’t take part in profound elements of that banking union,' he said. ‘I wouldn’t ask British taxpayers to stand behind the Greek or Spanish deposits. It’s not our currency, so it would be inappropriate to do that. ‘I will make sure that Britain’s interests, particularly in the single market and the operation of fairness in the single market, are protected. That is the key for Britain.’ However, Mrs Merkel has demanded full ‘political union’ in the eurozone and said Germany would not be stopped by countries such as Britain dragging their feet. Stage-managed stroll: The trio of Norwegian PM Jens Stoltenberg, Angela Merkel and David Cameron come over all Reservoir Dogs on the roof of the Kanzeleramt yesterday . Posing for the cameras: The trio look awkward ahead of crucial talks . ‘We need more Europe, a budget union and we need a political union first and foremost,’ she said. ‘We must, step by step, cede responsibilities to Europe. We must not remain immobile because one country or another does not want to follow yet.’ Before their talks, Mr Cameron and . Mrs Merkel answered questions from students at a town hall event at the . Federal Chancellery in Berlin. Mr . Cameron once again voiced his strong opposition to a Europe-wide . financial transactions tax, which he said would simply drive jobs and . growth away from the continent. Britain's . financial services industry was already 'making a proper contribution' to helping get the national deficit under control, through taxes such as . the banking levy, the Prime Minister said. But . he recognised that the mistakes made by banks in the run-up to the . crash of 2008/09 had fuelled the anger seen in the movement to occupy . areas of the City of London with tent cities. 'I . think a lot of the anger was with irresponsibility in the banking . industry and the financial industry and I think people were right to be . angry because banks had made bad decisions and had to be bailed out by . the taxpayer, and many of the taxpayers were earning much, much less . than the people who made the bad decisions in the banks,' he added. 'People were angry about that. But anger is not a policy. 'We need to work out what do we do, how do we regulate these organisations properly. 'We think we have responded properly to the anger.' Meanwhile George Osborne yesterday gave the Government’s strongest hint yet that a referendum is likely on Britain’s place in Europe – but stopped short of promising one. Poll: George Osborne is the first cabinet member to hint at an EU referendum but would not promise one . The Chancellor became the first senior member of the Cabinet to suggest that a nationwide vote would be necessary to redraw the UK’s relationship with Brussels if the euro crisis leads to greater integration between eurozone nations. Mr Osborne pointedly referred to the Government’s new law that would trigger a referendum if powers are passed to the EU as ‘one of the most significant things this Government has done’. Crucially, he suggested that the new Europe likely to emerge from the wreckage of the single currency will indeed mean powers passing to Brussels. So far ministers from David Cameron down have stressed that a referendum is not necessary because changes that affect only the eurozone do not involve powers being ceded to Brussels from the UK. But Mr Osborne suggested the fundamental change in the nature of the EU, with eurozone countries effectively merging their fiscal policies and potentially their bank deposits, is such a fundamental change that the British public should have their say. ‘A reshaped relationship with Europe would imply, would involve, a transfer of  sovereignty or powers to Brussels,’ he said. ‘We have a very clear safeguard in the system now, thanks to this government, which is, if there is any transfer of power from this country . . . transfer of competence or transfer of sovereignty from this country to the European Union . . . then there will be a referendum.’ And calls for a straight in-out poll are growing from the Right and now the Left. Former Labour Foreign Secretary has said Britain has the perfect opportunity to break from the 'shackles' imposed by Brussels as members like Germany close ranks to form a 'single country called Europe'. The electorate must be asked two simple questions, would the UK be better off leaving the EU, or staying and joining the euro, he said. 'A referendum on the future of Europe is inevitable at some point between 2013 and 2016 at the latest,' he wrote in The Times. Britain's Foreign Secretary from 1977-79 said the UK would be better off cutting links with Brussels to join a wider single market to include non-EU members like Turkey and Iceland, which he calls the 'European Community'. 'This has to happen because Britain's vision for an EU of no further integration and Germany's wish for near-complete integration are incompatible.'","Merkel mocks PM by calling him 'impatient' for wanting a quick resolution to the eurozone crisis .

"These are the intimate pictures that show John Edwards and his mistress Rielle Hunter are still very much involved. The pair was spotted playing happy families at a beach house on Figure Eight Island, North Carolina over the weekend - which no doubt came as a welcome break following Edwards's corruption trial and ahead of the release of Hunter's lurid tell-all book. The disgraced former presidential candidate and his mistress were seen relaxing with glasses of wine on the balcony of their $4,000-a-week beach house and laughing with their four-year-old daughter Quinn - and looked the happiest they have been in months. Happy families: John Edwards, his mistress Rielle Hunter and their four-year-old daughter Quinn are pictured enjoying a weekend away at a beach house in North Carolina . They appeared oblivious to the storm . Hunter's memoir has created after it gave explicit details of their . affair and made a savage attack on his late wife Elizabeth. The trio shared jokes as they paddled in the sea and relaxed on the beach house balcony. Hunter, 48, looked at ease in a white tankini as she held her daughter's hand and strolled down to the waves for a swim. Edwards, . 59, wearing light blue shorts and a navy polo shirt, looked a world away . from the broken man at his corruption trial as he laughed with the daughter he referred to as 'precious' in his speech following his acquittal. With daughter Quinn, they looked very much a family, despite Hunter's own admission she is uncertain of the future of her relationship with Edwards. 'I really have no idea what will happen with us,' she wrote in her memoir. 'The jury is still out. But I can honestly say that the ending is of no concern to me anymore. The love is here. And as sappy as it may sound, I love living in love.' But the images show Hunter can be certain of one thing: Edwards's devotion to his youngest daughter. Photos of the father and daughter laughing and playing on the beach come in stark contrast with Edwards's one-time claims that the girl was not his. Taking it easy: The trio also headed to the beach, where Hunter and Edwards took it in turns to watch over Quinn . Welcome break: The couple laughed together on the holiday, which came following Edwards's corruption trial. Right, Hunter holds Quinn outside the beach house . Picture of normality: Hunter, who carried out an affair with Edwards as he was married to his cancer-stricken wife, joins Quinn and Edwards on the balcony . Getting some rest: As Edwards and Quinn giggled on the balcony of their $4,000-a-week beach house, Rielle took a short nap . But after Edwards, who was hauled to . court on charges he had used campaign funds to cover up his affair with . Rielle, was found not guilty on one count of corruption, he spoke about his . love for all of his children, including the four-year-old love child. Despite having publicly denied for two . years that he was her father, he said: 'My precious Quinn, who I love . more than any of you can ever imagine, who I am so close to, so, so . grateful for.' The father and daughter were seen playing on the sand on Sunday close to where they were staying. Later they held hands when they went to pick up groceries with her mother Rielle, who was also at the house. The disgraced senator has only ever been pictured with Quinn once before when she was a baby in 2008. The photos, published in the National Enquirer, broke the news of the scandalous affair which Edwards had been keeping secret from his wife Elizabeth who was dying of cancer. Edwards had four other children with Elizabeth - Wade, who died in 1996, Cate, Emma-Claire and Jack. The trip also comes as excerpts from Hunter's tell-all memoir, due out . June 26, are slowly being leaked to the public. One chapter describes the first time she slept . with John Edwards as the 'most extraordinary night of her life'. 'Loved up': Pictures, showing Edwards kissing Rielle on the cheek as they leave the beach, indicate the pair are still very much involved . All smiles: The couple appeared at ease as they spent the weekend at Figure Eight Island with their four-year-old daughter Quinn . Daddy's girl: Quinn was seen out with her dad John Edwards, whose affair with Rielle Hunter ruined his political career . Helping hand: Rielle, who first met John Edwards in February 2006, joins him and Quinn as they leave the beach . Household chores: Hunter struggles with blankets as the trio arrives at the beach house on Figure Eight Island, North Carolina . The couple met in February 2006 at the Regency Hotel in New York City. Hours after Hunter approached the former North Carolina senator, he . called her up to his hotel room for a night of 'surrender' and 'zero . sleep'. 'The connection I felt when I walked . in the door had only grown and the amount of energy between us was huge . and unstoppable,' Hunter writes in the book, according to an excerpt obtained by Radar Online. 'Then a moment came while we were . talking when something in my heart clicked and I surrendered. I took off . my teacher hat, let go of all my resistance to him and let him lead. And lead he did. He led me toward the most extraordinary night of my . life. There was a lot of talk, a lot of laughter and zero sleep.' But Hunter says she didn't give in . easily to sleeping with a married man - it took Edwards telling her a . story about having three other mistresses to get her into bed that first . night they met. 'He told me that he had an entire . hidden life that had gone on for decades and that he was currently . involved with three different women. One lived in Los Angeles, one in . Florida, and one in Chicago,' Hunter writes, according to Radar Online. 'Clearly, this behavior of his was not . going to change overnight... I also told him that if I was going to . help him, he couldn't lie to me. He needed to have one person in his . life that was safe for him. He said that wasn't a problem, and when he . said that, I felt a wave of total relief roll off of him. The body that ruined a political career: Rielle, 48, looks svelte in a white tankini as she walks with Quinn along the beach . Baring all: In her memoir, out next week, Hunter says the first time she slept with Edwards was the 'most extraordinary night of her life' Forgetting their troubles: Hunter watched over her daughter as she played in the sand near their rented beach house . The trio left the beach together, clearly relaxed with one another. Rielle donned casual Crocs shoes while Edwards' t-shirt revealed a slight paunch . 'He needed this . safe place. Somewhere in the midst of our talk, long after I realized . how far off the rails his marriage was, and for how long it had been . that way, something happened between us.' She soon joined his campaign, and despite a lack of film-making experience, the politician arranged a $250,000 contract for her to make a series of behind-the-scenes documentaries from the campaign trail. Hunter also attacks Edwards's wife Elizabeth, who died in December 2010 of . breast cancer, calling her 'crazy,' 'venomous' and a 'witch on wheels.' She says her abusive behavior toward John Edwards drove him into the . arms of other women. Edwards seemed relaxed and right at home on the weekend getaway with his youngest child as he sipped a drink in the ocean breeze . The trio arrived at the beach house together along with Quinn, who was bedecked in hearts . Young Quinn beamed up at her father as he unloaded the trunk, including a bottle of white wine . Even though it appeared the family weekend included a trip to a toy shop for some new stuffed animals, little Quinn looked less than happy on one trip from the house . Other accounts of the 2008 . presidential campaign, including 'Game Change' by journalists John . Heilemann and Mark Halperin back up Hunter's portrait of Elizabeth . Edwards as controlling and potentially abusive. When Hunter fell pregnant, Edwards had a . trusted aide, Andrew Young, claim paternity of Quinn in an effort to stave . off political disaster. n her book, Hunter lambasts Young for his role in covering up the affair. She says it was Young's idea for Edwards and . Hunter and lie and say Hunter's baby belonged to him and not the . presidential candidate, a bizarre fiction she later bitterly regretted. Hunter repeated the lie in an interview . with the National Enquirer and Edwards, famously, told ABC News during . an August 2008 broadcast that the baby was not his. Fatherly love: After his acquittal last month, Edwards called his daughter 'precious' - even though he publicly denied she was his for two years . Love child: Quinn is Edwards's fifth child. He had four with his ex-wife Elizabeth, who died from cancer in December 2010 . Day out: Edwards, who asked his aide to pretend to be Quinn's father, is seen walking from the beach after the day out . As the arrangement became farcical Hunter actually lived with the Youngs and their small children as she pretended . to play happy families with them. Edwards didn't publicly . acknowledge his love child until 2010, when she was nearly two. The memoir is not the first time this year that details of the affair have been told to the public. Intimate details were revealed during Edwards's trial, which culminated with his acquittal on one count of accepting illegal campaign contributions on May 31. The judge declared a mistrial on five other felony counts. Federal prosecutors said earlier this month that they would not retry Edwards, and the charges against him were dropped. Prosecutors had accused Edwards of masterminding a scheme to use about $1 million in secret payments from two wealthy political donors to hide his pregnant mistress as he sought the White House in 2008.

"Three panhandlers were arrested Wednesday for stabbing a woman to death on Hollywood's star-lined 'Walk of Fame' Tuesday night. Christine Calderon, 23, took pictures of the homeless men before she was stabbed once in the torso, according to KTLA. Police found Calderon bleeding in front of the American Eagle Outfitters around 8.30pm. Witnesses said bystanders tried to stop the bleeding. Attacked by strangers: Christine Darlene Calderon, pictured with her nephew Mahlik, was stabbed to death after taking a photo of panhandlers in Hollywood . Tragic loss: Miss Calderon was walking home from work with a male friend when she was fatally stabbed . Investigation: Police arrested three suspects in the fatal stabbing of  Calderon who was murdered on Hollywood's 'Walk of Fame' Police said Christine Calderon died in front of an American Eagle Outfitters near Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue in Los Angeles . 'The girl was just laying on the ground with blood everywhere,' Monta Cobbin, an employee of the American Eagle store, told NBC. 'Everyone was trying to help her stop the blood.' 'She was wearing jeans and I think it was a white tank top and it was covered in blood,' said a street vendor who did not want to be identified. Calderon, of Lynwood, California, was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center but died during surgery around 11.40pm. Homicide detectives said Calderon was walking along Hollywood Boulevard with a male co-worker when she stopped to take a picture of a cardboard sign one of the men was holding, according to the Los Angeles Times. She had been amused by the rude words and smiley face on the sign. Distraught: Yolonde Tassin, Miss Calderon's mother, said she feared for the worst when her daughter stopped texting her back . Young life cut short: The 23-year-old was hoping to become an engineer, her devastated mother said today . Search: Police found the suspects, believed to be homeless transients, near where the stabbing occurred . The men wanted Calderon to pay $1 for the picture, but she refused, igniting a dispute that ended in Miss Calderon's life. One of the men jumped on Calderon, pushing her to the ground, as her co-worker was pinned against a wall, according to the Times. Miss Calderon was bleeding as she ran away. The suspects were identified at the scene around midnight using photographs Calderon and her friend took. The men, who are believed to be homeless, were found near the scene by homicide detectives. Police say the men are all white and in their late twenties and early thirties. Miss Calderon's mother Yolonde Tassin told the Times she became worried about her daughter when she stopped texting her back on Tuesday night. She knew Calderon was dead when detectives showed up at her home the next day. 'I said, ""My daughter's dead isn't she?""' Ms Tassin said. 'And he gave me a slight nod.' The grief-stricken mother said that in the last few years, her daughter had been working to make her life better, had given up alcohol and drugs and was studying to become an engineer. She told the Times: 'She didn't want to waste years. She wanted to get in there and do it right.' Stars: Roughly 10 million visitors from around the world come to see Hollywood's 'Walk of Fame' every year . Police cautioned others to be careful when approaching anyone on the street. 'Just be aware of your surroundings and be careful. Generally, in my experience as a law enforcement officer, people, transients don’t like their pictures being taken,' LAPD Officer Cleon Joseph said. 'I'm not saying that’s a cause or reason for anything, but you just at the end of the day need to be careful,' Joseph added. The area where Calderon was killed is usually packed with tourists, attracting beggars and costumed street performers hoping to cash-in on their ignorance and demanding money for posed pictures. Calderon's family told the Times she hung out in the area with her friends. Police patrols along the street were beefed up after the fatal incident. Witnesses reported seeing armed officers on rooftops on Wednesday night.","Christine Calderon , 23, was stabbed in the stomach on Tuesday night .

"The city of Phoenix is facing a possible lawsuit after telling a woman she couldn't pass out free bottled water to people in Arizona's 112-degree heat. Dana Crow-Smith said she and a religious group were offering the water at a downtown festival in July as a kind gesture and to offer conversation on their Christian faith when told they were violating a city code. 'It was really hot and yeah we wanted to show God's love and a small act of kindness is a great way to do that without shoving it down someone's throat,' she told ABC 15. Scroll down for video . Helping out: Dana Crow-Smith said she was offering free bottled water at a festival in Phoenix, Arizona as both a kind gesture and way to offer conversation on Christianity . A city worker told her she was operating without having a permit for the water's distribution she claims and told her she would need to stop immediately. Non-profit civil liberties organization The Rutherford Institute has since offered to represent Ms Crow-Smith against the city. They claim her First Amendment rights were violated and her claimed need of a permit was unjustified under the city's code itself. 'In fact, the Phoenix's City Code prohibits only ""vending"" on City sidewalks without a license agreement,’ the institute wrote in a letter to the city earlier this month. Violation: Ms Crow-Smith was passing out bottles like this one shown when told the gesture was in violation of a city code with her not having a permit . 'Having read a Bible passage referencing . the importance of small acts of kindness such as offering water to the . thirsty, Ms Crow-Smith was further moved to offer cold bottles of water . to people at the Festival who were braving the desert's scorching . 112-degree heat,' the institute wrote. 'I don't even think it's about religious . beliefs, I think anybody should be able to give away water, on the side . walk to anybody. It's hot, and it's a nice thing to do,' Ms Crow-Smith . said. The Rutherford Institute has since notified the city that they will file a lawsuit unless an apology is issued, they agree to train city workers on First Amendment rights and assure to never interfere with her distribution of water again. 'It is beyond comprehension that local government officials would interfere with citizens performing such a basic act of charity as giving water to the thirty in your city,' the institute wrote.

"Once a fit and sporty schoolgirl with a talent for dancing, Loredana Verta’s weight plummeted to less than four stone as she was gripped by anorexia. After battling the eating disorder for more than three years, her vital organs began to shut down. Eventually she contracted liver disease and died from a heart attack aged 19. During her tragic descent the aspiring make-up artist kept a diary which  lays bare her self-loathing and weight obsession in page after page of  harrowing entries. Scroll down for video . Loredana Verta, pictured left and right, died at the age of 19 after a three-year battle with anorexia. At the height of her illness the teenager's weight plummeted to four stone . Five years after Loredana's death from a sudden heart attack in 2009, her mother Anna, 55, finally built up the courage to open her daughter's diaries this year. Now she is releasing them to help others . Loredana, right, with her siblings Gabriella and Vittorio, at the height of her illness when her weight plummeted to four stone . Now, five years after Loredana’s . death, her mother Anna, a teacher, is releasing the diaries she could . only bring herself to read for the first time this year, with the aim of . raising awareness of how deadly anorexia can be. Mrs . Verta said yesterday: ‘At the time I couldn’t understand how she’d lost . control of her own body – why she couldn’t get better, despite all our . worries and fears for her. ‘But . now, looking through Lorry’s eyes, I finally understand her battle. I . want other sufferers to read her diary and recognise themselves in it, . and know just how deadly anorexia really is.’ One entry in the diary . reads: ‘Lord, I’ve said it. I NEED HELP. I’m scared I really am. I don’t . even have the strength to cry. I HATE ME AND MY LIFE. Nothing is going . right for me. I just wish it would.' Loredana (right) at the start of 2007 when she weighed just under 8st . Loredana . had two sisters – Natalina, 28, and Gabriella, 23, as well as a brother . Vittorio, 19. Her battle against illness began when she was 16, shortly . after she joined a dance school. According . to her mother, ballet was Loredana’s passion. But Mrs Verta, 55, of . Hendon, north-west London, said: ‘One day she came home extremely . anxious. She said the other girls in class were so much thinner than . her. ‘She was already slim . and pretty. She loved living and enjoyed meals with the family, and . there was nothing wrong with the way she looked. ‘I . insisted she was beautiful the way  she was, but she just shook her . head. All girls have confidence issues at some point, but I hoped Lorry . would see sense eventually.’ Loredana began eating tiny portions at mealtimes and tried to conceal the fact her weight was dropping dangerously low. 'I hate me and my life,' Loredana wrote in her diary, revealing her constant battle as anorexia consumed her every thought . Loredana's innermost thoughts show pleas to be thin, and heart-breaking insights into her mind, ravaged by the illness . 'I can't do this anymore, I hate my body,' the teenager wrote consumed and tormented by anorexia . 'Mum is so . lovely. I love her. She is trying so hard with me, but I’m pushing her . away because I don’t want to gain weight. I need to lose weight - not . gain it. I just want to be thin.' 'I don’t know how to eat. I don’t know anything. All I want is to be and look boney thin. HELP ME.' 'I can’t do this anymore. I hate my life. I hate my body.' 'I don't feel good, I feel so fat. I get so angry when I think back to when I lost all the weight. I felt so good.' 'I feel so fat, please let me be THIN. I hate my life.I don't want to be fat, please let me be THIN.' 'Why do I have to be fat?' 'I feel crap and I really hate my life, I want to be THIN.' 'There is hardly anyone here, the day is dragging. I look so fat, I've gained so much I can feel it and I look it. I want to DIE.' 'Plz Lord I've said it, I need help, I'm scared. I really am. I don't even have the strength to cry.I HATE ME AND MY LIFE. I just want to be happy and thin. Nothing is going right for me, I just wish it would.' Mrs Verta said: ‘We’d always been close, but we started arguing every day. ‘I . tried my best to make her eat by watching her carefully and trying to . get her to finish her meals, but nothing we did or said worked.’ Loredana . wrote in the diary: ‘Mum is so lovely. I love her. She is trying so . hard with me, but I’m pushing her away because I don’t want to gain . weight. I need to lose weight – not gain it. I just want to be thin.’ In 2005, Loredana was admitted to a specialist treatment centre, weighing less than  four stone. Mrs . Verta said: ‘Even though she was so frail, she was terrified of going . into hospital because she thought she  would ‘‘get fat’’.’ After . a six-month stay, her weight crept up to eight stone. But the diaries . she kept during that time reveal a young woman facing daily . consultations, medical tests and regulated mealtimes who was all the . while tormented by deep anxiety over food and body image.

After intensive treatment, Loredana, pictured with her mother, did recover her weight to around eight stone, but a chest infection, which caused her to lose weight, sparked a relapse . ‘I struggled to comprehend why her desire to be thin had taken over her life in such a cruel way. I cried every day.’ It . was only this year that  Mrs Verta found the courage to open the diary . as a way of  gaining understanding about Loredana’s illness. ‘Anorexia occupied her every thought – her entire being,’ Mrs Verta said. ‘I was devastated to read how she felt as if she hated her life and her body. ‘Lorry . thought she could live with the condition – that as long as she was . thin, she would be OK.

"Michael Wilson, 31, (pictured outside court) took his 75-year-old grandmother Maureen's debit card and stole £9,537 during a number of cash withdrawals . A man who stole nearly £10,000 from his disabled grandmother to fund his cocaine habit has walked free from court despite his relative insisting he 'deserved to go to prison'. Michael Wilson, 31, took his 75-year-old grandmother Maureen's debit card after moving into her home in Nelson, Lancashire, when her husband Arnold, 74, was admitted to a care home. The former aircraft engineer made a string of withdrawals from various cashpoints after correctly guessing her pin number and blew her savings on his £1,000-a-week cocaine habit. The money had been put aside to pay for Arnold's £110-a-week care home fees. Burnley Crown Court heard how Mrs Wilson only found out about her grandson's habits after she tried to use her debit card while out shopping and was told it had been refused because she was overdrawn. She said it then emerged he had lost his job but had continued to pretend to go to work. He admitted theft at court on Friday and was handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for a year. He was also ordered to carry out 240 hours worth of unpaid work, take part in a six month drugs programme and comply with an 8pm to 7am curfew. However, Mrs Wilson said she was disappointed with the sentence imposed by the judge and said he should've gone to prison. She said: 'I would like to have seen him gone to prison, I think he deserves it. 'He could be so nice and used to dote on me. It's frightening enough when it's a stranger who robs you but when it's your own relation. 'He has ruined his life. He was a really good looking lad and always very smart. He has been silly, stupid. I have lost a lot of money. 'I haven't seen him since. He has definitely brought shame on the family but I think they are more annoyed than ashamed - annoyed that he could do something like that. 'How did he think I was going to manage in the future - if I go into a home, the house is going to have to go and everything else. He just didn't think about me at all. He was interested in getting the money for drugs. 'It's a disaster. He may say he has remorse but I don't believe him. I can't ever forgive him - there's no chance.' Wilson had been living with his grandmother for around 12 months after she was left debilitated by a stroke and unable to care for her husband of 53 years who worked as a Rolls Royce engineer. Mrs Wilson added: 'I needed someone to look after me and he looked after me well. 'He was a kind lad and he was really good, he cooked tea and he would stay. But unbeknown to me he was taking my card and putting it back in my handbag after using it at the bank. 'I was none-the-wiser and the possibility my own grandson could steal from me was the last thing on my mind.' Mrs Wilson said she believed the missing money from her account was a mistake at first, before contacting the bank after realising her debit card had disappeared. Wilson was spared jail after admitting theft at Burnley Crown Court (pictured) despite his grandmother saying he should go to prison because he 'deserves to'. He was handed a suspended sentence and a daily curfew . Inquiries revealed £9,537 was taken from her account in total. In court, prosecutor Emma Kehoe said: 'It became apparent that the defendant, might have had something to do with what happened. 'Mrs Wilson contacted the building society and got a mini statement. It became apparent there had been a lot of transactions, totalling £9,537, which she just couldn't account for. 'The defendant immediately accepted it was completely and utterly down to him and the family decided the police had to become involved because of the amount that had been taken.' In mitigation for Wilson, who has served two months behind bars while on remand, defence counsel Robert Elias said: 'I have to acknowledge the sense of betrayal of a family member going behind your back and emptying your bank account. 'She probably would have given him money if he had had the courage to ask.' Mr Elias said at the time, Wilson was living 'something of a Walter Mitty existence' and added: 'He was leaving the house, pretending to go to work and kidding himself, as he couldn't accept or come to terms with his position. 'That bubble of self-deception, as well as deceiving others, can't go on for very long. He has had a wake-up call. 'There's really no useful interest in incarcerating him any further. He has been punished by the wake-up call of incarceration for his own welfare.' Passing sentence, the judge, Mr Recorder Barrie Searle, said: 'This was a serious breach of trust. It was a betrayal. It was unpleasant. 'Clearly, you did not have permission to use that bank card in the way that you did. 'A lady of these years is probably not used to this sort of treatment when she goes into a shop and I can imagine the worry she must have suffered at that age. 'Although I have not seen a victim impact statement, I am using my common sense as to how she must have felt. 'I don't know whether the money will be recovered by her and whether that will put her mind at rest, but the fact is the damage has been done. 'There are many who say, to use a cliché, that the clang of the prison gates would have a real effect on somebody like you. It has been a very chastening experience and it has been a wake-up call. 'I take the view that you have had your punishment because you went to custody for the first time in your life and it has had an impact upon you.'","Michael Wilson stole from 75-year-old grandmother to fund cocaine habit .

"Carina Saunders, 19, was dumped in a duffel bag . Second man arrested in connection with murder . A teenager was tortured and cut up in front of another woman so she would be frightened into cooperating with a human trafficking ring, police said. Jimmy Lee Massey, 33, was arrested over the first-degree murder of Carina Saunders, 19, whose dismembered body was found stuffed in a duffel bag. The young woman had been beheaded and dumped on October 13 behind a grocery store. A 20-year-old woman came forward as a witness to say she had been kidnapped by Massey and forced to watch Miss Saunders painful death in Bethany, Oklahoma. Her identity has not been released because of concerns for her safety. Scroll down for video . Tortured: Carina Saunders, 19, was known to have run with a rough crowd who used drugs but the choice to kill her was 'random', said police . Brutal: Jimmy Lee Massey (left) and Francisco Gomez have been arrested over the torture and dismemberment of 19-year-old Carina Saunders in Bethany, Oklahoma . Miss Saunders was known to use drugs but not thought to be involved in criminal activity. The choice of her was 'random', according to police. Massey was already being held in the . Oklahoma County jail on drug charges and he remains held without bond. Court documents do not list an attorney for him, Police Chief Phil Cole said. A second man, 31-year-old Francisco Gomez was also arrested in connection with Miss Saunders' murder along with charges of drug trafficking and failure to pay child support. As he was lead into the police station in handcuffs last night, he told reporters: 'I've got nothing to with no drugs, no murder, no nothing.' In pain: Carina Saunders was tortured in front of another woman as a warning for her not to cross a trafficking gang .

Chief Cole said there was no evidence the witness knew Miss Saunders but both women knew Massey separately. Police said the kidnapping and brutal . killing were meant to send a message that the witness and her friends . faced the same fate unless they cooperated with a human trafficking and . drug ring. Gruesome: Bethany police chief Phil Cole speaks about the murder of Carina Saunders . The police chief said: 'Evidence in our investigation has led us to believe that she had been expected to provide certain things to this trafficking group and that she had not been performing to their satisfaction. 'We believe there were other people there and they're now the focus of our investigation.' Oklahoma County Assistant District Attorney Scott Rowland said a decision on charges would be made in January. Rowland declined to discuss whether the drug charges that Massey was being held on were related to the killing. 'We're at a delicate point in the case and I want to be really careful about what I say,' he told a news conference. Chief Cole said there was no evidence that Miss Saunders was involved in criminal activity. He said: 'Our information right now leads us to believe she was a random choice, as sad as that is. 'She had relationships within these loosely associated people, and I think that she was a victim of opportunity.' He said investigators met with the young woman's family at the weekend. He added: 'They are encouraged by this. They're hoping this is just one of many more that will be held to answer for their daughter's murder.'

"Warning: Dr Michael Mosley appeared on ITV's This Morning to dispel common fitness myths . We're constantly being told that exercise is the panacea to many of life's ills. Not only will it make us fitter, it will help us lose weight and boost our mental health. But it seems this may have been wrong all along. Exercise can actually cause us to gain weight - and there's no such thing as an 'endoprhin rush', one expert claims. Dr Michael Mosley, the brains behind the popular 5:2 diet, says countless myths surrounding physical activity are hampering our health - and morale. 'A lot of people think that when you exercise, you can eat what you want - and that the gym will make you happy,' he told ITV's This Morning. 'But this is wrong.' During the programme, he discussed the common myths that could do more harm than good. Here, MailOnline outlines his key points... GOING TO THE GYM CAN MAKE YOU FAT . The key problem is that we reward ourselves with 'treats' after exercise - or have the 'I've been to the gym, so I can eat what I want mentality', says Dr Mosley. 'Exercise is a good way to keep weight off - but it's not a good way to lose it. 'Going to the gym will burn calories - but way less than we think. '1lb of fat is 3,500 calories - and fat is more energy-dense than dynamite' - so to burn 1lb of fat you'd need to run about 38 miles.' He cites the example of a muffin and latte - which many of us underestimate the calorie content of. 'If you run one mile, you burn roughly 100 calories,' he told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes. 'A muffin contains around 500 calories - so you would have to run for five miles or walk for 10 miles to burn it off.' And when it comes to a latte - which has around 150 calories - it would be 1.5 miles of running or a three-mile (hour long) walk. 'That is why people never lose weight going to the gym in the long-run.' Bad reward: 'A muffin contains around 500 calories - so you would have to run for five miles or walk for 10 to burn it off,' says Dr Mosley.  A typical latte contains around 150 calories - and would take 1.5 miles of running or a three-mile (hour long) walk to shift . NOT EVERYONE GETS FITTER WITH EXERCISE . 'There was an experiment which followed 100 people exercising for 30 minutes, five days a week,' Dr Mosley told viewers. Over time, their metabolic fitness - the strength of their heart and lungs - was measured. 'While 20 per cent became significantly fitter, most didn't change that much and 20 per cent saw no change at all - they just didn't have the right genes,' he said. 'It is true - some people have a genetic make up that means they just can't lose weight. 'It can very demoralising and these people feel like a failure.' He added that gym bunnies tend to be the 20 per cent of people who see significant improvements in their fitness. Myth: While exercise can relieve symptoms of depression, this is more to do with being out in the fresh air rather than the release of 'feel-good' endorphins, Dr Mosley claims . EXERCISE DOESN'T RELEASE 'FEEL GOOD' ENDORPHINS . We're always being told this, but again, there is no scientific evidence for it, Dr Mosely told Ruth Langsford. 'The endorphin molecules are simply too big to cross the blood-brain barrier. 'I personally find exercise doesn't boost my mood at all.' And while studies have shown exercise can relieve symptoms of depression, this is more to do with being out in the fresh air, he says. 'It's about getting out, clearing your head - whether that's walking the dog, playing golf, whatever,' he said. FORGET SLOGGING IT OUT FOR AN HOUR - YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MINUTES . In fact, evidence is increasingly showing that short bursts of high-intensity exercise are much more beneficial, he said. Indeed, research published last week showed just two one-minute sessions a week for six weeks dramatically . improved the health and physical fitness of men and women over 65. Blood pressure dropped and everyday tasks such as getting out of a chair or carrying shopping became easier. Although . they began by doing six six-second sprints, by end of the study, they . were able to do ten per session – adding up to 60 seconds of activity. After . just six weeks, blood pressure fell by 9 per cent and day-to-day . activities were easier, the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society . reports. 'Despite fears that high-intensity exercise could be dangerous for elderly people or those with existing heart conditions, it actually has a protective effect,' Dr Mosley said today. Half of people are unaware that lack of exercise can increase the risk of cancer – with as many wrongly blaming stress. A . survey shows most people do not know that just 30 minutes of physical . activity a day could reduce the risk of bowel, breast and womb cancer. But . the YouGov poll commissioned by World Cancer Research Fund UK (WCRF) found 46 per cent of people believed stress increases the risk of cancer . – despite the lack of scientific evidence. The survey showed 56 . per cent of the 2,535 people questioned are in the dark about the link . between too little physical activity and a greater risk of cancer. Professor . Martin Wiseman, medical and scientific adviser at the WCRF, said: ‘For . many people, stress makes them aware of problems that they had formerly . ignored, or is a reason for seeking advice. ‘Stress might prompt them to become acutely conscious of an irritation or pain that they had previously tolerated. ‘It’s . this stress that often pushes them to seek their doctor’s advice, and . many automatically link the outcome to the recent stress and believe it . to be the cause. ‘However, there is no sound scientific evidence that stress causes cancer.’ Professor . Wiseman said as well as cutting weight gain, research shows activity . has a direct role in preventing some cancers possibly by maintaining . healthy hormone levels.","Dr Michael Mosley told ITV's This Morning the myths harm health and morale .

"At least 18 people died and nearly 50 were injured in a stampede in India's financial capital of Mumbai early on Saturday as thousands of mourners gathered following the death of the 102-year-old leader of a Muslim sect.

'People have come from outside India, and more will keep coming. Everyone was very fond of him,' said 62-year-old Mumbai-resident Juzer Lokhandwala, who attended with his family to pay their last respects. The origins of the Shia Muslim sect can be traced to Yemen. In India, some of the largest Bohra Muslim communities live in the western state of Gujarat, where many are merchants. The community, widely seen as mostly prosperous and philanthropic, runs a large speciality hospital in Mumbai. Stampedes frequently happen at religious sites in India but they are rare in large cities, such as Mumbai, where there is a greater police presence to monitor the flow of people.

"His staggering bravery during the heat of battle not only won him the ultimate military accolade for valour but also a heartfelt tribute from a young Winston Churchill. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Watson was shot in the thigh, arm and his hand while trying to clear a village in British India of murderous warriors. But despite the appalling injuries - which he would modestly said were no more than 'grazes' - and debilitating blood loss, Lt Col Watson insisted on heading back through the hail of bullets and back into the fray. Heroic: Lt Col Thomas Watson won the Victoria Cross, left, after shrugging off three bullet wounds and continued fighting enemy tribesmen wreaking havoc in a village in British India . He only stopped battling after fainting from blood loss. Churchill - who was fighting in the North West Frontier region of British India under the command of General Jeffery and was part of the relief force that arrived the following . day - later wrote of Lt Col . Watson's heroics: '...the man will go on, unshaken and unflinching after . he has received a severe and painful wound.' It was also noted that the officer had . 'in all probability saved the whole force from being wiped out' by the . Pashtun enemy who had massively outnumbered the British during the Siege . of Malakan in 1897. Lt Col Watson was awarded the VC for his bravery. He went on to serve in World War One but died from illness in 1917. The details of his gallantry have come to light again as his family prepare to auction the Victoria Cross he won during that astonishing display of bravery.

The medal, the highest military . decoration for gallantry, has been passed down . through the Watson family but is now expected to fetch £160,000 at sale. David Erskine-Hill, of London . auctioneers Dix Noonan and Webb, said: 'The North West Frontier was so . oft the scene of savage fighting and heavy casualties in days of the . Empire. 'And the story behind Thomas Watson's . VC epitomises the very nature of that fighting - a small hillside . village, surrounded by overwhelming numbers of hostile tribesmen, and a . remarkable band of British and Indian troops who held on against all the . odds, until relieved. 'Watson led two hair-raising charges at the cost of multiple wounds, including a shattered hand and ruptured artery. Lt Col Watson's Victoria Cross group of six medals stand testament to his staggering bravery and service . 'No wonder Winston Churchill, who . arrived with the relief force the following morning, was later moved to . describe Watson's courage as 'sublime'. 'But in common with many fellow VCs, . Watson remained extremely modest about his accomplishments, his charming . letter to his wife, written in haste soon after those momentous events, . merely referring to one or two ""grazes"".'

He married his wife Edith Welchman, . who herself had previously been awarded the Royal Red Cross for her . efforts in the nursing of British soldiers in India. In September 1897 an army of 10,000 Pashtun tribesmen lay siege to the British garrison in Malakand. On the night of September 16 at the . village of Bilot that was being held by the enemy, Lt Col Watson rounded . up 'a few' men of the East Kent Regiment and of the Bengal Sappers. He led them in a charge of the remove the tribesmen who retaliated with heavy fire. In his 1898 book, the Story of the . Malakand Field Force, Churchill wrote of how the burning village was a . 'shambles' when the relief party arrived the next day. The future Prime Minister wrote: 'All . round lay corpses of men and mules. The bodies of five or six native . soliders were being buried in a hurriedly dug grave. 'Eighteen wounded men lay side by side . in a roofless hut, their faces drawn by pain and anxiety looked ghastly . in the pale light of the early morning.' Churchill's account of the action the night before stated: 'The village was too large for so small a party to clear. 'The tribesmen killed and wounded . several of the soldiers and a bullet smashed Lieutenant Watson's hand. He however continued his efforts and did not cease untilo again shot, . this time so severely as to be unable to stand. 'His men carried him from the village.' Horours: Among the collection of military awards won by is the extremely rare Royal Red Cross group of three given to Sister E. Welchman, who later married Lt Col Thomas Watson . Four days later, while recovering from his wounds, Lt Col Watson wrote the letter to 'my own darling' wife. He wrote his getting injured: 'I got . touched on the right leg, only a graze...I went back to get some . Sappers...I hurried backand was pointing out where the devils were . sneaking up when I got a slight flesh wound in the inside of the right . arm - niothing of consequence but unfortunately almost immediately . afterwards I got hit badly on the left hand.'

"This is the body that sank John Edwards' political career. Rielle Hunter, 48, looked svelte in a simple white tankini as she strutted in the southern sun on Figure Eight Island in North Carolina this weekend. The beach vacation came just in time for her to celebrate Father's Day with the man who spent two years publicly denying their daughter Quinn, 4, was his. The candid photos come as Hunter reveals lurid details about her sex life with Edwards and the passion that drove him so mad he cheated on his cancer-stricken wife and sabotaged his presidential campaign in 2008. Hunter says the first time she slept with Edwards was the 'most extraordinary night of her life.' The body that drove John mad: Even at 48, Rielle Hunter looks fetching in a simple white tankini as she and Quinn hit the beach in North Carolina on Sunday . Holiday: Hunter, John Edwards and little Quinn celebrated Father's Day at Figure Eight Island, off North Carolina's southern coast. Hunter managed to show off her figure, even though she covered up with a cowboy hat and sunglasses . Status unknown: Hunter remains coy about the status of her relationship with Edwards, claiming she doesn't even know . The couple met in February 2006 at the . Regency Hotel in New York City. Hours after Hunter approached the former . North Carolina Senator, he called her up to his hotel room for a night . of 'surrender' and 'zero sleep.' Hunter claims she wrote the book, 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me,' to publicly explanation the six-year romance to the couple's love child, Frances Quinn Hunter. However, the former campaign videographer seems to leave little to the imagination about her sex life. Family? Edward, Rielle and Quinn are pictured together at their rented beach house last weekend . The book is due out June 26. An extensive interview with ABC News will air Friday on '20/20.' Hunter says she caught Edwards' eye at the hotel when she followed him out of a reception and said, 'You are so hot.' Hours later, she got a call from him inviting her to his room. She . claims she went only because she thought she could give Edwards advice . for his presidential campaign. But that all changed the moment she was . alone behind closed doors with 'her Johnny.' 'The connection I felt when I walked . in the door had only grown and the amount of energy between us was huge . and unstoppable,' Hunter writes, according to an excerpt obtained by Radar Online. 'And . then a moment came while we were talking when something in my heart . clicked and I surrendered. 'I took off my teacher hat, let go of all my . resistance to him and let him lead. And lead he did. He led me toward . the most extraordinary night of my life. There was a lot of talk, a lot . of laughter and zero sleep.' But . Hunter says she didn't give in easily to sleeping with a married man -- . it took Edwards telling her a story about having three other mistresses . to get her into bed that first night they met. 'He . told me that he had an entire hidden life that had gone on for decades . and that he was currently involved with three different women. One lived . in Los Angeles, one in Florida, and one in Chicago,' Hunter writes, . according to Radar Online. 'Clearly, this behavior of his was . not going to change overnight... I also told him that if I was going to . help him, he couldn't lie to me. He needed to have one person in his . life that was safe for him. 'He said that wasn't a problem, and when he . said that, I felt a wave of total relief roll off of him. He needed this . safe place. Somewhere in the midst of our talk, long after I realized . how far off the rails his marriage was, and for how long it had been . that way, something happened between us.' But Edwards did lie to Hunter. He . lied that night about the three other mistresses -- and used the lie to . manipulate her for five years. He didn't come clean about his love life . until 2011, she says. Edwards had two other mistresses, he said, but both those affairs ended before his 2004 bid to become Vice President. Hunter, 48, says she spent most of her 20s snorting cocaine as she pursued an acting career in New York. But she got past drug abuse before she turned 30 and replaced it, she claims, with a quest for 'spiritual growth.' The book contains a full-throated defense of her lover -- even as she is coy about the status of their relationship. Sex-obsessed: Hunter claims she and Edwards had a magnetic attraction that clicked as soon as she walked into his hotel room in February 2006 .

Hunter . attacks Edwards' wife Elizabeth, who died in December 2010 of breast cancer, . calling her 'crazy,' 'venomous' and a 'witch on wheels.' She says her abusive behavior toward John Edwards drove him into the arms of other women. Other accounts of the 2008 . presidential campaign, including 'Game Change' by journalists John . Heilemann and Mark Halperin back up Hunter's portrait of Elizabeth . Edwards as controlling and potentially abusive. He also blasts Andrew Young, John Edwards top aide, who helped hide the affair for several years. She . says it was Young's idea for Edwards and Hunter and lie and say . Hunter's baby, Quinn, belonged to him and not the presidential . candidate. Playing in the surf: Hunter and Quinn frolicked in the warm water with other beach-goers on Sunday afternoon .

When Edwards faced the prospect of an . indictment that could put him behind bars, he calmly told Hunter he . would probably wind up in a low-security prison in Virginia more like a . country club than a jail. She quickly responded that she and their daughter would move there to be near him if that happened. Federal prosecutors spent a year prosecuting Edwards, culminating in a six-week trial that ended last month. Jurors acquitted Edwards on one count of accepting illegal campaign contributions and deadlocked on five other felony counts. Turned over a new leaf: Hunter says she spent most of her 20s snorting cocaine, but gave up drugs to pursue 'spiritual growth' Come-on: Hunter says she got Edwards' attention the first night they met by chasing after him and telling him 'You're so hot' Presence: Edwards claimed Hunter had a physical and sexual confidence that made her irresistible .

"Police in Quebec, Canada, were following the scent of something sweet - millions of dollars' worth of maple syrup missing from a large warehouse stocking over $30million worth of the amber nectar. The theft puts a cavity-sized dent in Quebec's syrup stock, considered to be a global strategic reserve of the sweet stuff that is often used to replenish markets during disappointing seasons. Quebec produces up to 80 per cent of the world's maple syrup. Quebec Provincial Sgt Claude Denis said on Friday that it was too soon to determine the exact quantity or value of the maple syrup stolen from the St. Louis-De-Blandford facility where over 10 million pounds is stored, but it is likely that millions of dollars worth of the product were taken. Scroll down for video . Sweet heist: Millions of dollars' worth of maple syrup was swiped from the St. Louis-De-Blandford warehouse in Quebec stocking over 10 million pounds of the sticky stuff . The Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers said it discovered the missing syrup last week during a routine inventory where empty barrels were found at the site at St-Louis-de-Blandford, Quebec, meaning that the sticky liquid was somehow transferred to other containers by the perpetrators. The federation is the industry association for the province's 7,500 syrup producers, and administers a bulk sale system with quotas on individual operations, according to CBC News. If every drop of syrup was stolen from . the warehouse, it would represent more than a tenth of Quebec's harvest . for this year, and more than a quarter of the federation's inventory. Officials initially kept the news quiet, hoping it would help police solve the crime. Anne-Marie Granger Godbout, the executive director of the federation, said that while it is not unusual for individual maple syrup producers to have stock stolen, having millions worth of syrup stolen is ‘unusual.’ ‘It's the first time something like this has happened,’ she said. ‘We've never seen a robbery of this magnitude.’ She said the disappearance of the stock was not obvious at first in the huge warehouse. The facility alone houses nearly the equivalent of half the entire U.S. production of maple syrup in a year, she said. Sticky situation: If the stolen syrup makes its way onto the market, it could hurt some 10,000 Quebec producers . ‘The U.S. market is the main market for maple syrup, about 75 per cent of Canadian maple syrup is directly exported to the U.S.,’ she said. She noted the theft was particularly ill-timed after a disappointing 2012 season for U.S. producers, triggering more demand for Canadian syrup. She said auditors would require a few more days to determine how many of the 45-gallon barrels have been emptied. Theft of stock at the individual producer level prompted the industry in Quebec to group inventory in locations such as this, Granger Godbout said. While the federation is insured for the loss, if the stolen syrup makes its way onto the market, it could hurt the group's 10,000 members, CNN reported.

"The final straw in John Edwards' doomed marriage with his wife Elizabeth was when he asked to see his love child Quinn, the disgraced politician's mistress has revealed in her tell-all memoir. Rielle Hunter, who met Edwards in February 2006 and had his daughter two years into their affair, wrote that he promised his wife he would not speak to Hunter again after admitting the child was his. But in December 2009, more than a year after he finally admitted to being Quinn's father, he told his wife he needed to see the child before she underwent sedation for dental surgery. Revelations: In her tell-all memoir, John Edwards's mistress Rielle Hunter tells of his love towards his daughter Quinn. The father and daughter are pictured at the beach in North Carolina this weekend . Love child: Edwards denied he was the father of Quinn, pictured left with her mother Hunter, for two years. In her lurid memoir, Hunter reveals her shock at his public denials . 'Elizabeth screamed at him, ""If you go to be with her at the hospital, we are done!""' Hunter writes in her memoir, What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me. 'He said, ""She is my daughter, and I am going"",' Hunter added, to which Elizabeth responded: 'I am going to divorce you!' After 32 years of marriage, the couple signed a separation agreement and Edwards moved out of the home - only to return to following year before Elizabeth lost her battle with cancer. In the memoir, due out next week and excerpted in People Magazine, Hunter provides an unwavering defense of Edwards and documents his love for Quinn, now four. 'Venomous': Hunter claims John Edwards' late wife Elizabeth, pictured in 2004, was controlling and abusive. Elizabeth died of cancer in December 2010 . The father and daughter were pictured . together for the first time since 2008 this weekend. Images show . Edwards at ease with Quinn, as he laughs and plays with her on the beach . in North Carolina. 'Johnny was so sweet with our daughter,' Hunter writes about the first time he met his daughter. 'She looked right at him with a look of . love that she still gives him. I have never seen her look at anyone the . way she looks at her dad.' The . love he showed for his daughter came at odds with his public denials of . his paternity. For two years, he denied the child was his and asked his . aide, Andrew Young, to pretend to be her father. When . the National Enquirer broke the story that Quinn was in fact Edwards' daughter, Hunter said she was stunned to hear him continue to deny it. 'Nothing - nothing - prepared me for that,' she writes. 'I watched the man that I loved deny our child. How could he do that?' Daddy's girl: Hunter reveals that, after her birth, Quinn gave her father a look of love that she still gives him . Fatherly love: After his acquittal last month, Edwards called his daughter 'precious' - even though he publicly denied she was his for two years . After . the interview with the National Enquirer, she told him how much his words had hurt her, she wrote. He simply responded: 'Sorry, but it didn't mean anything.' Last month, when Edwards was hauled before a judge on charges that he had used campaign funds to cover up his affair with Hunter, he publicly acknowledge his love for his 'precious' daughter. After he was acquitted of one count . of corruption and a mistrial was declared on five other counts, Edwards . emerged from the court house saying he was grateful to all his children. He said: 'My precious Quinn, who I love more than any of you can ever imagine, who I am so close to, so, so grateful for.' In her memoir, Hunter also gives insight into her pregnancy, which she claims had been unplanned. 'I couldn't imagine I was, given I was 43 and had never been pregnant,' she writes. 'Johnny . and I never used birth control but I was mindful of my cycle and I was . certain that I had never been ovulating during any of my visits with . Johnny.' Normal family: Hunter has said that she does not know what the future holds between her and Edwards . Day at the beach: The trio were pictured together at a beach house on Figure Eight Island, North Carolina this weekend, in a sign that Hunter and Edwards are still very much involved . When she told . Edwards of the pregnancy, he paused and said kindly: 'I want to be clear . that whatever you decide, this is your decision, and I support you.' The excerpts, published in People Magazine, provide the latest revelations from the book, which is due out on June 26. She claims she wrote the juicy book for . Quinn and is part of her 'duty' Edwards' three other children, Cate, . Emma Claire and Jack, that he had with Elizabeth. It offers lurid details about the . couple's sex life, especially the 'extraordinary' sleepless night she . 'surrendered' to Edwards just hours after meeting him at a reception in a . New York City hotel. The . memoir also provides a scathing attack on Edwards's wife, who lost her . battle with cancer in December 2010. She was battling the disease when . her husband's affair became public. Out with Mum: Four-year-old Quinn walks with her mother during shopping trips on their holiday . Despite . these horrific circumstances, Hunter shows only scorn for Elizabeth. She says she was controlling and abusive toward her husband, which drove . him into the arms of other women. Hunter calls her lover's late wife 'venomous' and a 'witch on wheels'. 'Many people invested their hearts, their time and their energy into the image of John and Elizabeth Edwards,' she writes. 'While this image wasn't exactly true, I did play a role in destroying this myth, and many supporters ended up feeling hurt, betrayed, and disillusioned.' The excerpts also describe Elizabeth's tortured reaction to learning that her husband was having an affair with Hunter, his campaign videographer. 'Elizabeth requested all the tapes (I’d made of the campaign). She locked herself in a room to watch,' Hunter writes. At ease: The trio are finally pictured together after years of Edwards denying he was Quinn's father . Loved up: The couple appeared at ease on the beach break, which came after Edwards' corruption trial . 'On one tape she saw Johnny walking . into a room and his reaction to seeing me. She apparently told him that . he never once looked at her the way he looked at me. So she took that . bit and put it on her computer as a screen saver in order to watch it . over and over again.' Hunter added she is still in love . with Edwards and that they're still together as a couple, even though he . lives 140 miles away and sometimes only visits once every two weeks. The mistress likened their . relationship to that of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn - the A-list . Hollywood couple who have been together for nearly 30 years but never . married. She added: 'Marriage? I have no idea. I'm not a big fan of the institution, but never say never.'","Hunter claims in her memoir that cancer-stricken Elizabeth demanded a divorce when Edwards asked to visit Quinn .

"A stunning collection of photographs of World War One battlefields as they are today are to go on show in Britain for the first time. A hundred years on, with no one alive to remember the 'war to end all wars', only the landscape bears witness to the events that killed 21 million men women and children. The Somme, Passchendaele, Ypres and Verdun and so many other battlefields may be just names in history books today, but the sites along the western front have recovered their former tranquility and peace. Memory of war: The Champagne  Battlefield burial site memorial left intact on the Western Front with the soldier's equipment left on the grave, along with a plaque placed there by his father in 1919 . Craters: An aerial view of the Newfoundland Memorial Park in Beaumont Hamel, Northern France, with its shell craters and trenches . Battlefield: A major allied offensive took place in 1916 at  Messines Ridge on the southern end of the Ypres Salient with over 8,000 metres of tunnels dug and 21 mines containing almost 600 tonnes of explosives  laid under the German lines . A father's tribute to his dead son is illustrated by the young man's helmet and equipment adorning his graveside with a plaque at the Champagne battle site. Fifteen haunting images taken by World Press Photo award-winning photographer Mike St Maur Shiel go on show next month between November 5 and 14th in a street gallery exhibition - Fields of Battle Lands of Peace 14 – 18 - at Westminster Hall after being given permission by the Black Rod. The freestanding photographs, each measuring 1.2 metres (4ft) by 1.8 metres (5ft 10in), are the result of a six-year project and reveal the transformation of the battlefields of the 1914-18 war into the landscape of modern Europe. In August 2014, the exhibition opens in London with 60 images in central London before touring across . the UK and Ireland's major cities during the centenary until 2018 based on . a timeline of World War One events. St Maur Sheil said: 'This collection represents a legacy which I hope will create . a gateway to the battlefields themselves, encouraging people to . visit these historic landscapes during the centennial period and so . create awareness and understanding of the events.' Peaceful: A view today from Cavernes des Dragons southwards over La Vallee Foulon towards French positions . Traquil Masurian lakes on the Eastern Front: The German 8th Army tried to encircle the Russian 1st Army there in 1914 . St Maur Sheil who won his award in 2002 for his work on child trafficking in West Africa, began taking the battle field pictures after visiting Dunkirk with his father who served there in 1940 with the London Irish Rifles. 'Oddly enough he featured in what has . become one of the iconic images of that battle but what came as a . complete surprise to me was the extraordinary memory he had for . what appeared to me to be feature-less fields, ' he said. 'We visited Ypres and I watched him as he . stood erect at the Menin Gate, fighting back his tears: it was an . emotion I had never been exposed to before. 'The men of 1914-18 largely saw the land . torn apart and stripped of its covering mantle of grass and trees, it's . bones literally laid bare as they sought shelter within its protective . skin.' Conflict: The landing at Cape Helles was part of the amphibious invasion of the Gallipoli peninsular by British and French forces in April 1915 .

His images of the former battle fields extend over 600 kilometres from the coast of the English Channel, across Belgium and northern . and eastern France as far as the Swiss border. The exhibition, conceived jointly with historian, the late Sir Richard Holmes and Chris Bridge of street gallery pioneers, WeCommunic8, includes fascinating archive imagery, historical information and educational content .

"A Michigan man phoned police this week to complain an online prostitute had hiked her price unexpectedly after she accepted the agreed-upon fee for sex. Police in Ann Arbor report that they fielded a complaint of a robbery-in-progress around 10:30 p.m. Wednesday at a home on Packard Avenue. Not quite true love: The gritty encounter was more Taxi Driver than Pretty Woman . But when they arrived at the location in the southeastern portion of the state, they discovered . something other than your typical hold-up or heist. AnnArbor.com writes that police discovered a 45-year-old man haggling with an obstinate 19-year-old Ohio woman whom he had contacted over the Internet  about the price they had initially agreed upon for the illicit act. According to investigators, the hapless john informed them that once the woman took his cash, she suddenly said told him she was upping her fee. 'So, she was arrested,' Ann Arbor police Lt. Renee Bush told AnnArbor.com. The man was not arrested, according to the website, which reports that it will now be up to Washtenaw County prosecutors whether to file charges against him. Meanwhile, the accounts rendered by both the prostitute, as well as the 45-year-old man, wildly differed in substance, according to Bush. There was no word on how much the john had agreed to pay the alleged prostitute, or through what website he had contacted her on the Internet. The incident still is under investigation, Bush said. The story unfolded after a police fielded a call of a robbery taking place at a home on the 2700 block of Packard Avenue in the southeastern Michigan city of Ann Arbor .","Michigan police respond to the 'robbery'

"Mobile phone firms are warned today they will be forced to allow customers to swap freely between rival networks unless they end the scandal of blackspots afflicting a fifth of the country. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid revealed he favoured a system of 'national roaming' to eliminate poor signals that leave millions unable to make calls. He also said the Government will provide £150 million to fund 'hundreds' of new mobile phone masts providing coverage to the most rural areas. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, pictured checking his mobile as he arrived at the Houses of Parliament on Friday, said not being able to get a signal should be part of the modern world . In an interview with the Daily Mail ahead of the Conservatives' annual conference, which starts this weekend in Birmingham, Mr Javid said he backed campaigners who complain that in parts of the country telephone reception is worse than in India and Malawi. 'When we first started using mobiles 25 years or so ago, it was a luxury. But today, the idea that you can't use a mobile to have a conversation wherever you are in the UK is not part of the modern world. 'I see this as a national utility that we should all be able to use. It's not just about lifestyle, it's absolutely vital for a modern economy,' Mr Javid said. 'In the UK, at a national level, we don't have roaming. So a French person coming to Wales gets a better signal that someone does as a local. It is such a big problem that something needs to be done.' Mr Javid said so-called 'not spots', where there is no signal at all, were mostly in remote, rural communities. 'For that, we're starting a specific programme with £150 million of government money,' he said. 'We'll get a third party to put up masts in those areas and mobile operators have committed to plug into that. 'Obviously, they have to go through the planning process, but we are talking about hundreds of masts and we want to get moving quickly. Unless we get the hardware up, we won't see any improvement. 'The second issue is partial not-spots, where one provider might provide a signal, but others don't. You might be able to make a call if you're on O2 but someone on EE can't. 'In terms of numbers of people that are affected, it's a bigger problem – about 20 per cent of the country in terms of geography. 'I've experienced it in my constituency in North Worcestershire, which has some very rural parts. I share people's frustration. 'I have been pushing a potential solution, which is the idea of national roaming. When you go to Europe, when you switch on your phone it will roam and find the nearest signal and lock onto it. 'It's a software change, not a hardware change. Obviously the mobile phone companies already implement a system of roaming for international customers. The concept isn't new.' Mobile phone firms could be forced to share their masts so customers can latch on to any signal, regardless of whether it is their provider's . The Culture Secretary said he had discussed the proposal with industry regulator Ofcom, who had 'made it clear to me that from a technical point of view, it's feasible'. 'From a commercial point of view, this wouldn't be the first choice of the operators, but Ofcom is telling me that it can be made to work,' he added. 'I am just not happy with how the mobile companies have behaved on this. I have said to them that unless they can come up with something equally compelling, that will work well and can be done in a reasonable timeframe, I'm minded to push ahead with this. They should know that the Government is absolutely serious. 'Unless they come up with something else, then this is my preferred option. There are various ways of doing it, whether through regulation or legislation.' Greg Clark, now a Cabinet Office minister, attempted to change the law before the last election by introducing a 'right to roam' Bill in the Commons. As well as improving coverage in remote areas, the Tories believe that in areas where there are good signals, such as towns and suburbs, roaming would remove the need for duplicated mobile phone masts. Prime Minister David Cameron has voiced his frustration at not being able to make calls to world leaders while on holiday in Cornwall . It would mean a phone call is transferred to the nearest mast, even if it is run by a rival company to that the caller is signed up to. Mobile phone firms have been reluctant to agree to roaming because they have funded the costs of erecting masts themselves, and do not want to share them with rivals. Prime Minister David Cameron is understood to have become increasingly frustrated by dropped calls in his Witney constituency – and also in Downing Street, which is a notorious mobile phone blackspot even though it is in the heart of the capital. In June he revealed his struggle to keep in touch with world leaders while on holiday in Cornwall, because he could not get a mobile signal. The Prime Minister has been forced to drive to the top of a hill to get a connection on his phone to deal with the fall of Gaddafi in Libya and the bloody civil war in Syria. Mr Cameron, who holidays in Cornwall every year, said it was ‘very frustrating’ that parts of the country were still left in ‘not-spots’ without a decent phone signal. David Heath, a former environment minister and Lib Dem MP for Somerton and Frome, said he had to 'squat against the sink' to take phone calls from his office because of poor mobile phone coverage in his constituency.","Culture Secretary Sajid Javid threatens companies to allow roaming .

"Many will be deeply moved by the sight of a toddler beating her chest with tiny fists while a 300lb gorilla lounges alongside her, eating a kiwi fruit. They will laugh as the two toss straw over their heads and gasp when one of the world’s largest primates leans forward to give the little girl a tender peck on the cheek. Others, however, will be horrified. More than once, the gorilla gathers the girl in her arms, carrying her off as she would one of her young. The bond between the playmates is unmistakable despite the the grainy VHS footage being more than 20 years old. Dressed in navy jumper and light blue trousers, 18-month-old Tansy Aspinall romps in the sunshine, one minute swaying on a rope swing, the next tumbling down the slide, tummy first, her not-so-little friend behind her. Not-so-little being the operative phrase. For Tansy’s playground is, in fact, an animal pen at Howletts Wild Animal Park in Kent and her chums are western lowland gorillas. Scroll down to see the video of Tansy Aspinall and the gorilla for yourself... Controversial parenting? A photo taken in 1990, before the video was filmed, shows Tansy Aspinall in the arms of an adult gorilla at Howletts Wild Animal Park in Kent . Her father, Damian, has now decided to release the family film via The Mail on Sunday and is making it available on YouTube. It is a controversial decision and Damian, 52, is prepared for criticism but remains unrepentant. ‘This is a family video,’ he says. ‘Before I wouldn’t have released it but now, with the internet it is different. I don’t care if I get a bit of stick because I think the gorillas get a good deal out of it. There’s an upside for them that there wasn’t before. If we can show millions of people how gentle and noble and wonderful these animals are, then I think we’re doing the gorillas a service. I’m happy to take the stick for that.’ Tansy, now 23, agrees. She says: ‘I obviously understand that people might find it quite shocking seeing a baby going in with the gorillas because that’s how they have been brought up – to see gorillas in that King Kong kind of way. But really gorillas are such wonderful, gentle animals and they’re so human-like. So I hope it’s a way of people understanding how gentle and kind gorillas really are.’ She was too young to remember the . video taken at Howletts, the Palladian mansion that her grandfather, the . gambler John Aspinall, bought after a particularly good night at the . tables. Laughing or crying? Video clip of 18-month-old Tansy Aspinall playing alone with one of Dad's gorillas . No fear: The toddler was filmed 19 years ago by Damian and has been kept secret because of some fears that it might have provoked a backlash from childcare experts because of the risk . Gorilla-hug: The young girl is smothered by the 300lb powerful adult . Aspinall filled the house and grounds with animals, including tigers, wolves and gorillas. He also brought the pets he had kept in his previous home in London’s Eaton Square including  a leopard, a Himalayan bear and a capuchin monkey. In time, the animals were moved outdoors and Howletts became a wildlife park. On John’s death in 2000, Damian took control and set up the Aspinall Foundation, a conservation initiative to return captive-bred animals into the wild. His foundation has now bred more captive animals – and reintroduced them into the wild – than any other organisation in Europe. There have been 139 gorilla births, 33 black rhinos and 20 African elephants. The animals are released into reserves in Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the foundation has approximately a million acres of guarded land. Contrary to popular belief, this is no rich man’s hobby. True, Damian is wealthy thanks to the chain of casinos he set up with media mogul Kerry Packer’s son James – but it is all self-made money. His father refused to help him financially, and at the time of his death, Howletts was running at a loss of millions. Gorilla-loving father Damian Aspinall, 52, with his daughter Tansy Aspinall (now 23) John Aspinall was the owner of Howletts and grandfather to Tansy Aspinall . Damian has not only ensured its survival but turned it into a truly groundbreaking conservation project. Tansy also wants to play a part in the foundation’s work – mainly, she says, because of her childhood experiences. ‘I don’t really remember that specific moment with the gorillas but I do remember playing with them,’ says Tansy, who has just completed a degree in politics at Bristol University and is ‘on the job hunt’. ‘I don’t have any of the fear of gorillas that people normally have. I just feel love and warmth. Of all the  animals, gorillas are my favourite. And that’s because they were always something I went in with as a child. I remember them being so gentle –  they almost treated me as if I was one of their own little babies.’ Ambam the gorilla shows how he can walk like a human at Howletts . Of course, there are dangers. During his adolescence Robin Birley, Lady Annabel Goldsmith’s society club-owning son, was mauled by a tiger at Howletts. In 1980, a tigress called Zeya was shot after killing two keepers, and in 1994 the park’s head keeper was killed when a two-year-old Siberian tiger pounced on him. And in 1989 a two-year-old boy had his arm ripped off by a chimp after he reached into a cage to stroke it at another Aspinall park in Kent, Port Lympne. There is no record of a gorilla ever killing a human. Damian says: ‘I wouldn’t put my children or daughters in with an adult tiger or a lion regardless of the relationship – but gorillas are different.’ Even so, times have changed, something Damian accepts. Tansy and her younger sister, Clary, 20, are Damian’s daughters with his first wife, Louise Sebag-Montefiore. The couple divorced in 1997. Both girls were allowed to play with the gorillas but Freya, his eight-year-old daughter by his former partner, Donna Air, was not. He says: ‘I gave an interview when Freya was young and they said, “Would you take Freya in with the gorillas?” I said, “Yes, sure.” There was uproar. The police called and said if you do this we’re going to have to come and interview you and social services called and said, “We might take your child if you do this.” The usual absolute nonsense.’ Still, he’s teaching her tiger speak and gorilla gurgles. He’s serious. ‘I can speak wild boar,’ he says. ‘When you wake up in the morning, open the bedroom door and two tigers jump in your bed, you’re in serious trouble if you don’t know good morning in tiger-speak.’ Damian’s earliest memory is of playing roly-poly on the lawn with wolves and rolling over a wasps’ nest. ‘I was about eight and was with my sister,’ he recalls. ‘The swarm came out and they chased us and the wolves, biting and stinging us everywhere.

"A cafe claims to be cooking the biggest breakfasts in Britain by serving customers seven-pound fry-ups consisting of four times the daily calorie intake. Mark Winder's 'The Hibernator' weigh in at seven pounds each and diners have to sign a legal disclaimer before attempting to eat one as it adds up to 8,000 calories - four times the recommended daily intake. The meal, named 'The Hibernator', consists of eight rashers of bacon, eight sausages, four hash browns, four fried eggs, a four egg cheese omelette, four waffles, four pieces of toast, four pieces of fried bread, four black pudding, two ladles of beans, two ladles of tomatoes, mushrooms, a portion of large chips, and a two pint milkshake to wash it all down. Scroll down for video . The Hibernator  weighs the same as the average newborn baby and no customer has yet been able to finish it . The ingredients used in the dish - which includes eight rashers of bacon, two ladles of beans and eight eggs . Pictured left, cafe owner Mark Winder with the meal which is served on a turkey platter. Right, the disclaimer customers must sign to acknowledge the health risks before attempting to eat it . The Man Vs Food inspired challenge, sold for £19.95, has only been attempted by 20 people since it was first added to the menu - and no one has since completed it. At around 14 times more calorific than a regular fry-up, the big breakfast takes around 30 minutes to cook and a disclaimer must be signed before challengers can dig in. Mr Winder, 39, who runs the Bear Grills cafe in Congleton, Cheshire said: 'I reckon with these ingredients you could feed a family for a week. 'The breakfast alone is around 6,000 calories and the 2,000 calorie milkshake just tops it off. We weighed all the cooked food and it came to a whopping seven pounds. 'That's the weight of a baby. It's called The Hibernator because if anyone completes it they'll have to sleep for a year. 'We have a disclaimer which says that no one under the age of 18 can take part and that they know about the very high calorific content and high fat content. We ask people to understand that they know what they are getting themselves into. They have to tick a box to say whether they have any underlying health conditions.' The Bear Grills cafe in Cheshire, from where Mark Winder serves his huge full English breakfast . The breakfast is brought out on a 4ft turkey platter because Mr Winder couldn't find any plates big enough. Challengers have an hour to eat the entire breakfast, including the milkshake. Those who do eat the whole breakfast win £100, get their name on the Wall of Fame, have the breakfast named after them and also get to add another ingredient to the challenge. He added: 'We used to set the time limit as half-an-hour but we realised that no one was ever going to finish it. Although we did have one guy called James who nearly did it in half-an-hour but couldn't make it to the end.' The Hibernator was named in honour of the Congleton Bear, a historical tale of the town's attempts to buy a new fiercer bear for bear baiting in the 1620s. Mr Winder said: 'I came up with the breakfast to get youngsters to come in and get involved. 'Most of my customers are in the 60s and 70s and the reason I came up with the Hibernator was to inject some youth into the place and I think it has. 'Younger guys come in, and it is all men who have tried the challenge, and they look at the ingredients up on the board and say: ""I am going to smash that."" 'But then they see it come out on the big platter all heaped high and start to cry on the phone to their friends. They give up after about twenty minutes.' The cafe even has a 'green bucket' which is brought out when a challenger fails to clean up the carnage left on the plate.","Cheshire cafe's Man vs Food-inspired breakfast contains 8,000 calories .

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic's career has taken him all over Europe, playing some of the world's best teams and with many legends of the game. So it is no surprise that when the Swede told Paris Saint-Germain's television channel his dream team, made up of the best 11 players he's even played with, it should have a formidable look about it. But, also unsurprisingly, the array of talent on offer was not so great that the PSG striker failed to find room for himself. Here are the 10 superstars that Ibrahimovic picked to play alongside him. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Who makes it into Zlatan Ibrahimovic's dream team? Zlatan Ibrahimovic was always likely to pick himself in any greatest XI, but who else did he see fit to include in his line-up? Goalkeeper - Gianluigi Buffon . Italy No 1 Buffon played with Ibrahimovic during the striker's two seasons at Juventus. With seven Serie A titles, a World Cup, and a one-time runner-up for the Ballon d'Or (which hasn't been won by a goalkeeper since 1963), Buffon is one of Europe's most decorated keepers ever. Juventus and Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon is one of the most successful stoppers in the history of the game . Right back - Lilian Thuram . Another member of the Juventus team that Ibrahimovic spearheaded in the mid-2000s, Thuram is Zlatan's pick on the right side of his illustrious back four. The French defender won the World Cup in 1998, at which he was given the Bronze ball as the third best player at the tournament behind Ronaldo, Davor Suker, and ahead of team-mate and final goal hero Zinedine Zidane. Lilian Thuram is best remembered for his two goals during the World Cup 98 semi-final against Croatia . Despite his illustrious career for club and country, Thuram is best remembered for his only two international goals, both of which came during the same game, the 2-1 win over Croatia in the World Cup semi-final. Centre back - Thiago Silva . When picking your finest 10 team-mates, it's always sensible to include one or two of your current colleagues and Ibrahimovic has put his club captain Thiago Silva in at the heart of the defence. Brazil defender Thiago Silva (right), Ibrahimovic's captain at PSG, is a crucial part of the French champions' line-up . To understand his importance, one need look no further than the appalling defensive display in Brazil's 7-1 World Cup final defeat by Germany, or PSG's slow start to the season this year, both in his absence, to understand his importance. Victor Valdes . Carles Puyol  Alessandro Nesta   Javier Zanetti                   Gianluca Zambrotta . Andrea Pirlo . Luis Figo           Yaya Toure    Wesley Sniejder . Thierry Henry  Alessandro Del Piero . Centre back - Fabio Cannavaro . Another World Cup-winner and a defender who has won the Ballon d'Or, it's hard to argue with the selection of Cannavaro in any team. The former Italy captain played with Ibrahimovic at Juventus, before moving to Real Madrid where he continued his legacy as one of Europe's great central defenders. Left back - Maxwell . Perhaps the least-heralded member of this team, Maxwell might be in Zlatan's dream team as something of a friendly face. The pair have played together for a large part of their careers, representing Ajax, Inter, Barcelona and now PSG. Maxwell is an accomplished full back, and - as with most players who play with Zlatan - has picked up a lot of silverware. Fabio Cannavaro celebrates scoring  against Liverpool in the Champions League with Ibrahimovic during their time together at Juve . Maxwell and Ibrahimovic, who have played together at four different clubs throughout their careers, celebrate a PSG goal . Right midfield - Andres Iniesta . World Cup-winning goalscorer, three-time Champions League winner, and one of the greatest talents to come out of Barcelona's famous La Masia academy. Alongside Xavi, Iniesta has become almost synonymous with Barca's mesmerising tiki-taka of the late 2000s. A central midfielder most of the time, he has been used on the flanks enough to let Zlatan get away with playing him out wide here. Ibrahimovic described his mis-use at Barcelona as 'like buying a Ferrari, but you drive it like a Fiat', but he still picked Iniesta in his team . Central midfield - Patrick Vieira . Arsenal's captain of the Invincibles, now Manchester City's reserve team manager, Vieira was one of the most complete midfielders of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Patrick Vieira and Ibrahimovic block Lazio forward Igli Tare during a Serie A game in 2005 . Tough-tackling, powerful with the ball, and with an often overlooked ability to pick a pass, Vieira was the whole package. He joined Zlatan at Juventus in 2005, and the pair moved to Inter a year later following Juventus' corruption scandal, where they won three consecutive Serie A titles together. Central midfield - Xavi . The metronome at the heart of one of the best teams club football has ever seen, Xavi at his peak would get into almost any XI you care to mention. Xavi looks on as Ibrahimovic strikes a free-kick during their single season together at Barcelona in 2009 . The sixth member of this team to have won a World Cup, Xavi will retire from football one of the most respected, and decorated players in the history of Barcelona. Left midfield - Pavel Nedved . The talented Czech playmaker was a hugely influential member of the Juventus team that featured Ibrahimovic between 2004 and 2006, pulling the strings from midfield while Zlatan banged in the goals. Pavel Nedved, a Juventus legend, celebrates with Ibrahimovic in after winning the Serie A title (which was later stripped from Juve) It is often forgotten that Nedved was actually awarded the Ballon d'Or in 2003, as well as helping his national team to the final of Euro 96 years before that. During a long career, he was consistently superb. Forward - Lionel Messi . Ibrahimovic's time at Barcelona is not always remembered particularly fondly, as the Sweden star was often shunted out wide to make room for the supremely talented Messi. 'You bought a Ferrari, but you drive it like a Fiat,' Zlatan complained as he failed to get the prominence he felt he deserved, and he even was less than complimentary about the trio of Barcelona stars in this team: ‘Messi, Xavi and Iniesta always obeyed without protest. They were like schoolboys.’ But, even Ibrahimovic has to concede, with this line-up, that when you have La Liga and the Champions League's all-time leading scorer, you have to play them in the centre. Ibrahimovic and Lionel Messi did not always gel perfectly together during their time at Barcelona, but both are supremely talented . Forward - Zlatan Ibrahimovic . The man himself. Only right that someone who so famously refers to himself in the third person should pick himself to play up front for his own personal dream team. Between 2004 and 2011 the big striker won eight domestic titles in a row, coming as close to being a guarantee of success as any player in history. So his inclusion is probably fair... Zlatan's team in full, complete with himself and Messi as a strike partnership, is formidable, but would it beat the alternative XI?","Paris Saint-Germain striker selects the best XI of all his team-mates .

"Predecessor? Homo erectus, widely considered to be a direct ancestor to humans, never co-existed with modern man, researchers believe . Scientists have thrown doubt on a key theory of human evolution after discovering an ancestor of modern man may have become extinct earlier than previously thought. Homo erectus was widely considered to be a direct ancestor of our own species Homo sapiens. The two were believed to have once co-existed alongside each other - until now. Homo erectus migrated out of Africa around 1.8million years ago. By around 500,000 years ago it had vanished from Africa and much of Asia and was, until now, thought to have survived in Indonesia until as recently as 35,000 years ago. Early modern humans reached the region about 40,000 years ago, and so were believed to have co-existed with their ancestors. The . new research suggests this assumption was wrong - and Homo erectus . disappeared long before the arrival of Homo sapiens in Asia. New . excavations and dating analysis indicate that Homo erectus was extinct . by at least 143,000 years ago, and perhaps more than 550,000 years ago. If . this is the case, it challenges the widely accepted 'Out of Africa' hypothesis which holds that modern humans became fully evolved in Africa . before emigrating to other parts of the world. The model predicts an overlap between Homo sapiens and older species they replaced outside Africa. The late survival of Homo erectus in Indonesia had previously been held up as evidence supporting the theory. Dr . Etty Indriati, from Gadjah Mada University in Indonesia, who co-led the . investigations at two sites on Indonesia's Solo River, said: 'Homo . erectus probably did not share habitats with modern humans.' An alternative 'multi-regional' hypothesis proposes that modern humans evolved from ancestor species in Africa, Asia and Europe. The research is published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE.","Homo erectus was thought to have co-existed alongside Homo sapiens in Asia for 5,000 years .
But scientists now believe it disappeared from Asia at least 100,000 years before arrival of Homo sapiens .

"Stuck in the middle: Katherine Jackson's 'disappearance' cuts to the heart of a family divided . It's a tale as old as time - a family become bitterly divided over the will of a wealthy relative and descend into bickering and skulduggery. But when Paris Jackson, the beloved . daughter of late pop icon Michael, reported her elderly grandmother . missing last week, it soon became evident that this most famous of musical . dynasties is riven with particularly sinister feuding. 'I haven’t spoken with her in a week. I want her home now,' the 14-year-old tweeted, clearly distressed about the whereabouts of her guardian. Katherine, 82 , has since been . located at an Arizona spa under the care of her daughter, Rebbie, but . her grandchildren, with whom she lives day-to-day in Encino, California, . were clearly never informed that she was to be taken on a trip. So why would Michael's siblings try and drive a wedge between their mother and her young, dependent grandchildren? It all comes down to Michael, of course, who is in death as he was in life - the jewel in the crown of the Jackson empire. His will is at the centre of this . unseemly scuffle after some of his brothers and sisters baulked at being . denied a slice of his estimable fortune . When he died of a drug overdose in June 2009 Michael left much of his $600 million to his mother and his three children. Katherine became guardian of Prince, 15, Paris, and Blanket, 10, and the rest was designated for charity. But five of Jackson’s brothers and sisters claim the singer’s will is 'fake, flawed and fraudulent' and . that his lawyers forged his signature. Singer Janet Jackson surprised many by joining  former Jackson Five stars Tito and Jermaine and siblings Randy and Rebbie to challenge the will. Divided: Kelly Griffin, LaToya Jackson, Stephen Hill, Katherine Jackson and . daughter Rebbie (far right) who the grandmother is staying with in Arizona, LaToya is not challenging her late brother's will . Last month they wrote a strongly-worded letter to John Branca and John McClain, Jackson’s two lawyers who were named his legal executors.

Legal guardian: Katherine Jackson, far left, is guardian to Michael's children Blanket, third left, Prince, center and Paris, right. She and his three children are also Michael's only beneficiaries. Concerned: Paris asked for help . finding her grandmother while concerned she's in the care of a man she . disproves of . Now sources tell TMZ that Katherine's . trip to the Tuscon spa with Rebbie is all part of 'a concerted effort' to get Katharine on board with their claim. Yet despite the LAPD treating the . case as an open investigation, as reported by TMZ, the disputers are . trying to claim there is nothing egregious at play here. 'Mother is fine,' said Michael’s brother Jermaine. 'She is merely an 82-year-old woman following . doctor’s orders to rest up and de-stress.' But a source told Britain's Daily Express newspaper: 'When Katherine was reported missing that wasn’t just concern for a frail old lady, that was concern over a fabulously wealthy estate.' A family member revealed: 'Katherine is tired. The fighting over Michael’s money started shortly . after his death and continues.' The quarrelling quintet suggest they have proof that Michael was in New York on the day he supposedly signed his will in Los Angeles and accuse the lawyers of lying to Katherine Jackson to get her to increase their pay for running the estate. 'Your actions are affecting her health and on top of that we’ve just found out she recently had a ministroke,' the five Jacksons wrote. Our brother told us, in no uncertain terms and without hesitation in the months prior to his death, that he despised both of you and he did not want either of you to have anything to do with his life or estate for that matter,' they wrote. 'She’s not equipped to handle the stress load you are putting on her.' Siblings La Toya, Jackie and Marlon have not joined their brothers and sisters on the claim . And young Paris is outspoken in her disgust for certain kinfolk: 'I will defend my beloved family member with all I have, even if it means from other family members. Appeal: Paris Jackson, Michael's 14-year-old daughter, tweeted her concerns for her grandmother on Sunday morning . Still worried: Paris wasn't to speak to her grandmother, her uncle claims Katherine has been ordered not to use phones or computers by a doctor . Bond: Jackson pictured with his mother in 2005 . 'What has been said about my grandmother is a rumour… she is completely fine. I don’t appreciate you telling everyone things that aren’t true. She said of her Uncle Randy: 'Maybe he should have respect for his mother.' Katherine Jackson did obtain a judge’s permission to investigate the will’s validity but never pursued it to court. The singer’s executors replied: 'We are saddened that false and defamatory accusations grounded . in stale internet conspiracy theories are now being made by certain members of Michael’s family whom he chose to leave out of his will.' Sources close to the estate claim Randy and Jermaine are trying to make Katherine seem infirm, . hoping to get themselves appointed as her conservators, with access to more than £50,000 a month in money from the estate. Reassuring: Michael's brother Jermaine assured that his mother is resting under doctor's orders but without her grandchildren claiming to know much more . Status updates: Jermaine Jackson took to Twitter to issue statements on his mother's whereabouts through the weekend . But Jermaine insisted: 'This family’s first and foremost concern is our mother’s health, welfare and wellbeing. Nothing else.' They insist that Katherine hasn't . contacted her granddaughter as she is on medical orders to 'stay away . from phones and computers.' However Paris, rather understandably, has a fear of doctors after her father was killed by an overdose of powerful anaesthetic propofol by his physician, Dr Conrad Murray, who was jailed for four years last November for involuntary manslaughter, . 'The same doctor that testified on behalf of Dr Murray saying my father was a drug addict (a lie) is caring for my grandmother,' tweeted Paris, referring to Dr Allan Metzger, who tended Katherine days before her disappearance, before adding: 'Just saying.' Still, the rebel five insist that it's their mother they care for, and not their little brother's millions. Whatever the truth, there's no doubt that the mysterious case of the missing matriarch is just the beginning of a nefarious saga.

"He admitted that he had 'no idea' who pop singer Christina Aguilera was. But when it came to the classics, Prince Charles was on safer ground. The future king and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, enjoyed a tour today of Global Radio in London, which owns stations including Classic FM - Camilla's favourite, apparently - Heart, Capital and LBC. In the studio with Classic FM presenter John Suchet the prince admitted that he might have offered some 'gentle persuasion' when advising the Duchess of Cambridge on her wedding music. Scroll down for video . Charles, pictured at the BBC today with Fearne Cotton in the background, paid a visit to various radio stations today as part of a day to celebrate radio . Duchess on the decks! Camilla getting down at Kiss FM during her visit to Bauer radio in London today . While on a tour of Heart FM CHarles asked DJ Toby Anstis what song he was playing - and looked blank when he was told the singer was Christina Aguilera . Asked to choose his favourite piece of music, Charles picked Charles Hubert Hasting Parry’s I Was Glad, which was played when Kate and William walked down the aisle. 'Well I might have offered a bit of subtle influence,' he said archly. 'Don't forget that Elgar thought he was remarkable but for some unknown reason he was forgotten. I thought this was such a tragedy I wanted to revive interest in his music. He is so quintessentially English.' Charles was so clearly knowledgeable about classical music that he even had presenter John Suchet on the back foot with some of his questions about composers and suites. He also asked the presenter: 'Can you indulge yourself occasionally by playing a bit of Beethoven?' and congratulated him on 'diplomatically' playing some Wagner, another of his favourite composers. Upstairs it was a very different matter as he met Heart FM's Toby Anstis, however. An excited Fearne Cotton tweeted a picture of herself at Radio 1 as Charles and Camilla were given a tour . Charles, who was accompanied on the tour by the Duchess of Cornwall, spoke about his love of classical music, while the duchess admitted her favourite station was Classic FM . Politely asking what was currently playing to the station's seven million listeners, he was told it was U.S. superstar Christina Aguilera  - a revelation which left the prince utterly blank faced. Downstairs the prince and his wife met some of the network's well-known presenters including Capital FM Breakfast show hosts Dave Berry and Lisa Snowdon. Berry said the prince was 'incredibly' polite and apologised for keeping him at the station when he and his partner had been up at 4.30am. 'I couldn't believe how concerned he was, what a top man,' he said. 'Admittedly he knew nothing about the kind of music we played and, as I am so polite, I wasn't going to ask him about the Big Top 40 number one Clean Bandit and whether he liked it. 'But I do have it on good authority, from a very good contact of mine, that William and Kate always have Capital on in the background when they are at home with little Prince George, so we do have a royal seal of approval.' Charles chatted to Heart FM star and former Spice Girl Emma Bunton - and asked her if the girls might reform . 'He is always such a lovely man and it was so nice to see him again,' said Emma after meeting the prince . Charles came face to face with a Dalek during his visit to the BBC, one of the stops on his London-wide radio station tour . Miss Snowdon added: 'The Duchess remembered me when I was on Strictly Come Dancing. She was such a lovely easy going woman. I think she wants to see Dave on it in his Spandex.’ Another familiar face was Heart DJ Emma Bunton who has met the prince many times in her previous guise as a Spice Girl. ‘He is always such a lovely man and it was so nice to see him again. He was asking me about when the Spice Girls were going to reunite. That puts a bit of pressure on you! He always asked after the rest of the girls and how they are doing.’ Her colleague Jamie Theakston added: ‘I think they were both quite fascinated to see how it all worked behind the scenes. They are clearly great radio listeners.’ Myleene Klass, who started her career as a classical musician an now hosts Smooth Classics on Classic FM, spent several minutes chatting to both the prince and his wife. DJs Jo Whiley, left, and Chris Evans, right, looked delighted to be presented to their Royal guest at the BBC today . ‘The Duchess is just lovely and is clearly a listener herself. She said when her father was alive he never turned the station off,’ she said. ‘It also turned out that we shared a dressing room at the Classical Brits and I had to apologise for not tidying it up. I felt mortified!’ The couple were out and about visiting radio stations across London as part of a day to celebrate radio. Their first visit was to the BBC at Broadcasting House in Portland Place which boasts 10 national and 40 local radio stations as well as the legendary BBC World Service which broadcasts in English and 27 other languages. The couple toured the BBC newsroom and met with staff at the New World Service headquarters. Camilla also toured the Woman's Hour offices, for whom she has pre-recorded a piece, and even viewed a rehearsal in the Live Lounge at Radio 1. Is one getting down to those funky beats?

"Two years ago, they were nobodies. Jacqui Lambie was a scrappy political candidate. Ricky Muir was a revhead from Gippsland. But the Palmer United and Motoring Enthusiast senators could fast become 'very, very powerful', political operatives said, if they split from Palmer and set out on their own. That's exactly what the senators did on Wednesday, when they flexed their muscles, breaking away from PUP by announcing they would vote to stop the government's Future of Financial Advice rules. Scroll down for video . Maverick move: PUP-aligned Senators Jacqui Lambie (left) and Ricky Muir (right) today linked up with other crossbenchers and announced they would vote down the government's FOFA laws . Bomb-thrower: Ms Lambie has split with her party in an effort to shut down the Abbott government's Future of Financial Advice law changes . The former Australian Army soldier has been at odds with her colleagues in recent weeks . At a press conference this morning, the two senators announced they would vote to disallow the changes, which water down restrictions on financial advisers. Going against a deal PUP had previously signed with the government, Lambie and Muir linked up with Labor, the Greens and maverick senators David Leyonhjelm, Bob Day, John Madigan and Nick Xenophon to almost certainly defeat the proposal. It could be a sign of things to come, thanks to the maths in the Senate. Political strategist Glenn Druery told Daily Mail Australia Lambie and Muir could become an influential voting bloc in their own right, particularly as the government needs 39 votes to pass laws, or at least six crossbenchers. 'If they're smart, Ricky and Jacqui could form their own little alliance,' said political strategist Glenn Druery, known as the 'preference whisperer'. Mr Druery, who used to work for Muir, said the two senators could bounce between the PUP bloc consisting of Palmer United Party senators Glenn Lazarus and Dio Wang, and the four other crossbenchers. 'By moving between the Day - Leyonhjlem bloc and the PUP bloc they could put themselves into very strategically important positions. 'If they do team up and become a little bloc on their own, and work with the other power blocs, they are potentially very, very powerful.' Clive Palmer this morning demoted the rebellious senator from PUP's senate leadership and barred her from party room meetings following weeks of internal warfare.

In an interview with Radio 4BC on Wednesday morning, Mr Palmer described it as a 'sad situation' for Ms Lambie but denied his party was unravelling. 'Well, we're 100 per cent united. We are united. 'That's just one person, one member out of thousands, who's having a particular problem, who hasn't resigned from our party.' He also accused Mr Muir of 'backflipping', saying: 'After he’s got the government to accept all the changes he’s wanted he’s decided to change his mind when it comes to him delivering on that arrangement.' Palmer United's Glenn Lazarus told reporters he was hoping things would stay together and that Ms Lambie would not leave the party. Signs aren't good she will change her mind. Senator Lambie has scrubbed the PUP name and logo from her website. And she is not talking to her PUP colleagues, Mr Lazarus said. 'I love Jacqui, I think we get on really well, and the party has achieved quite a number of things throughout the year,' he said.

The Civil Defence Bunker in Gravesend, Kent, has been given Grade II listing, as a rare surviving example of a purpose built civil defence control centre, which would have been used in the case of a Soviet air attack. The building, which would have been staffed by around 35 people, would have handled information and co-ordinated the response to a nuclear attack, and was operational between 1954 and 1968.

The building, designed by Bryan Jefferson, has been listed at Grade II. Home sweet home: Capel Manor House, in Horsmonden, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, has also been listed . A room with a view: Michael Manser, the designer of Capel Manor House, pictured inside the property which has an exposed steel frame and bronze tinted glass walls . Special status: Capel Manor House is now one of just 5.5 per cent of buildings which have listed in the UK . And Capel Manor House, in Horsmonden, . near Tunbridge Wells, Kent, which is built with its steel frame exposed, . bronze tinted glass walls and a flat timber roof, has been listed at . Grade II*, joining just 5.5 per cent of listed buildings, for its high . architectural interest. The building was designed by Michael Manser, one of a small number of architects in the 1960s and 1970s who explored the use of steel-frame construction for domestic architecture. The Roman Catholic Church of English Martyrs, Birkenhead, the Wirral, built in 1952, was originally listed at Grade II but has seen its listing upgraded to the higher Grade II* listing. Mr Vaizey said: 'Everyone knows that England has a fine and wonderful built heritage. But it's sometimes forgotten that we have many outstanding modern buildings too. 'Our architects are among the best in the world and it's absolutely right that their finest work is afforded the same protection as their historic forebears. Lighting up the night: Sheffield electricity substation which has been given listed status in the latest move to protect post-war architecture . Underground: The entrance to the Gravesend Civil Defence Control Centre in Kent . 'The buildings and structures I am listing today demonstrate this well. Innovative, exciting and eye-catching, they each in different ways show that architecture in this country is very much alive and well in the modern world.' Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, admitted that listing modern buildings, which some people saw as 'concrete monstrosities', could be controversial. 'Few areas of English Heritage's work are as disputed or as intriguing as the listing of modern heritage and these striking buildings listed today exemplify our rigorous and highly selective approach. 'Some still view the buildings of the era as concrete monstrosities, others as fine landmarks in the history of building design,' he said. The listings coincide with the opening of an English Heritage exhibition, Brutal and Beautiful, looking at the UK's love/hate relationship with recent architectural history, at Wellington Arch, central London, from September 25 to November 24. Almost 700 post-war buildings have been listed in the past 25 years. Talking point: The Gravesend Civil Defence Control Centre Bunker in Gravesend, Knet, has been given listed status . Going up in the world: The Roman Catholic Church of English Martyrs, in Birkenhead, the Wirral, built in 1952, has seen its listing upgraded from Grade II to Grade II* .

"Helen Smith appears at Sheffield Magistrates court. She has been found guilty of enlisting the help of a phony official to conduct sham musical exams at her home . A music teacher who arranged for students to take sham piano exams in front of a phoney official, has been found guilty of fraud. Helen Smith held the examinations at her home for five pupils who paid their fees and took the tests believing them to be genuine. The tests were carried out by an unknown woman who claimed to be an official examiner and the students were later told they had passed the exams with flying colours. However, suspicions were aroused when certificates failed to arrive. Smith, 42, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, told Sheffield Magistrates Court she had arranged the exams in good faith with the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM). But Lynne Butler, deputy head of UK operations for ABRSM, told the court that the organisation had no record of any exam taking place at Smith’s house on December 15 and had not sent any examiner to the property. The combined cost of all the exam fees and additional lessons was around £1,600, Magistrates’ were told. Smith, who has previously been banned from teaching in schools for two years by the General Teaching Council after claiming sick pay while being on holiday, was convicted yesterday of six counts of fraud by abuse of position and one of fraud by false representation between February 2012 and March this year, in relation to two adult and three teenage pupils. Mrs Butler told the court ABRSM had sent a cheque for £264.90 earlier in 2012 to Smith for cancelled examinations which was cashed by the teacher on July 18. That money included a full refund for an exam that had been due to be taken by Andrea Jackson. Smith, who has previously been banned from teaching in schools for two years by the General Teaching Council after claiming sick pay while being on holiday, was convicted yesterday of six counts of fraud by abuse of position and one of fraud by false representation between February 2012 and March this year, in relation to two adult and three teenage pupils . She . said Smith had told ABRSM the reason for the cancellation was Ms . Jackson’s father had died -something later revealed not to be true. Miss . Jackson was told by Smith shortly after the Grade Five exam later in . the year that she had passed with a distinction but the ABRSM later told . her it had no record of an exam on that day. Sharon Copley, the mother of one of Smith’s teenage pupils, was told her daughter should attend the test for Grade Five piano at her house by Smith instead of another official exam they had already booked. She told the court: 'She was absolutely devastated. 'To be told by somebody you trusted that you have passed with a distinction and to then find out the person she looked up to hadn’t told the truth, she felt humiliated and let down. It knocked her for six.' Smith said an administrative error by the board was possibly to blame for it having no record of the tests nor of sending an examiner to the address on the day in question. Sheffield Magistrates' Court was told the combined cost of all the exam fees and additional piano lessons was around £1,600 . She said she thought the woman was an official examiner and told the court she was sad that pupils she considered friends believed she was to blame. Smith, who represented herself during the trial, said: 'I feel very hurt and betrayed and let down by the board’s inaccuracies or whatever has happened. I did my job as a music teacher to make sure they took their exams.' But passing verdict at Sheffield Magistrates Court yesterday, District Judge Sheila Driver said: 'You attempted to involve yourself in a game of smoke and mirrors, but your evidence was inconsistent, not credible, and frankly nonsense. 'I am satisfied that all victims suffered a financial loss due to a false representation by you and I therefore find you guilty of all charges.' Smith will be sentenced next month.","Helen Smith, 42, from Sheffield, hosted fake piano exams for students .

"At the National Security Agency headquarters in Fort Mead Maryland, a memorial carved into a plaque reads: 'They Served in Silence.' The motto is in stark contrast to this week's revelations by NSA leaker Edward Snowden, who has now become the most infamous agency employee in recent years. But a candid NSA archive reveals the thousands of staffers who been quietly working on America's most sensitive secrets for over six decades. Strike a pose: The US Army Signal Intelligence Service posed in front of their vault in 1935 . Early days: Cryptologists in Korea in the 1950s. The Army Security Agency (ASA) was responsible for supplying the Army's codes and ciphers . Working around the clock: Cryptologists hard at work during the Second World War . Determined: Fleet Radio Unit Pacific (FRUPAC) in Hawaii working on JN-25, the principal Japanese Navy encryption system in 1945 . The series of photos document the . significant changes the agency has gone through since it was established . on Nov. 4 1952 by then-President Harry Truman. The predecessor to the NSA was the Armed Forces Security Agency which was set up in 1949. But that agency did not have much power and lacked a central control centre. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director Walter Bedell Smith sent a memo to James . S. Lay, Executive Secretary of the National Security Council in 1951 that spurred the creation of the NSA. Mission: U.S. Army Engineers conduct diving operations to recover Nazi cryptologic records from Lake Schlersee in Southern Germany at the end of the Second World War . Intelligence: NSA's SIGSALY, a secure speech system used in World War Two for the highest-level Allied communications . Equipment:  A UNIVAC 9300 Peripheral Processor, left,  a punch card computing data center from 1966,  and a KY-8 Cryptologic Device, right .

Watching: The direct communication link between Washington and Moscow at the Pentagon Building, as monitored by the NSA . He observed recommended a survey of communications intelligence activities after observing  'control over, and coordination of, the collection . and processing of Communications Intelligence had proved ineffective.' Then-president President Harry S. Truman authorized the agency's creation in June 1952 - he understood the importance of a central spy body as America had become a . dominant power on a global stage, facing global responsibilities and . threats. U.S. efforts had led to breaking German and Japanese codes in the Second World War, success against the German U-Boat threat in the North Atlantic, and . victory in the Battle of Midway in the Pacific. As war raged in Korea, the creation of NSA allowed the Defense . Department to consolidate cryptologic support to military operations, . and to meet challenges that the nation would face in the Cold War. The agency ran the the VENONA project  - a long-running secret collaboration betwqeen the U.S and the U.K involving cryptanalysis of messages sent by intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union. Technology evolving: Staffers chat as they stand next to the NSA supercomputers in the 1970s . America's sensitive secrets: An NSA staffer at work in 1971 using a console at the agency . Demonstration: VADM Inman and Ms. Ann Caracristi listen to Hall of Honor Cryptologist Frank B. Rowlett describe the ENIGMA machine . Growing agency: The NSA continued to expand into the 1980s, as seen in this aerial headquarters of its headquarters . In 1953, the VENONA project exposed a massive Soviet espionage effort that threatened national security. The NSA moved to Ft. Meade  in 1957- one reason the site was . selected was because it was deemed far enough away from the capital in . case of a nuclear strike. In 1960 the agency was rocked after two employees William Hamilton Martin and Bernon F. Mitchell, defected to the Soviet Union. The alarming revelation prompted tighter personnel security measures. The agency's signals intelligence . (SIGINT) played a critical role in 1962 in defusing the Cuban Missle . Criris, a saga which had the world's nations nervously holding their . breath.

Memories: NSA's Cryptologic Memorial Wall honors those 'who served in silence' since the Second World War . Modern day: A view of the National Security Operations Center Floor last year . The 1980s saw former NSA employee Ronald Pelton convicted of spying for and selling secrets to the Soviet Union. He reportedly has a photographic memory as he passed no documents to the Soviets. Petty Hohn Anthony Walker, Jr.,  a . United States Navy Chief Warrant Officer and communications specialist . was also convicted of spying for the Soviet Union from 1968 to 1985. In the late 1980s President Reagan attended the dedication of the Operations 2A and 2B buildings. In the 1990s the NSA provided key information for the Gulf War, codenamed Operation Desert Storm. In 2001, the 9/11 terror attacks that . killed 2,977 people reinforced the need for the NSA as America became a . clear Al-Qaeda target.

"She is said to have been one of the founding figures of the Swinging Sixties. Twiggy and Bianca Jagger were among the figures Barbara Hulanicki, the fashion guru and founder of the iconic boutique Biba, dressed in the label's heyday. But now the fashion designer believes the sexual revolution has gone too far, with celebrities no longer expressing themselves through new fashion but some bearing so much flesh they resemble porn stars. Scroll down for video . Barbara Hulanicki (pictured in 2009) will return to Biba at House of Fraser as consultant for the fashion label . Miley Cyrus (left) has been criticised for her skimpy outfits - a step too far for Hulanicki's designs (right) Hulanicki branded some of the clothes now worn on the red carpet as 'horrible'. ‘There’s no mystery. Talk about cleavages. It’s like porn – over the top,' Hulanicki told the Daily Telegraph. The Polish-born designer said she feels the revolution has gone too far, with young girls now taking the pill earlier than ever . She said: ‘What’s scary now is that there are very young girls taking it. They’re starting too early. It’s not about love anymore. We’ve been liberated too much.’ Ms Hulanicki said the launch of the pill in 1961 - at the start of the sexual revolution that gave women more freedom to express themselves - was welcome at the time. She said women began to be aware of their own shape and were no longer forced to live in what she described as 'hormonal hell.' Ms Hulanicki admitted she took the pill herself, something which she felt gave her a 'happier life' and husband. Hulanicki said celebrities are now bearing 'cleavages' - with Katie Price (left) and Rihanna (right) examples . The 78-year-old this week announced her return to Biba, now owned by House of Fraser, after decades of absence. Ms Hulanicki launched a fashion mail-order company in 1963 with her husband Stephen Fitz-Simon . The label was relaunched four years ago by the department store and Hulanicki will now work as a consultant. She launched the firm, which began as a mail order fashion business before opening its first store in London, 50 years ago with her husband Stephen Fitz-Simon. Biba became known for its daring fashion and helped to define some of the clothes in the swinging sixties. Ms Hulanicki is now an interior designer in Miami after losing control of her company name in the seventies. A 1969 Biba playsuit was seen as an item to be worn by the 'bold' because of deep cut armholes and neckline . Barbara Hulanicki claims to have been interested in fashion in a young age, saying clothes were 'always more than a mere necessity' She was born in Warsaw in Poland in 1936 before relocating with her family to Jerusalem . Their life in Jerusalem ended in 1948 when her father was taken from the family home and found dead the next day . She went back to England to live with her mother and two sisters including the youngest Beatrice, nicknamed Biba and the inspiration behind the fashion label . Ms Hulanicki started buying affordable but fashionable clothes and went to Brighton College of Art . In the 1950s Ms Hulanicki met her husband Stephen Fitz-Simon, who worked in advertising . In 1963 the pair set up a mail order fashion company under the name Biba and orders began to gather pace . The first Biba shop opens at 87 Abingdon Road in Kensington, London, in 1964 selling low-priced, high-fashion clothes and accessories. In 1966 Biba moved to 19-21 Kensington Church Street and becomes associated with the iconic figures of the swinging sixties such as Brigitte Bardot, Mia Farrow and her then husband Frank Sinatra . The first Biba department store opens at 120 Kensington High Street in 1969 expanding into menswear, make-up, jewellery, paint, cushions, fringed lampshades and satin sheets. In 1973 Big Biba opened at 99-117 Kensington High Street in the old Derry & Toms store; seven storeys including a roof garden, restaurant/music venue and food hall. A million people visited every week – David Bowie and Marc Bolan were regulars. In 1975 the fall of the company was dramatic and in  the space of months Ms Hulanicki lost control of it to British Land, one of the largest property development and investment companies in the UK. Between 1976-2006 there were several unsuccessful attempts to relaunch the Biba label, none of which involved Ms Hulanicki. The label was relaunched again by House of Fraser in 2009, this time successfully. In 2011 model Daisy Lowe appeared in the House of Fraser Biba campaign .

"Looking shyly into the camera, nothing in Deng Wen Ge’s high school volleyball team photograph suggests that she was destined for bigger things. In this exclusive photograph from 1980, she was certainly taller than many of her classmates at 5ft 11 inches, but both her name – Chinese for ‘Cultural Revolution’ – and her conservative hairstyle fitted right in with her Communist peers in the factory city of Xuzhou. Few among her wealthy, well-connected society friends in the United States would recognize the teenage athlete, as Wendi Deng, who until last summer was the wife of Rupert Murdoch, the world’s most powerful and controversial media mogul. Young dreams: Wendi Deng, then known as Deng Wen Ge, in her high school volleyball team in 1980 . Work: Ms Deng was said to have had 'some cosmetic surgery work' when she moved to America with the main ambition of becoming 'rich and famous' Through sheer force of will and the patronage of certain well-placed friends, Wendi, the name she adopted in her teens, went from the poor daughter of a $50-a-month factory manager living in a town where the lights went out every night at 7pm to a multi-millionaire divorcee in a $60million triplex on Fifth Avenue in the city that never sleeps. The first step in her remarkable journey began with her arrival in California in February 1988 after meeting a 50-year-old American engineer working on a project in Xuzhou, who agreed to help improve her English. With the enthusiastic co-operation of his wife, Jake Cherry sponsored Wendi’s student visa and put her up at their La Cresenta, California, home sharing a bedroom with their five-year-old daughter. Suddenly, from sharing clothes with friends in Xuzhou and donning her lookalike high school volleyball team uniform, Wendi was wearing pairs of $200 jeans, her California State University, Northridge, economics professor Daniel Blake told Vanity Fair. In a 2007 interview by writer Eric Ellis for Australia’s ‘The Monthly’ magazine, Blake also described Wendi as 'a trendy dresser, a modern girl'. Now: Ms Deng attended the New York Collection by Martin Katz reception at The New York Palace on February 11. It was the first time she was seen in public since a revealing Vanity Fair profile . According to another of her professors, Kenneth Chapman, Wendi, one of his brightest students, had ‘some kind of cosmetic surgery’ and turned up wearing dark glasses at around that time when she was living in Los Angeles in the mid-1990s. ‘I don’t remember a whole lot,’ Chapman said this week. ‘We are going back to the 1990s. ‘When she graduated there was a picture of her taken when she had a lunch with a couple of friends.’ ‘Can you imagine what it would've been like, how she got there with no knowledge of the culture?’ a New York friend of Wendi’s told Ellis. ‘It was almost inevitable that she was going to make some mistakes. I don't think she has an evil personality; she just has this incredible ambition coupled with this lack of self-consciousness. She got to California and she wanted to social-climb, to get out of the situation that got her there.’ By this time, the Cherry’s marriage had become a casualty of Wendi’s move to the West. According to a numerous reports, Jake Cherry - who is now 76 - was kicked out of the family home by his wife, Joyce, after she discovered he was having an affair with his young protégé. Power: Ms Deng enjoyed a rapid rise from the daughter of a factory worker in Communist China to the wife of Rupert Murdoch, enjoying a life of luxury in a $60million triplex on Fifth Avenue, New York . Wendi and Cherry wed in February 1990, but the marriage lasted just four months before she met a . Revelations: The Vanity Fair piece stoked up rumors that she had a crush on former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and liked his 'good body' younger man, David Wolf, who was closer to her own age. The Wall Street Journal later reported the divorce became official after two years and seven months in 1992, which is seven months longer than what was required for Deng to obtain a 'green card'. From there, Deng’s social ascent became all the more rapid. She enrolled in an MBA course at the prestigious Yale School of management in 1995 and as part of her internship requirement she won a temporary job at Star TV, a satellite television station in Hong Kong that was owned by Murdoch’s NewsCorp. The internship may have taken her back to Communist China, but it was also the direct route to the heart of one of the titans of capitalism. Simply put, according to her old Star TV colleagues, Deng’s ‘ambition was to be rich and famous.’ It wasn’t long before an opportunity came her way to meet Murdoch when she was reportedly asked to accompany him as an interpreter and guide on a trip to Shanghai. The May-December working relationship developed into a romance, rocking the Murdoch family. Murdoch and Wendi were married in 1999, just 17 days after his divorce from ex-wife Anna. The union would bring the couple two children and all the fame Wendi could have ever dreamed of. She met the Queen of England and hobnobbed with tycoons and movie stars. Her photograph was a staple of the society columns and, if a recent Vanity Fair article is to believed, she was impressed by other powerful men like Google chairman Eric Schmidt. According to a note to herself written by Wendi that was published in Vanity Fair, she was more than happy with the way her transformation from Chinese factory town girl to Manhattan society maven has worked out. Break up: Ms Deng divorced Mr Murdoch last year after having two of his children. Her notes that were revealed in Vanity Fair revealed that she thought she had 'style, grace' that she 'looked gorgeous and so young, so cool' ‘Lisa [girlfriend of Eric Schmidt, left] will never have my style, grace,’ she wrote. ‘I achieved my purpose of Eric saw me looking so gorgeous and so fantastic and so young, so cool, so chic, so stylish, so funny and he cannot have me.’ The article also revealed details of a lovestruck note from Ms Deng, in which she praised former British Prime Minister Tony Blair’s ‘good body’, his ‘really, really good legs’ and even his ‘butt’. It said staff at Mr Murdoch’s home in Carmel, California, were uneasy when Mr Blair arrived and tried to find her. The magazine claimed they told him Ms Deng had gone to the master bedroom, but ‘by the time they could tell her, Mr Blair was looking for her, they found Mr Blair walking into the master bedroom and closing the door behind him’. On another occasion ‘they were feeding each other during dinner, which made the staff uncomfortable’, the magazine claimed. Mr Blair’s friends deny he had an affair, they were feeding each other and that he was ever alone with Ms Deng. Vanity Fair says Mr Blair had 'rolled his eyes' and looked 'panicked' when he was told Mr Murdoch would not be joining them until the following night. Just a week after the Vanity Fair story broke, Wendi, now 45, was back in the limelight hosting a diamond promotional night in New York. Wearing a glamorous lace black and cerise gown she could afford to smile for the camera. She’d come a very long way from that posed team photo with her high school sports team.","Then called Deng Wen Ge, Wendi Deng pictured in 1980 volleyball team .

"Jeff Bezos' estranged biological father has revealed that he plans to contact the billionaire amazon founder after learning about their genetic connection last year - nearly half a century after abandoning the boy and divorcing his mother when they were teenagers. Bezos, 49, was born to teenage parents in Albuquerque, New Mexico and his mother left his birth father after being married for two years. As told in a book excerpt published in Bloomberg Businessweek, writer Brad Stone reveals that he was the one to actually tell Bezos' father that the son he abandoned as an infant was the multi-billionaire who runs one of the biggest companies in America. Scroll down for video . Bullish, driven and determined: Bezos founded Amazon.com in a bid to live life without regrets . Then and now: Ted Jorgensen was a teenage unicyclist (left) when his son Jeffrey was born, and he only learned that the boy grew up to be Jeff Bezos last year (pictured right this year, at age 69) Ted Jorgensen was an 18-year-old unicyclist who was a rising star on the niche circuit when his girlfriend, Jackie Gise, became pregnant. The pair travelled to New Mexico to get married- because she was too young under American law- and then returned and had a makeshift ceremony at her house where both of their mothers signed their marriage application form. Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born on January 12, 1964, and 17 months later, Ted and Jackie got a divorce. Both Jackie and her father told Ted never to contact the family again, and he agreed. The lengthy book excerpt tells how she then started dating her co-worker, Mike Bezos, who she eventually married. She asked Jorgensen's legal permission to allow her new husband to adopt their son, Jeffrey, and he agreed. Parents: Jeff's mother Jackie (left) married his step father Mike Bezos (right) when Jeff was four-years-old . Fast forward 47 years and little Jeffrey Bezos is all grown up, having turned his book shipping business into an online behemoth that turns over around $75billion in annual revenue. Reporter Brad Stone went to the small bike repair shop in Glendale, Arizona that Jorgensen owns in 2012, and he found the 69-year-old working behind the counter. 'I’d considered a number of ways he might react to my unannounced appearance but gave a very low probability to the likelihood of what actually happened: He had no idea what I was talking about,' Stone writes. 'Jorgensen said he didn’t know who Jeff Bezos was and was baffled by my suggestion that he was the father of this famous CEO.' It was only after the author brought up Jeff's mother Jackie Gise and their infant son Jeffrey that he saw the wheels in Jorgensen's head begin to turn before seeing his eyes fill 'with sorrow and disbelief'. His own family: Bezos married his wife MacKenzie in 1993 (seen together at the Met Ball in 2012) and they have four children . Man with a plan: Amazon started as a book-shipping business that went public in 1997 (Bezos pictured that year) Stone then met with Jorgensen and his current wife Linda who has four children that he helped raise. 'I wasn’t a good father or a husband,' Jorgensen said of his first marriage. 'It was really all my fault. I don’t blame Jackie at all.' At . first, the couple decided that they would not tell her four sons about . their half sibling, but early this year they changed their mind. The . Bloomberg article tells how the youngest of the sons, Darin Fala, . reached back out to Stone and told him that he and his stepfather had . decided to reach out to Bezos. 'My wife calls me unemotional because she has never seen me cry,' Fala said after the big reveal. 'Ted . is the same way.

"Not for the first time, I have been inspired by Jerry Hall. I adored her so much back in my early 20s that I made and hand-painted an exact copy of the fabulous black and gold tiger-print dress she wore in the video of Bryan Ferry’s single Let’s Stick Together. So when I read that she'd cleared out her wardrobe to sell her stash of designer clothes for charity I decided to follow suit. The problem is, I don't have one wardrobe, I have seven - three in my bedroom, three in my study and, just for luck, one more in the guest bedroom. Raiding her wardrobe: Amanda has a lot of clothes so will she finally be able to give some away? In my defence, I'm not a prolific shopper, but I am a hoarder and hitherto incapable of throwing anything out - after all, every piece in my wardrobe conjures up memories of the times I wore it. Twice a year, I swap between summer and winter clothes, keeping the seasonal ones in my study and the off-season ones in the bedroom. One whole wardrobe is an overflow, and I confess I haven't worn any of the pieces hanging in it for at least six years. This is obviously where my clearout should start, but would I be able to part with anything? Black night: Within weeks of wearing this, Amanda left her partner . THE BIG BREAK UP . I bought this exquisitely embroidered, draped Alberta Ferretti sequined black top and lace skirt for my ex-partner's 50th birthday party nearly seven years ago. It cost £500 and the colour should have been a clue. During the speech I made, paying tribute to his many great qualities, I kept breaking down in tears. Guests came up to me afterwards and said it was so touching, so very moving. Little did they know they were tears of sorrow, not joy, because I knew I was soon to leave him. Within weeks he had moved out. I can't wear this outfit again, but hope it brings happiness to some poor unsuspecting soul. Too young: This outfit has to go . MAJOR WARDROBE MALFUNCTION . I bought this stripy skirt from Reiss about five years ago for £80. It has never been worn, unsurprisingly, and looks more like a belt than a skirt. What was I thinking? I bought it during a skinny phase and thought I could get away with anything. I did put it on a few times planning to wear it, but one glimpse in the mirror and I knew it was all wrong for me - too short, too obvious, too young and not a little tarty. The Agnes B red cardigan is one of those items you buy thinking 'I'll get lots of wear out of this' but I never have. The front-fastening gapes and the buttons constantly break free creating serious cleavage malfunction. Charity bag it is. Memory: This top reminds Amanda of a once happy relationship . MEMENTO OF MARRIAGE . I picked up this classic stripy top for my then fiance John at a market in Sydney 30 years ago. It cost $5 and is still as good as new. Our marriage ended very sadly just four years later, but this top reminds me of the happier times we had in the Australian sunshine, falling in love and frolicking in the sun without a care in the world. We both used to wear it, and it is the only thing of his I have kept. The wedding ring I returned, the engagement and eternity ring I pawned and gave the money to a homeless old lady who lived in a doorway near where I worked in Pimlico. I won't ever wear this top again, but I can't chuck it either - it reminds that even failed relationships begin with love. Back it goes. Online mistake: A regrettable purchase . DON'T DRINK AND SHOP . This £200 black and white fur trimmed Nanette Lepore cardigan was one of my many online mistakes. Rule one for online shopping - never even contemplate it after a couple of glasses of wine. I’m a bit of an online ingénue, sticking to designers such as Amanda Wakeley or Nanette Lepore as their sizes are constant. I also get my Myla bras and knickers online, partly as I loathe underwear shopping and they always fit. This cardigan looked fabulous on a young model, but it makes me look like a little old lady collecting her pension at the Post Office. This is all wrong for me, but hopefully it will be just right for a grateful granny. Issa not working for me: Amanda won't keep this wrap dress . LOOKS GOOD ON KATE BUT NOT ON ME . I fell in love with this dazzling Issa dress when I bought it about eight years ago, with a hefty price-tag of nearly £500. Yes I know Kate swears by these faux-wrap dresses - and, yes, I know the cut and draping are ludicrously flattering, but they're just so middle-aged. With its bold bright green, yellow, blue, white and black pattern, one male friend said it made me look like an exotic butterfly emerging from the forest. Another suggested a giant dragonfly. Ouch! It fits perfectly, and is very slimming, but who wants to look like an insect, stick-like or not? Out! Winter warmer: But Amanda is passing this coat on . THE LESSER SPOTTED YETI . This fluffy coat, bought for £120 in the sale at Fenwick's 15 years ago, always made me feel like a teenager. Despite the unusual grey, blue and pink mottled fake fur, it felt glamorous with jeans or a dress. One of the reasons I loved this coat was that it was such a change from my beloved timeless Nicole Farhi black wool and fake fur coat or my navy swing coat - they were for work, my yeti was for fun and I wore it for years. And while my girlfriends thought it was cool, one male friend said it made me look like a moth-eaten taxidermied bear. Trying it on again now, I realise it is just too young for me these days. Let's hope it keeps some twentysomething warm and happy this winter. Date dress: Now for her boyfriend's eyes only . MY 'COME AND GET ME' FROCK . Now, I love this £250 red Nanette Lapore dress and actually think it's quite flattering, but my boyfriend hates it. I know we shouldn't be influenced by what our men think, but we are. Anyway, it's not that he doesn't like it. He loves it, but only when I wear it with him. He describes it as a 'date dress', but he actually means it's a come-and-get-me frock. It does pre-date him, so to speak, and I have a hunch that's why he dislikes it so much, for the mere reminder that I ever dated anyone else. Silly thing. I'll admit that the colour is rather obvious, and the neckline a bit Marie Antoinette, but on reflection I refuse to give this one away. Back it goes - for his eyes only. Sadness: Amanda wore this to deliver tragic news . TOO PAINFUL TO PART WITH . It's funny what you come across when you search through your wardrobe - the good, the bad, and the unbelievably painful. To anyone else's eye, this £20 khaki linen sundress would be first on the reject pile. And I did contemplate losing it - for a moment - but it stays. I last wore it nearly 20 years ago. The phone rang before 6am on an already stinking hot day in Perth. It was my brother Michael's wife telling me the news we'd been expecting but would never be ready to hear. He had died in the night. Frantic to get dressed to make our last visit, I was keen not to offend by wearing anything inappropriate. So I chose this modest dress then walked into Mum and Dad's room, where they were curled up together asleep, to tell them. Michael's last words to me the night before he died were 'see ya', something I intend never to say to this dress, so plain to the eye but so embedded in the heart. Best forgotten: This was worn during an embarrassing public blunder . NIGHT THAT MAKES ME CRINGE . This Kenzo dress cost a whopping £500 when I bought it for the Sony radio awards in 2003, to announce the prize for best talk radio presenter. A simple enough task you might think, reading out three names in reverse order. And yet when the moment came, for some unfathomable reason I decided to pay my own personal tribute to Five Live's Victoria Derbyshire (who hadn't even been placed in the top three). No sooner had the words 'the wonderful Victoria Derbyshire' left my lips than she and her team were on their feet, hugging each other and heading for the stage. I had to shoo them back and announce the real winner, whose name escapes me to this day, but the shame lives on. The host Paul Gambaccini whispered in my ear that it was the biggest disaster he had ever witnessed at an awards show. Little wonder I've never been able to wear it since. Top of the reject pile it goes.","Inspired by Jerry Hall, Amanda has had a wardrobe clearout .

"At first glance this hapless fish looks like a large mackerel that has swallowed a football. But  the unusual looking creature found washed up on a south coast beach is actually an exotic but deadly pufferfish, usually only found in tropical waters. The species - a specialty in Japan - are well-known for ballooning in size by filling their bodies with water or air to deter predators. And, judging by the size of this creature, it appears to have died while in full defensive mode, with its stomach fully inflated. Deadly: This exotic but deadly pufferfish, which has its stomach fully inflated, was found washed up on a beach in Dorset, despite rarely entering British waters . The fish was found by Richard Fabbri, from Weymouth Watersports, who spotted the fish swept up on Chesil Beach . The 12 ins long specimen was found by Richard Fabbri, from Weymouth Watersports, who spotted the fish swept up on Chesil Beach in Dorset - the first time the species has been seen in the area for 30 years. But had any beach forager picked up the silver fish and taken it home for their dinner they would have come in for a nasty shock. All pufferfish are poisonous and carry a toxin in their internal organs that has no known antidote. There have been several incidents of people who have died after consuming a pufferfish believing it to be a harmless species. Oceanic pufferfish - Lagocephalus lagocephalus in Latin - are a delicacy in Japan but rarely enter British water, because it is usually too cold for them. Only a very small number have been recorded before, all off the south west coast. Oceanic pufferfish - Lagocephalus lagocephalus in Latin - are poisonous and carry a toxin in their internal organs that has no known antidote. Mr Fabbri, who works at Weymouth Watersports, said: 'It looked very odd. It had this big puffy belly that was under its throat but the rest of its body looked more like a mackerel.' Peter Tinsley, of the Dorset Wildlife Trust, said: 'It is an oceanic pufferfish. We know of one that was actually caught off Chesil Beach in the 1980s so it is very rare to see them here. 'The waters of the west coast of England are a bit warmer than the rest of the country, mainly due to the effects of the Gulf Stream. 'It is quite a slender fish and they only inflate their bellies when they feel threatened.' Most pufferfish are found in sub-tropical and tropical waters in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. They have four large teeth which are used for crushing the shells of crustaceans and mollusks, their natural prey.","12inch exotic silver fish spotted by Richard Fabbri on Chesil Beach .

No one else was injured. Garcia's friend, Fernando Mora, 25, crouched down to pray on the sidewalk where the veteran died. He said Garcia had recently told him he had lost fellow troops in Afghanistan. 'He came back alive,' Mora told the Los Angeles Times. 'So to die like this, it's not right.' Los Angeles police Lt. Paul Vernon told reporters that 'the ironies are obvious. To survive as a soldier in an overseas conflict, only to be killed in your neighborhood upon your return.'

'It appears Francisco was the target of the attack,' Vernon said. 'Apparently, a simmering dispute had boiled over during the night, and this suspect came looking for Francisco. Figuring out the dispute should lead us to the shooter.' Authorities talked to several witnesses and collected evidence, including several bullet casings. Brian Enriquez, 21, told the Los Angeles Times that he, Garcia and a group of friends left Garcia's girlfriend's house when she decided to go to sleep.

"Being both a famous actor and just 4-foot-2, Peter Dinklage gets a lot of stares on the street. But one time that distraction proved deadly when a motorcyclist in Los Angeles crashed and died after taking his eyes off the road to ogle at the 44-year-old actor. Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister on popular HBO series Game of Thrones, told Esquire about the incident that happened shortly after he hit it big in the 2003 film The Station Agent. Scroll down for video . Fatal glance: Peter Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister on HBO series Game of Thrones, says a motorcyclist died after getting distracted staring at him on a street in Los Angeles . Keep your eyes on the road: The accident happened one morning while he was walking down Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles (pictured above) 'I was walking down Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. There was this guy on a motorcycle right in front of me...maybe six feet? And he looked at me. He didn't wave, but he looked at me, and then he pulled out into traffic and this car, like, boom - killed him instantly.' Cover guy: Dinklage recalled the traumatic event in a recent interview with Esquire magazine . 'I was the last person he saw on earth,' Dinklage added. After the accident, Dinklage says he ran into a coffee shop and had somebody call an ambulance. By the time he got back outside the motorcyclist was already dead. Dinklage says he didn't get too close to the man, but felt an emotional connection after locking eyes just before the crash. 'There was this quiet moment where it was like I was the only person in the world who knew this guy was dead. And I was there looking at him, you know, in those moments of calm after something horrible happens, the calm before the melee starts, before the ambulances and the cops arrive and it becomes a scene. There was that moment when I was with him.' When the writer asks whether Dinklage is troubled for playing a role in the motorcyclist's death, he gets defensive. 'No! I never felt like that! Not at all. 'Oh,my God! F*** you. How dare... I never thought of that before. This was supposed to be a story about how I actually connected with a stranger...I'm gonna have nightmares tonight.' Dinklage went on to say that while most of his encounters with fans are just people trying to take his picture, some of the connections have been very meaningful. Like the time a woman came up to him crying. 'She didn’t seem crazy or anything, so I asked what was the matter,' he recalled. 'And she was like, ""I just wanted to tell you, my boyfriend died today. And The Station Agent was his favorite movie. This is like a sign that I saw you. I can’t believe this. May I please have a hug because I’m dying right now?""' 'And, of course, I gave her a hug,' Dinklage said. Game of Thrones returns for a fourth season on April 6.

"Not for Roger Federer the mad dash around Europe that Andy Murray is embarking on in order to qualify for next month's year-end festivities at London's O2 Arena. The Swiss master has long since qualified for the eight-man field, and while the 27 year-old Scot makes his late entry into this week's Vienna Open the question is whether, at 33, Federer can finish the season as world number one. Sunday's new rankings saw him back at number two ahead of Rafael Nadal and, based purely on points won in 2014, within one thousand points – potentially a week's work – behind Novak Djokovic. Roger Federer lets out a roar as the 33-year-old won his first Shanghai title on Sunday against Gilles Simon . As Federer reflected following his victory at the Shanghai Open on Sunday: 'Usually everything slows down at the end of the season. Not for me this time.' He was also referring to the fact that, following the Barclays ATP World Finals in London next month, he will play for Switzerland in this year's Davis Cup final, the only significant prize in tennis he has yet to win but which is now possible with Stan Wawrinka as his team-mate. Two variable factors are involved in this late season drama for Federer. One surrounds whether he will have the energy to carry it all off, as although he is off this week he is due to play in Basle, Paris and London before the Davis Cup. Federer kisses the trophy after winning the Shanghai Masters ahead of a busy end-of-season period . Confetti rains down as Federer receives his trophy in front of a capacity crowd at the Qizhong Tennis Stadium . The other, specifically relating to the ranking situation, is whether Djokovic will turn up in both Paris and London, which are the two remaining fixtures carrying heavy ranking rewards. His wife Jelena is due to give birth sometime next month (he has kept the due date secret), and that could affect his participation in at least one of those. Murray will play in Vienna, Valencia and Paris, making it six weeks' worth of consecutive tournaments as he tries to make it back into the world's top eight. Assuming everyone is fit and present in London, Murray is effectively battling five others players – Kei Nishikori, Tomas Berdych, Milos Raonic, David Ferrer and Grigor Dimitrov – for three places at the 02 from his current standing of tenth. Andy Murray is desperate to qualify for the World Tour Finals and is playing six tournaments in a row . Four have already qualified (Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and Wawrinka) while world number six Marin Cilic is a certainty due to an obscure rule that makes it easier for the season's Grand Slam winners to get in. The tennis season sometimes has a humdrum feel in October, but the fact that the spoils have been shared more evenly among the men this year has injected life into both the 'Race To London' and for the world number one position. It has led Murray to completely change his tune from what he said at the US Open, where he insisted that he would not overplay to try and make the field for London. The women's season-end finals, which take place next week in Singapore, had its field set relatively early, although there is a chance Maria Sharapova could overtake Serena Williams as world number one, especially as the American has been troubled by a knee injury.","The world No 2 has a packed schedule before the end of season tour finals .

"An eight-year-old schoolboy has married a 61-year-old woman because the ghost of his dead ancestor told him to. Sanele Masilela tied the knot with Helen Shabangu, who is already married and a mother-of-five. The boy, from Tshwane, South Africa, said he had been told by his dead ancestors to wed and his family, fearing divine retribution, forked out for a wedding. They paid £500 for the bride and a further £1,000 for the big day, which was organised in just two months.

It's already shocked the community but the family has defended the ceremony, saying it was just a ritual and not legally binding. Sanele's 46-year-old mum, Patience Masilela said: 'This is the first time this has happened in the family.

"A massive ancient subglacial trough deeper than the Grand Canyon has been discovered under Antarctica. Part of a massive ancient mountain range, it was found buried under several km of ice using specially developed penetrating radars. The massive subglacial valley is up to 3 kilometres deep, more than 300 kilometres long and up to 25 kilometres across, and in places, the valley floor is more than 2000 metres below sea level. All calm - the area above the giant mountain range, which is covered in upto 7km of ice . The massive subglacial valley is up to 3 kilometres deep, more than 300 kilometres long and up to 25 kilometres across, and in places, the valley floor is more than 2000 metres below sea level. The mountain range and deep valley were carved millions of years ago by a small icefield similar to those of the present-day Antarctic Peninsula, or those of Arctic Canada and Alaska. Researcher were able to chart it for the first time by combining data from satellites and ice-penetrating radars towed behind skidoos and on-board small aircraft. In fact, it is so large researchers say it can be seen from space - despite being several kilometres underground. The research involved scientists from Newcastle University, the University of Bristol’s Glaciology Centre, the British Antarctic Survey and the universities of Edinburgh, Exeter, and York. They charted the Ellsworth Subglacial Highlands – an ancient mountain range buried beneath several kilometres of Antarctic ice - by combining data from satellites and ice-penetrating radars towed behind skidoos and on-board small aircraft. The researchers spent three seasons investigating and mapping the region in West Antarctica. The mountain range and deep valley were carved millions of years ago by a small icefield similar to those of the present-day Antarctic Peninsula, or those of Arctic Canada and Alaska. Professor Martin Siegert, Professor of Geosciences at the University of Bristol, said: 'While the idea of West Antarctic Ice Sheet growth and decay over the past few million years has been discussed for decades, the precise location where the ice sheet may originate from in growth phases, and decay back to in periods of decay, has not been known. Of of the sub-ice radar images which helped researchers pinpoint the vast valley, showing the giant mountains ans passes between them . 'By looking at the topography beneath the ice sheet using a combination of ice-penetrating radio-echo sounding and satellite imagery, we have revealed a region which possesses classic glacial geomorphic landforms, such as u-shaped valleys and cirques, that could only have been formed by a small ice cap, similar to those seen at present in the Canadian and Russian High Arctic. 'The region uncovered is, therefore, the site of ice sheet genesis in West Antarctica.' The team’s analysis has provided an unprecedented insight into the extent, thickness and behaviour of this ancient icefield, and the configuration and behaviour of the early West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The subglacial landscape shows where and how the West Antarctic Ice Sheet originated and grew. It also provides important clues about the size and shape of the ice sheet in West Antarctica in a warmer global climate. The findings are published in the latest edition of the Geological Society of America Bulletin. Another image showing the vast valley, outlined in black here . The paper’s lead author Dr Neil Ross, from Newcastle University, said: 'The discovery of this huge trough, and the characterisation of the surrounding mountainous landscape, was incredibly serendipitous. 'We had acquired ice penetrating radar data from both ends of this huge hidden valley, but we had no information to tell us what was in between. 'Satellite data was used to fill the gap, because despite being covered beneath several kilometres of ice, the valley is so vast that it can be seen from space. 'To me, this just goes to demonstrate how little we still know about the surface of our own planet. The discovery and exploration of hidden, previously-unknown landscapes is still possible and incredibly exciting, even now.'The research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

"This was the shocking sight that greeted marketing executive  Jessica Sawyer when she returned to collect her £80,000 Bentley from a car wash. The black convertible should have been gleaming in the sunshine. Instead the bodywork was riven with dents, scratches and cracks after the car was crashed into a wall at Wash And Shine in Cheetham Hill, Manchester. Miss Sawyer said: ‘Fifteen minutes after I handed over the keys I got a call from the police telling me the car was in the side of the car wash. When I saw it I just started crying.’ Damage: Jessica Sawyer left her Bentley at the car wash but returned to find it in this state . Collision: Part of the car wash building was also destroyed when the vehicle was driven into it . She was given the car as a 30th . birthday present last December by her mother, who is the boss of the . family telecommunications firm. Miss Sawyer said her insurers had paid . the £48,000 cost of replacing the bodywork. Police told her the car wash driver . may have mistaken the accelerator for the brake on the automatic, but he . fled after the crash and has not been seen since. The wash owner said . he was not in charge at the time of the crash. Ms Sawyer, an advertising and marketing manager who lives in Bramhall, Stockport, is still waiting for repairs to be completed on her car after the vehicle's entire bodywork had to be replaced. She said: 'When I got to the car wash . that day I handed over my keys to the man washing the car in front of . mine and said I would be back in an hour. 'But 15 minutes later I got a call from the police telling me the car was in the side of the car wash. Upset: Ms Sawyer (left) is still waiting for repairs to be completed on her car after the vehicle's entire bodywork had to be replaced. Pictured right is the Bentley before the collision . 'I went back and when I saw it I was so upset I just started crying, then I got angry. 'The police officer there told me he thought the guy I'd given my keys to had mistaken the accelerator for the brake because it's an automatic and he'd seen it happen before. 'There was no engine damage but all the bodywork was damaged.' Her insurance company have also now had to take legal action against the car wash, after the owner claimed the man who drove it was not an employee. Work needed: The collision left the vehicle's bodywork completely wrecked to the tune of £48,000 . Ms Sawyer said: 'The insurance company have been amazing and have paid out - but the owner of the car wash has refused to admit responsibility. Now they are having to take legal action against them. 'The whole thing is so upsetting and disappointing and I want other people to know what has happened because I think they should take responsibility for what has happened.' When contacted the current owner of the car wash said he was not in charge at the time of the accident and said he had only taken over the business four weeks ago. He declined to comment further. A police spokesman said: 'Officers were called to the car wash on the day of the incident, by the business owner. 'The incident is now being treated as a civil matter between the car owner and car wash owner due to the many inconsistencies between the two accounts of what happened.'","Jessica Sawyer left £80K Bentley at car wash in Cheetham Hill, Manchester .

"Swathes of Slovenia have been entombed in a four-inch thick layer of ice after Eastern Europe was hit by a freak blizzard. Pylons buckled under the extraordinary . weather conditions, leaving more than 35,000 households - up to 100,000 . people - without power. The damage is expected to reach . €66million. But authorities are not yet able to reach more remote parts . of the country which have been cut off as the transport network failed. Scroll down for video . Frozen: A traffic island and road signs are buried beneath four inches of ice after an historic blizzard hit eastern Europe . Blackout: Towns and villages across Slovenia suffered power cuts as the electric grid began to collapse in the face of the historic blizzard . Rain brought in on a warm weather front . collided with freezing air hanging over much of the country, causing the . water droplets to turn to rock hard ice the moment they landed. Anything which come into contact with the rain was soon covered in a thick layer of impenetrable ice. Extreme weather chaser Marko Korosec took photographs of damage wreaked by the terrifying natural phenomenon. Mr Korosec, 32, said cars, buildings, bridges, roads, trees, road signs and powerlines disappeared in the storm's icy aftermath. Deep freeze: Trees are snapped like matchsticks under the weight of ice which have covered much of Slovenia . Entombed: An impenetrable layer of ice has enveloped vegetation after a record-breaking blizzard swept across Slovenia and parts of Europe . Ice . storms strike in Slovenia every few years, but this one was 'extremely . unusual' and covered nearly the entire country, he said. Mr Korosec, from south west Slovenia, said: 'We've been hit by a record breaking and historic ice storm. 'It brought an extreme black ice accumulation, at some places there was more than 10cm of ice thickness. Frozen solid: A car lies encased in a thick layer of ice as temperatures plunge in parts of Slovenia . Subzero: Freak weather conditions meant rain turned almost instantly to ice as soon as it landed - encasing swathes of the Slovenian landscape in frost . 'It . was brought about by the valleys being in negative temperatures, while . the upper levels were experiencing warm and above zero temperatures. 'Very heavy rain was falling for several days and rapidly freezing on everything. 'Ice storms happen every few years across some areas in Slovenia, but this one covered almost the whole country. 'That's extremely unusual and especially with so much damage done. 'Nearly half of all forests in the country were badly damaged or destroyed - that's approximately 500,000 hectares of woods. 'Numerous electric poles and powerlines were brought down and more than 100,000 people went without power for several days. Cold snap: The freezing weather brought transport links to a halt as ice made travelling treacherous . 'Railways were badly damaged too and it will take several weeks before they are all fully operational again. 'Some areas are still experiencing deep ice cover but it is expected to melt over the next couple of days as warm temperatures and rain are expected.' Mr Korosec, who lives in south west Slovenia, took the shots in the towns of Postojna, Pivka and Razdrto. The worst hit areas were those between 500 and 800 metres above sea level, he said. He added: 'The ice was very thick and strong, so much so that one could actually climb on it. 'It covered everything from cars, buildings, bridges, roads, trees, road signs to powerlines. 'I know it will take some days before it's all completely melted.' Clashing weather: A combination of a warm wet front meeting an unusually cold climate caused the rare ice storm to cover the landscape in stunning icicles . Treacherous: This steep descent, left, is made . almost impassible by the ice storm which caused pylons, right, to buckle . in the freak subzero temperatures . Mr Korosec, who works as a supervisor on motorway road weather information systems, said his home was on the edge of the disaster. The damage to Slovenia's infrastructure caused by heavy ice in the past week will cost at least €66 million ($89 million), although extensive forest devastation could push the sum much higher, government ministers said yesterday. Infrastructure Minister Samo Omerzel said damage to electricity powerlines was estimated at around €27million, plus another €10 million for the power distribution system. 'The damage is extraordinary because of broken (power) cables, fallen trees. Today we still have 35,000 households without electricity,' Omerzel told reporters after a cabinet session. Damage to the state railway was put at €20 million, while the repair of roads could cost at least €9 million, he said. Brittle: The record-breaking blizzard covered hundreds of miles of road in a thick coating of ice . Isolated: Government agencies have not yet been able to assess the true scale of the damage caused by the blizzard because swathes of the countryside are still cut off . The devastation, which will take months to repair, occurred mostly in west Slovenia where a freak ice storm coated parked cars, petrol stations, street signs and houses and brought down electricity lines and trees. The extreme weather comes at a bad time for the tiny EU member country, which is already going through the worst economic crisis in its two decades as an independent state, Slovenia narrowly avoided an EU/IMF bailout last year. Farming Minister Dejan Zidan said damage to forests, which cover almost 60 per cent of Slovenia, was staggering but could not be estimated just yet. 'We cannot remember ever having had this kind of damage,' he said. A detailed assessment would be possible only after more than 6,000 kilometres (3,750 miles) of backroads, clogged with snow, ice and fallen trees, are cleared. Zidan said Slovenia would soon start talks on 'favourable, long-term loans' with the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank. Local media reported that the government may also apply for funds from the EU's solidarity fund, set up for major natural disasters in member states.","Ice storm has caused €66million damage to Slovenian infrastructure .

"Euan Blair has bought a four-storey, £3.6million Georgian townhouse in central London to share with his new wife. The property, in Marylebone, has a master bedroom with en-suite bathroom, two further bathrooms and two reception rooms. The . 29-year-old, who is though to be preparing a bid to become an MP, . completed the purchase just days before he married Oxford graduate . Suzanne Ashman last month. Love nest: the new Mr and Mrs Blair (left) will be moving into their new £3.6million Georgian townhouse (right) soon having put the old house on the market for £1million more than tony and Cherie paid two years ago . Situated in West London the impressive property has easy access to Regent's Park, Madame Tussauds and Marylebone High Street. Euan . dated Miss Ashman for eight years before the pair finally got married . in The South Pavilion, the £5.75 million Grade I-listed mansion in the . Buckinghamshire countryside owned by Tony and Cherie. Euan is also thought to be making a move into politics by running as the Labour candidate for safe seat of Coventry at the next election, after Bob Ainsworth said he was stepping down. The couple are yet to move into their new home and are living in a slightly less lavish house about a mile away. The four-storey house bought for . £1.29million has been put on the market for . £2.35million – leaving the Blairs with a potential £1million profit in . just three years. On the market: The Central London property has an asking price of £2.35million . There’s one snag, however. The house is being marketed as containing a ‘separate apartment’, even though planning permission has never been obtained for one. The Central London home was bought in the name of Euan, 29, and his mother Cherie in 2010. It immediately attracted controversy because of an attempt to get planning permission to separate the basement into a self-contained flat. Westminster Council received an application to build steps down to the basement from the street, and to divide it into a separate flat. The internal stairs to the basement were to be removed. Three neighbours complained, fearing greater pressure on parking, rubbish collection and other services, and after advice from the council the application was amended. This application retained the new external entrance – and its own kitchen – and was duly approved. However, a council officer noted in June 2010: ‘This permission does not authorise the use of the basement as a separate self-contained flat.’ By May 2011, the council received a complaint that Euan had replaced a door to the upper floors with a wall, in an apparent attempt to create a separate basement flat. Following ‘enforcement action’ the council was told the wall was being replaced by a door. But last year, the battle to create a separate flat resumed and, at one stage, a new number was placed on the basement door, along with a letter box. The council again took ‘enforcement action’ saying that it received a report of ‘general nuisance (loss of amenity)’, involving the ‘use of the basement as a self-contained flat’. Visits from the council led to a denial from Euan that he was using his basement as a separate flat, and the action ceased. But the property is now being marketed by Sandfords estate agents as having ‘a separate apartment on the lower ground floor’ ideal for a ‘separate office or rental investment’. There is no warning it still needs planning permission. Last night sources at the estate agents claimed that the one-bedroom flat had been rented out for £1,200 a month. The source said a locked door on the stairs to the upper floors ensured the basement could be used as a separate home. Last night a spokesman for the Blairs refused to explain why both the house advert and estate agent suggested the basement was a self-contained home – but insisted Euan and Cherie had done nothing wrong. ‘Westminster Council has already accepted that there are two units, which is why it charges two separate council taxes,’ the spokesman added. A spokesman for Westminster Council said: ‘No planning application has been received to divide this house into two dwellings – and following information received we have now started an investigation.’ Another council spokesman said council tax valuations had no bearing on whether planning permission had been issued for the basement flat to be a separate dwelling. Last month Euan married girlfriend Suzanne Ashman, 25.","Purchase of four-storey mansion was completed days before wedding .

"Barack Obama has released a picture of himself skeet shooting in an attempt to silence his critics in the gun lobby who doubted if he had ever fired a gun in the ongoing gun control debate in Washington. The photograph of the president doing some recreational shooting at Camp David last August was published on Friday, after Mr Obama said in an interview that he enjoyed blowing off some steam at the range. Skeptics took the president to task after he expressed admiration for the sport, calling for some photographic evidence of the president taking aim. Scroll down for video. Guns a blazing: The White House released this picture, taken on Aug. 4, of the president skeet shooting after skeptics questioned Mr Obama's claim that he enjoyed shooting at Camp David . The picture was released nearly two months after the Sandy Hook massacre, as Democrats wrestle with gun lobbyists over tightening firearm restrictions. Amidst the debate, President Obama was asked whether he had ever fired a gun, in an interview with The New Republic published on January 27. 'Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time,' he said. 'Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there. And I have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations,' he continued. 'And I think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake.’ Really? Previously, the only firearm Mr Obama had been pictured with was a water gun . His comment was seen as a way to assuage conservatives angered by his plans to ban assault weapons as part of a drastic overhaul of gun laws. The Obama administration has called for new measures to curb gun violence in the wake of the December 14 shooting massacre at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut that claimed 26 lives. This week, the tragedy remained on the American consciousness as The Bipartisan Task Force on Gun Violence Prevention and Children's Safety convened in Newtown. Made up of 48 lawmakers from across Connecticut, the task force is focusing on school safety, mental health and gun violence. Emotions ran high as parents and relatives of the victims of the December shooting spoke at the hearing. Gun control was also the topic of a Senate Judiciary Committee this week, after calls from the Obama administration to impose stricter gun laws. California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein has introduced legislation that has been criticized by gun-rights advocates and the hearing was held to begin the Herculean feat of crafting legislation to satisfy both sides of the aisle. The Wednesday hearing on Capitol Hill began with a statement read by former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was injured in a January 2011 Tucson shooting. Tragedy: The nation was shocked when 20-year-old gunman, Adam Lanza, entered the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, CT on Dec. 14 and killed 20 students and 6 teachers . Scared: Chilling scenes, like this Sandy Hook student being escorted by police from the school on Dec. 14 after the shooting massacre, shocked the nation . But some were skeptical that the president was an avid gunman and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) even challenged the Commander in Chief to shoot with her. 'If he is a skeet shooter, why have we not heard of this? Why have we not seen photos? Why hasn't he referenced this at any point in time?' the Congresswoman said on Monday on CNN's 'Erin Burnett OutFront.' 'I tell you what I do think,' Ms. Blackburn said, 'I think he should invite me to Camp David, and I’ll go skeet shooting with him and I bet I’ll beat him.' Presidential pastime: John F. Kennedy skeet shooting at Camp David with actor David Niven and Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee in May 1963 . Hunter: Former President George W. Bush, pictured in October 1994, is an avid hunter . The image of the Democrat with a gun baffled others as well. 'It was a surprise to a lot of people in the industry when we saw that and heard that,' Michael Hampton Jr., executive director of the National Skeet Shooting Association - of which the president is not a member, told the New York Times. 'Officially we have no idea whether he does participate or not. Only him or his people would know that,' he had said. President Dwight Eisenhower installed the shooting range at Camp David in the 1950s . Reporters even quizzed White House press secretary Jay Carney the day after Mr Obama's comments were made public and the Obama adviser failed to provide details. 'I don’t know how often. He does go . to Camp David with some regularity, but I’m not sure how often he’s done . that [skeet shooting],' Mr Carney stated. 'When he goes to Camp David, he goes to spend time with his family and friends and relax, not to produce photographs,' he added. After . the media hoopla, the official White House decided to release a . photograph of the president, dressed casually in jeans and a black Nike . polo shirt, holding a rifle and shooting clay targets at the range at . Camp David, Maryland. The shotgun is cocked in Obama's left shoulder, his left index finger is on the trigger and smoke is coming from the barrel. Though the picture was taken on August 4, 2012, the photo was only released on Friday to silence skeptics. The shooting range at the presidential retreat was installed by President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s. The retired Army general enjoyed shooting and even brought visiting dignitaries, including Prince Charles, to join him. Presidents . John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush are among the former . U.S. leaders who have also been photographed packing heat. Mr Obama's predecessor, 43rd . President George W. Bush, is an avid hunter who enjoyed the sport at . his ranch in Crawford, Texas - which was dubbed the 'Western White . House' during his tenure. His Vice-President, Dick Cheney, also . enjoyed the practice but landed in a tight spot when he accidentally hit . his shooting companion, Texas millionaire Harry Whittington, while . quail hunting on a Texas ranch in February 2006.","President Obama said in an interview last week he enjoyed skeet shooting .

"Exotic tour: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are again heading to a deserted paradise island, only 18 months after their honeymoon in the Seychelles . Most couples can’t hope to manage a second honeymoon until retirement – if at all. For the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, however, it’s come around rather more quickly. Only 18 months after their honeymoon on the exclusive North Island resort in the Seychelles, the couple are again heading to a deserted paradise island – this time in the South Pacific. Kate and William will spend a night . on privately owned Tavanipupu island, famed for its crystal waters and . luxury hand-thatched bungalows, as part of their first official tour on . behalf of the Queen. Before . that the couple will travel to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Borneo and the . Solomon Islands, ending their nine-day trip on the South Pacific realm . of Tuvalu, the fourth smallest country in the world. They’ll . get up close and personal with wild orangutans, have an orchid named . after each of them and face the challenge of being carried from a plane . in a garlanded canoe. It . will be the biggest test yet of Kate’s much-praised fashion sense, as . she will need up to 30 different outfits, including one for a trek to . the jungle. The Queen is believed to be lending her several pieces of jewellery including, possibly, one of her favourite tiaras. Her . famous locks will be also well cared for – Prince Charles is privately . footing the bill for a freelance hairdresser to travel with them. And the couple have hired a private jet – paid for by the taxpayer –  for part of their trip. Sources . said it would be ‘absolutely impossible’ to travel to remote Tuvalu and . the Solomon Island otherwise. The Queen is still sovereign of both . countries. The tour has been organised to mark the Diamond Jubilee and many of the stops were chosen personally by the Queen. The . couple will also visit the Commonwealth nations of Singapore and . Malaysia on behalf of the British government to strengthen diplomatic . and trade links. Perfect beaches: The royal couple spent a night on the Tavanipupu Private Island Resort . Fit for royalty: The 'majestic' bed in one of the luxury bungalows where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stayed . It's a hard life: William and Kate will sail by traditional war canoe to the Tavanipupu Private Island Resort, which is known as one of the South Pacific's 'best kept secrets' Idyllic: The view from one of the verandas on privately owned Tavanipupu Island . Luxurious: One of the hand-thatched bungalows on the resort where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expected to stay . In . Singapore, where they land on September 11, William and Kate will be . afforded the honour of having an orchid named after each of them in the . Botanic Gardens. They will . then head to Malaysia, staying in the capital Kuala Lumpur, where the . duchess will give her first foreign speech abroad, at a hospice. The couple will also attend a glitzy dinner hosted by the country’s king in his palace. Then . they will fly on to Sabah, the Malaysian part of Borneo, and travel . deep into the jungle at Danum Valley, where they hope to climb into the . rainforest canopy and see wildlife including the endangered orangutan. On September 16 they will make their way to Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands. The . couple have been told to expect a colourful welcome – complete with . chanting warriors –  followed by a drive to the capital in an . open-topped vehicle decked in fresh flowers. Paradise: The Royal couple will take in Tuvalu, a Polynesian island located midway between Hawaii and Australia which is one of the most remote inhabited places on the globe . The Royal treatment: The couple will be carried from a plane in a garlanded canoe just like the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were during their visit to Tuvalu in 1982 . Animal watching: William and Kate will get up close and personal with wild orangutans in Borneo . Getting back to nature: The Duke and Duchess will also head deep into the jungle in the Danum Valley in Borneo . Another . traditional state dinner also beckons, although this one takes the form . of an outdoor island feast with meats cooked in underground barbecues. And . then, just when the endless rounds of smiles and handshakes may have . got a little too much, they will be whisked off to paradise – in a . traditional war canoe. The five-star Tavanipupu Private Island Resort is known as one of the South Pacific’s ‘best kept secrets’. It . says it offers ‘decadent king-sized beds, some of the best food on the . planet, crystal clear water teeming with life, a relaxing massage over . the water [and]  “real” local people who wait on you hand and foot  … in . one of the wildest places left on earth.’ The 37-acre island, discovered by Europeans in the 19th century, was once a coconut plantation owned by Norwegian traders. In . the 1970s it was bought by English interior designer Dennis Bellote and . his late partner Keith Paske, who turned the overgrown island into a . luxury five star resort. Poignant: The couple will be given the chance to view an orchid named after William's late, mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, which she never got to see . Stop off: On September 16 they will make their way to the Solomon Islands, which despite consisting of nearly 1,000 islands across 11,000 square miles, have a population of little over half a million . It . is currently up for sale for just over £7.5million. The royal couple . are believed to be staying there as guests of the Solomon Islands . government, which is anxious to promote tourism in the area. It . is expected they will stay in a £300-a-night hand-thatched bungalow . favoured by honeymooners which has been built over the crystalline . waters of the Coral Sea and boasts a ‘majestic’ king-sized bed carved . out of bamboo. Each of the resort’s eight bungalows has a personal attendant who can be summoned with a tap of a tribal drum. Aides . confirmed yesterday that the couple hope to do a little snorkelling . before retiring to bed for an early start to Tuvalu the following . morning. The Queen last visited the island  in 1982 when she was carried ashore with Prince Philip from Britannia in a canoe. This time William and Kate will arrive by plane but the locals are still determined to continue the custom. ‘We have really have no idea what to expect,’ their private secretary admitted yesterday. The . couple will be given a tour of the ten mile square island, including . the coconut tree that was planted by the Queen on her last visit. But . it will be rather less luxurious than their previous stop. The island . is plagued by ants and large rats, and the infrastructure is so limited . that the couple will stay in only the most basic of hotels.","Couple will take in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Borneo, the Solomon Islands and tiny South Pacific realm of Tuvalu .

"Father-of-two David Telles, 38, was jailed for six years at Exeter Crown Court after he flew 6,000 miles to sexually abuse a  14-year-old schoolgirl he groomed through online game Clash of Clans . A US paedophile who jetted across the Atlantic to sexually abuse a British teenager he seduced in a cult online game was behind bars today. Widower David Telles,38, posed as a schoolboy to target the impressionable 14-year-old as she played Clash of Clans on the internet. The father-of-two brainwashed the girl, who was 24 years his junior, into thinking she was in love  before convincing her to runaway with him. When they were found the child was even wearing an engagement ring the carpet fitter had given her. A judge sitting at Exeter Crown Court jailed Telles for six years after he admitted meeting a child following sexual grooming, abducting a child between June 14 and 18, three offences of sexual activity with a child, and engaging in a sexual act in the presence of a child. Adrian Chaplin, prosecuting, said Telles made contact with the girl online through the internet game Clash of Clans, which has a facility for players to chat privately with each other. At first he posed as a boy of about her age and they started exchanging phone calls in which they quickly became closer, each telling the other they loved them. Telles eventually revealed he was a 38-year-old widower with two teenage children of his own but by then the girl was infatuated by his attention and replied 'age is just a number'. Mr Chaplin said Telles knew the girl's true age and must have known she was vulnerable because she told him she was unhappy at school. She was also self harming. Exeter Crown Court was told the carpet fitter travelled 6,000 miles from his home in California to Heathrow and hired a car to drive to Cornwall where he picked her up the teenager. The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, fled her family home in the middle of the night with some clothes and her passport after climbing out of her bedroom window. Mr Chaplin said: 'The girl's parents thought she was in bed but the next morning found a note which said 'I am gone. I will be back, I love you'. Telles and the girl stayed together at hotels in Cornwall and Exeter, Devon, for two nights before her family and the police tracked them down. 'Inquiries with her mobile phone company showed a large number of calls to a number in America,' said the prosecutor. The father and the police called the number and spoke to Telles and the girl and eventually persuaded him to meet them at pub car park where he was arrested in a major police operation involving the force helicopter. The girl at first denied there had been any sexual acts between them. It took two months before the girl got over her infatuation and told the police the truth. She also revealed he had put pressure on her to keep quiet, telling her she would ruin his life and he might die in jail. She also told police Telles had asked her to take her passport with her when she climbed out of her window in the dead of night and met him in his hired car at the end of the road. Joss Ticehurst, defending, said Telles of of Pleasanton, California, was likely to face more charges when he is deported back to the US at the end of his sentence. He will lose his business, will be banned from living near any school and has already lost contact with his own children aged 14 and 16. He said there was no element of force or coercion in either the abduction or the sexual acts which followed and Telles had been traced and arrested because he cooperated with the police and the girl's parents. David Telles, 38, who had two teenage children, groomed the girl through online game Clash of Clans . He said: 'The girl knew he was 38. She packed a bag and went to his car. It was not some snatching of a girl against her will. She had access to his phone and could have used it on many occasions when she was alone. 'On one occasion they went to a filling station and she had a conversation on her own with the attendant in which she was said to be chatty, relaxed and happy.

'You asked her to bring her passport with her and it wasn't as if she needed that to get from Cornwall to England.

"The family of a Texas teenager sentenced to probation after killing four people in a drunken-driving wreck will pay for just a fraction of his court-ordered treatment, a court official testified Friday. Ethan Couch's parents will be charged $1,170 a month for his treatment at the North Texas State Hospital in rural Vernon. That amount would cover less than two days of treatment, which costs $715 a day, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. Couch's case drew national attention due in large part to his defense's argument that his wealthy parents had coddled him into a sense of irresponsibility - a condition that a defense expert called 'affluenza.' 'Affluenza': Ethan Couch killed four people last year when he crashed into the back of a disabled vehicle while he was driving drunk . Couch, 17, killed four people last year when his vehicle rammed into a crowd of people trying to help the driver of a disabled vehicle south of Fort Worth. Investigators said he was driving his family company's pickup truck while drunk and with traces of Valium in his system. Couch admitted to causing the wreck and received 10 years' probation from State District Judge Jean Boyd rather than prison time, as prosecutors and Couch's victims wanted. Several of his victims have since sued the Couch family, with most of them reaching confidential settlements. Debbie Spoonts, placement supervisor for Tarrant County Juvenile Services, said the facility decided what Fred and Tonya Couch would pay based on a sliding scale. Blaming the parents: Tonya Couch, left, and Fred Couch, Ethan's parents, offered to pay for treatment at a California rehab facility that costs $450,000-per-year . A message from The Associated Press . seeking comment from Spoonts on the facility's payment policy was not . immediately returned Friday. The . teen's family previously had offered to pay for Couch to go to a . $450,000-a-year rehabilitation center near Newport Beach, Calif. Boyd . rejected that request. Ethan Couch's attorney, Reagan Wynn, and Fred and Tonya Couch did not speak to the media after the hearing. Lance . Evans, the attorney for Couch's parents, said after the hearing that . the family 'respects the decision of the facility and of the court, and . will honor the payment system that the court has put in place.' Kevin . McConnell, the father of a child who was injured in the wreck, declined . to comment after the hearing on whether the amount the Couches will pay . is fair. 'That's not my call,' McConnell said. 'We have a criminal justice system and a legal system. That's not my call to make.' McConnell's family is suing the Couches. He said they will not accept a settlement and instead want a jury trial. Killed: Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were helping out the driver of a broken down SUV when they were struck and killed by Couch's out-of-control pickup . Victims: Breanna Mitchell,  and Brian Jennings, 41, were both killed in the horrific crash . Mr & Mrs Couch have paid undisclosed sums to the families of three who died. Pastor .

"A vigil for a 17-year-old who died in police custody in North Carolina ended in violence on Thursday. The march was intended as a peaceful memorial for Jesus Huerta, who died in the back of a police car of a gunshot wound to the head last month. Police, some dressed in riot gear, used tear gas and batons to disperse the crowd of about 150 friends, family and supporters as they marched towards Durham Police Department. Grief and anger: Protesters held the vigil for teen Jesus Huerta who died last month while in police custody . Police line: Officers in riot gear shadowed the protesters as they moved from Durham's downtown to the police department and back again . The supporters began at Durham City Hall and marched towards Durham Police Department, shadowed by police. According to the News Observer, as the crowd surged towards the Police Department parking lot police commanded them to leave. No answers: Jesus Huerta died last month of a gunshot wound to the head while his hands were cuffed behind his back . The crowd continued into the parking lot, some carrying signs that read 'Murdered by police.' A coordinator of the vigil, Rafael Estrada Maya called for quiet and restraint. 'We are praying! Respect prayer! Respect the dead,' he pleaded over a loudspeaker. The crowd departed the parking lot and began to move back towards Durham's downtown area where younger members of the crowd chanted and threw firecrackers at the ranks of armed riot police. Smoke bombs and tear gas were released and according to a witness, police beat protesters with sticks. 'They didn't really look like batons or night sticks, but they were thinner and longer and they were reaching over the banner whacking people with them,' said David Kaplan. 'They were clearly upset with the fact that people were out expressing themselves and upset at the fact that it appears they murdered a 17-year-old child.' Police Chief Jose Lopez said his officers were restrained in their treatment of the protesters. 'I could not be more proud of the restraint and professionalism demonstrated by our officers,"" Durham Police Chief Jose Lopez said in a statement to the media. 'There was a march. The peaceful intent did not exist. We used the best practices in law enforcement,' he said at a news conference Friday. At least six protesters were arrested. Broken up: Police used smoke bombs and tear gas to disperse the protesters, who had planned a peaceful vigil . Jose Huerta's sister Evelin Huerta says police . 'The actions of the Durham Police Department, led by Chief Lopez, last night were a tried-and-true tactic to intimidate and spread fear in our community,' she said. 'We call on Chief Lopez to resign immediately in light of his leadership that put dozens of armed police on the streets to scare residents and turned a memorial vigil into a war zone last night. We will not be intimidated by Chief Lopez and the Durham Police Department's tactics.' The Durham Police Department says that Jose Huerta died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound while he was sitting, handcuffed, in the back of a police cruiser. He had been taken into custody by Officer Sam Duncan for a second-degree trespassing violation at around 3am on November 19. Intimidation: Huerta's family say police tried to intimidate and spread fear among protesters who are demanding answers in the death of the teen . Force: Police pin a protester to the ground during the memorial for Jesus Huerta . According to CNN, Police Chief Lopez told a press conference that gunshot residue tests conducted on Huerta revealed a 'saturation' of gunshot residue on the gloves Huerta was allegedly wearing, while Officer Duncan's hands had none. Police say the gun used in the shooting was not a police department weapon, but it is standard procedure to search suspects before they are placed in a vehicle for transport. The case is still under investigation by the State Bureau of Investigation. It was the second such event for Jesus Huerta that has erupted in violence. A protest last month ended with arrests and damage to police vehicles. The Huerta family is calling for a federal investigation and demanding that the police department release all information pertinent to the case. The family intends to hold vigils on the 19th of every month in Huerta's memory until that time.","A vigil was held Thursday for a teen who died in police custody in Durham .

"Their plight has never been so desperate - the African elephant is hurtling towards extinction as a result of mass poaching, according to campaigners. It is estimated that more than 20,000 were killed on the continent last year for their ivory tusks - which earn a fortune as they are traded illegally in China and south-east Asia. Their tragic situation has led British wildlife photographer, Paul Goldstein, to make an impassioned plea to the public about elephant conservation - using his majestic photo album, taken over 25 years of watching the animals. The award-winning photographer, from Wimbledon, south-west London, has also spent 16 years working as a guide for Exodus travels, a company that specialises in adventure holidays. In the lead up to World Elephant Day on August 12, Mr Goldstein is urging people to spare a thought for the fate of elephants, which some believe could be poached to extinction in little more than a decade. He has spent 25 years in the African bush capturing the animals on camera while also giving lectures on wildlife, photography and conservation. He co-owns Kicheche Camps in Kenya, a base for luxury safaris, and has previously run marathons in a 10ft Bengal tiger suit to raise money and awareness for the animal. Despite the elephants' grave situation, Mr Goldstein believes collective action could still save the wonderful species from becoming a footnote in history. The last decade has seen a huge rise in poaching, with organised crime syndicates and rebel militias looking for ways to fund their operations in Africa, becoming increasingly involved. The demand for ivory, also referred to as white-gold, is at its highest in China, where it is used in decorations and in traditional medicines, fueling a multi-billion-pound illicit trade.

In 2011, about 25,000 of the world's largest land mammals were killed and the number was around 22,000 in 2012 .

"These are the Second World War bunkers that still crouch on the landscape as echoes of the biggest conflict in history.

The Type L483 transmitter bunker, Spaarndam, . Netherlands: Graffiti artists have given this inland fortification, just . east of Haarlem, a second, less destructive chance at life as a canvas . for their typographical artworks . The 42-year-old, originally from . Stockport, Cheshire, but now living in Amsterdam, Holland, started his . bunker odyssey in 2009 and has now visited them all over Europe. 'I . originally found the  geometry and shape of the structures fascinating . and the fact that they were just left standing alone in a farmer's field . or on a beach,' he said. 'It . was as if they were still on guard but nobody had told them the war is . over. Once I started photographing them it was impossible not to be . moved by what the buildings symbolised and what they have witnessed.' Vital defences: Field Marshal Erwin Rommel inspects the Atlantic Wall fortifications in France in March 1944, three months before the D-Day landings that spelled the beginning of the end of the Nazi empire in Europe . Built by thousands of forced labourers, the Atlantic Wall fortifications stretch from the Spanish border to the northernmost tip of Norway. Begun in 1942, following the devastating raid by British commandos which destroyed the dry dock at St Nazaire, they were strengthened in 1944 on the orders of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, who believed Germany could not resist an invasion of Europe were it not stopped at the beach. He ordered strings of concrete pillboxes built along the coast, as well as the planting of anti-tank obstacles and millions of mines, in the hope his forces could destroy an Allied invasion force before it could gain a toe-hold. The defences were never completed and, as history shows, they were insufficient to hold back British and U.S. troops as they flooded into Europe on D-Day. However, in subsequent years, their existence was used to answer Soviet charges that Western leaders had delayed the opening of a second front in Europe. Most of the structures photographed . for Mr Andrew's set are part of the Atlantic Wall fortifications, put up . by the Nazis between 1942 and 1945 in anticipation of an Allied . invasion of the continent from Britain. The . first were chosen simply because the Netherlands-based photographer had . noticed them while driving between assignments, and been taken by their . surreal, decaying aesthetic. But . subsequently he began to hunt down more and more unusual bunkers dotted . around the coast and countryside of north-west Europe. He . researched online, used Google maps and scoured history books in the . search for more of these ghosts of Europe's brutal wartime history. 'Obviously a lot of them are the . same, so I avoid repeating myself,' Mr Andrew said. 'I choose them by . design, concentrating on those which are unusual.' He added: 'It's almost absurd that these things are still there. 'The . shape of them is purely functional, it's just this weird shape and if . you didn't know anything about it you would think ""what's this?""' Mr Andrew uses a special technique to . photograph his bunkers that gives them their eerie glow, making them . seem almost like the apparitions of fallen soldiers. He . explained that each photograph is taking just on the cusp of . night-time, in a 15-minute time window just as the last light of the day . fades. Each is the product . of a long, 10-minute exposure, with Mr Andrew walking around the . structures with a strobe flash to shine light on them from every angle. He . must dress all in black, with his face covered by a black balaclava, as . he carries out the lengthy process to ensure that he does not appear in . the final image. 'The technique I use when I photograph the bunkers means that I have a 10 to 15 minute window of opportunity to photograph them,' he said. He explained that he must capture them in perfect light conditions just as day turns to night. 'I walk around the structures with a strobe and flash them,' he added. 'They are very long exposures of about 10 minutes each.' D-Day landings: A U.S. Coast Guard landing barge, tightly packed with helmeted soldiers, approaches the shore at Normandy, France, during initial Allied landing operations, on June 6, 1944 . The first wave: American soldiers swarm from their landing craft towards the beaches of Normandy, where they faced fierce resistance from Wehrmacht soldiers holed up in the bunkers lining the shore . Only the brave: After landing at the shore at Normandy, these British troops wait for the signal to move forward into the French countryside . Mr Andrew says his favourite image is . the anti-submarine defences at Cramond Island, near Edinburgh, one of . the few in his set to show British fortifications. 'I . think that these structures almost look like the Easter Island . statues,' he said. 'There's something very strange about them. The . pattern they make coming out of the water I find very haunting and I . didn't expect there would be any bunker kind of stuff in Edinburgh.' Another curious bunker photographed by Mr Andrew is the observation tower for a dummy airfield in Fliegerhorst, Belgium. Alexandre . Moretus, current owner of the land in which the bunker sits, told him: . 'Did you know this observation tower was a part of a decoy (fake) airfield intended to distract allied air attacks. 'This was not a success in this case... The allied bombed it but... with wooden bombs.'

We had some defences too: The Cramond Island submarine defence boom, near Edinburgh, Scotland, which are Mr Andrew's favourite in the entire collection . 'I'm not trying to make an anti-war statement': Nevertheless, Mr Andrew, pictured, who photographs the bunkers between paid assignments, says it is 'impossible not to be moved by what the buildings symbolised and what they have witnessed' The photos were not . taken to make an anti-war statement, Mr Andrew said, but to offer an insight into a . fascinating chapter in history. 'As . a photographer you try and point things out to people which you find . beautiful or fascinating and ask them to take a longer, closer look,' he . said. 'I'm not trying to . make an anti-war statement but just bring them to peoples attention, . show people these amazing buildings, steeped in such incredible history . are still scattered throughout Europe's fields and dunes. 'I work on the bunker photographs only in the winter, it's taken about three winters to photograph the collection so far. It's a personal project, so I have to find time between my regular paid assignments. 'It's surprising to see some bunkers being used by farmers for other purposes, such as storing animal feed, farm equipment etc. I'm also amazed at the shear number of them still around, some in very good condition.'

"William Spiller, pictured with his partner, Glenys Molyneaux, was allegedly killed by his son Nathan Robinson after a row over money . A man killed his 25-stone father and then 'carefully' dismembered his body and 'neatly packaged' the body parts in plastic storage boxes which he used as a television stand, a court has heard. Nathan Robinson used a Stanley knife and hacksaw to cut up the body of his father, 48-year-old William Spiller, at the flat they shared in Bournemouth, Dorset. The 28-year-old is on trial at Winchester Crown Court accused of the murder of his taxi-driver father, which he denies. The jury was shown photographs of the flat, including plastic boxes containing body parts which were stacked with a television placed on top. They were also shown the  filing cabinet with the box containing Mr Spiller's head inside. Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Robinson killed his father on May 16 last year, following an argument over money. He said that a neighbour who lived below the pair noticed a 'pink liquid' was dripping through the ceiling of his bathroom. The prosecutor said that this was diluted blood as Robinson cleaned up the crime scene with a floor and a steam cleaner which he went out to buy after he killed his father. Mr Lickley said: 'Mr Spiller was a large man, 6ft 5in, he weighed in excess of 25 stone in weight, hence I say when his body was cut up and dismembered, it would have taken time and effort. Armed with a Stanley knife, small hacksaw and a saw, it would have been a messy business.' He added that the body parts had been 'packaged neatly' in the boxes. The prosecutor said that Robinson attempted to cover up the killing and had created a 'things to do' list including paying the rent on the property, which was his first action after the incident. He also used his father's mobile phone in the following weeks in an attempt to pretend that he was still alive. After paying the rental company at their offices in cash, he then went to a store and purchased the cleaning equipment. The neighbour who spotted the dripping blood had previously heard an argument coming from their flat in which the deceased said: 'Do you expect me to keep subsidising you for the rest of my life?' Mr Spiller's dismembered body was found at the pair's home in Bournemouth after a neighbour saw liquid dripping through his roof . When he went to investigate the liquid, the defendant answered the door and was described as 'very calm, just normal, very collected, there was nothing to say he had just had a fight with his dad'. Mr Lickley said that Robinson's actions meant that his father's body was not found until a month later, on June 17, after his father's partner, Glenys Molyneux, reported him missing to police because he had stopped replying to text messages. She believed he had been visiting a friend in the West Midlands. Mr Lickley said: 'Dorset Police attended the flat, they noted strong smells and flies, alive and dead, in the hallway leading up to the property. 'They entered and they found Mr Spiller within the bedroom area, his body had been dismembered, that is cut up, deliberately and carefully and placed in plastic storage boxes together with items of clothing. 'Mr Spiller's head had been removed, cut off, and was found within another box within a filing cabinet in the bedroom.' Robinson spent hundreds of pounds drinking and socialising in Glasgow after killing his father, a jury at Winchester Crown Court (pictured) was told . The prosecutor added: 'In one of the boxes was a Stanley knife with a relatively small but sharp blade, a saw and a small hacksaw - the tools, the Crown say, which were used to kill and cut up the body of Mr Spiller.' Mr Lickley said that Robinson took at least £7,750 in cash belonging to his father and on May 22 went to visit friends in Glasgow where he spent up to £300 'drinking, eating and socialising', all the time sending text messages purporting to come from his dead father. He then used more money stolen from his father to pay for a weekend with his mother, who was separated from Mr Spiller, to stay at a hotel in Bristol for a vegan weekend. When he was later arrested at his mother's home in Birmingham, Robinson said to police: 'Is this a joke?' Robinson denies murder but admits manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility.

"A spectacular row broke out last night over Alex Salmond’s alleged attempts to silence a leading Scottish academic who questioned independence. The first minister tried to force Louise Richardson, Principal of St Andrews University, to tone down warnings about the adverse impact of a Yes vote. A source said he spent ten minutes attempting to ‘put words in her mouth’. Scroll down for video . Alex Salmond is said to have pressured Louise Richardson (right), Principal of Scotland's oldest university . Leaked emails revealed how the SNP leader’s special adviser, Geoff Aberdein, urged Professor Richardson to attack the Westminster government over funding for higher education, the Daily Telegraph said. He reportedly emailed her press secretary with a suggested statement, reading: ‘The Scottish Government has risen to the challenge on fees in stark contrast to the government south of the border and I’m sure they can rise to the challenge on research funding as well.’ But in a reply, Professor Richardson wrote: ‘I’m sorry but I’m afraid I cannot agree to this statement.’ It is also claimed the First Minister called Professor Richardson, the first female principal of the 600-year-old institution, and told her to rectify remarks she made about the consequences of Scotland leaving the UK. Flying solo: The row started in March last year as Professor Richardson warned independence could prove ‘catastrophic’ for St Andrew’s if it threatened access to £3billion of UK scientific grants handed out each year . A source familiar with the conversation said that the First Minister spent 10 minutes attempting to ‘put words in her mouth’ about the impact of independence. The row started in March last year as Professor Richardson warned independence could prove ‘catastrophic’ for St Andrew’s if it threatened access to £3billion of scientific research handed out each year by the UK. Prof Richardson added St Andrews was concerned about the funding gap left by English students . She challenged the SNP government’s assumption that an independent Scotland would be able to ‘buy into’ the funds administered by Research Councils UK, which give Scottish universities a lucrative share of national funding. She told the Times newspaper: ‘If we were cut off from national research councils it would be catastrophic for this institution. 'We would lose our top academics, we would fail to attract serious academics [from other countries].’ Prof Richardson added that St Andrews was concerned about the funding gap that would be left by English students who would no longer be liable to pay their £9,000 tuition fees because they would be treated in the same way as other EU students. In November last year, Prof Richardson urged her staff to reject ‘external pressure’ to take a certain stance on independence, and said she was concerned that academics ‘may feel constrained about speaking publicly on the issue or fear adverse consequences if they do’. In a letter to all members of staff, she wrote: ‘I would very much hope, however, that university staff feel no constraints whatever in expressing their views, whatever they are, on the issue of independence. ‘Indeed I would encourage you to do so. At times of national uncertainty the public justifiably look to universities for reasoned debate and considered argument and I think it incumbent upon us to provide just that. ‘Whether or not my personal views are in accord with yours, any external pressure to limit or suppress debate will stop at my door.’","First Minister 'put pressure' on St Andrews principal Louise Richardson .

"The pilot of the missing Malaysia  Airlines flight was in emotional turmoil over the break-up of his marriage, his family have revealed. Speaking about the mystery for the first time, the wife and daughter of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah said the 53-year-old pilot had been distracted and withdrawn in the weeks before the aircraft’s  disappearance – and refused pleas to attend some marriage counselling sessions. Three weeks after Flight MH370 went missing with 239 crew and passengers aboard, investigators in Malaysia believe that someone – possibly the captain – deliberately steered the Boeing 777 off course after communications were cut. Scroll down for video . Close: MH370 pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah with his daughter Aishah. She has claimed he had been distracted and withdrawn in the weeks before the aircraft's disappearance . The plane is thought to have flown hundreds of miles out over the southern Indian Ocean where it eventually ran out of fuel and plunged into the sea. No suicide note has been found and no motive established, but police are continuing to concentrate their inquiries on the pilot’s  background and whether his state of mind before the flight may be a factor. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the pilot’s wife, Faizah Khanum Mustafa Khan, has told investigators that he stopped speaking to her in the weeks before the fateful flight on March 8, and spent time alone in  his room where he had built a flight  simulator. ‘He just retreated into a shell,’ she said. Meanwhile, Aishah Zaharie, 28, the pilot’s daughter, said that in her last conversations with her father, she barely recognised the man who used to dote on her. ‘He wasn’t the father I knew. He seemed disturbed and lost in a world of his own,’ she said. Last week, Faizah and Aishah, along with other family members, were interviewed in detail by police in Kuala Lumpur. The lengthy interviews, described in detail to The Mail on Sunday by a source close to the pilot’s family, revealed that: . Family portrait: Captain Zaharie with wife Faizah and two of their children. He was reportedly on the brink of divorcing her after nearly 30 years of marriage . Plush: The family home in an upmarket Kuala Lumpur suburb . Despite the pilot’s behaviour, his family are convinced that he was  not responsible for the plane’s disappearance . Faizah, who was just 16 when she first met Zaharie, broke down repeatedly during two lengthy interviews with police, the family source said. One of the interviews lasted more than four hours. She was initially reluctant to discuss the breakdown of her marriage, and refused to accept her husband might be involved in the flight’s disappearance, protesting: ‘It’s unfair to blame my husband.’ However, over the course of the interviews, she told police how her husband became increasingly distracted in the months leading up to the flight. ‘I found him distant and difficult to understand,’ she said. She told investigators that although they continued to live in the same house, Zaharie spent his time alone. Faizah said her husband was so withdrawn he hardly spoke to his sons and was not close to them. ‘He just retreated into a shell,’ she said. When he wasn’t working, Zaharie spent ‘more time with friends than with family members’. She confirmed they had spoken of separating but had not taken any formal steps towards getting a divorce. The 53-year-old pilot had been under suspicion after investigators discovered a flight simulator at his Kuala Lumpur home . The pilot's wife has told investigators that he stopped speaking to her in the weeks before the fateful flight on March 8, and spent time alone in his room where he had built a flight  simulator . She said he appeared agitated and to . be suffering from ‘frayed nerves’. Of his three children, Zaharie . appears to have been closest to Aishah, who flew back from Melbourne, . Australia, to be with her family after MH370 went missing. She . spoke to her father by phone in the weeks before the flight,  and told . investigators: ‘He wasn’t his usual self. He was distant and cranky.’ The hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines aircraft was set to resume today. Nine ships and ten planes  will cover a 97,000sq mile  area where search teams  have so far failed to recover  any confirmed debris from  flight MH370. Chinese aircraft have spotted objects that were white and red – the same colours as the aircraft – but these items have yet to be conclusively linked to the passenger jet, which disappeared three weeks ago with 239 . passengers and crew on board. Investigators hope that locating debris will help narrow the search for the ‘black box’ recorders. However, a shortage of live satellite data and adverse weather conditions are hampering the operation. The investigation is being led by the Malaysian authorities. Meanwhile, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority is  co-ordinating the search 1,150 miles off the coast of Perth in an area of the Indian Ocean that is one of the world’s  most remote and least researched areas. Aishah said her father spoke to her . about his marital problems and told her he didn’t think they could . reconcile. In their conversations, he asked her how she would feel if . her parents divorced. Aishah said she tried to persuade her father to seek the help of Islamic elders to try to mend the relationship but he refused. The daughter told investigators she did not know if there was another woman in her father’s life. Although . Aishah does not appear to have spoken to her father on  the day the . flight disappeared, she told investigators she knew from friends in . Kuala Lumpur he was upset and felt ‘utter frustration’ over the jail . sentence given to Anwar Ibrahim. Zaharie was a fervent supporter of Anwar, a pro-democracy icon in Malaysia who was jailed for five years for sodomy hours before Flight MH370 took off for the final time. Anwar’s supporters believe it was a politically motivated prosecution. Despite her father’s personal problems, Aishah told investigators she did not believe he could be in any way responsible for the flight’s disappearance. ‘I don’t believe he would ever intentionally endanger the lives of his crew and passengers,’ she insisted. Investigators also spoke to the pilot’s two sons – Ahmad Seth Zaharie, 26, a languages student, and Ahmad Idris Zaharie. Ahmad Seth told them he had ‘barely spoken’ to his father in the weeks before the flight disappeared, even though they shared the same house. Ahmad Idris posted a message on Facebook thanking someone for a poem written in support of his father which he said had helped to counter the ‘wounds and sadness’ from ‘baseless accusations made against my father’. Police interviews with family members have confirmed that the pilot – who lived with his family in an upmarket suburb of the Malaysian capital, close to the international airport – did not have any obvious financial problems. The Mail on Sunday revealed last weekend . that police had not, at that time, interviewed the pilot’s wife in . detail, partly because of cultural sensitivities in asking direct . questions to people in grief or distress. The plane is thought to have flown hundreds of miles out over the southern Indian Ocean where it eventually ran out of fuel and plunged into the sea . The softly-softly approach frustrated FBI officials working alongside Malaysian federal police. British intelligence agents are also helping in the investigation, The Mail on Sunday has been told. News of the interviews came as the search for remains of the  plane continued. A Chinese and an Australian ship retrieved objects from the sea 1,150 miles off Perth, Western Australia, but none was confirmed to be from the missing flight. Chinese aircraft also flew over the search area, and reported spotting three orange, white and red objects floating in the sea. However, officials cautioned that they may be junk rather than wreckage from the aircraft. Britain's only contribution to the vast fleet of vessels scouring the Indian Ocean in search of the jet is not expected to arrive until ‘mid to late this week’. Survey ship HMS Echo is sailing 6,000 miles to join the operation after its captain received orders in the Arabian Gulf to head for the west coast of Australia. Last night former Defence Intelligence chief Air Marshal Sir John Walker said Britain’s contribution of one ship and no aircraft ‘is an indictment of how we’ve disarmed ourselves’. He added: ‘We decommissioned the RAF’s fleet of Nimrod [patrol aircraft] and failed to replace it. With this we lost our maritime surveillance capability and a lot of expertise that would also have proved ideal.’ Personnel from the Met Office, the Hydrographic Office and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) are providing behind-the-scenes support to the search operation. The Ministry of Defence is also assisting  the Malaysians with  imagery analysis. Meanwhile, China has sent the largest number of ships assembled outside its national waters in modern history. Defence experts in the region claim that China’s vast flotilla of search vessels has a dual purpose – to send a warning signal to Japan and the Philippines, its maritime rivals in the Far East, with whom it is embroiled in a number of territorial disputes.","Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was about to divorce his wife of 30 years .

"A Las Vegas man’s apartment was searched and cordoned off by police after he was presumed dead and mistaken for a look-alike who had committed suicide. Rob Ponte, 31, a Zappos employee, was shocked when he got home Monday night to see his apartment sealed with coroner’s tape. When he went inside he could see that investigators from the Clark County coroner’s office and Las Vegas police had rummaged through his drawers and his computer had been searched. Look-alike: Rob Ponte, 31, a Zappos employee in Las Vegas, was assumed dead after police and coroner's investigators thought he looked like man who was found dead near his home Monday . ‘They were searching for a suicide note,’ Ponte told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Police had found the dead body of a man in an alley at 330 S. 7th St, near Ponte’s Towne Terrace home. An apartment manager had given them a copy of Ponte’s driver’s license, according to Clark County Coroner Mike Murphy, who said the two men looked similar. Although the identity hadn’t been established through fingerprints or other scientific tests, investigators proceeded as if the information was correct, he said. ‘Honestly, it looked like it was that guy,’ Murphy told the Review-Journal. ‘[The photo] was certainly close enough for us to think it was him. So we started from there.’ Discovered: Police had found the dead body of Ponte's look-alike in an alley at 330 S. 7th St, near Ponte¿s Towne Terrace home in Las Vegas . Suicide: Ovik Banerjee, 24, a University of North Carolina graduate, has been identified as the man who killed himself by jumping from a nearby building, according to authorities . His office released the jumper’s real identity on Wednesday. The dead man is Ovik Banerjee, a University of North Carolina graduate, who came to Las Vegas as a fellow in the 2012 class of Venture for America, a program that connects graduates with businesses. The 24-year-old worked with the Downtown Project, a $350 million real estate development and small business and technology investment project to revive downtown Las Vegas, according to his personal website. Banerjee’s death was ruled a suicide. ‘We are deeply saddened by the passing of our friend and colleague Ovik Banerjee,’ a Facebook post from the Downtown Project stated. ‘He was a caring, bright, and incredibly kind person, and he will be missed.’ The post prompted an outpouring of support and grief from dozens of people who described Banerjee as ‘an amazing light’ and someone who ‘spread enthusiasm and kindness’. 'Caring': Banerjee's personal website says he was from Alabama. The 24-year-old was described as a 'caring, bright, and incredibly kind person' by the Downtown Project . According to Banerjee’s personal website, was from Alabama and had degrees in biology and environmental science. ‘I firmly believe that everyone in the US should dedicate at least a year of their life between the ages of 18 and 26 to service, because at no other point in one’s life is someone as able-bodied, energetic, and unencumbered by other obligations,’ Banerjee wrote in a post dated October 2, 2012. On his Twitter page, Banerjee called himself an ‘explorer, adventurer, entrepreneurial apprentice, and inquisitive twenty-something looking for new experiences.’ His last Twitter post, on January 1, asked fellow Vegas friends for a lift from the airport for a ‘wayward Indian’. It is not clear why he committed suicide. Not going to sue: Ponte says police apologized to him for their mistake but added that it was a violation of his privacy. He does not plan to take further action . Ponte says police apologized to him for their mistake, according to the Review-Journal. Murphy said coroner’s investigators don’t need a warrant to enter someone’s home and secure the property, unlike detectives investigating a possible criminal case. A suicide investigation is a civil matter, he said. ‘We’re protecting property,’ he said. ‘Part of what our job is to do is to inventory it so some friend with a key or manager doesn’t come in and start taking stuff. ‘We’re not looking for criminal activity, we’re looking for information related to the incident, and information that may lead us to the next of kin.’ Ponte said someone called his mom, but she didn’t answer. Thankfully, they didn’t leave her a voicemail, he said. He said he doesn’t plan to sue but was slightly annoyed at the inconvenience. ‘It wasn’t a mess but clearly everything was rummaged through so I felt my privacy was violated. But I do understand how it would have happened.’","Rob Ponte, 31, a Zappos employee, came home Monday night to see his apartment cordoned off .

"They’re the upmarket vegetables that we order from a menu but for many of us they’re too intimidating to cook at home. Celeriac, artichokes and sweet potatoes are counted among the sides that people like to order at a restaurant but are clueless when it comes to preparing them in our own kitchens. Research by Marks & Spencer found that almost three quarters of customers buy and cook more vegetables than they did in the past, and are trying branching out in their vegetable choices. And a sizeable 57% said they now consider interesting vegetables to be a meal in their own right, rather than just an accompaniment to a meat dish. Artichokes are counted among the sides that people like to order at a restaurant but are clueless when it comes to preparing them . But research has found that while we may be keen to try more adventurous vegetables, we don’t know how to prepare or cook for ourselves. The survey found that 35% of customers would use exotic vegetables such as pak choi, okra and beetroot at home if they were pre-prepared and ready for cooking. Customers classified these vegetables as ‘difficult to cook’ as opposed to broccoli, carrots and mushrooms, which were described as easy to cook but ‘boring’. But now supermarkets are responding to the British desire to push the culinary boundaries. Marks & Spencer has launched the UK’s first miniature sweet potato, ‘Glorious Sunshine’ as a result of finding that customers were unsure how to cook and prepare normal bulbous sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes are another favourite vegetable that people are not confident to cook with . The baby sweet potatoes are a third of the size of their traditional counterparts and are more tender and cook much faster. M&S Vegetable Buyer, Louisa Read, said: ‘After seeing the research that our customers found sweet potatoes one of the most difficult vegetables to prepare and cook we wanted to offer something that reduced the hassle. ‘Both delicious and nutrient-packed these baby versions can be roasted whole. And with more fibre, less calories and less carbs they are a healthy and delicious alternative to white potatoes.’ Last month Waitrose announced the launch of baby avocadoes in its ‘Essentials’ range, which join the ranks of baby carrots, baby corn and baby asparagus as the pint-sized plants in supermarket aisles. The demand for a wider variety of vegetables in supermarkets comes as many people choose to move away from a carnivorous diet to a plant-based one, as well as the craze for ‘superfoods’ – foods which contain high levels of vitamins and minerals. Out of the 3,000 people surveyed, almost half said they are trying to eat less meat, and a quarter (23 per cent) are trying to replace meat with more beans, lentils and pulses.","M&S study found that almost three quarters of customers buy more veg .

"Not many houses can boast of being owned by a former prime minister, hosting Sir Winston Churchill for regular lunches and having had Margaret Thatcher as a close neighbour. But Holwood House, a sprawling mansion just east of the village of Keston, Kent which is dubbed ‘the original Chequers’, also has the price tag to match its illustrious history. The 25,000-square foot house has been put up for sale for £12million, further evidence of the booming property market in the South. The Grade I listed mansion is set in stunning parkland grounds and features views of Canary Wharf and is only a short distance from Biggin Hill where the new owner can park their private jet . An energetic new owner will be able to work out in one of the two gyms or the private indoor pool installed by the current owner, City banker Martin Zapico . The gold-themed master bedroom has two dressing rooms and a private lounge . The huge sum is a far cry from the house’s celebrated links to the abolition of the slave trade. Its former owner, William Pitt the Younger, who became the youngest Prime Minister in 1783 at the age of just 24, paid just £8,950 for the house in 1785 despite his ‘consistently unsteady finances.’ The story goes that Mr Pitt and his friend and fellow politician, William Wilberforce, sat together under a large oak tree in the grounds and discussed the abolition of slavery. The walls on the staircase are adorned with suitably traditional and period appropriate paintings . On 12 May . 1787, Mr Wilberforce wrote in his diary: ‘At length I remember after a . conversation with Mr Pitt in the open air at the root of an old tree at . Holwood just above the steep descent into the vale of Keston, we . resolved to give notice on a first occasion in the House of Commons of . my intention to bring forward the abolition of the slave trade.’ The tree became known as the ‘Wilberforce oak’ which stood for many centuries before it perished during the Second World War. It is not the property’s only claim to fame. Charles Darwin, the famous naturalist, loved the parkland and regularly had picnics with his family there, conducting experiments and observations. During the Second World War, Sir Winston Churchill also used to ‘dine regularly’ at the Grade 1 listed house. Today the house strikes a rather different tone. It is currently owned by City banker, Martin Zapico, 46, who bought it for £2.5million in October 2002. He has flamboyantly re-decorated the house in a style more commonly associated with a Premier League footballer. Some of its most opulent features include a gold-themed master bedroom with two dressing rooms and a private lounge. It has a further five bedrooms – and four extra bedrooms in the ‘staff wing’. It has not one, but two gyms, as well as an indoor swimming pool, a home cinema, a tennis court, a summer house and a substantial games room with a snooker table. The estate is a short drive to Biggin Hill airport, which is convenient if the new owner has a private jet they like to use, and is about 14 miles from both Sevenoaks in Kent and Canary Wharf. Unusually, it has 40 acres of land but still has a view over Canary Wharf, the business district in east London. Fans of Horrid Henry might recognise the house as it was used in the making of the 2011 film of the popular children’s books by Francesca Simon. It appears in the dream sequence in the film, starring Angelica Huston, Richard E Grant and Jo Brand, when Henry wants to be a rock star. James Crawford, a partner in Knight Frank’s prime country team, the estate agency which is selling the property, said it is ‘one of the most important houses in private hands within the M25’. He said: ‘It is a fabulous family home refurbished to a high standard and offering a range of leisure facilities. ‘To own 40 acres of private parkland within view of Canary Wharf is a rare asset.’ Simon Gooch, the author of ‘Holwood – A stroll around the estate’, said: ‘It is a really handsome building and there are lots of very mature trees around it. Whoever buys it is very lucky.’ Early 17th Century The first version of the house is built and is used variously as a hunting retreat and gathering place for the politicians of the time. 1785 William Pitt the Younger, Prime Minister between 1783-1801 and again in 1804 until his death in 1806, buys the house for £8,950 and uses it as a retreat from the Westminster bubble. The house has been dubbed ‘the original Chequers’. 1850s Charles Darwin and his wife Emma, who live nearby, are frequent visitors. The grounds have twice been proposed as a UNESCO world heritage site due to this link to the famous naturalist. 1862 The ‘Wilberforce Oak’, where Mr Pitt and William Wilberforce discussed the abolition of slavery, is commemorated by a stone seat put in place by Lord Stanhope, a relation of Mr Pitt. 1871 The widowed Marchioness of Salisbury rents Holwood House and marries Edward Stanley, the 15th Earl of Derby and Foreign Secretary in Disraeli’s administration. They moved from their country retreat in 1873 and snapped up the nearby Keston Lodge a year later. Later, the couple buy Holwood House for £60,000. 1940s Descendants of the family continue to live in the house throughout the war, and regularly host Sir Winston Churchill. 1950s Margaret Thatcher – who is not yet a Tory MP - and her family move into a house on the nearby Keston Park estate. 1953 A company called Seismograph Services makes Holwood House into its headquarters for geo-physical studies. 2002 Bought by its current owner Martin Zapico for £2.5m. 2014 On sale for £12 million. As well as two gyms and an indoor swimming pool, the house features a summer house and a substantial games room with snooker table . The property is being sold by Knight Frank who have described Holwood House as 'one of the finest Grade I listed Palladian mansions within easy reach of London' Enthusiastic home cooks will love the marble topped surfaces in the enormous kitchen, although with a staff wing containing four bedrooms, the new owner may not necessarily be preparing their own food .

"A woman diagnosed with an advanced HIV infection may have caught it by sharing manicure equipment with a cousin who didn't realise she was HIV-positive . A 22-year-old woman was diagnosed with HIV after having her nails done using shared manicure equipment. Doctors say the case, detailed in a medical journal, has revealed a new form of transmission for the virus. However the researchers warned that transmission through shared manicure equipment is a 'very rare event' and the risks of infection from new sources are still very low. When diagnosed, the woman was found to have advanced HIV, according to the report in the journal AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses. But she had none of the usual risk factors for acquiring the virus, which is most commonly caught by having sex without a condom. It can also be passed on by sharing infected needles and other injecting equipment, and from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding. However, the woman did report having shared manicure instruments years before with a cousin who was later found to be HIV-positive. Blood analysis suggested the woman contracted the virus around ten years ago. Further genetic analysis of the viruses from both patients suggested it came from a common ancestor, indicating the possibility HIV was transmitted through the manicure instruments. Dr Brian Foley, of the HIV Sequence Database at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said the case should not make people scared of contact with people with the virus, as the risk of infection is very low. He said: 'HIV is not transmitted by casual contact, such as sharing eating utensils, or drinking from the same water glass. 'This transmission of HIV by shared manicure equipment is a very rare event that should serve not to make people fear HIV or contact with HIV-infected people.' However, the case could promote caution around sharing items which may contain blood, he added. He said: 'It should make people aware that sharing any utensils with possible blood-blood contact, such as needles used for drugs, tattoos, or acupuncture can result in transmission of viruses such as hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV. The HIV virus (pictured) is most commonly caught by having sex without a condom. It can also be passed on by sharing infected needles and other injecting equipment, and from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding . 'In addition, there are other common viruses and bacteria that can also be spread by sharing equipment without proper disinfection between users.' HIV is transmitted from one person to another through bodily fluids including blood, blood, semen, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids and breast milk. It must enter directly into a person's bloodstream through an injection with a needle or syringe, or come in contact with damaged tissue, or a mucous membrane. Mucous membranes can be found inside the mouth, the vagina, the opening of the penis, and the rectum. Dr Michael Brady, Medical Director at Terrence Higgins Trust, echoed that this is a rare case. He said: 'This is a highly unusual case. It is often very difficult to be certain as to the source of an HIV infection – especially one that happened over a decade ago – and it is hard to imagine how HIV could be caught from manicure equipment. 'In the UK the vast majority of HIV infections are passed on through unprotected sex. I don’t think this single case need change our simple message that the best ways to prevent HIV infection are to use condoms and test regularly for the virus'.","The woman, 22, was diagnosed with advanced HIV virus .

They are having thyme-roasted turkey and honey-baked ham, cornbread stuffing and oyster stuffing, braised winter greens and macaroni and cheese. Don't forget the green bean casserole, sweet potato gratin, mashed potatoes and dinner rolls. And despite the lavish spread, the president himself will be picking up the bill. Gary Walters, who was chief White House usher for many years, said the payment rule dates back to 1800 when the White House was first occupied by President John Adams and there was no staff. Presidents brought staff with them and paid for everything. Congress gradually began spending money to maintain an official White House staff to oversee operations and maintenance, but presidents continued to pay for personal expenses. What it boils down to, Walters said, is that the White House is first and foremost the president's home. The president said in his weekly radio and Internet address that the first family planned to spend the day with friends and family - catching up, eating good food and watching some football. He says Thanksgiving is his favorite holiday 'because, more than any other, it is uniquely American.' Obama also called U.S. troops to thank them for their service - a tradition he often upholds on Thanksgiving. On Wednesday Obama and his family handed out canned and fresh vegetables and bread to clients of Bread for the City, a center in southeast Washington that provides food, clothing and other services to the poor. They were joined by Michelle Obama's mother Marion Robinson. In time-honored tradition he also pardoned the National Thanksgiving Turkey.

Obama hands out Thanksgiving food to the needy on Wednesday as part of his annual tradition . The president said in his weekly radio and Internet address that the first family planned to spend the day with friends and family - catching up, eating good food and watching some football . In the spirit of the holiday, Obama on Wednesday took 'action fully within my legal authority, the same kind of action taken by Democrats and Republican presidents before me,' to pardon the National Thanksgiving Turkey, a 49-pound bird named Cheese. He also spared an alternate turkey, a 47-pounder named Mac. Both came from Cooper Farms in Oakwood, Ohio. 'If you're a turkey, and you're named after a side dish, your chances of escaping Thanksgiving dinner are pretty low,' Obama said at the annual event, which drew international media coverage. He was accompanied by his daughters, Malia and Sasha, who declined his invitation to pet the birds. 'No,' Malia said. The ceremony was moved indoors because of cold, wet weather that blanketed Washington. 'So these guys are well ahead of the curve. They really beat the odds,' he said of Mac and Cheese. The president obviously enjoys the annual Thanksgiving turkey pardon, but his daughters looked like they would rather be anywhere else this week .","Thyme-roasted turkey and honey-baked ham, cornbread stuffing and oyster stuffing, braised winter greens and macaroni and cheese .

"Tout: John Smith, chief among the touts, is pictured at Southfields tube station in London, where he asks passing fans if they want to buy tickets . They are the most sought after Centre Court seats, reserved for royalty and dedicated – and very well-heeled – Wimbledon fans. But exclusive ‘debenture’ tickets for the Championships are being sold on for massive mark-ups by touts. Over the past two weeks, street dealers are thought to have made hundreds of thousands of pounds selling debenture tickets for cash in hand. Yesterday, fans accused the All . England Club of allowing the abuse. They are  furious at traders . flooding the exclusive stands with the ‘wrong sort of people’. Some . 2,500 Centre Court and 1,000 No1 Court debenture tickets are sold at a . premium by the All England Club to raise money for refurbishments. Owners get tickets each day for five years. There . is huge demand for the seats, which cost £27,750 for the five years . until 2015. While other Wimbledon spectators are banned from selling . their tickets, debenture holders may do so – usually to companies . offering corporate hospitality or via stockbrokers. But . this privilege is being abused by businessmen who buy the debenture, . then employ touts to sell tickets for a massive mark-up. With . such tickets going for £1,000 to £3,200 a day – and for up to £25,000 . for a pair for the men’s final – over five years they are likely to make . huge gains. This week, the . Mail saw touts exchange wads of cash with punters yards from the courts. Re-selling is not illegal, so all police can do is issue dispersal . notices, forcing touts to leave for just 24 hours. John Smith, chief among the touts, arrives at Southfields station each day to ask passing fans if they want tickets. He agrees fees outside before . exchanging money behind closed doors. Some touts work out of cars, while . others use a Coral betting shop. If police vans arrive, Smith darts . into a taxi. Celebration: Mr Smith agrees fees outside before exchanging money behind closed doors. At about 4pm on Tuesday, he celebrated with three bottles of white wine (pictured) on the terrace of the Norbiton Cafe . At about 4pm on Tuesday, he . celebrated with three bottles of white wine on the terrace of the . Norbiton Cafe in Kingston upon Thames. His friends drank, smoked and . sang as he did more deals on the phone. As . Andy Murray was losing to Grigor Dimitrov at about 2.30pm on Wednesday, . Smith sold a Centre Court ticket for £500 for just one afternoon. He said: ‘They cost £50,000 to buy for five years, don’t they? They’re on the stock exchange. There’s no problem at all. ‘Yesterday we got a couple of phone calls from hotels, they were for £900 each.’ Secretive: An unknown ticket tout sells tickets to a woman in the back of her Mercedes near to Wimbledon . Closing the deal, he added: ‘You get access to the debenture lounge. Enjoy!’ Smith said he had semi-final tickets for £2,300 and men’s final tickets for £3,200 each. On ticket site Viagogo, a pair of these tickets was listed at £25,000. Genuine debenture holders said touting was bringing down standards. The strict dress code rules have been relaxed this year, allowing fans to wear trainers, jeans and shorts. One ticket holder said: ‘These seats are meant to be for real tennis fans, who are willing to pay a lot of money to guarantee they can get a seat. Sought-after 'debenture' tickets for Wimbledon's Centre Court costing £27,750  - which . allow ticket-holders to attend every day for five years - are being sold . by touts for up to £3,200 per day . 'Nothing is being done to stop people buying them to sell them to anyone. Just look around at who has got in here today.’ Another added: ‘We pay a  lot of money for our tickets. It’s a shame to turn up and see people in jeans and t-shirts.’  Tennis tournaments are excluded from legislation that bans touts at football games. But touting is still against street trading laws. A Met Police spokesman said it had set up a dispersal zone to help move on anti-social touts.

"A person’s race is still a major factor when picking a partner, according to a study of dating app users. Research examining the preferences of Facebook dating app, Are You Interested (AYI) found black men and women receive fewer responses to their messages. It also found that men from all different races prefer a partner of another race over their own. The study found men respond to women around there times more often than women reply to men's messages and that the women studied were mostly drawn to white men . The data comes from AYI, which claims to be one of the largest Facebook dating apps with over 70 million users and is similar to Tinder. It works by letting people looking for a date, or something more casual, flick through profiles of users and click ‘yes’ to show their interest or ‘skip’ to move on to the next. When a user clicks ‘yes’ the person they are interested in receives a notification that someone is interested and has the chance to respond. The study looked at the gender and ethnicity of the people who responded to a ‘yes’ notification, Quartz reported. Research examining the preferences of . Facebook dating app, Are You Interested (AYI) found black men and women . receive fewer responses to their messages . Researchers for the app looked at 2.4 million heterosexual interactions by users who are mostly aged 35 and over, to collect the statistics. The study found black men and women get the lowest response rates to their messages. Most men prefer Asian women (with the exception of Asian men,) while all women (except black women) are most drawn to white men, according to the research. Interestingly, it found men from all racial groups tend to prefer women from races other than their own. The study said Asian women seem to favour advances from white men, as they responded to ‘yes’ messages almost eight per cent of the time – more than any other race. Most men prefer Asian women (with the . exception of Asian men,) while all women (except black women) are most . drawn to white men, according to the research . The data suggests that men are least likely to respond to ‘likes’ from black women and did so 7.5 per cent of the time, which is less often than for Asian, Latino and White women. Men respond to women around there times more often than women reply to men’s messages. However, the findings said men tend to be drawn to women from another race, contrast sharply with another recent study. Sociologist Professor Kevin Lewis, from the UC San Diego Division of Social Sciences, found members of dating sites are most likely to contact individuals who share their own racial background on dating websites. He studied the interaction patterns of 126,134 users of dating website OkCupid.com in the U.S. over a  two-and-a-half month period. The sociologist found the tendency to initiate contact with someone from a shared race, is strongest among Asians and Indians and weakest among whites, the study said. Researchers for app, Are You Interested, looked at 2.4 million heterosexual interactions to collect statistics. The data suggests black men and women got the lowest response rates to their messages . While he said white people were the most likely to consider relationships with people from other ethnic backgrounds, he said the biggest 'reversals' in preference, are observed among groups that display the greatest tendency towards in-group bias. Professor Lewis' study also found that a person who is contacted by someone from a different racial background for the first time is more likely to reply, which he explains using his theory about 'pre-emptive discrimination'. 'Based on a lifetime of experiences in a racist and racially segregated society, people anticipate discrimination on the part of a potential recipient and are largely unwilling to reach out in the first place,' he said. 'But if a person of another race expresses interest in them first, their assumptions are falsified and they are more willing to take a chance on people of that race in the future.' However, he warns that the effect is sort-lived as people go back to habitual patterns in around a week. The data suggests men are most likely to message a woman of a different race to their own, but a recent study by sociologist Professor Kevin Lewis, found members of dating sites are most likely to contact individuals who share their own racial background .","Data from Facebook dating app, Are You Interested, found men from all different races preferred a partner of another race over their own .

"British Airways announced tough new security measures last night which will see passengers barred from US-bound flights if their electronic devices are not charged up. In preventing passengers from flying, the airline is going one step further than the guidelines issued on Sunday. These stated that gadgets will be confiscated before boarding if their owner fails to switch them on and prove they are not packed with explosives. The US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has said it will not allow mobile phones – especially the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy – on to planes bound for the U.S. from some international airports if the devices are not charged. But British Airways’ rules could see travellers with uncharged electronic devices – some of which are notorious for having short battery lives – not only lose their gadgets but also their seats on the flight. Not taking any chances: British Airways is going one step beyond TSA's new security regulations and will kick passengers off U.S.-bound flights if they are found boarding with an uncharged electronic device . And unwitting passengers whose batteries have run out during a stop-over, before taking a connecting flight to the U.S., face being stranded, unable to continue their journey. A spokesman from British Airways confirmed its new policy, telling MailOnline: ‘If [customers] are unable to power up their electronic device they will not be allowed to fly. 'If it does not power up then it cannot be placed in hand or hold luggage. We advise our customers to please do all they can to ensure that any electronic device they have is fully powered before you arrive at the airport. ‘For people transferring we advise that they use electronic devices sparingly if they are going to fly on a long journey before getting to London and then transferring on to a US destination.’ The airline also admitted that there will be limited charging facilities at check-in, so there is little chance of any last-minute powering up. Still unclear is what will happen to the confiscated devices. Whether they will be returned to their owner or destroyed. Special attention: The TSA in the US has announced that iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones will come under strict scrutiny . The heightened security comes amid reports two terror networks are working together on a bomb that could evade existing detection measures. In addition to cellphones, U.S. officials are concerned that laptops, tablets, cameras, e-readers, music players and game consoles could be used to conceal a bomb carried by an operative of al-Qaeda. 'The danger with electronic devices is . the ability to hide something metal, like a military or commercial . detonator, which makes a bomb extremely reliable,' former ATF Special . Agent in Charge Jim Cavanaugh told NBC News. Even more concerning is the fact that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, aka ISIS), the extremist group currently taking control in Syria and northern Iraq, could be working in conjunction with Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). In 2009, AQAP's lead bomb maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, built an underwear bomb used in a failed attempt to bring down a plane bound for Detroit. Threats: U.S. officials fear al-Qaeda bomb maker Ibrahim al-Asiri (left), the man who supplied failed Christmas Day bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab (right), is working on a new device to give to one of the thousands of Westerners who have joined the jihad cause for ISIS . Abdulmutallab's plan to blow up a flight bound for Detroit, Michigan on Christmas Day 2009  was foiled when the explosive designed by al-Asiri failed to detonate . Al-Asiri, 32, continues to work in Yemen which has U.S. officials worried, especially if he is working to supply one of the thousands of Westerners who have joined up with ISIS jihadists in the Middle East and could be carrying passports allowing easier travel. The TSA did not disclose which airports would be conducting the additional screening, but industry data shows that more than 250 foreign airports offer nonstop service to the U.S. London Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport, may be the hardest hit with hundreds of outbound flights to the U.S. carrying thousands of passengers every day. The airport issued a statement following the new regulations, advising passengers on U.S.-bound flights to make sure their electronic devices are charged before arriving at the airport for travel. U.S. officials singled out particular smartphones, including the Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy, for security screening on direct flights bound for the States from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. There's also concern that a hard-to-detect bomb could be built to hide in a shoe, an anonymous U.S. official told Reuters. That fear was intensified on Sunday when a man being screened at the Detroit airport was found concealing a knife in his sneaker. Hiding places: On Sunday, a man in Detroit was stopped after TSA agents found a knife hidden in his shoe . For now the rules are only in place for U.S. bound flights at foreign airports, and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson refused to say whether the tough regulation could impact domestic flights soon. 'We continue to evaluate things,' he said on Meet the Press. 'In this instance we felt that it was important to crank it up some at the last point of departure airports and we'll continually evaluate the situation.' The BA spokesman added: ‘Safety and security is our top priority at all times and we continue to work closely with airports and governments around the world.‘ . 'We are complying with the US regulations and would advise customers to arrive in good time for their flights both at check-in and also at the boarding gate ... our flights continue to operate as normal.’","Tough new flight security measures announced last week amid concerns terrorists are developing new hard-to-detect bomb .

"They are the smart glasses that let wearers see information in their peripheral vision as well as take photos in the blink of an eye. But while Google Glass may sound cool to tech-heads, the search giant’s inability to offer its smart spectacles to the general public, means that the spy-movie worthy gadget is being ditched by developers. After two years of wearing his pair to high-profile events, even Google co-founder Sergey Brin turned up without his pair to a Silicon Valley red-carpet event on Sunday, saying that he had left them in his car. Scroll down for video . While Google Glass (pictured) may sound cool, the search giant’s inability to offer its smart spectacles to the general public, means that the spy-movie worthy gadget is being ditched by developers . While Mr Brin, who heads up the secret lab which developed Glass, did recently wear them to the beach, his timing is not auspicious as many developers and early Glass users are losing interest in the much-hyped, $1,500 (£959) test version of Google Glass. The spectacles comprise a camera, processor and stamp-sized computer screen mounted to the edge of eyeglass frames in order to show users information on the lenses. Glass may have some specialised uses in the workplace but its prospects of becoming a consumer hit in the near future are slim according to many developers and Google has pushed back the roll out to the mass market. Of 16 Glass app makers contacted by Reuters, nine said that they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them, mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the device. Three more have switched to developing for business, leaving behind consumer projects. Plenty of larger developers remain with Glass. Among the 100 apps available are Facebook, but Twitter recently defected. Of 16 Glass app makers contacted by Reuters, nine said that they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them, mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the device. This is despite Google trying to make its smart specs more fashionable. Frames designed by Diane von Furstenberg are shown . In April, Google launched the Glass at Work program to help make the device useful for specific industries, such as healthcare and manufacturing. So far the effort has resulted in apps that are being tested or used at companies such as Boeing and food chain Taco Bell. Google is selling Glass in bulk to some businesses, offering two-for-one discounts. CrowdOptic, which uses Glass as portable computers for surgeons and other people out of offices, is currently in use at 19 US hospitals and expects that to grow to 100 hospitals early next year, said Chief Executive Jon Fisher. Alex Foster began See Through, a Glass advertising analytics firm for business, after a venture firm earlier this year withdrew its offer to back his consumer-oriented Glass fitness company when it became clear no big consumer Glass release was imminent. ‘It was devastating,’ he said. ‘All of the consumer glass start-ups are either completely dead or have pivoted,’ to enterprise products or rival wearables. ‘If there was 200 million Google Glasses sold, it would be a different perspective. 'There's no market at this point,’ said Tom Frencel, the Chief Executive of Little Guy Games, which put development of a Glass game on hold this year and is looking at other platforms, including the Facebook-owned virtual-reality goggles Oculus Rift. Several key Google employees instrumental to developing Glass have left the company in the last six months, including lead developer Babak Parviz. Google insists it is committed to Glass, with hundreds of engineers and executives working on it, as well as new fashion-focused boss Ivy Ross, a former Calvin Klein executive. Tens of thousands use Glass in the pilot consumer program. ‘We are completely energised and as energised as ever about the opportunity that wearables and Glass in particular represent,’ said Glass Head of Business Operations Chris O'Neill. Google Glass was the first project to emerge from Google's X division, which is also creating self-driving cars. It’s thought that it will take time for such ground-breaking technologies, including wearables such as smartwatches and Glass to evolve into a products that click with consumers. ‘If there was 200 million Google Glasses sold, it would be a different perspective. There's no market at this point,’ said Tom Frencel, the Chief Executive of Little Guy Games, which is looking at developing games for other platforms, including the Facebook Inc-owned virtual-reality goggles Oculus Rift (headset pictured) Mobile game company Glu Mobile was one of the first to launch a game on Glass. While Spellista (pictured), a puzzler released a year ago, is still available, Glu has discontinued work on it, a spokesman for the company said, perhaps due to limited customers using Glass . ‘We are as committed as ever to a consumer launch. That is going to take time and we are not going to launch this product until it's absolutely ready,’ Mr O'Neill said. Mr Brin had predicted a launch this year, but 2015 is now the most likely date, a person familiar with the matter said. After an initial burst of enthusiasm, signs that consumers are giving up on Glass have been building. Google dubbed the first set of several thousand Glass users as ‘explorers,’ but as these people hit the streets, they drew stares and jokes. Some people viewed the device, capable of surreptitious video recording, as an obnoxious privacy intrusion, deriding the once-proud explorers as ‘Glassholes.’ ‘It looks super nerdy,’ said Shvetank Shah, a Washington, DC-based consultant, whose Google Glass now gathers dust in a drawer. ‘I'm a card carrying nerd, but this was one card too many.’ Glass now sells on eBay for as little as half list price, while some developers have claimed they felt unsupported by investors and even Google itself. Google Glass was the first project to emerge from Google's X division, which is also creating self-driving cars (pictured). It’s thought that it will take time for such ground-breaking technologies, including wearables such as smartwatches and Glass to evolve into a products that click with consumers . The lack of a launch date has given some developers the impression that Google still treats Glass as an experiment. Matthew Milan, founder of Toronto-based software firm Normative Design, which put a Glass app for logging exercise and biking on hold, said: ‘It's not a big enough platform to play on seriously. Mobile game company Glu Mobile, known for its popular ‘Kim Kardashian: Hollywood’ title, was one of the first to launch a game on Glass. While Spellista, a puzzler released a year ago, is still available, Glu has discontinued work on it, a spokesman for the company said. But there are still some enthusiastic developers. Cycling and running app Strava finds Glass well-suited for its users, who want real-time data on their workouts, said David Lorsch, vice president of business development. And entrepreneur Jake Steinerman said it is ideal for his company, DriveSafe, which detects if people are falling asleep at the wheel. This graphic reveals how Google's prototype driverless car looks and works. The car makes turns and reacts to vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do, and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read, in real-time, what other objects are actually doing . The prototype two-seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive. The car makes turns and reacts to vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do, and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read, in real-time, what other objects are actually doing. The route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to Chris Urmson, the leader of Google's self-driving car team. The car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100miles (160km) before charging. Its shape suggests a rounded-out Volkswagen Beetle - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face. The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen, in a bid to be safer for pedestrians. In these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph (40kph) and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles. Ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use Google's extended maps service. Driving works by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree ‘view’, with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘see’ and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights.","Delay in releasing Glass to public means developers are ditching device .

"Following Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin's comments on rape, his fellow Republicans have turned on him - not to mention he has earned the ire of the President himself. Distancing themselves from the man who made the statement that the victims of 'legitimate' rape don't get pregnant because the 'female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,' prominent Republican party members have demanded that he step down. Republican Mitt Romney said that Mr Akin's comments on rape are 'insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong.' President Barack Obama called Mr Akin's statements on rape and abortion 'offensive' and 'way out there' on Monday, and said politicians should not be making healthcare decisions on behalf of women. Mr Akin does have one ally for staying the race from opponent Claire McCaskill, who said today that the 'people of Missouri' ought to make the final call on his politics. Scroll down for video . Alone: Following aspiring Missouri Senator Todd Akin's repellent comments on rape, his fellow Republicans have turned on him . Opposition: President Barack Obama chimed in calling sentiment 'way out there' Distance: Republican Mitt Romney said Monday that Todd Akin's comments on rape are 'insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong' 'This statement is kind of a window into Todd Akin’s mind,' Mrs McCaskill said on MSNBC. Mr Akin has served six terms and describes himself as Missouri's most conservative congressman a description Mrs McCaskill has pounced on, warning her constituents of the dangers of a 'true conservative.' Mr Romney said he has 'an entirely different view' than Mr Akin's, calling the candidate's comments 'offensive.' The GOP presidential candidate also called on Akin to correct his statements. President Barack Obama also took the opportunity to chime in, voicing his own opinion about women's rights. 'The views expressed were offensive,' Mr Obama told reporters in the White House briefing room today. 'Rape is rape and the idea that we should be parsing and qualifying and slicing what types of rape we are talking about doesn't make sense to the American people and certainly doesn't make sense to me.' 'First of all, from what I understand from doctors, (pregnancy from rape) is really rare,' the GOP stalwart told KTVI-TV. 'If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.' He went on to say: 'But let’s assume that maybe that didn’t work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.' Many were in disbelief that someone could present such an argument. Voicing his opinion: Rep Akin spoke to TV station KTVI in St Louis about rape . Fight: Mr Akin does have one ally, however, in his opponent Claire McCaskill, who said today that the 'people of Missouri' ought to make the final call on his politics . 'I found Todd Akin’s comments about rape victims outrageous and way over the line. He needs to apologize,' demanded Republican Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown. When Mr Akin's comments hit the web, he unsuccessfully sought to quell the storm. A statement from Mr Akin read: 'In reviewing my off-the-cuff remarks, it's clear that I misspoke in this interview and it does not reflect the deep empathy I hold for the thousands of women who are raped and abused every year.' 'I recognize that abortion, and particularly in the case of rape, is a very emotionally charged issue.' He continued: 'But I believe deeply in the protection of all life, and I do not believe that harming another innocent victim is the right course of action.' Indefensible: Reihan Salam, a National Review blogger, tweeted, 'Todd Akin ought to step the heck down' Backlash: 'I found Todd Akin's comments about rape victims outrageous and way over the line. He needs to apologize,' demanded Republican Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown . His own party sought to distance themselves immediately, even with his tail firmly between his legs. 'Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan disagree with Mr Akin’s statement,' the campaign said. 'A Romney-Ryan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape.' The damage was done. George Allen, the Republican Senate nominee in Virginia, condemned the comments as well. 'While Congressman Akin may have addressed his statement, like many men and women I strongly disapprove of his original comments — and the sentiments behind them,' he said in a statement. 'Regardless of party, we all have a responsibility to unite against any leniency on crimes against women and turn our focus to the solutions that make America stronger and safer.' 'Governor . Romney and Congressman Ryan disagree with Mr Akin’s statement. A . Romney-Ryan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of . rape.' Romney/Ryan Presidential Campaign . 'Usually, we’ll give our side something of a pass when it comes to outrageous statements,' wrote conservative Rick Moran. 'This isn’t a gaffe. It’s a nuclear bomb.' Reihan Salam, a National Review blogger, tweeted, 'Todd Akin ought to step the heck down.' The one person who is backing Mr Akin's run is his Democratic competition. Appearing on Morning Joe, Claire McCaskill refused to blast her opponent, recognizing that in a way, she has already won. Even the announcer introduced her as the candidate 'elected last night.' Mark . Halperin asked her point blank: 'Senator, do you think Congressman Akin . is fit to be a Senator from Missouri? And would you like to see him . step down and be replaced so Missouri voters have another choice besides . you in a general election?' Moving Forward: His own party sought to distance themselves immediately, even with his tail firmly between his legs. 'Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan disagree with Mr. Akin's statement,' the campaign said . 'Well, first of all, it’s not my place to decide. It is the people of Missouri and I think the people of Missouri have to make this decision,' she said. 'I mean, he has some passionate supporters in the Republican party.' In a previous statement McCaskill had announced: 'As a woman & former prosecutor who handled 100s of rape cases, I'm stunned by Rep Akin's comments about victims this AM.' Still, the candidate has refused to step down. 'The good people of Missouri nominated me, and I’m not a quitter,' Mr Akin told Mike Huckabee, a Republican and former governor. 'My belief is we’re going to take this thing forward. And, by the grace of God, we’re going to win this race.

"Probe: Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp, is driven to his apartment in London. His company is facing calls for an investigation into claims it hacked into the phones of 9/11 victims . The FBI is investigating allegations that media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp sought to hack into the phones of September 11 victims, a law enforcement official said today. The official revealed the news to the Associated Press on Thursday, while New York City-based News Corporation is in crisis mode. A rival newspaper reported last week that the company's News of the World had hacked into the phone of U.K. teenage murder victim Milly Dowler, 13, in 2002 and may have impeded a police investigation into her disappearance. More possible victims soon emerged - other child murder victims, 2005 London bombing victims, the families of dead soldiers and former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. The FBI's New York office didn't immediately comment on Thursday and neither did News Corp or the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. On Thursday, Mr Murdoch caved in to pressure from Britain's Parliament as he and his son James first refused, then agreed, to appear next week before lawmakers investigating phone hacking and bribery by employees of their newspaper empire. Mr Murdoch began his media career in Australia in 1952 after inheriting The News newspaper after the death of his father, and he has built News Corp into one of the world's biggest media groups. Its assets include Fox News, the 20th Century Fox movie studio, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and three newspapers in Britain - down from four with the death of the News of the World. Demands: Senator John Rockefeller has called for a probe into whether journalists working for Rupert Murdoch's empire targeted U.S. citizens and, right, Senator Frank Lautenberg called on the FBI to investigate whether News Corp had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act . The news of the FBI's investigation . comes after U.S. media watchdogs were calling for the agency to . investigate claims that News Corp hacked into the phones of victims of . the 9/11 attacks. Research group Media Matters was . calling on the American public to lobby Congress to hold hearings 'to . see just how far this scandal goes'. Senator . John Rockefeller wants a probe into whether any journalists working for . the Murdoch empire had targeted U.S. citizens after the terror attacks . in New York and Washington in September 2001. The Democratic senator, chairman of the Senate commerce committee, did not offer any evidence that victims had been targeted. Major player: Mr Murdoch's empire includes Fox News, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post in its portfolio . But . in a statement, he said: 'I encourage the appropriate authorities to . investigate to ensure that Americans have not had their privacy . violated. 'The reported . hacking by News Corporation newspapers against a range of individuals - . including children - is offensive and a serious breach of journalistic . ethics. 'This raises serious questions about whether the company has broken U.S. law.' A . second senator - Frank Lautenberg - urged authorities to examine . whether or not News Corp had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, . which makes it illegal for a U.S. company to pay foreign officials to . obtain or retain business. In . a letter to regulators, he wrote: 'Further investigation may reveal . that current reports only scratch the surface of the problem at News . Corporation.' Matt . Butler, chief executive of Media Matters, said: 'American also need to . know whether our privacy was violated by Murdoch reporters searching for . a good scoop to sell news. Breach of ethics: A private investigator in New York has alleged he was contacted by News of the World reporters wanting 9/11 victims' phone numbers and details of calls made around the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon . 'We can't rely on News Corp, with is . record of mismanagement, to address the problem. We must take proactive . steps to protect our privacy from News Corp's mismanagement. 'Murdoch's cover-up is falling apart, with serious consequences for hacking victims and News Corp shareholders alike.' Another . pressure group, Protect our Elections, has written to the FBI demanding . parallel civil and criminal investigations into News Corp in the wake . of the News of the World hacking scandal. Earlier . this week a former New York policeman now working as a private . investigator alleged he was contacted by News of the World journalists . wanting  9/11 victims' phone numbers and details of the calls they had . made and received in the days leading up to the attack. Empire: Mr Murdoch's media business also includes The Australian, The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph in Australia . A source said: 'This investigator is used by a lot of journalists in America and he recently told me that he was asked to hack into the 9/11 victims' private phone data. 'He said that the journalists asked him to access records showing the calls that had been made to and from the mobile phones belonging to the victims and their relatives. 'His presumption was that they wanted the information so they could hack into the relevant voicemails, just like it has been shown they have done in the UK. 'The PI said he had to turn the job down. He knew how insensitive such research would be, and how bad it would look. 'The investigator said the journalists seemed particularly interested in getting the phone records belonging to the British victims of the attacks.' Members . of the family which used to control the Wall Street Journal have said . they would not have voted to sell the newspaper to Rupert Murdoch if . they had realised the full extent of News International's phone-hacking . scandal. Murdoch bought the . newspaper in August 2007, six months after the News of the World's . royal editor, Clive Goodman, was jailed for voicemail hacking - but at . the time News International said the practice was confined only to . Goodman. Today Christopher . Bancroft, part of the family that used to control Dow Jones and Company, . the Journal's publishers, said: 'If I had known what I know now, I . would have pushed harder against [the bid].' Mr . Bancroft, who at the time had sole voting control over a trust which . represented 13 per cent of Dow Jones shares, said he would have 'held . out' if he'd known. Another . relative, Lisa Steele, said 'it would have been harder, if not . impossible' to have accepted the bid if she had known the full extent of . the scandal. She told . ProPublica: 'The ethics are clear to me - what's been revealed, from . what I've read in the Journal, is terrible. It may even be criminal.' Some members of the Bancroft family say they would have voted the same way even if they knew about the scandal. Bill . Cox III said he 'probably would have thought twice about it but . probably would have sold', although he said the scandal made him 'sick . to my stomach'. Even at . the time of the sale, the deal with News International proved . contentious, and the family recruited an independent panel to keep an . eye on the newspaper's ethics. The boss of News Corp's Australian division – which owns eight of the 12 major papers down under -  announced it was investigating all payments it has made for stories over the last three years as the hacking scandal spread. John Hartigan, in an email to staff, said it was 'offensive' to link them to the NoW scandal and said there was 'absolutely no reason to believe' they were involved in any wrongdoing. But he added: 'We will be conducting a thorough review of all editorial expenditure over the past three years to confirm that payments to contributors and other third parties were for legitimate services.' Hugh Grant took his campaign against Mr Murdoch's newspaper empire to the States. The actor appeared on America's most watched breakfast TV program, The Today Show, warning viewers the scandal could well spread there. 'I would've thought it would be of interest to American's because Rupert Murdoch does own an enormous amount of your media, with Fox news and stations, and 20th Century Fox, and some of your newspapers, he told viewers. Scandal: The News Corporation HQ is in New York. Pressure groups are calling for civil and criminal investigations into the media group . 'I think people need to ask themselves, ""Who is this man who owns such a large part of our media?"" 'And when you hear some of the new allegations that may include hacking of some of the 9/11 victims, that may strike a chord with Americans.' It comes as Mr Murdoch's grand plan for a further expansion of his media empire was in tatters last night as the 'firestorm’ over phone hacking forced him to withdraw his bid to take over BSkyB. The tycoon shelved his £10billion offer for the satellite broadcaster as it became clear that British Prime Minister David Cameron, along with party leaders Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, were joining forces in a Commons vote urging him to back off. Mr Cameron also relented in the face of intense pressure from Labour and the Liberal Democrats and agreed to a judicial inquiry into press standards, regulation and ownership, and allegations of illegal phone hacking by the News of the World and police corruption. Media proprietors, including Mr Murdoch, as well as senior politicians, police chiefs and journalists accused of phone hacking, are all expected to be summoned under oath. The probe will be headed by Lord Justice Leveson, who prosecuted Britain’s worst female serial killer, Rose West. The News of the World published its last edition on Sunday.","Law enforcement official says FBI have opened investigation into News Corp .

"The 11-year-old who managed to sneak onto a plane without a ticket or passport and fly to Italy said it was 'easier than doing my homework.' Liam Corcoran slipped away from his mother in Wythenshawe, caught a bus to the airport three miles away and boarded a plane bound for Rome without anyone questioning what he was doing. Speaking to The Sun about how he had managed the feat, the schoolboy said it had been easy. 'I didn't have anything on me and no one asked me for anything,' he said. He added that he had needed to go to the toilet and had simply kept walking until he ended up on the Jet2 plane. Liam Corcoran, 11, was allowed to board a Jet2 flight to Rome without being asked for his passport or boarding pass . He said: 'I went in the toilet and sat there but I couldn't get out. Then - whoosh! - we were going up in the sky.' It was only when Liam began boasting . that he had run away from home as the plane cruised over France that . other passengers alerted cabin crew. A major investigation has now been launched into how the schoolboy managed to evade security, but the managing director of Jet2.com Ian Doubtfire admitted an earlier decision to scrap a headcount of passengers on board before take-off could have been partly to blame. Mr Doubtfire promised to reinstate the policy with immediate effect. He said: 'As an airline we take security extremely seriously so I was very surprised to hear the news. 'We don’t actually do headcounts on aircraft attached to airbridges - we stopped doing that some time ago, but we have reinstated it with immediate effect after this incident. 'We are also doing a secondary boarding pass check at the gate. We are taking the matter very seriously.' Upon realising the schoolboy was aboard the plane, it was by then too late to turn around so the flight continued its journey to Rome. Liam . stayed in the airport with police and airline staff for nearly two hours . before being put on a flight home. Liam, who has learning difficulties, said he did not think much of the Italian capital. 'The police were there. It was too big and scary on my own. I just wanted to go home and see my mum,' he said. An full investigation is underway at Manchester Airport after the security lapse . As well as causing several hours of . panic for Liam’s mother Mary, 29, the astonishing breach of security at . Manchester Airport just before the start of the Olympics raised urgent . questions about Britain’s border protection. Ms . Corcoran said: 'I can't get my head around it. How did he get that far . without anyone asking him one question? I just keep thinking how easy it . would be for a terrorist. It's unbelievable.' Yesterday Liam’s father, Aaron Fort, . 34, spoke of his disbelief that no one at the airport had questioned . what an unaccompanied child was doing there. He revealed that Liam – described as . ‘a handful’ who has run away in the past – had never been on a plane . before and does not own a passport. Mr Fort said: ‘Liam told me the . first time he knew he was in a bit of trouble is when the plane started . to rise off the ground. He just did what the stewardesses told him and . sat in his seat with his belt on.’ Once other passengers raised the alarm, flight crew radioed details of the stowaway to colleagues on the ground. On arrival at Fiumicino Airport in . Rome, Liam was kept on board while the aircraft was prepared for the . return journey. Finally, eight hours after taking off from Manchester, . he was reunited with his relieved mother. With airport security meant to be on . heightened alert amid fears of a terrorist attack on the Olympics, . Transport Secretary Justine Greening last night said: ‘I treat security . breaches very, very seriously, so we are now reviewing urgently with . Manchester Airport, and the airline, exactly what happened.’ Meanwhile, airline Jet2 said it had . suspended three employees who had waved Liam through and was now . carrying out headcounts on all flights. Liam’s father explained that his son . had been swimming with his mother in Wythenshawe, Manchester, when his . adventure began on Tuesday. Mr Fort, who is separated from Liam’s . mother and lives in Blackpool, said his son had to be rescued by a . lifeguard. ‘That sort of incident would have worried him,’ the charity . shop worker added. ‘He has some learning problems and copes differently . from other children. He must have got changed and given his mother the . slip.’ After his bus journey, Liam wandered . into Terminal 1 at around 1pm and apparently ‘tailgated’ another family . preparing to go through to security. An airport source said: ‘Often one . parent has the boarding card for all their children, so the security . guard should count the cards and the children, but obviously they’ve . failed to notice there was one extra.’ Journey's end: Liam managed to get to Fiumicino airport in Rome . He stressed that Liam went through scanners which would have picked up anything suspicious he was carrying. Once through to the departures, he . went to the first gate he could find. He is thought to have again . mingled with families, and Jet2 staff failed to notice he had no . documents as he took a seat. A passenger on the return flight, . Sarah Swayne, 26, from Nantwich, said: ‘He was very talkative and seemed . quite unfazed by it all.’ Liam’s mother was not at her . top-floor housing association flat in Newall Green yesterday, but a . neighbour said: ‘I think he’s going to be a bit of a hero among his . friends for managing it.’ A relative added: ‘Liam’s an . attention seeker, he runs away constantly. But he’s never done anything . like this. The little monster went off to Rome.’ A spokesman for Manchester Airport . said the breach was being ‘urgently investigated’, but added: ‘The boy . went through full security screening so the safety of passengers was . never compromised.’ In total, Liam escaped five checks: . security staff should have checked his boarding pass before screening, . Jet2 staff should have taken his boarding pass and checked his passport . at the gate, flight crew in the cabin should have checked his boarding . pass stub, and a passenger headcount should have been carried out before . take-off. Earlier this month police criticised . security at Manchester Airport after an armed robbery suspect being . flown back to the UK for questioning escaped through a luggage chute.","Boy says getting on flight was easy and that no one had asked him for anything but just smiled .

"The average interest rate on an easy-access ISA account has fallen to a record low. The typical rate on an account which allows people to get immediate access to their money has plunged to 1.17 per cent after falling for five months in a row, according to respected financial website MoneyFacts. This is the lowest average rate since it began keeping records in 2007, the year before the financial crash. Experts said it was another sign that savers had been ‘sacrificed’ in favour of mortgage borrowers. It also suggests that George Osborne’s flagship policy of raising to £15,000 the amount savers can deposit in a tax-free ISA – announced in what he dubbed a ‘Budget for savers’ in March – is unlikely to be of much use to those with nest eggs. Far from reinvigorating the savings market, the Government scheme to increase the allowance in ISAs had proved to be a flop, it was claimed yesterday. In 2012 there were 403 ISA products on the market but now there are 283, suggesting banks are not competing to give savers a good rate. Sylvia Waycot, editor at Moneyfacts.co.uk, said: ‘Rates are still at historically low levels, product numbers continue to fall and the ISA market as a whole remains subdued. The typical rate on an account which allows people to get immediate access to their money has plunged to 1.17 per cent . ‘Despite the hype surrounding the new allowance, it’s as though providers have decided to just sit this one out.’ Critics blamed the Government’s Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) for rendering savers of little value to banks, leading them not to bother competing for their business. The scheme allowed banks and building societies to borrow money cheaply from the Bank of England for lending to people seeking mortgages. Launched in 2012, it was designed to breathe new life into the housing market after the economic crisis – but savings rates dropped because banks no longer needed to lure savers to raise funds. Although the FLS scheme is now closed to mortgage lenders, they still have billions of pounds to call on – and little incentive to attract savers, critics said. Mrs Waycot said: ‘FLS has had a greater negative impact on savings rates than the historic low Bank of England rate.’ The Bank of England base rate has been at 0.5 per cent since 2009, but is expected to rise by the beginning of spring. However, experts said the rise – which will push up interest rates on savings accounts – would be barely felt if savers’ rates continued to fall now.","It is the lowest average rate since MoneyFacts began keeping records .
Experts said it was another sign that savers had been ‘sacrificed’ in favour of mortgage borrowers ."
"The hunt for missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 has been narrowed to the southern region of the previous search zone after a new analysis of satellite phone data. A failed attempt at a satellite phone call from the jet 'suggests ... the aircraft might have turned south a little earlier than expected,' said Warren Truss, Australia's deputy prime minister. It comes just weeks before the multi-million dollar, year-long sonar hunt for wreckage is due to begin. The overall search area still remained unchanged, Mr Truss said. He did not explain how the southern area was singled out. Scroll down for video . Boeing 777 Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 with the registration number 9M-MRO flies over Poland February 5. The jet vanished without a trace after flying off course while ferrying passengers from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing . However, Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Martin Dolan said he would meet with international experts next week to decide whether the 60,000 square kilometre (23,000 square mile) targeted search area should be extended or shifted further south based on the new analysis. 'We think we may extend that area farther south; that's the thing we're currently considering,' he said. The new analysis applies to satellite data from the first of two satellite phone calls Malaysia Airlines ground staff attempted to make to Flight 370's crew. By the time the calls were attempted, the plane had become invisible to civilian radar. It had flown west without communications past Sumatra and beyond the range of Malaysian military radar. Mr Dolan said the new analysis suggested the jet was already flying south when the first phone call was attempted less than 20 minutes after the plane dropped off military radar. 'Previously, there was the possibility that it could have been quite a bit later, so we had to do our modelling based on a range of possibilities as to where the aircraft turned,' he said. Malaysian transport minister Liow Tiong Lai and Australian deputy prime minister Warren Truss today signed a memorandum of understanding sharing the ongoing costs of the search for the missing Boeing 777 . A U.S. Navy submersible aboard an Australian vessel. Similar submarine vehicles equipped with sonar, echo sounders and video cameras will be used to scour 23,000 square miles of search area . 'We're now more confident that it turned comparatively early. That does make a difference to how we prioritise the search along the seventh arc,' he added, referring to the area where satellite information from a jet engine transmitter suggests the plane ran out of fuel and crashed. Investigators have long been aware of the phone call. But they have only recently adapted analysis methodology to glean clues to the plane's direction from the satellite phone data. MH370 disappeared on March 8 after flying far off course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Officials say the investigation into the how it crashed can only proceed once its wreckage and black boxes are recovered. By the time the calls were attempted, the plane had become invisible to civilian radar. It had flown west without communications past Sumatra and beyond the range of Malaysian military radar. Mr Dolan said the new analysis suggested the jet was already flying south when the first phone call was attempted less than 20 minutes after the plane dropped off military radar. Today, Mr Truss and Liow Tiong Lai, Malaysia's transport minister, signed a memorandum of understanding sharing the ongoing costs of the search for the missing Boeing 777 as it progresses to an expensive new stage. Mr Liow said investigators had advised that success of the undersea search for wreckage and the aircraft's back boxes with cockpit voice recordings and flight data was crucial to solving the mystery of the disaster. 'The investigation cannot continue without the search result,' he said. 'We need to find the plane, we need to find the black box in the plane so that we can have a conclusion in the investigation.' Malaysia, as the country where the Boeing was flagged, has overall responsibility for the investigation. But Australia has search and rescue responsibility for the area of the Indian Ocean where the plane is thought to have crashed 1,100 miles off Australia's west coast. From next month three vessels towing underwater vehicles equipped with side-scan sonar, multi-beam echo sounders and video equipment will begin scouring 23,000 square miles of search area. The operation could take up to a year and cost AU$52million(£29m). Before the underwater search starts, two survey ships are mapping the entire search area. Chinese vice minister of transport He Jianzhong, who also attended the Canberra meeting, said the ministers agreed that the search would not be interrupted or given up. Most of the lost passengers, 153, were Chinese.","The overall search area in the southern Indian Ocean remains unchanged .
Officials from Australia and Malaysia agree to share costs of search .

"It was not that long ago that online banking was rolled out by all major banks, but now anyone living in France with a bank account and Twitter handle can send a tweet to transfer money. The service, called S-Money, was developed by one of France's largest banks and uses the social network to send cash between users, who reportedly don’t even have to enter bank details. The move by Groupe BPCE, France's second largest bank by customers, coincides with Twitter's own push into the world of online payments as the social network seeks new sources of revenue beyond advertising. The service, called S-Money, was developed by one of France's largest banks and uses Twitter (screenshot pictured) to send cash between users, who don’t even have to enter bank details . Twitter is racing other tech giants Apple and Facebook to get a foothold in new payment services for mobile phones or apps and while S-Money is not an official Twitter product, it shows what is possible on social networks. ‘(S-Money) offers Twitter users in France a new way to send each other money, irrespective of their bank and without having to enter the beneficiary's bank details, with a simple tweet,’ Nicolas Chatillon, chief executive of S-Money, BPCE's mobile payments unit, said in a statement. Payment by tweets will be managed via the bank's S-Money service, which allows money transfers via text message and relies on the credit-card industry's data security standards. Facebook and Twitter are said to be working on ways for people to transfer money, making splitting the bill (illustrated) as easy as sending a message . It is not clear at this time how the technology works and Mr Chatillon simply said: ‘The ease of use and immediacy of the S-Money payment solution for individuals is perfectly adapted to the Twitter user experience.’ It appears that the service simply uses Twitter in a way that can be compared to third-party initiative such as Starbucks’ #TweetACoffee and Amazon’s #AmazonCart, where people use a specific hashtag in exchange for goods. Last month, Twitter started trials of its own new service, Twitter Buy, to allow consumers to find and buy products on its social network . The service embeds a ‘Twitter Buy’ button inside tweets posted by more than two dozen non-profits music artists such as Pharrell and vendors such as Burberry and Home Depot. Twitter's role to date has been to connect customers rather than processing payments or checking their identities. ‘From the Twitter point of view, there is a limit to their appetite for getting involved in payments processing itself,’ said Andrew Copeman, a payments analyst with financial services research firm AITE Group, who is based in Edinburgh, Scotland. ‘At the moment, banks are probably viewing Twitter and other social media networks as marketing channels to reach a wider set of their customers and to extend the bank's existing mobile banking initiatives,’ he said. Last month, Twitter started trials of its  new service, Twitter Buy, to allow consumers to find and buy products on its social network. The service embeds a ‘Twitter Buy’ button inside tweets posted by more than two dozen non-profits music artists such as Pharell and vendors such as Burberry (a catwalk show is pictured) Twitter is testing a 'buy button' which can generate cash from its users. The button sits in a tweet and lets people simply click to buy what they see. It's being tested in a 'small percentage of US users'. A total of 20 brands, including retailers including Burberry, musicians such as Rihanna, and non-profits are involved in the trial. The move is the first bug attempt by Twitter to generate revenue by a means other than advertising. Once users have clicked 'Buy' they will be asked to enter their payment and shipping details, unless it is not their first purchase in which case their details could have been stored. Twitter's success in developing additional services on its platform as Facebook has done will be key to its future profitability. Rakuten Bank in Japan offers a similar ‘Transfer by Facebook’ service that lets users of its mobile banking app send money to anyone in their Facebook friends list. Investors have been worried about Twitter's slowing user growth, sending the shares down about 17 per cent this year, while rival Facebook's have climbed 35 per cent. Thomas Husson, a marketing strategy analyst with Forrester Research, said Twitter was likely to multiply efforts to explore new ways to generate revenue with banks and credit card firms. ‘Twitter wants to more explicitly demonstrate the overall value of its network as an advertising platform,’ he said. Jean-Yves Forel, CEO of Groupe BPCE said: 'Groupe BPCE is the first banking group to offer individuals a payment solution where they can transfer money with a simple Tweet. ‘This S-Money initiative opens up a whole new range of payment possibilities on the social networks.' There is no indication that the service will be rolled out internationally. Friends using Facebook Messenger could soon send each other money in a very similar way to how they currently exchange photos within private messages. This rumour is based on screenshots taken by a US computer science student who uncovered what he believes is Facebook’s next move to make its stand-alone messaging service more popular. The payment options appear to let users send money in the same way they send files, with the addition of in-app PIN code to boost security. Andrew Aude, a student at Stanford University in California, used an iOS tool called Cycript on an iPhone to explore the ‘forthcoming’ feature, which has yet to be confirmed by Facebook,TechCrunch reported. He said users will be able to pay friends at the touch of a button within a message, but at this stage it is not known whether the feature will be offered for free, or whether users will have to pay a charge for the convenience. A Messenger payment service would go head-to-head with PayPal, as well as other peer-to-peer payment systems. It would also make Facebook’s offering stand out from other popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp. ‘With FB messenger, you attach money just like you attach a photo or a location. You don't even have to link a bank account!’ Mr Aude tweeted. He continued that users can press a button to make a payment, entering the amount of money they want to send. The transaction is not posted to a user’s News Feed and is kept private. Explaining how it works, Mr Aude said the system uses ‘some magical means’ to look up the bank account number of a recipient, before depositing the chosen sum of money. Mr Aude believes that Facebook will roll out the feature in the US over the next few months, but concedes that it could take much longer.","Payment function was developed by French bank Groupe BPCE .
From today, French residents can transfer money by sending a tweet .
Users of the service need a Twitter handle and bank account .

"Passengers will have to prove that their electronic phones, laptops and tablets do function at UK airports . British Airways announced tough new security measures last night which will see passengers barred from US-bound flights if their electronic devices are not charged up. In preventing passengers from flying, the airline is going one step further than the guidelines issued on Sunday. These stated that gadgets will be confiscated before boarding if their owner fails to switch them on and prove they are not packed with explosives. The US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has said it will not allow mobile phones – especially the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy – on to planes bound for the US from some international airports if the devices are not charged. But British Airways’ rules could see travellers with uncharged electronic devices – some of which are notorious for having short battery lives – not only lose their gadgets but also their seats on the flight. And unwitting passengers whose batteries have run out during a stop-over, before taking a connecting flight to the US, face being stranded, unable to continue their journey. A spokesman from British Airways confirmed its new policy, telling the Daily Mail: ‘If [customers] are unable to power up their electronic device they will not be allowed to fly. If it does not power up then it cannot be placed in hand or hold luggage. We advise our customers to please do all they can to ensure that any electronic device they have is fully powered before you arrive at the airport. ‘For people transferring we advise that they use electronic devices sparingly if they are going to fly on a long journey before getting to London and then transferring on to a US destination.’ The airline also admitted that there will be limited charging facilities at check-in, so there is no chance of any last-minute powering up. The heightened security comes amid reports two terror networks are working together on a bomb that could evade existing detection measures. US officials are concerned that a mobile phone, tablet, laptop or other electronic device could be used as a bomb by Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamist Nusra Front, Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria. Scroll down for video . The new British Airways measures barring passengers whose electronic items cannot be powered on exceeds guidelines which state the item should simply be confiscated . In 2009 a Yemen-linked bomb maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, built an underwear bomb used in a failed attempt to bring down a plane bound for Detroit. The TSA did not disclose which airports would be conducting the additional screening, but it was reported last week that passengers at British airports travelling to the US are facing extra checks on their phones. US officials singled out particular smartphones, including the Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy, for security screening on direct flights bound for the States from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The BA spokesman added: ‘Safety and security is our top priority at all times and we continue to work closely with airports and governments around the world.‘ . We are complying with the US regulations and would advise customers to arrive in good time for their flights both at check-in and also at the boarding gate ... our flights continue to operate as normal.’","Tough new flight security measures announced last night go further than the recommended guidelines .

"Athletics is in turmoil after it was revealed that two of the sport’s biggest names had failed drugs tests. Tyson Gay, the fastest man in the world this year, has tested positive for an unidentified substance and former world record-holder Asafa Powell was among five Jamaican athletes to have failed drugs tests for a banned stimulant. Usain Bolt’s agent Ricky Simms said that his client was not implicated in the scandal, but Olympic relay gold medallist Sherone Simpson confirmed she had tested positive for oxilofrine at Jamaica’s national trials last month. Scroll down for video . Shock: Tyson Gay has had his contract with Adidas suspended . Unconfirmed reports claimed that  27-year-old Nesta Carter, who ran 9.87sec in a Madrid 100m on Saturday night, had also fallen foul of the authorities. If proved,  the three quickest men over 100m this  year will have failed drugs tests and will miss next month’s World Championships in Moscow, leaving the sport in crisis. Gay, 30, the second fastest man of all time, has run the three quickest 100m times of 2013, but tested positive for an unnamed substance at an out-of-competition test on May 16. The triple world champion will have his ‘B’ sample tested this week, but has already pulled out of the USA’s World Championships team and Friday’s Diamond League meeting in Monaco. Star men: Gay (left) has recorded the fastest 100m this year and Powell (right) is a former world record holder . Gay said: ‘I don’t have a sabotage story. I put my trust in someone and was let down. ‘I don’t have anything to say to make this seem like it was a mistake or it was on USADA’s (United States Anti-Doping Agency) hands, someone playing games. I don’t have any of those stories. ‘I made a mistake. I know exactly what went on, but I can’t discuss it right now. I hope I am able to run again, but I will take whatever punishment I get like a man.’ You too: After the news of Gay's failed test, it emerged that Asafa Powell (left) also tested positive . On a dark day for athletics, it emerged Powell was one of five Jamaican athletes to have failed tests. Powell, Simpson and Carter are coached by Stephen Francis at the MVP Track and Field Club and the two confirmed failed tests relate to banned stimulant oxilofrine. Two athletes who compete in field events, including a junior, are also understood to be implicated. Powell and Simpson both insisted they had not taken the drug intentionally, with sources suggesting it was part of a supplement introduced to their training group. But if their ‘B’ samples back up  the findings of the ‘A’ samples, they will face two-year bans and may never run again. Devastating: Gay has admitting to using a banned substance . Gutting: The news is a true blow to those involved in athletics . Powell, 30, said: ‘A sample I gave this year has returned “adverse findings”. The substance oxilofrine was found, which is considered by the authorities to be a banned stimulant. I have never knowingly or wilfully taken any supplements or substances that break any rules. ‘I am not now — nor have I ever been — a cheat. My team has launched an investigation and we are cooperating with relevant agencies and law enforcement authorities to discover how the substance got in my system. ‘This result has left me devastated. I am reeling from this genuinely surprising result. I accept the  consequences. My fault, however, is not cheating but not being more vigilant. I want to reiterate that in my career as an athlete I have never sought to enhance my  performance with any substance.’ Pulling out: Gay will take no part in the Moscow World Championships next month after the findings . A member of Powell’s support team was reportedly detained by Italian law enforcement officers last night after a property in Italy was raided. It is believed the trainer provided the sprinter with supplements that could have  contributed to the positive test. Simpson, 28, also took responsibility. ‘As an athlete, I know I am responsible for whatever goes  into my body,’ she said. ‘I would not intentionally take an illegal  substance. I am sorry for any hurt or embarrassment this positive test may have caused.’ This is the biggest crisis to hit athletics since the BALCO scandal at the turn of the century, when a number of American athletes, including Olympic champion  Marion Jones, were found to be taking banned substances. Veronica Campbell-Brown, a friend of Gay and the world 200m champion, was suspended after a positive test for a banned masking agent in June. Another one: Sherone Simpson (left) has also tested positive for a banned substance . Former world 110m hurdles champion . Colin Jackson said it was an ‘absolutely awful’ day for track and field, . while British 200m champion James Ellington called it a ‘disappointing . day for our sport’. Jackson added: ‘Gay is a global star. It takes away faith from the public. The good side is it doesn’t matter what level you’re at; if you’re taking drugs you will get caught.’ Neil Black, performance director of British Athletics, said: ‘I would start with utter disappointment. You think of the athletes striving day by day and it must rip the backside out of them. We all suffer.’ The banned drug oxilofrine that top Jamaican sprinters Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson have tested positive for is a stimulant used to boost the body's ability to burn fat. The substance helps athletes boost their power-to-weight ratio with more lean muscle and less fat, and so increase their speed. It may also increase the rate at which the heart reaches its maximum performance during exercise, meaning a greater supply of oxygen can get to the muscles earlier. Oxilofrine is an agent that stimulates part of the nervous system and was previously used to treat low blood pressure. More recently, it has started to appear in combination with caffeine in dietary supplements marketed as weight loss products. However, the superiority of using oxilofrine over an exercise warm-up to achieve this appears unconvincing. There have been no previous findings in Britain but competitors in cycling, athletics, weightlifting, rugby union and American football have been banned in the last three years. They include the USA's Amy Dodson, one of the world's top amputee runners, who received a six-month ban in 2011 and American cyclist Flavia Oliveira who was banned for 18 months in 2009. Both said they had unknowingly ingested the stimulant via an over-the-counter supplement.","Tyson Gay admits guilt after testing positive for banned substance .

"Furious family members of those on board MH370 have written an 18-page letter demanding answers, 76 days after the Malaysia Airlines plane went missing without a trace. It claims the families are fed up with 'skimpy accounts' of what occurred. 'There is some confusion over the [plane's] last point of contact,' the letter reads. It has been sent to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, days before a deeper search of the southern Indian Ocean begins. Demanding answers: Sarah Bajc's (left) partner Phillip Wood (right), 50, was on board MH370, along with 238 other passengers and crew, when it disappeared in the early hours of March 8 on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing . A host of Malaysian ministers and Government bodies involved in the so far fruitless search also received a copy of the letter, which calls for all the wrong information about what happened to their loved ones to be erased. It analyses the preliminary report into the plane’s disappearance, which was released on May 1. Sarah Bajc's partner Phillip Wood, 50, was on board the plane, along with 238 other passengers and crew, when it disappeared in the early hours of March 8 on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Recipient: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott received a copy of the letter . She has spoken up for the families involved in writing the letter, who were helped by a host of experts, including retired pilots and air traffic controllers and military experts to compile their report. Ms Bajc, who lives in Beijing, said the 350 family members want more answers about the investigation to be released and for transparency, the Courier Mail reports. They have asked that raw radar data from MH370 be released for independent analysis. And they have also questioned how authorities could be certain the Boeing 777 had crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. Devastated: Relatives of passengers on board the missing flight, seen here in Beijing in March, have still not received much concrete information . In charge: Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak also received the letter from distraught families . The Malaysian Government has now pledged to publicly release the raw satellite data, from Insmarsat satellite communications company, which shows how the plane's path was located after it disappeared from civilian and military radar. However, they have given no indication on when this will be done. 'We request that a comprehensive interim report be issued as soon as possible detailing all the known facts, to include, but not be limited to, the many areas that we have enumerated in our analysis. 'We believe that eliminating wrong information and assumptions is as important as confirming correct information and assumptions,' the letter says. The search for MH370, off Perth on Australia's west coast, has so far failed to bring results. Searching: The Bluefin-21, operating from the Australian navy's Ocean Shield vessel (pictured), has been searching an area of the Indian Ocean where four acoustic signals were detected in early April . At sea: Commander James Lybrand Mission Commander ADV Ocean Shield (left) and Chris 'Sharkie' Moore, Phoenix Team Lead, watch the launching of the Phoenix Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Artemis off the deck of Ocean Shield on April 17, 2014 . It has now emerged that the underwater search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane by the Bluefin-21 drone will wind up in days, ahead of commercially contracted technology being used for a deeper ocean hunt. The Bluefin-21, operating from the Australian navy's Ocean Shield vessel, has been searching an area of the Indian Ocean where four acoustic signals were detected in early April. Retired defence chief Angus Houston, who has previously said the sounds were man-made, on Thursday said it was still too early to discount the pings amid speculation they might not be from flight MH370's black box after all. 'They are still being analysed,' Mr Houston told ABC TV. 'We are ensuring that nothing has been overlooked and that everything has been considered.' Work also continues to review and analyse all the data and information relating to the likely flight path of MH370, which was largely provided by British company Inmarsat. Mr Houston said the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) would make an announcement about that 'extensive and very robust process of review' in the future. 'Nothing has been overlooked': Former Defence Chief Angus Houston, Chief Coordinator of the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC), said it was still too early to discount the pings that were heard in the southern Indian Ocean . Clueless: The search for MH370, off Perth on Australia's west coast, has so far failed to bring much evidence to light . He was certain the Boeing 777 wound up in the Indian Ocean and searchers were looking in the 'right broad area'. JACC said Ocean Shield was expected to depart the search area on Wednesday and return to the West Australian fleet base on Saturday where the Bluefin-21 would be demobilised. In the meantime, it will continue operating within its depth operating limits. Two Chinese ships, the Haixun 01 and Zhu Kezhen, are on their way to the search area to map the ocean floor in preparation for the deep ocean technology, which, like the Bluefin-21, will use side-scan sonar to hunt for wreckage. Mr Houston also said the first book about the plane, written by American writer Nigel Cawthorne, was disappointing and insensitive. In the book, Cawthorne claims the plane could have been shot down by US-Thai strike fighters as part of a training drill that went horribly wrong. 'The families have gone through an incredibly traumatic time over the last two-and-a-half months,' Mr Houston said. 'To be putting books out at this stage is very premature. 'There's still a long way to go with the search, and of course, if we eventually find the aircraft, the investigation into what actually happened.'","Families have slammed 'skimpy accounts' of what happened .

"A gay Apple customer claims he was handed a receipt with a homophobic slur on it after shopping in one of their stores. Adam Catanzarite visited the Apple store at Pioneer Place in Portland last month to purchase a pair of $29 earphones. But when he checked his receipt days later, the place reserved for the customer's email address had been replaced with the words f@g.com. The receipt Mr Catanzarite claims he was given with the homophobic slur after shopping at an Apple store . The slur was printed on the receipt where the customer's email address is usually placed . An outraged Mr Catanzarite then took to his Facebook page, where he uploaded a picture of the receipt and hit out at Apple. In the post he said: 'I know first-hand that this is an example of the type of #homophobic beliefs and actions that lead young people to harm themselves. 'This type of action is NOT OKAY, especially from a company that prides itself on being LGBTQ inclusive and welcoming.' It is thought that when asked for his email address, Mr Catanzarite refused to give it to the employee and the letters could have innocently been entered as a way of filling out the email address field. It is claimed Mr Catanzarite was offered a refund as an apology and a store gift card, which he says he gave away. But now he has called on Apple to offer training to employees so they can learn the impact the word can have. The post Mr Catanzarite wrote on Facebook after finding the gay slur on his receipt from Apple . In a separate Facebook post he explained: 'Historically, my communities have faced a history that is filled with extreme violence by individuals who are victims of their own homophobia and the society that says homophobic behavior is okay. 'The employee who entered f@g.com should not be fired (take a minute to let that settle in if you need to), but should be given an opportunity to learn about the impact of the use of the word and how these words impact the individuals who have been oppressed by them.

"Joe Biden held an ‘emotional one-on-one meeting’ with Barack Obama and ‘apologized profusely’ after announcing his support for gay marriage in May, according to a new book. The Vice-President also accused Jim Messina, the Obama campaign manager, of ‘throwing him under the bus’, an e-book published by Politico has revealed. Obama tried to calm Biden down, saying: ‘Look, Joe, there are people who want to divide us. You and I have to be on the same page from now on. You and I have to make sure that we don’t get divided.’ Bond: President Obama and VP Joe Biden last pictured together in May at the White House. A new book has revealed that despite bumps in the road, they are intent on a united political front in the run up to the elections . After Biden’s ill-judged utterance, Obama was forced to bring forward his own announcement of support for gay marriage, which he had planned to make at the Democratic convention in Charlotte, North Carolina this month. The incident underlines the extent to which Biden’s garrulous manner and inability to stick to a prearranged message has become a problem for the White House and the Obama campaign. It also highlights, however, Obama’s apparent loyalty to Biden, whom he picked as his running mate even though he had failed to win a single state in two presidential campaigns 20 years apart. Biden had served 36 years in the Senate and was lampooned for his long-winded nature even in an institution renowned for the excessive self-regard and verbosity of its members.

"It was almost 500 years ago, during the ongoing land border wars, that a group of Scottish youths captured an English flag from a raiding party. And to mark the historic occasion, hundreds of horse riders marched, and galloped, through Hawick during the annual Common Riding. Meanwhile, locals also enjoyed some unusual rituals such as Snuffin' - which saw people shoving each other as they tried to grab snuff which was packed inside a ram's horn. The event - the first of the Border festivals - not only celebrates the seizing of the flag in 1514 by the young men ('callants') of Hornshole, in the heart of the town, but also the ancient custom of riding the marches, or boundaries, of the common land.

Held by the Cornet, the current flag is a copy of the ancient flag which was captured at Hornshole as the original has long been lost . The flag is an important part of the events at the Hawick Common Riding today. Held by the Cornet, the current flag is a copy of the ancient one which was captured at Hornshole as the original has long been lost. In 1707, the Town Council noticed that the flag being used had become torn and useless. However, it still exists and may be seen in the museum at Wilton Lodge. The flag is blue with a cross of gold ('A Banner Azure with Saltire Or'). It has the date '1514' in gold. The letters 'HC' were added later. They stand for 'Hawick Colour'. In the late 1800s, studies of past flags showed that the shape of the flag should not be square or rectangular. It should instead be in the shape of a 'pennon' - which is a long narrow triangular or swallow-tailed flag. This is the shape of the flag used today. It is believed that the first flag belonged to the Priory at Hexham. A few years ago, the people in charge of Hexham Abbey asked the Hawick Council for a copy of their flag. This request was granted. The copy they received still hangs on a wall in the abbey. In the mid-18th century, other flags were carried during the Common Riding. Schools and guilds were represented in the Common Riding procession by mounted standard-bearers. Arguments, however, arose over which flags should come first. In 1747, the following order was agreed by the Council. First was the Town Flag followed by the Grammar School Flag. Then came the English School flag and lastly the Prentice Colour. Two years later, the Council decided that in the future there should be only one flag: 'May 26 - the which day the Bailies and Council have unanimously resolved that in time coming no Colour or Standard shall be carried on the Common Riding days except the Town's Colour or Standard.' This rule was not too strict as the Grammar School flag was still carried till about 1777. Since then, however, only one flag has been carried at the Common Riding.                                                                                                                        Source: Hawick Callants Club .","Event celebrates seizing of flag by the .

But for drag racer Matt Hagan - who has now survived three such explosions in as many years - his dramatic exit from a qualifying race was simply cause for a sulk.

Scroll down for video . Fireball: The carbon fibre bodywork swells as flames erupt from the engine . Just seconds before, the carbon fibre shell of his 'funny car' - a class of drag racing vehicle - had rippled like cloth as flames erupted from the engine and tore backwards through the driver's cabin. Everything but the bonnet was ripped off and strewn across the track as a parachute deployed to bring the charred framework to a halt. According to Top Gear, the explosion took place after an intake valve dropped into one of the engine cylinders, leaving three of the four race lanes scattered with debris. Violent: The top and sides of the shell are blown clean off as flames tear through the entire car . Breakneck: The emergency parachute slows the smoking wreck from 260mph . While Hagan faced his third consecutive frustration in the qualifying rounds, rival Robert Hight claimed his fourth Funny Car victory in a row on Sunday.

"A man who once worked closely with beleaguered comedian Bill Cosby has come forward to detail how he once helped the star funnel thousands of dollars to a virtual harem of young women he kept during The Cosby Show's 8-season run. Frank Scotti, 90, told the Daily News on Sunday that he spent years as NBC's 'fixer' for Cosby--as a conduit through whom the actor sent lady pals funds and as a guard at Cosby's dressing room door when those women visited. 'He had everybody fooled,' said Scotti, who says he eventually walked away from the star because of how he treated women. NBC employee speaks: A former NBC employee has come forward claiming he helped Bill Cosby funnel women to many women in the 1980s and 1900s. Despite rumors of protests, Bill Cosby's Florida show went off without a hint of trouble on Friday evening (pictured) The NBC veteran told the New York Daily News, in a story published Sunday, that Cosby had a rotating lineup of young women brought to his Brooklyn dressing room by a complicit modeling agency. Scotti said the Manhattan agency's owner would lead the girls there and leave once Cosby picked his chosen lady. 'She knew exactly what was going to go on,' Scotti told the News. 'Then he'd tell me, 'Stand outside the door and don't let anyone in.' Now you put that together and figure (out) why.' According to Scotti, some of the girls were as young as 16. Scotti claims Cosby would put women he especially liked up in apartments and give them up to $2,000 per month. After decades, Scotti's even saved receipts from money orders he says he gave those women for Cosby. One of those women, Shawn Thompson, had a daughter named Autumn Jackson who would claim Cosby was her father. Dressing room visits: JC Studios in Brooklyn was home to The Cosby Show for several seasons, it's unclear if Scotti's purported 'fixes' happened there . Halcyon days: Frank Scotti worked with Cosby during the star's time at NBC in the 1980s and 90s, when he starred on The Cosby Show (pictured). After decades, Scotti's even saved receipts from money orders he says he gave women for Cosby, though the money was moved in Scotti's name, he says . The money orders, though, are in Scotti's name and not Cosby's. 'I did a lot of crazy things for him,' Scotti told the Daily News. 'He was covering himself by having my name on it. It was a coverup. I realized it later.' And when he did, Scotti said he had to walk away. 'You've got all of these kids, every time,' he told the Daily News. 'I used to like him, but that's the reason I quit him after so many years — because of the girls.' In recent weeks, at least seven women have publicly accused the 77-year-old Cosby of sexual assault years ago. Cosby has not been charged in connection with any of the allegations. Only one woman has filed suit - Andrea Constand, who sued in 2005 and settled for an undisclosed amount before the case went to trial. Cosby's attorney, Martin Singer, has criticized previous 'decades-old discredited allegations' and denied some others. He suggested in a Friday statement that Cosby's accusers may have another agenda. 'There has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich, powerful men, so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted.' Models: Model Janice Dickinson, here in a file photo, is one of several women who claim they were raped by Cosby. Scotti claims the actor once had a deal with a Manhattan modeling agency, who delivered young women to his dressing room door . A statement issued Friday by Bill Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, in response to allegations of sexual assault against the comic: . 'The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity. These brand new claims about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous, and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years. Lawsuits are filed against people in the public eye every day. There has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich, powerful men, so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted. This situation is an unprecedented example of the media's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards. Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end?

"Ed Miliband's party has been accused of using blackmail to force a pro-Blair Labour candidate to drop out of the running for the Falkirk seat . Ed Miliband was last night embroiled in claims of a major corruption scandal involving allegations of ‘blackmail’ over the selection of a Labour candidate. Sources close to Mr Miliband have told The Mail on Sunday that the US employers of a Labour candidate were threatened with losing lucrative work with the party unless they told him to quit the race in favour of a pro-union rival. A senior Labour figure is alleged to have applied pressure to the  firm, run by one of Barack Obama’s advisers. And it is claimed a high-profile Labour supporter sent an email to officials at the party’s HQ, ordering them to ‘bend the rules’ to approve bogus last-minute block membership applications to ‘fix’ victory for the Left-wing candidate. Insiders say Mr Miliband is under pressure to censor the official report into the scandal to avoid political damage. The MP who won the seat for Labour at the last Election last night issued a public challenge to the party leader to respond to ‘worrying claims that serious corruption allegations are being swept under the carpet’. The row follows the contest to pick a successor to MP Eric Joyce after he was forced to resign from the Labour Party and his seat in Falkirk, as a result of a Commons fracas. The contest was suspended last month following allegations that the Unite union recruited its members to the constituency, with fees being paid en bloc by the union – in some cases without the individuals  even knowing they had joined. The union denied it had broken any rules. Labour General Secretary Ian McNichol launched an inquiry, but publication of the  report has been delayed. This newspaper has been told it is because party chiefs are determined to bury the toxic new allegations. Last night, Mr Joyce threw down the gauntlet to Mr Miliband. ‘It is being said the inquiry has been told a senior Labour figure emailed officials at party HQ telling them to process bogus applications,’ he said. ‘That is outrageous. And if it is true that one of the candidates’ employers was told to make him stand down by threatening to deprive them of Labour contracts, that would be political blackmail. Gregor Poynton is the pro-Blair UK political director of American firm Blue State Digital . Unite-backed Karie Murphy was a leading contender to become the Labour candidate in Falkirk. Labour is accused of engineering a win for Ms Murphy . Mr Miliband must show that serious corruption allegations are not being swept under the carpet.’ The Mail on Sunday was secretly alerted to the Falkirk scandal by an individual close to the Labour leadership, who insisted on meeting well away from Westminster. The two leading contenders for the safe Labour seat in Falkirk were Unite- backed Karie Murphy and Gregor Poynton, the pro-Tony Blair UK political director of US-run communications firm Blue State Digital. It is run by American whizzkid Joe Rospars, who has masterminded campaigns for Barack Obama. Earlier this year, the firm won a contract to advise Mr Miliband. The Labour whistleblower told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I was shocked to be told a senior Labour figure told Blue State Digital that unless Poynton pulled out of Falkirk, the company could lose contracts with Labour.’ When this newspaper put the allegation to Blue State Digital in America, a spokeswoman repeatedly stated: ‘We have no comment.’ Put to her that her stonewalling suggested the claim was true, she said: ‘No comment.’ The whistleblower also claimed a senior Labour figure had emailed staff at party HQ, urging them to process an 11th-hour block application to join Falkirk Labour Party by union supporters of Ms Murphy. A 100 new members were recruited to Falkirk almost overnight – a 50 per cent rise in its ranks. ‘It was a blatant bid to rig a seat on behalf of a candidate,’ said the whistleblower. Blue State Digital boss Joe Rospars (right) won a contract to advise Ed Miliband earlier this year. It has been alleged that threats were made that the contract could be withdrawn . Blairite Mr Poynton was knocked out . of the Falkirk selection battle when pro-union Labour supporters voted . to make it an all-women shortlist. Mr Poynton’s allies claimed it was a crude device to prevent him defeating Ms Murphy. Asked . about claims that his US employers had been told to make him withdraw . from the Falkirk contest, or face losing business from Labour, Mr . Poynton declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr Miliband said: ‘We have . no comment.’ The row is a rerun of the bitter squabbles between the rival camps of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown that tore Labour apart. Labour’s Lord Mandelson has attacked the activities of pro-union supporters in Falkirk. The Falkirk seat was left vacant after MP Eric Joyce (pictured) was forced to resign from his seat as a result of a Commons fracas . The US-run communications firm Blue State Digital has masterminded campaigns for Barack Obama . Union chiefs claim the allegations of foul play are sour grapes by Blairites. But even some union-sponsored MPs are worried about union tactics in Labour selection contests. ‘Some of the unions behave disgracefully and it should be stopped, but people are scared to speak out,’ said a Unite-backed Labour MP in a Commons bar last week, while nervously looking around to check he had not been overheard by any colleagues. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Ms Murphy or Mr Poynton, who is married to moderate Labour MP Gemma Doyle. A Labour spokesman said: ‘The Labour Party has acted swiftly and thoroughly to deal with this issue. As soon as complaints were made about irregularities in relation to new members of the Falkirk CLP the selection of a candidate was suspended and an inquiry was set up. ‘Appropriate action will be taken if the inquiry reports Labour Party rules have been broken.’","American communications company Blue State Digital won contract to advise Ed Miliband .

Julie Lemaitre protests outside the Maxwell C. King Center for the Performing Arts before a Bill Cosby performance in Melbourne, Fla., Friday . 'The thing is, these people are prodding and pushing people and asking people to have a frat house mentality,' he told Florida Today. 'Now suppose someone brings a weapon or decided to do more foolishness."" Cosby said that this is ""not good for anyone.' The Hollywood Reporter noted that an upcoming show in Las Vegas set for Nov. 28 was now cancelled. 'When you go to a civil rights march or something like that, at least there are meetings and some organization to it and people understand how to behave. There may be people coming to the show that don't know exactly what to do; there is no organization to it all.' 'I know people are tired of me not saying anything, but a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos,' Cosby told a reporter backstage at the King Center . That same day, Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, said the accusations had ""escalated far past the point of absurdity,"" dismissing them as 'fantastical,' 'unsubstantiated' and 'uncorroborated.' 'When will it end?' he asked. 'It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop.' And, throughout the audience, his fans agreed. Cosby said his silence was not an admission of guilt but because he should not be forced to answer 'innuendo' The show Friday night in Melbourne, Florida, might have seemed destined for disaster for the comedian, enveloped in growing accusations of rape and sexual assault that have derailed his career comeback and crumbled his tour schedule. What he got, though, was an adoring audience that laughed so hard they slapped their knees, shouted love at the stage and rose to their feet as he came and went. 'I think people went in there with him as Bill Cosby from the TV show,' said Travis Weberling, 40, of Melbourne, 'not the guy they heard about on the news.' The 2,000-seat theater beefed up security and announcements before Cosby took the stage warned a disturbance was possible — radio hosts had even offered cash and prizes to anyone who made it happen. Reporters swarmed the venue. But, in the end, just one protester stood outside, holding a sign that read, 'Rape is no joke.' The 2,000-seat theater beefed up security and announcements before Cosby took the stage warned a disturbance was possible — radio hosts had even offered cash and prizes to anyone who made it happen . What remained to be seen was whether the evening marked a turning point for a beloved television father, or simply a momentary reprieve. It did nothing to immediately change the fact that Cosby's projects have been nixed and stalled, performances have been canceled across the country and women continue to come forward accusing him of serious crimes. Fans seemed to believe Cosby should be seen as innocent until proven guilty. They talked of watching him on TV as a child, and of his albums becoming familiar friends when the moved to unfamiliar, faraway towns. They brushed off the accusations, howling at everything he uttered. Cobsy's 90-minute set wandered from a childhood fear of God to the loss of freedom in marriage to the rocket-speed Spanish of a piñata-store worker . When he took the stage at the Maxwell C. King Center For The Performing Arts, they stood and hollered, and he returned a thumbs-up. Only a smattering of empty seats were seen. Cosby wore cargo pants and a shirt that said 'Hello Friend' and never once ventured in the realm of controversy. His 90-minute set wandered from a childhood fear of God to the loss of freedom in marriage to the rocket-speed Spanish of a piñata-store worker. He sat for much at the start of the show, then grew increasingly physical, impersonating jujitsu and gymnastics poses, laying on the floor in stocking feet and thrusting a fist upward in a gesture of battling the everyday oppression of living with a wife. And when it was over, he said ""good night,"" walking off as the audience again stood. The most impassioned of his fans breathed a sigh of relief. Judith Stone traveled from Madison, West Virginia, for the show, deeming it 'absolutely fantastic' and grateful no one interrupted. Some of the women accusing Cosby are going public again after initially coming forward around 2005, when Andrea Constand filed a lawsuit alleging that she was sexually assaulted by him . 'I think he will leave with a very positive attitude,' she said. Elsewhere, audiences will not have the chance to see Cosby. Performances in Oklahoma, Nevada, Illinois, Arizona, South Carolina and Washington were called off. David Fischer, director of The Broadway Center in Tacoma, Washington, said an April appearance was called off because it conflicts with the organization's mission strengthen the community 'building empathy, furthering education and sharing joy.' Projects on NBC and Netflix have been canceled, and TV Land decided not to air reruns of ""The Cosby Show."" Cosby's producers said at least 28 other shows remain on his schedule through May 2015. Tom Werner, who co-founded the Carsey-Werner Company which produced ""The Cosby Show,"" defended Cosby in a statement to the Boston Globe. 'The Bill we knew was a brilliant and wonderful collaborator on a show that changed the landscape of television,' Werner and partner Marcy Carsey said in the statement. 'These recent news reports are beyond our knowledge or comprehension.' And, even in a crowd of Cosby faithful, there was some worry there was more to come. 'This very well may be Bill Cosby's last show,' said Marcus Utt, 25, of Melbourne. The day of his performance, his attorney, Martin Singer, dismisses allegations as 'fantastical,' 'unsubstantiated' and 'uncorroborated' Some of the women accusing Cosby are going public again after initially coming forward around 2005, when Andrea Constand filed a lawsuit alleging that she was sexually assaulted by him. Tamara Green, a California attorney, also said Cosby tried to sexually assault her in her Los Angeles apartment around 1970, when she was a model and an aspiring actress. She said Cosby gave her two pills that made her almost lose consciousness, took her to her apartment, undressed her and then took his clothes off as she fought off his advances. Another woman, Joan Tarshis, said Cosby gave her drug-laced drinks twice in 1969, forcing her to perform a sex act the first time and raping her the second time. She said she told no one about this for decades, and only decided to go public when she read a Nov. 13 column in The Washington Post by Barbara Bowman, who alleges she was drugged and raped by Cosby when she was 17. And, offering a familiar narrative, another woman, Therese Serignese, said she was drugged and raped by Cosby in 1976. The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity.

"Thanks to well-endowed stars such as Beyonce and Rihanna, curvaceous derrieres have never been more popular. But as mother-of-two Apryl Brown knows only too well, attempting to get the look using silicone filler can have catastrophic results. Instead of a curvier behind, Mrs Brown was left in agony and eventually had to have her buttocks, legs and arms amputated after a black market practitioner injected her with industrial grade silicone of the sort commonly used in bathroom sealant. Scroll down for video . Survivor: The botched operation left Apryl in agony and meant her hands and feet had to be amputated . Now the 46-year-old is speaking out in a bid to encourage others to steer clear of rogue practitioners and become more accepting of their bodies. Her problems began in 2005 when a woman claiming she could provide buttock injections walked into her salon. Instead of telling her to leave, Apryl, who says she always wanted bigger buttocks, was thrilled and immediately agreed to have the treatment. At first, everything seemed fine but just months after having the injections, the pain began. 'They [Apryl's buttocks] started to get hard, and then they started to get . discoloured,' she explains. 'By 2006, it was starting to itch and by 2007, the pain . started. 'One thing about pain is that you can't turn it off. I couldn't . sleep, I couldn't eat, I couldn't even concentrate.'

''I . had gone to this party one Saturday night and woke up Sunday morning . and thought ""oh my God, Apryl!"". I just couldn't pull myself together,' she remembers. 'That night was the roughest night of my life. I literally scratched all . of the skin off my buttocks. My nails pulled all of the skin off my . body. And when my sister came in, and she saw that, it freaked her out.' Apryl was rushed to hospital, where surgeons discovered that a massive infection caused by the impure silicone had caused her body to go into severe shock. 'The only end point on silicone . injections is removal,' explains the doctor who saved Apryl's life, James Jens Black. 'Removal when it's not infected or removal when it . is infected and about to kill you.' After a month in a coma, Apryl awoke to a very different world. The drugs that saved Apryl's life had diverted blood flow to her essential organs, keeping her heart beating and liver functioning as her body fought off the infection. But her hands and feet, starved of oxygen while the drugs did their work, had died. 'I just moved the cover and I saw my right foot and I thought ""oh my God"" and it was that moment, that's when it got real,' remembers Apryl. Gruesome: The damage to Apryl's backside following the botched jab. Her buttocks were later amputated . Dangerous: Silicone injections nearly always have terrible side effects, say leading surgeons . 'They were just black and swollen and necrotic and there was gangrene, and one [of Apryl's family members] said: ""just look at your hands"" and I looked and that's when it got really real. Along with her buttocks, too damaged and infected from the injections to remain, her hands and feet had to be amputated. Despite the heavy price she paid for cheap surgery, Apryl says that she's recovering and is determined to enjoy the rest of her life. 'Now it's just my new normal,' she explains. 'Now it's . just different. Now I don't just wake up and jump up on my legs, I wake . up and snap on my prosthetics. 'The hands, that's more challenging . because you don't really realise how much you do with them until you . don't have them.' Leading surgeon, Dr Massimiliano Marcellino of the London Centre for Aesthetic Surgery, commented: 'We strongly discourage our patients from undergoing buttock injections. 'You will not find any professional Harley Street cosmetic surgeon that would be prepared to perform this procedure.' She also hopes others will learn from her story and offers this advice to those contemplating surgery: 'Don't ever . do anything without researching it and definitely don't ever do anything . on the black market. 'It's not about how you fall down. It's not about . making choices that are not catastrophic. It's about knowing how to get . up. 'And the only thing that will ever make you feel better about . yourself is feeling loved. That you are enough, no matter how it looks, . what it is or how it feels, that it's enough.'

"Pope Francis condemned corruption claiming it was a worse evil than sin, but compared it to bad breath, 'someone who has it hardly ever realises it'. The Pontiff was meeting delegates from the International Association of Penal Law in the Vatican. He also condemned the process of extraordinary rendition, holding prisoners without trial and the death penalty. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis warned that corruption was a greater evil than sin and needed to be cured . He called for the abolition of capital punishment even describing imprisonment as its own death penalty . Pope Francis was addressing members of the International Association of Penal Law in the Vatican . He said: 'The scandalous accumulation of global wealth is possible because of the connivance of those with strong powers who are responsible for public affairs. The corrupt one does not perceive his own corruption. It is a little like what happens with bad breath: someone who has it hardly ever realises it; other people notice and have to tell him' 'Corruption is an evil greater than sin. More than forgiveness, this evil needs to be cured.' Pope Francis said some states used 'extra-judicial executions' as an unintended consequence of an action. He claimed that the death penalty has been used 'an instrument of suppression of political dissent or of persecution of religious or cultural minorities'. Pope Francis also warned against the use of pretrial detention. He said it is being used improperly as another form of unlawful punishment that is 'hidden behind legality'. He said: 'In the world today, torture is used not only as a means to achieve a particular purpose, such as a confession or an accusation—practices that are characteristic of a doctrine of national security — but also adds to the evil of detention.' He continued: 'Criminal code itself bears responsibility for having allowed, in certain cases, the legitimacy of torture under certain conditions, opening the way for further abuse.' He said: 'Caution in the application of penal codes must be the overarching principle of legal systems … and respect for human dignity must not only act to limit the arbitrariness and excesses of government agents but as the guiding criterion for prosecuting and punishing behaviors that represent the most serious attacks on the dignity and integrity of the human person.' Pope Francis said he believed the death penalty was an abuse of human rights and warned against the rise of 'penal populism' where politicians attempt to solve the problems in society by a tough stance on crime rather than following a path of social justice. He said the media and politicians advocated  'violence and revenge, public and private, not only against those responsible for crimes, but also against those under suspicion, justified or not'. Pope Francis said the criminal code should protect human dignity when instead it legitimises torture . Pope Francis warned that national security was being used as an excuse to perpetrate injustice . He said: 'It is impossible to imagine that states today cannot make use of another means than capital punishment to defend peoples’ lives from an unjust aggressor . 'All Christians and people of good will are thus called today to struggle not only for abolition of the death penalty, whether it be legal or illegal and in all its forms, but also to improve prison conditions, out of respect for the human dignity of persons deprived of their liberty. And this, I connect with life imprisonment. 'Life imprisonment is a hidden death penalty.' He said: 'The traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor that cases in which the execution of the offender is an absolute necessity are very rare, if not practically non-existent.' Pope Francis said that prison conditions should respect a person's dignity while they are deprived of liberty .","Pope Francis compared corruption to bad breath in a Vatican address .

"Gang members in Mexico have admitted to massacring 43 students who went missing in September after the local mayor demanded they be 'taught a lesson' so they didn't interrupt a speech by his wife. Attorney General Jesus Murillo said on Friday that three detainees revealed that they set fire to the group - some of whom were still alive - at a rubbish dump near Iguala in the state of Guerrero, close to where the students went missing. So far, 19 mass graves have been discovered around Iguala and more than 70 people have been arrested. Scroll down for video . The 43 students, pictured, went missing as they travelled to a protest in Iguala, Guerrero State  in September . Residents have held demonstrations calling for a full investigation into the fate of the 43 missing students . Jose Luis Abarca, who was previously mayor of Iguala, left, and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda right, were found and arrested in Mexico City on Monday and are believed to have masterminded the massacre . Investigators believe that the fires used to dispose of the bodies burned for 15 hours. After the flames died down, it is claimed that gang members waded through the ashes to recover any bone or teeth which may have survived the intense heat. The 46 students have not been seen since they disappeared near the southern city of Iguala on September 26 after being attacked by police. Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said: 'The high level of degradation caused by the fire in the remains make it very difficult to extract the DNA that will allow an identification.' The bone fragments are being sent to Austria to a specialist laboratory for DNA testing. Police allegedly handed the students over to the Guerreros Unidos cartel who are believed to have killed them and disposed of their bodies. Murillo Karam said there is no evidence the students were involved in organized crime. Some 74 people have been detained so far in the case. Authorities say it started when police, under orders of then Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca, opened fire on students who were in Iguala collecting donations and had commandeered public buses. Jose Luis Abarca, left and his wife Maria de Los Angeles Pineda are believed to have links to the drug cartel . Investigators believe the bodies of the 43 missing students were burned at this rubbish dump . Six people were killed in two confrontations before the 43 students were taken away and allegedly handed over to Guerreros Unidos. Abarca and his wife, who were captured Tuesday after weeks of being on the run, are among those in custody. Jose Luis Abarca, who was previously mayor of Iguala, and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda were found and arrested in Mexico City on Monday. They are accused of organising the alleged massacre. Concerned that the group were about to disrupt a speech to be given by his politically ambitious wife, Abarca ordered police to 'teach them a lesson' according to Mexican media reports. Pineda demanded that police arrest they students when they threatened to ruin a party she was having, and once the police had the students they were then handed over to the gang members. Prior to this the police also opened fire on the group, killing several before the bodies were burned. Attorney General Jesus Murillo is seen leaving the prison after speaking with three gang members . Protesters walk with a sign featuring a photograph of the students . Pineda was able to make these demands as she is at the top of the criminal underworld tree in Iguala, and it was believed her speech may have been her announcement of her desire to succeed her husband as mayor. What's worse, the students had no intention of disrupting Pineda's speech, but were merely travelling through the town on buses they'd hired to take them to Mexico City for a remembrance service in honor of students massacred there in 1968. There has been and continues to be a massive outcry across Mexico to see that justice is served for this mass murder. Authorities searching for the students have found a large number of bodies, although Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said he would have to wait until the results of DNA tests have been returned before confirming their identities. He admitted that many of the bodies had been badly burned which will make the process of extracting DNA more difficult. He said: 'I have to identify, to do everything in my power, to identify, to know if these were the students.' Some parents of the missing students do not believe that their children are among the dead. Mario Cesar Gonzalez told CNN: 'We are not going to believe anything until the experts tell us: You know what? It is them.' Isrrael Galindo, claimed: 'The government is trying to resolve things its way so that to rid itself of this great problem it is facing. My son is alive. My son is alive. My son is alive.' The victims were mostly in their 20s studying to be teachers when they planned to travel to Iguala on September 26 for a demonstration. Protesters have been holding regular demonstrations demanding the safe return of the missing students . Locals have lost faith in the Mexican government and their ability to investigate incidents such as this . Some of the families are unwilling to accept that their relatives are dead until they receive conclusive proof . Amnesty International has criticised the Attorney General over his handling of the case. Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas Director of Amnesty International said: 'Tragically, the enforced disappearance of these student teachers is just the latest in a long line of horrors to have befallen Guerrero state, and the rest of the country. 'The warning signs of corruption and violence have been there for all to see for years, and those that negligently ignored them are themselves complicit in this tragedy.' Amnesty said the mayor of Iguala has long been suspected of criminality and links to drugs cartels. Ms Guevara Rosas said: 'If the allegations against Iguala’s mayor and the federal and local police had been investigated when other serious human rights violations occurred, it is more than likely that the terrible murders and enforced disappearances of the students would not have taken place.'

"Google CEO Larry Page announces that the search giant has concluded a $12.5 billion deal to buy Motorola Mobility, a key manufacturer of smartphones and other devices . Google completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of phone maker Motorola - and immediately appointed a senior Google exec as CEO. Google is widely expected to use the acquisition to produce further phones and tablets running its Android software - including Google-branded rivals to Apple's iPad. Dennis Woodside, previously president of Google's Americas region, is Motorola's new CEO. It is Google's largest acquisition ever, and pushes it deeper into the phone market. Google CEO Larry Page said, 'Many users coming online today may never use a desktop machine, and the impact of that transition will be profound.' Besides producing smartphones and tablet computers, Motorola  also makes cable-TV boxes that could provide Google with a springboard for delivering more of its services, including advertising, to living rooms in the form of a revamped version of its Google TV service. Macquarie Securities analyst Benjamin Schachter believes Google is particularly interested in developing a better tablet computer powered by its Android software to compete against Apple's hot-selling iPad and Amazon's Kindle Fire. Google is already a formidable force in mobile computing thanks to its Android software, the most popular mobile operating system on Earth. Motorola's Xoom tablet: Google is widely expected to use the acquisition to produce further phones and tablets running its Android software - including Google-branded rivals to Apple's iPad . At the same time, the acquisition has been interpreted as largely a defensive one. Google needs Motorola's trove of 17,000 cellphone patents to defend Android phones against lawsuits by Apple, which accuses them of copying iPhone features. Google and Motorola announced the deal last summer, expecting it would close late last year or early this year. But approval from Chinese regulators was slow in coming. On Saturday, China approved the deal, on condition that Google Inc.'s Android software would remain free for other phone makers for at least five years. Regulators in the U.S. and Europe had cleared the deal three months ago. The acquisition will also test Google's ability to keep its business partners, shareholders and employees happy as it moves beyond Internet search and other services built on software to begin manufacturing a wide range of equipment for the first time. Google executive Dennis Woodside was appointed as the new CEO of Motorola. Woodside is also an Ironman Triathlete . Google has been reassuring its Android partners that Motorola's devices won't get souped-up versions of the software or receive other preferential treatment. Although it initially was drawn to Motorola Mobility for its patents, Google has been signaling recently that it has been drawing up more ambitious plans for Motorola Mobility. The company also will likely have to do some hand-holding with investors who have already been fretting about Motorola Mobility's troubles eroding Google's hefty profit margins. As its line of smartphones has waned in popularity, Motorola Mobility has suffered losses totaling $1.7 billion during the past three years. Google has earned a total of $25 billion over the same stretch. The contrasting fortunes of the two companies is one reason why CEO Larry Page has decided to operate Motorola Mobility separately so it will be easier for investors to track how the different lines of business are faring. Turning around Motorola Mobility also will require layoffs, a painful process that belies Google's carefully cultivated image as a cuddly employer. Google laid off about 300 people after it paid $3.2 billion to acquire online advertising service DoubleClick Inc. in 2008, up until the biggest deal in the company's history. The cutbacks represented about one-quarter of the workforce that Google inherited from DoubleClick. If Google imposes a similar reduction on Motorola Mobility's 20,500-employee payroll, it would translate into about 5,000 layoffs. Taking on so many new employees also raises the risk of culture clashes with the 33,000 people already working at Google. Motorola Mobility is one half of the old Motorola Inc. It split at the beginning of last year. The other half, Motorola Solutions Inc., is still independent. It sells police radios, barcode scanners and other products aimed at government and corporate customers. Google shares fell $5.69 to $608.41 in morning trading Tuesday. They are still near their 52-week high of $670.25 per share set in early January.","Analyst expects Google-branded tablet to fight iPad .

"Three men charged with burning alive 43 Mexican students ahead of a speech by the mayor's wife have chillingly reenacted the horrific massacre for investigators. Footage released by the Attorney General shows the suspects using twigs and trash bags to explain candidly  how they layered the victims 'like a grill' before bathing them in gasoline and setting them alight. Their voices are cold and unemotional as officers follow them through the rubbish dump where every single victim was shot, killed and dumped in a river near Iguala in Guerrero State. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO - WARNING: SOME VIEWERS MAY FIND IT DISTURBING . Chilling: This is one of three gangs members who walked investigators through the brutal alleged massacre of 43 students near Iguala, in Mexico's Guerrero State. He used a twig to show how the bodies were stacked . Unemotional: Another suspect sat handcuffed in the police station mimes swinging the bodies one by one . Cover up: A third leads the detectives down to the river by San Juan bridge where the bodies were dumped . Gestering in handcuffs, one in a high visibility jacket is sat in the police station as he confirms reports that the students were targeted en route to protesting at a speech made by Mayor Jose Luis Abarca's wife. Abarca allegedly demanded that the students be 'taught a lesson' so they didn't interrupt the event. He tells investigators: 'They came in the biggest truck. They asked them who they were, and they all responded that they were students. 'So they took them down and asked them why they had come to Iguala, and they said they had come for Abarca's wife.' Another takes the investigators to the scene, using plastic bags as props. He dumps one on the dirt, saying: 'They let them drop like that. The students stood up and then they would walk like this [bending with his hands behind his head].' Step by step: This suspect crouches with his hands behind his head as the students did, he explained . Leaving no trace: The group left the fire burning for 15 hours before cleaning up, investigators believe . Hidden: Every trace of charcoal and bone was deposited in bags and bottles then thrown in the river . The alleged gang member shows how they were then pushed to the ground and shot. Those that died instantly were then dragged by their hands or legs into one pile and the living into another. Brazenly, one suspect then mimes how all the victims were swung into a landfill one at a time by two gang members. 'The bodies would roll until they reached the flat part,' a third suspect chilling recounted in a monotonous voice. Nearby, they built a circle of rocks and put tires in the middle, he explains. On top of the tires, they put firewood. All 43 bodies were then layered on. 'In the beginning, the bodies would be placed like this,' he said, scratching lines into the ground using a stick.'Like a grill'. A second layer of victims would then be placed over them at a perpendicular angle, followed by another layer - 'until all the bodies fit'. Two members - named as El Huassaco and El Deva - stood at either end of the pile and 'bathed the grill of bodies with diesel and gasoline'. Handcuffed: Here one man, identified as 'El Chereje', swings his arms to show how they were set alight . 'Ordered': El Chereje refers to gang leaders who he claims ordered them to get rid of the bodies in the river . Desperate to hide all trace of their victims, the men were then scrambled to find bottles and plastic to put on the fire to stop it from extinguishing. They left with the fire still burning and came back to clean with trash bags and bottles to pick up the charcoal and bones, the suspects said. When their truck arrived at the San Juan bridge a gang leader identified as 'El Turco' allegedly told the group to deposit the bags, making small holes in them so the remains were lost in the water. So far, 19 mass graves have been discovered around Iguala and more than 70 people have been arrested. This is part of the widespread crime scene cordoned off by police in Iguala where they found 19 mass graves .

"Bill Clinton likes $550 wristwatches so much that he has bought 14 of them to give away as presents, he told a Denver audience on Wednesday. The former president will receive $944,000 in pension and benefits from taxpayers this year and spent $7,700 on the watches, not counting the two he owns himself. In the run-up to the 2016 elections he and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, are trying desperately to distance themselves from charges that they've become wealthy elites. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'You want one too?' Bill Clinton pointed to his $550 Shinola watch on Wednesday after a panel discussion with Chipotle Mexican Grill Co-CEO Monty Moran . Time on his hands: WHen the former president is running late for a $500,000 speaking gig, he checks this Shinola 'Runwell' watch -- one with a tan band and another in black . Bill fed that narrative Wednesday in Denver during a Q&A session at the annual meeting of his Clinton Global Initiative. Asked about a rumor about his spending splurge during an April 26 visit to the Shinola watch factory in Detroit, Clinton chuckled as he explained how he bought five watches last year to give as Christmas presents, and another nine this year. The stunned Q&A moderator turned to the audience and said he hadn't known the story was true. 'I had no idea,' he deadpanned. 'I thought I was just pulling his leg.' The Daily Caller reported that Clinton said the group he was traveling with in Detroit bought as many as 30 of the timepieces. He already owned two of the Shinola 'Runwell' watches – the leather bands are different colors – and a factory employee gave him a third in April, with the Presidential Seal engraved on the back. When he visited the Detroit watch-assembly facility, according to Crain's Detroit Business, Clinton called the watch 'elegant and informal,' adding that the Runwell model's large numbers help him with his flagging eyesight. Shinola is America's most prolific producer of watches, which are more often made in Europe and Asia. It also produces bicycles, leather goods, journals, leather goods and pet toys. Its name comes from a World War II expression that name-checked the Shinola brand of show polish. A common put-down in the U.S. at the time was, 'You don't know s**t from Shinola.' The company acquired the trademark in 2011. 'Not out of touch': Bill Clinton's spending sprees aren't helping his wife Hillary reposition herself as a woman of the people in advance of an expected run for president in 2016 . Yes, THAT Shinola: The watch company's namesake used to be a shoe polish that inspired the insult 'You don't know s**t from Shinola' Despite a taxpayer-funded lifestlye, a reported $500,000 standard speaking fee and a growing collection of expensive timepieces, former President Clinton insisted on Tuesday during an NBC News interview that he and his wife are normal people. 'I think I had the lowest net worth of any American President in the 20th century when I took office,' he claimed. Twenty-two years later, the Clintons are the wealthiest living former first couple. 'We’ve got a good life, and I’m grateful for it. But we go to our local grocery store on the weekend. We talk to people in our town. We know what’s going on.' Hillary Clinton said Wednesday during an interview with PBS that comparing her wealth to that of Mitt Romney, the super-rich Republican presidential candidate in 2012, would be 'a false equivalency.' She earns a reported $225,000 per speaking engagement, including a planned autumn appearance at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, a school that has nearly tripled tuition costs in the past decade. One student there told MailOnline that Mrs. Clinton's anticipated payday is 'obscene ... maybe they should book someone else who won't add to the reasons we're paying more for school.'","Former president visited the one-of-a-kind U.S. watch factory in Detroit that built his own watch and bought 14 of them at $550 each to give as presents .

"A deaf quadriplegic blogger who won the hearts of thousands with touching internet posts before his sister announced he had died from pneumonia has been exposed as a fraud. 'David Rose', a 24-year-old cerebral palsy sufferer, garnered legions of fans with his witty tweets and Facebook posts, which he said he typed using a Tobii computer that tracked his eye movement using infrared light. After his story gained national coverage, Rose's sister 'Nichole' revealed online on October 11 that he had passed away, leading to an outpouring of grief and sympathy from across the internet. But now a fellow blogger, who carried out web investigations after becoming suspicious of Rose, has exposed him as a fake, revealing just how he spun an intricate web of lies that fooled so many. Lies: A deaf paraplegic blogger named David Rose has been revealed as a fake after a fellow blogger grew suspicious of his claims. 'Rose' had used this picture on social networking sites . Ruse: The picture is actually of a man named Hunter Dunn and has appeared in news reports, pictured . After learning of Rose's death and his 'last blog post', published by his sister on Friday, blogger Kristi-Anne began to question the story. Writing a post exposing the fraud, she asked how a paraplegic who could only type four words a minute could keep in such swift and consistent contact with followers online. She also wondered how life must be for someone who was deaf and unable to sign as a result of his cerebral palsy - yet also noted how he described his friends and relationships with such detail. She then found that the photo Rose had been using was actually of Hunter Dunn, another young man with cerebral palsy, whose picture appears on the Tobii site. Kristi-Anne was unable to discover . Dunn's Facebook page, and noted that it was he who deserved the real . praise for being an inspiration man, rather than the fake 'Rose'. She . added that most of Rose's tweets had been sent using TweetDeck, a . social media dashboard where users can view multiple messages at once . and send their own. False: 'Rose' had also uploaded this photo of him using his Tobii computer to type messages with his eyes . Revealed: But the blogger also found that picture was of Hunter Dunn from the computer's website . After sending her findings to theCHIVE, who had followed Rose's 'inspirational' story, they agreed it made no sense that Rose could be using this technology. 'Somebody using a Tobii ocular reader . would never use TweetDeck,' wrote reporter John Resig. 'But somebody posing as . Dave could easily use the Deck.' Resig added on his own post that one of his friends, who had been in close contact with Rose, flew to Los Angeles to attend his funeral after learning about his death. But Nichole Rose made her excuses and . refused to meet the friend. TheCHIVE also discovered there was no death . certificate for Rose. After . Kristi-Anne published her blog post, a blogger immediately commented on . it, admitting that they had carried out the hoax - and lauding its . positive effects. Yet, while . identifying themselves as Nichole, the blogger added that that person . was also a character - and her pictures were of an actress from a music . video. 'No celebrity or . fame was intended in this ruse; it all came quite fast and was a total . surprise,' they wrote. 'Up until recently he only had a handful of . online friends. The quick and furious fame is actually what brought . about the end of it all. New persona: He wrote a blog, tweeted and posted Facebook messages, gathering thousands of fans. He spoke a lot about his sister 'Nichole' - who he now admits is also made up . 'In hindsight it probably would have been better just to shut it all down and have everyone wonder what the hell happened, but the final post was meant to have the effect it did. 'To inspire people to love and live a . better life, and the public knowledge that it came under this false . pretense takes it all away.

"They may be old classics, but these books have been left completely timeless. American Artist Alexis Arnold has grown crystals on classic books including 'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea', 'Phantom Tollbooth', and 'The Singing Tree'. The 30-year-old, from San Francisco, uses laundry detergent to create the crystals which appear after the books are soaked in hot water and left to dry. Impressive: Artist Alexis Arnold, 30, grows crystals on books to create stunning effects . Sparkling: The artist, from San Francisco, uses laundry detergent to create the crystals which appear after the books are soaked in hot water and left to dry. This shows the book Encyclopedia of Superstitions . Her work has become so popular university libraries exhibit the books and they sell for around £320. Ms Arnold said: 'When selecting objects to crystallise, I was mostly concerned with objects that had lost their function or place, and printed books were fitting into this category more and more. 'I decided to start crystallising books and the following day came across eight boxes of wonderful, old books on the side of the road. 'I primarily use the laundry detergent, Twenty Mule Team Borax, to grow crystals on the various objects, but there are many household products that can be used to grow different types of crystals. Crystallised: The work has become extremely popular, with university libraries exhibiting the books and they sell for about £320. This book is the Alchemists Handbook . Stunning: Ms Arnold said the reaction to her work varies but often the growth of the crystals symbolises growth through childhood as many of the works are children's fiction. This book is called This Is Water . 'I start by creating a super-saturated solution of Borax in boiling water. When water boils, its molecules expand. 'I submerge the book in the hot, saturated solution and carefully manipulate the book to my liking. As the saturated water cools again, the molecules shrink and any excess Borax crystallises. 'Once the solution has completely cooled and the crystals have grown on the submerged objects, I drain the solution and dry the object without disturbing its shape. 'The objects will hold their new, transformed shape when completely dry.' Gleaming: Ms Arnold said that when she is selecting things to crystallise, she is mostly concerned with objects that had lost their function or place. This shows the World Book 1978 Year Book in crystals . Talented: This cactus was also crystallised by the artist . Ms Arnold says the crystals  change from translucent to opaque over time depending on atmospheric conditions. She said the reaction to her work varies but often the growth of the crystals symbolises growth through childhood as many of the works are children's fiction. She said: 'I love hearing people's response to my work and the interpretations vary, along with which books people prefer. Unique: Ms Arnold says the crystals remove the text and transform the books into aesthetic, non-functional objects which leave the stories to remain as memories. This is the book Chemistry - An Experimental Science . Original: Ms Arnold says much of her artwork represents visual displays of time, memory, and history. This shows The Singing Tree . 'It may be due to the books I have chosen or an association of crystal growth and youth, but many people tell me the work evokes memories from their childhood. 'The crystals remove the text and transform the books into aesthetic, non-functional objects, leaving the stories to remain as memories. 'The books, now frozen with heavy crystal growth, have become artefacts or geologic specimens imbued with the history of time, use, and nostalgia. 'Much of my artwork seeks to represent the visual displays of time, memory, and history.'
