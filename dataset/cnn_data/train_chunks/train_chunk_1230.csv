"A schooner that tragically sank in Lake Superior 115 years ago was recently rediscovered in its watery grave. The 199-foot long, three-masted Nelson sank near Grand Marais, Michigan in 1899 in the midst of a spring gale, claiming the lives of all but one of the 10 on board. The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society located the schooner recently, and sent a diver down to take pictures of the boat on the bottom of Lake Superior. Scroll down for video . The Nelson schooner sank in Lake Superior more than 115 years ago. Above, a sonar image of the boat in its watery grave . The Nelson sank on May 13, 1899 in the midst of a spring gale. Only the captain survived . The nine others on board died after being put in a lifeboat that was eventually dragged down with the quickly-sinking ship . 'It is a significant find. This is a wreck I think a lot of people have been looking for for a number of years. It has a great story,' Darryll Ertel, Director of Marine Operations for the Great Lake Shipwreck Historical Society, told 9 & 10 News. The Nelson was being towed by the steamer Folsum, along with another schooner named the Mary Mitchell, when the group of boats encountered rough waters due to a spring gale on May 13, 1899. 'Ice was covering the decks and before they knew it they were fighting for their lives,' Bruce Lynn, executive director of the Great Lakes shipwreck historical society said. Captain White of the Folsum made the decision to turn the boats back to port when he noticed that the Nelson was lulling. That's when the tow line snapped and the Nelson began its quick descent under water. Above, the location in Lake Superior, near Grand Marais, where the Nelson sank more than 115 years ago . 'It is a significant find. This is a wreck I think a lot of people have been looking for for a number of years. It has a great story,' Darryll Ertel, Director of Marine Operations for the Great Lake Shipwreck Historical Society, said . The captain of the Nelson worked quickly to put the his wife, infant child and the rest of the crew into a lifeboat. He then jumped from the sinking boat and by the time he resurfaced, the ship was almost completely submerged. Tragically, the lifeboat had been pulled under with it,  and Captain Hagginey's family and the rest of the crew perished. Hagginey survived after grabbing onto a piece of debris and eventually finding his way to shore. 'You have to think about 10 people and only one survivor and a captain that went down in front of his eyes. It is truly a tragic story but again this is a story we can tell and help people understand what was happening on the lakes in the 1890s,' Lynn said.","The Nelson sank on May 13, 1899 in the midst of a spring gale .

"Skaters are often music lovers, so it was only a matter of time before the two hobbies were combined. A student has created a modified skateboard that has speakers built into the base - and even a dock for a mobile phone or music player. And, in addition to playing music from the docked device, the Chargeboard can charge its battery using kinetic energy generated by the board's spinning wheels. Scroll down for video . A student at the Willem de Kooning Academy of art and design in Rotterdam has designed an electric skateboard called the Chargeboard (shown). The device has a docking station for the iPhone 4 and 4S. When turned on its side it can charge the phone and it also has speakers to play music . The Chargeboard was created by Bjorn van den Hout as part of a graduation project at the Willem de Kooning Academy of Art and Design in Rotterdam. He is now seeking funding for the project on Kickstarter. The two dynamo’s in the rear axles of the board generate 6V each. This electricity is then converted back to a 5V current and gets stored in to a powerbox. When a user docks their iPhone into the board, the powerbox automatically begins charging it. While in the dock, users can also play tracks using a speaker in the base. It is currently a prototype, but its designer plans to launch a Kickstarter campaign to fund production. In the wheels. two dynamos generate 6V when they spin, which is converted to a 5V current in the box of the skateboard. Aside from powering the speakers, this also charges the phone when it’s plugged in. The Chargeboard docking station is currently compatible with the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4S, although a 3.5mm headphone jack and a USB 2.0 port means other devices can also be used. The wheels of the board charge a battery pack in the board as it moves. One hour of riding can completely charge a phone. The board also has a 3.5mm headphone jack and USB port for use with other devices . In the wheels (pictured) two dynamos generate 6V when they spin, which is converted to a 5V current in the box of the skateboard. Aside from powering the speakers, this also charges the phone when it’s plugged in . Riding the board for one hour generates enough power to fully charge a phone, while the built-in battery can charge a phone eight times over. ‘I really want to develop it further, and bring it to market,’ van den Hout told MailOnline. ‘So I’m looking for a team of people who want to technically develop Chargeboard, and an investor would be great to get the project off the ground! ‘Because I just graduated I don’t have the financial capacity to finance it on my own.’ Designer Bjorn van den Hout plans to start a Kickstarter campaign on Monday 29 September to raise funding for production of the Chargeboard (pictured)","Chargeboard was built at the Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam .

"It's certainly an unusual sight to see a 30-tonne sperm whale being transported by lorry - but this unfortunate mammal that washed up on a beach is on its way to be buried as landfill. The 45ft whale was found at Portobello beach in Joppa, Edinburgh, on Saturday and towed to Burntisland, Fife, before being driven to a Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme facility. An examination was carried out at the facility in Dunbar, East Lothian, to determine its cause of death - and the whale’s huge carcass will now be disposed of as landfill at the seaside town. On the road: The 45ft mammal was driven to a Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme facility in Dunbar . Probe: A marine rescue worker photographs the whale that washed up on an Edinburgh beach on Saturday . Dunbar Community Council chairman Stephen Bunyan said: ‘My son told me about it coming to Dunbar and we both wondered why they were bringing it here. ‘But if it is going to landfill, I imagine they have brought an expert to carry out tests. I’ve never heard of it happening before, but I suppose it (makes) sense. What else are you going to do with a whale?’ Teams from Police Scotland, the Scottish SPCA, Whale and Dolphin Conservation and British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) were at the scene as crowds gathered to see the stricken mammal. Experts believe it died after being struck by boat propellers in deeper water, although it will be weeks before the official cause of death is confirmed. Investigation: Experts believe it died after being struck by boat propellers in deeper water, although it will be weeks before the official cause of death is confirmed . Onlookers: Teams from Police Scotland, the Scottish SPCA, Whale and Dolphin Conservation and British Divers Marine Life Rescue were at the scene as crowds gathered to see the stricken mammal . Corinne Gordon, a marine mammal medic with BDMLR, was part of the team to examine the whale, which suffered deep cuts around its mouth and to its dorsal fin. 'What else are you going to do with a whale?' Stephen Bunyan, Dunbar Community Council chairman . She said: ‘One of our experts, Dr Andrew Brownlow, came down to carry out an examination and took samples to establish a cause of death. ‘It will be quite a while before the results come back, but we believe it has been hit by propellers of a boat. Fully-grown male sperm whales can reach up to 20 metres (65ft), so he wasn’t a full adult.’ Last year a pod of 14 sperm whales was spotted near the Firth of Forth. They are usually found in deeper waters off the North and West of Scotland towards the Atlantic, where they hunt squid. Dead: The 45ft, 30-tonne sperm whale suffered deep cuts around its mouth and to its dorsal fin . Location: The 45ft mammal was found at Portobello beach in Joppa, Edinburgh, on Saturday morning . A pod of 26 pilot whales washed up in a beaching further up the east coast in Pittenweem, Fife, in 2012. 'We believe it has been hit by propellers of a boat. Fully-grown male sperm whales can reach up to 20 metres (65ft), so he wasn’t a full adult' Corinne Gordon, marine mammal medic . Ten survived and were re-floated, but rescuers had to winch the carcasses of 13 whales to the top of cliffs at the Fife beach to dispose of them after they died. The sperm whale, or cachalot, is the largest of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator. Mature males average around 52ft in length, with the head representing up to one-third of the animal’s length - while females are smaller, growing to about 42ft long. Sperms whale feed primarily on squid - and plunging 9,800ft for prey, it is the deepest diving mammal. It has the largest brain of any animal, more than five times heavier than a human’s.","30-tonne whale found at Portobello beach in Edinburgh on Saturday .

"This is the stunning moment a fearless diver came face to face with a 50ft whale. The extraordinary encounter happened as diver Reinhard Mink swam in the sea near the Azores Islands in Portugal. He suddenly found himself just inches away from the Sei whale - one of the fastest whales on the planet, with speeds of up to 40mph. Spectacular: Diver Reinhard Mink comes face to face with a 50ft whale near the Azores Islands in Portugal . But instead of panicking and darting away, Mr Mink looked directly into the whale's eyes and posed for the camera. The experienced diver, from Darmstadt, Germany, described the encounter as 'special' and 'exciting'. 'To get close enough to meet one of the biggest, fastest whales in the water doesn't happen very often,' he said. 'Even if you're lucky enough to see one, it's very rare to get so close. 'I . looked directly into his eye and that's something I will never forget. That feeling of two species trying to understand each other was . remarkable. It was a very special moment.' Inches away: The amazing encounter happened as Mr Mink swam in the sea between the Pico and Faial islands . Confident: Instead of darting away, Mr Mink looked directly into the whale's eyes and posed for the camera . Impressive: The Sei whale, above, is one of the fastest whales on the planet - reaching speeds of 40mph . Mr Mink had been working on a . documentary about Sperm whales with cameraman Kai Matthes, scientist Rui . Prieto and their skipper Emanuel when they were told a Sei whale had . been spotted in the area. With permission from the Azores government, they then dived into the water between the islands of Pico and Faial. They were stunned to come within inches of the massive whale, which is part of the Baleen species. 'We tried to stay as calm as we could and not make any sudden or surprising movements,' said Mr Mink. 'The biggest surprise was that the whale showed an interest in us and chose to come very close. Trip: Mr Mink and fellow crew members Kai Matthes, Rui Prieto and Emanuel tracked the whale for six hours by boat - a trip that spanned 35 nautical miles. Above, the massive creature surfaces near the diving boat . 'At some points, we were face to face and eye to eye, with just a few centimetres in between.' The crew then tracked the whale for six hours by boat - a trip that spanned 35 nautical miles from the south coast of Pico to the west coast of Faial. 'We had to jump each time from the diving boat and into the water near the whale. We went down approximately 12 metres each time,' said Mr Mink. 'We never expected anything like this to happen. Underwater pictures of Sei whales are extremely difficult to get because they are so shy and so fast. 'These pictures are very unique - it really was a once in a lifetime experience.' Amazing: In a separate encounter, diver Daniela Dirscherl is nearly engulfed by a giant whale shark in Indonesia . Feeding time: Wildlife photographer Richard Dirscherl and his wife swam among the 26ft creatures as they were fed thousands of tiny fish by local fisherman off the West Papua coast in Cenderawasih Bay . Mr Mink and his crew are not the only divers to have come within touching distance of a large sea predator recently. Wildlife photographer Reinhard Dirscherl and his wife Daniela were nearly swallowed up by feeding whale sharks as they dived off the West Papua coast in Cenderawasih Bay, Indonesia. The pair had jumped into the water as the 26ft sharks - who can dive up to 1.2 miles deep - were fed thousands of tiny fish by local fisherman. They then swam with the predators as they drifted through the water at about five miles an hour - gobbling up the colourful fish in one go. Open wide: The sharks drifted through the water at about five miles an hour - gobbling up the fish in one go . Mr Dirscherl, from Munich, Germany, said it was an opportunity he 'couldn't afford to miss'. 'With its mouth wide open, the shark plowed the sea and sucked hundreds of colorful fish down its throat,' he said. 'It came so close to me that I had to nudge it gently so it did not push me into one the nets. 'Then two more whale sharks joined in and I had to catch my breath as the greater of the two approached. Opportunity: Mr Dirscherl, from Munich, Germany, said it was 'amazing' to be so close to the feeding sharks . 'It was amazing to watch and to be that close to them.' Indonesian fishermen, who work through the day and night, use high-pressure sodium vapor lamps to illuminate the surface of the water - luring in plankton and other small fish. Once thousands of fish have gathered in the water, the lights are then switched off and the harvest begins. Whale sharks usually wait until the nets are full of fish to pounce because, according to Mr Dirscherl, they prefer prey that they can catch with minimal effort.","Diver Reinhard Mink comes within inches of massive Sei whale in Portugal .

"A former U.S. Navy submarine warfare specialist has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for trying to sell state secrets to FBI agents posing as Russian spies. Virginia Beach resident Robert Patrick Hoffman II, 40, faced the possibility of life in prison for trying to pass classified information to people he believed worked for the Russian government. Hoffman was sentenced in federal court in Norfolk Monday by U.S. District Judge Robert Doumar. Traitor: Robert Hoffman II, 40, pictured here at the time of his arrest in December 2012, was sentenced to 30 years for attempted espionage after trying to sell state secrets of FBI agents posing as Russian spies . Prosecutors said Hoffman gave sensitive documents about tracking ships to people he believed were Russian operatives, but in reality were FBI agents working undercover. ‘He was willing to place American lives at risk for personal gain,’ said Dana J. Boente, acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. ‘Today’s sentence should serve as a clear warning to others who would willingly compromise our nation’s most sensitive classified information.’ On his part, the 40-year-old man was unrepentant, claiming that he was the victim of a massive government conspiracy. He vowed to appeal his conviction. ‘I will not beg for mercy from this court and certainly not the FBI,’ said Hoffman, according to The Virginian Pilot. ‘I will not apologize for being good at my job.’ Hoffman was a cryptologic technician in the Navy who held top secret clearance and retired in November 2011. He spent much of his 20-year career as a submarine warfare specialist. One-time hero: Hoffman, pictured here in 2009, was a cryptologic technician in the Navy specializing in submarines who held top secret clearance and retired in November 2011 . Originally from Buffalo, New York, the decorated veteran retired with the rank of petty officer first class. Hoffman was convicted of attempted espionage this summer at the conclusion of a five-day trial. It took jurors only 90 minutes to find him guilty. Evidence presented by the prosecution showed that the Virginia resident had access to classified information pertaining to national defense. The FBI became suspicious of the veteran Navy serviceman after he made a three-week trip to Belarus shortly after he retired in November 2011 because he was passed over for a promotion, The Virginian Pilot reported. The 40-year-old ladies’ man who drove a car with the license plate ‘GR8 LEI’ decided to travel to the former Soviet republic in order to seek out a group of Belorussian women he had met in a club while stationed in Bahrain. During the trip, which Hoffman described to his friends back home as his 'man-cation,' he allegedly met with President Alexander Lukashenko. Upon his return to the U.S., a female FBI employee answered Hoffman's Craigslist ad. Using the moniker 'Tracey Tea,' the undercover agent exchanged dozens of emails with the retired officer and even went on a few dates with him. FBI later sent a second agent dubbed 'Olga' to his home dressed in a low-cut blouse and carrying a fake letter from Moscow containing a Soviet medal from a 'friend.' The missive supposedly written by a Russian spy named 'Vladimir' asked Hoffman to lend his ‘technical expertise.’ Honey trap: The FBI used two female agents dubbed 'Tracey Tea' and 'Olga' to lure him into the espionage scheme involving bogus Russian operatives . James Bond he's not: Hoffman agreed to drop off encrypted thumb drives in a hallow tree with classified information in exchange for a job that paid at least $45,000 a year and other perks . In response, the unemployed serviceman replied that he was 'willing to develop a mutual trust' and looked forward to 'renewing [a] friendship' in exchange for a job that paid no less than $45,000 a year and other financial incentives. Hoffman also emphasized that the need for 'security [was] paramount' and suggested they communicate by physical, rather than unsecure electronic means, according to the Justice Department. Following an extensive email correspondence with an FBI operative posing as 'Vladimir,' Hoffman left encrypted thumb drives containing secret and top-secret national defense information at a drop site in the hollow of a tree in First Landing State Park in Virginia Beach on three separate occasions in the fall of 2012. He was finally arrested December 6, 2012, despite his protestations that he was acting to help the FBI ensnare Russian spies. Spy hunter: Hoffman defiantly proclaimed his innocence, claiming that he was trying to help the FBI ensnare Russian spies but fell victim to a government conspiracy . During the trial, the defense noted that he reached out to the FBI after dropping off the third and final thumb drive and handed agents copies of his email exchanges with Vladimir. In one letter, Hoffman falsely claimed that he held the record for ‘most days deployed underwater.’ ‘Literally, I have spent more time underwater than ANY human being EVER,’ he wrote. In court, Hoffman described himself as a U.S. ’spy and a spy hunter’ who decided to assist the FBI out of kindness.","Prosecutors said Robert Hoffman II, 40, a cryptologic technician in Navy, dropped off thumb drivers with top secret documents about tracking ships .

"While most artists would be distraught at their work being vandalised, one sculptor believes the erosion of his underwater pieces by marine life has only made them better. More than 450 figurative sculptures have been installed in the underwater museum, the Museo Subacuatico de Arte, since British sculptor Jason deCaires Taylor co-founded it back in 2009 off the coast of Cancun, Mexico. But many of the artworks, all part of 'The Silent Evolution' project', are unrecognisable today after coral, sea urchins and other marine life have taken them over as their new home. Transformation: Jason deCaires Taylor's sculpture of Brian, the owner of a Harley Davidson showroom in Canada, has been taken over by marine life in the Museum of Subaquatic Art in Cancun, Mexico . Underwater artwork: A sculpture based on a local school teacher called Veronica, pictured left, is now encrusted with coral and covered in sea urchins. Pictured right is another piece from 'The Silent Evolution' project which has been transformed by sea-life over the years . New home: This work by deCaires Taylor is based on Paz, a local fisherman from Acapulco. It is located 10 metres below the sea surface in the Museum of Subaquatic Art in Cancun, Mexico, and is now home to a vast array of sea-life . The 39-year-old said: 'When I place them underwater it is the beginning of their lifecycle. For me they only come alive when they have their underwater patina. 'They are made from inert cement but when you see the skin of capillaries and tubular networks of the marine life and sponges colonising them, it makes them feel immortal.' The sculptures are all based on real-life people including Brian, the owner of a Harley Davidson showroom in Canada; Paz, a fisherman from Acapulco, Mexico; and Veronica, a local school teacher. Over time the works have become encrusted with hundreds of luridly-coloured sea sponges, spiny sea urchins and marine plants called hydroids, capable of delivering a nasty sting when touched. Coming to life: Jason deCaires Taylor believes the sculptures only come alive when they are covered in marine life . Life below the surface: 'The Anchors', a sculpture by Jason deCaires Taylor, sits in a bed of sea grass . The spiny sea urchins crawl across the faces of the sculptures, 10 metres below the surface, and provide a useful service to deCaires Taylor by eating the algae that can prevent coral from forming. Asked if he has any plans to prune back the growth on his works to ensure they do not become obscured, the artist is resolute. 'No, the plan is leave them as they are,' deCaires Taylor said. 'The human figure is so embedded in our psyche that even a small reference to our anatomy helps us comprehend the artwork.' Despite their foreboding appearance of the sculptures, deCaires Taylor says that to him they feel 'almost feel like family', although he admits that visitors to the museum are occasionally spooked. 'Some times people get a little scared, it depends on the conditions of the day,' deCaires Taylor said. 'If the water is clear with bright sun the figures have a slightly euphoric feel, other days when it is cloudy or the water murky the encounter can be quite startling. 'Each character has a unique story and it is very exciting for me watching nature take over.' Under the sea: Jason deCaires Taylor's underwater sculpture 'Vein Man' at the Museo Subacu·tico de Arte. Over time bright yellow fire coral will travel along the stainless steel lattice and look like blood through veins .

He . said: 'Sometimes when diving at night my dive lights attract thousands . of tiny swimming sea worms. Recently one crawled inside my ear canal and . felt like it had entered my brain. 'I was on my own at the time and found it quite disturbing, although fortunately after 20 minutes it found its way out!' DeCaires .

Stunning: The sculpture is planted with more than 200 cuttings of the rare Acropora Prolifera coral, in Cancun, Mexico .

Made . from black pH neutral marine cement, the work is augmented with . stainless steel spines, and over time it will be overrun with . fast-growing, bright yellow live fire coral which will mimic flames. DeCaires . Taylor said: 'I try to use the work to highlight the huge losses we're . having and how our blue planet is changing quite dramatically. 'Future generations aren't going to see the same number of species and fantastic pristine reefs. 'But I want to balance that sadness - in order to inspire people, you have to offer them hope as well.' Another . of deCaires Taylor's sculptures is Resurrection, a winged . angelic-looking figure, which uses live purple Gorgonian fan coral and . had to be rescued after being displaced from the reef system and damaged . during a recent storm.

Last light: The sculpture gets one last glimpse of daylight before being completely submerged by the water . Getting wet: No turning back is carefully winched into the water and placed on a rock at the bottom of the ocean . Strong . currents around the museum meant that the sculptures had to be craned . from a bridge into a nearby canal and then toed out to the site. The . Dover, Kent, born artist said: 'Some of these were much more delicate . than pieces I've made before, so it was difficult working in tough . conditions. 'I had to box . some of them up in crates and then sink them underwater in their crates. Believe me, taking a crate apart underwater is difficult.' DeCaires . Taylor now has 510 sculptural works permanently on display at the site, . although these are his final additions for the time being as he . prepares to relocate back to Europe. However, . the museum has been a huge success, receiving 250,000 visitors each . year, and deCaires Taylor is trying to secure funding to eventually . expand it to include 8,000 figures - more than the famous Terracotta . Army. He said: 'I'm leaving . Mexico, but I've got this legacy here, that my daughter can come back in . twenty years time and it will still be there.' Some of his more creative works include a life-size version of a Volkswagen Beetle and an underwater 'city' of homes.

"One of the world’s oldest complete human skeletons has been found in a cave in Mexico - and sheds new light on who the first Americans were. Named ‘Naia’, the remains belong to a 15-16 girl who went underground to seek water 13,000 years ago during the last ice age. She plunged to her death in a large pit known as ‘Hoyo Negro’, Spanish for ‘black hole’, in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. Scroll down for video . Diver Susan Bird working at the bottom of Hoyo Negro, a large dome-shaped underwater cave on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. She carefully brushes the human skull found at the site while her team members take detailed photographs of the skull of ¿Naia¿, the remains belong to a 15-16 girl who went underground to seek water 13,000 years ago during the last ice age. Deciphering the ancestry of the first people to populate the Americas has been a challenge, researchers say - and the discovery of Naia is a major step forward. On the basis of genetics, modern Native Americans are thought to descend from Siberians who moved into eastern Beringia (the landmass connecting Asia and North America) between 26,000 and 18,000 years ago. When sea levels rose after the last ice age the land bridge disappeared. These people, the earliest Americans, then spread southward. She roamed Earth up to 13,000 years ago when the now flooded cave systems in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula were much the same, apart from the water level being much lower than it is now. Her almost complete remains, including an intact skull and preserved DNA, were lying 130 feet below sea level near a variety of extinct animals, such as an elephant like creature called a gomphothere. These helped scientists establish the age of the bones as between 12,000 and 13,000 years old. Her pristine preservation enabled the researchers to extract enough DNA to establish the prehistoric girl was an ancestor of the earliest Americans, who arrived from north east Asia between 15,000 and 20,000 years ago, and modern Native Americans. The ancestry of the earliest Americans is still debated because the facial features of the oldest American skeletons don't look much like those of modern Native Americans. 'Modern Native Americans closely resemble people of China, Korea, and Japan,' James Chatters, lead author on the study, said, 'but the oldest American skeletons do not.' They have longer, narrower crania than later Native Americans, and smaller, shorter faces, too - more closely resembling modern peoples of Africa, Australia, and the Southern Pacific Rim. 'This has led to speculation that perhaps the first Americans and Native Americans came from different homelands,' Chatters continued, 'or migrated from Asia at different stages in their evolution.' Naia's skull as it was found (left) and the tooth that researchers analysed to find out about her life . The new find suggests that America was not colonized by separate migration events from different parts of Eurasia. Rather, the earliest Americans represent an early population expansion out of Beringia. On the basis of genetics, modern Native Americans are thought to descend from Siberians who moved into eastern Beringia (the landmass connecting Asia and North America) between 26,000 and 18,000 years ago. About 12,000 years ago Earth experienced a great climactic change, when the melting of the ice caps caused a dramatic rise in global sea levels, which flooded low lying coastal landscapes and cave systems. Many of the subterranean spaces that once provided people and animals with water and shelter became inundated and lost until the advent of cave diving. The Sac Actun cave system on Mexico's Eastern Yucatán Peninsula. 'Hoyo Negro is a more than 100-foot-deep, bell-shaped, water-filled void about the size of a professional basketball arena deep inside a drowned cave system,,' said James Chatters, lead author on the study. 'Only technical cave divers can reach the bottom. The Sac Actun cave system on Mexico's Eastern Yucatán Peninsula. 'First they must climb down a 30-foot ladder in a nearby sinkhole; then they swim along 200 feet of tunnel to the pit rim before making a final 100-foot drop. 'The divers are the astronauts of this project; we scientists are their mission control.' Like nearby caves, Hoyo Negro was accessible only via sinkhole; people and animals fell in and were trapped. Then, starting about 10,000 years ago, global glaciers melted, filling the caves with water. In addition to the near-complete human skeleton, the researchers found the remains of 26 large mammals, including extinct taxa such as sabertooths and gomphotheres. These people, the earliest Americans, then spread southward. Chatters and colleagues were delighted with their find: 'This project is exciting on so many fronts: the beautiful cave, the incredibly well-preserved animal skeletons, the completeness of the human skeleton, the success of our innovative dating approach,' he said. 'But for me,"" he said, 'what is most exciting is that we finally have an answer, after 20 years, to a question that has plagued me since my first look at Kennewick Man: 'Who were the first Americans?'' Complicating the puzzle, it's been very difficult to find intact Paleoamerican skeletons for study. 'Paleoamerican skeletons are rare for several reasons,' Chatters explained. 'The people themselves were few; they were highly nomadic and seem to have buried or cremated the dead where they fell, making the locations of graves unpredictable; also, geologic processes have destroyed or deeply buried their graves.' Divers Alberto Nava and Susan Bird transport the Hoyo Negro skull to an underwater turntable so that it can be photographed in order to create a 3-D model. The analysis of Naia analysis revealed a haplotype common to modern Native Americans, subhaplogroup D1. This genetic signature occurs only in the Americas, likely having developed in Beringia after populations there split from other Asians. The sample shows that individuals of the Pleistocene era with Beringian-derived mtDNA traveled far and wide through the Americas, all the way down to Mexico, for example. Critically, it shows that despite differences in craniofacial form, this early American woman was related to modern Native Americans; the differences in craniofacial form are probably best explained as evolutionary changes that happened after the divergence of Beringians from their Siberian ancestors, the authors say. Their work suggests that America was not colonized by separate migration events from different parts of Eurasia. Divers Susan Bird and Alberto Nava search the walls of Hoyo Negro, an underwater cave on Mexico¿s Yucatán Peninsula where the remains of Naia were found. The caves of the Yucatan became a sacred place for the Mayan civilisation that established itself about 10,000 years later. Rather, the earliest Americans represent an early population expansion out of Beringia. This aligns with the hypothesis that both Paleoamericans and Native Americans derive from a single source population. The caves of the Yucatan became a sacred place for the Mayan civilisation that established itself about 10,000 years later. Cave diving scientist Dr Patricia Beddows, of Northwestern University in the United States, said: 'The preservation of all the bones in this deep water filled cave is amazing. Alberto Nava at 145-ft depth in Hoyo Negro, inspecting a forelimb of an extinct Shasta ground sloth, one of two sloth species found in the cave. The Shasta ground sloth has not previously been found so far south in the Americas. 'The bones are beautifully laid out. 'The girl’s skeleton is exceptionally complete because of the environment in which she died. She ended up in the right water and in a quiet place without any soil.' Dr Beddows, whose findings were published in the journal Science, has hovered underwater above the skeleton’s site since its discovery in 2011, and prospected in the area. She said: 'Hoyo Negro is a very complex site. Assessing the skeleton's age required a novel approach given the challenging environmental conditions. The research team analyzed tooth enamel and bat-dropped seeds using radiocarbon dating and calcite deposits found on the bones using the uranium-thorium method, establishing an age of between 12,000 and 13,000 years. Analyses of DNA extracted from the skeleton's wisdom tooth found it belonged to an Asian-derived lineage that occurs only in America (haplogroup D, subhaplogroup D1). Finding a skeleton with DNA from one of America's founding lineages in Central America greatly expands the geographic distribution of confirmed Beringians among the earliest Americans. 'By understanding the formation of the shallow caves and the shaft into which the girl fell, we know the girl and the animals visited a site that looks almost like it does today, except the water level was down in the bottom of the shaft.' The skeletons in Hoyo Negro have valuable rock crystals lying on them, including a new form Dr Beddows calls ‘florets’ in recognition of their bushy nature and one inch size. Hoyo Negro is a black abyss in the state of Quintana Roo that is completely filled with water. It can only be reached by divers travelling more than 4,000 feet through underwater passages using underwater propulsion vehicles, or scooters, which enable them to cover long distances. It is about 200 feet deep and 120 feet wide and is located inside the Aktun-Hu cave system. Naia's skull as it was found: Hoyo Negro is a black abyss in the state of Quintana Roo that is completely filled with water. It can only be reached by divers travelling more than 4,000 feet through underwater passages using underwater propulsion vehicles, or scooters, which enable them to cover long distances. The skull and bones are clearly visible on the floor of the underwater cave . Once you enter the limestone pit you cannot see the floor below, and all that can be seen in front is a black void. Dr Beddows added: 'Research in flooded caves is much like space exploration, with divers similar to astronauts reporting back to ‘mission control’, a much larger scientific team at the surface. 'It all has to be done on SCUBA, which is our life support system. 'Our science team has been supported by a great number of dedicated non-science cave divers who have committed hundreds of hours at very dangerous depths to complete this exploration.” Deciphering the ancestry of the first people to populate the Americas has been a challenge, researchers say. The earliest modern human bones unearthed to date are pieces of human skull from ‘the Cave of the Monkeys’ in Laos that are up to 63,000-years-old.","Skeleton is of a very delicately built woman measuring only 4'10"" tall.

West Midlands Police has released the audio and admitted they found the plea to the emergency services 'unbelievable' because someone in danger could have been trying to get through. The caller contacted them while arguing with the owner of an ice cream van because she was unhappy with what she was served. During the minute-long call, the indignant woman told the operator: 'It doesn't seem like much of an emergency but it is a little bit because I've ordered an ice cream and he's put bits on one side and none of the other.

'I’m thrilled to have won,' said Carina, from Cambridge, who won the beach beauty round of the contest two weeks ago by modelling beachwear. She has also competed in interview rounds, sports rounds and eco rounds. The doctor-to-be says most of her peers were very supportive, but admits, 'a few were a bit perplexed'. Feeling patriotic?  Carina gets into the World Cup spirit after winning . Big heart: Carina says that people will always be attracted to beautiful things but she wants to use her beauty for a good cause, such as raising money for charity . Selfless: Carina hopes that by winning Miss England she will be able to give more back to the world . Carina still has one more year to go at Cambridge and is determined not to let her studies slip . Defending her decision to take part she told The Telegraph newspaper, 'You’re never going to get away from the . fact that people are attracted to beautiful things. I think that can be . used to the advantage of other things such as charity. Let’s use beauty . and do something with it.' 'It’s saying to women, be charitable, . think of others, be healthy and sporty, if you’re talented at something, . great, and if you want to represent your country, take on a leadership . role, do it,' she added. Carina said that despite the surprise of a few peers she has had a lot of support from fellow pupils and her boyfriend. 'Most of my fellow doctors are really supportive and my boyfriend is really excited.' Proud moment: Carina pictured in her moment of glory accompanied by her runners up .

Carina has one more year left at Cambridge University and currently juggles lectures with shifts at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in the city. She is also president of the Global Health Society at the university, which has just started a project to help the homeless in Cambridge. 'It is going to be such an honour . representing my beautiful country. Miss England is all about inner . beauty as well as outer beauty and I want to be a role model to the . youth, and with my medical background I want to bring awareness and aid . to people suffering in the world,' she says. All-rounder: Carina says that being Miss England is a case of inner beauty as well as outer beauty and she has used her modelling talents to help raise money at charity catwalks . Carina is in her fifth year of medicine at Murray Edwards College in Cambridge . Carina, who is the only member of her family to go into medicine, has always been interested in fashion too and took part in a charity catwalk show when she was at school. 'When I was younger I made a range of dresses and then modelled them at a catwalk show to raise money for charity,' she says. 'In my first three years at university I had to hold back on the modelling as I had so much studying to do, but last year I did some photo shoots and I also won the under 21 category in the Cambridge Model Search competition.'

"The New York World's Fair of 1964 introduced 51 million visitors to a range of technological innovations and predictions during its run. Fifty years later, some of those ideas have turned out to be commonplace in our world, such as video phone calls and asking computers for information. But some of them -  colonies on the moon and jet packs as a mode of everyday transportation - remain firmly on the drawing board. Scroll down for video . Habitats of the future: This installation of an imagined underwater colony was part of General Motors' Futurama 2 ride at the 1964 World's Fair in Queens, New York . WHAT THEY HAD WRONG .

At the Bell System pavilion, engineers . touted a 'picturephone' that allowed callers to see who they were . talking to, a concept that lives on in modern-day apps such as Skype and . FaceTime. At the time, . though, picture phones didn't take off, said Lori Walters, history . professor at the University of Central Florida. She attributed that to . high setup costs that made them accessible to relatively few. And at a time when many men attended the fair in coat and tie and women . in dresses, people weren't quite ready to be seen on the phone at any . hour, in their pajamas or worse. 'We were still a little more of a formal society,' Walters said. Touch-tone phones . Other new Bell technologies included the touch tone phones as opposed the traditional rotary dial. Known as the 'push button' originally . introduced at the Seattle World's Fair in 1962, this was still the . first time many visitors were exposed to this technology. Talking face-to-face: A Picturephone is demonstrated at the AT&T Pavilion at the 1964 World's Fair . Personal use of the computer . The . fair also gave wide exposure to the power of computers, which at the . time were seen as huge cabinets of blinking lights and electrodes . operated by big corporations. At . the IBM pavilion, visitors saw a computer system in which a machine . took in a card with a date written on it and gave back another card with . a news story from that date. At the NCR pavilion, a computer would answer scientific questions or give out recipes from a cookbook.

The two-seater sports car with its long hood and short rear deck was officially unveiled by Lee Iacocca, head of the Ford division, at the World's Fair, just four days before the April 17 public introduction. Ford predicted its newly-introduced  $2,368 model - touted as 'the car that dreams are made of' - would sell about 100,000 cars.

"These slimy creatures may look like aliens from another planet but they are actually the life teeming inside a single drop of pond water. The colourful organisms were captured using a photography technique called high-definition microscopy in a lab in Ohio by photographer Peter Matulavich. The pond safari pictures show everything from a single-celled paramecium organism moving through bacteria to a defecating 10mm creature called hydra and a cluster of Euglena Protozoa that are seen in such high numbers they have been known to make entire ponds and puddles appear green or red.

Microscopy is the method of using microscopes to view samples and objects that cannot be seen by the naked eye. Matulavich's first image shows a microscopic view of the small freshwater Hydra as it defecates in a single drop of water in a lab in Ohio. The creature grows around 10mm long and biologists are keen to study them because they appear not to age or die. They are found in most unpolluted freshwater ponds, lakes and . streams and possess what's called radial symmetry. This means that its body has a symmetrical shape and its body parts are evenly distributed. Matulavich managed to also capture a pair of Blepharisma. Blepharismas are what's known as protists, or single cellular organisms. They are filter feeders, which means they suck in water, eat bacteria and algae found inside this water and filter the clean water back out of their bodies.

"High life: Garnett Gilbert Smith, 44, has been sentenced to 25 years for drug trafficking . One of Baltimore's biggest ever drug dealers has been jailed for 25 years for shipping a ton of cocaine - and enjoying a life of fast cars, designer clothes and luxury properties with the earnings. Garnett Gilbert Smith's lavish life was revealed in court in Baltimore, where he was found guilty of shipping the drugs from California to Maryland between 2010 and 2011. The 44-year-old cleared $10,000 profit on each kilogram, raking in more than $10 million in total, according to court documents. Prosecutors say he also trafficked heroin. He splashed the cash on stays at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills - where rooms can reach $1,000 a night - and owned or rented numerous properties in Baltimore, Georgia, Virginia and California. He had an impressive fleet of 19 . luxury vehicles, including a $162,300 Lamborghini Murcielago, a $219,000 . 2009 Maybach, a $165,000 Aston Martin  and motorcycles worth up to . $65,000. His designer wardrobe included items from Gucci, Cartier and Louis Vuitton. Authorities also seized $258,000 worth of shoes, belts, pants, glasses, belts, hats and bags from his Atlanta storage unit, the Baltimore Sun reported. They also took £1.1 million in . jewelery from his condo in Studio City, California, and $741,000 in cash . - some hidden in speakers and tool boxes - from his Maryland home. Authorities photographed the massive piles of cash that Smith had stockpiled at the time of his arrest . Smith stockpiled cash easily as he cleared $10,000 profit on each kilogram . Bling: They also confiscated piles of garish gold and diamond jewelry and multiple watches . It doesn't seem the diamond encrusted evil eye pendant did him much good . He raked in over $10million selling drugs, and all these luxury watches became the property of the federal government . His condos in Beverly Hills and McLean, Virginia both rented for $4,800 a month . After sending Smith to prison for 25 years, the judge handed $6.7 million of Smith's . assets over to the federal government, including a condo in downtown Baltimore, $1.6 million in . jewelry and cars. Authorities . say he blew through millions of other dollars earned from drugs on . clothes, parties, vacations and his large entourage. His lengthy sentence came after the Drug Enforcement Administration had spent two years investigating Smith, who authorities called 'Mr Big'. 'Garnett Smith, simply put, is one of . the largest cocaine and heroin dealers to be prosecuted in Baltimore in . recent history,' prosecutors wrote to a judge ahead of the . sentencing, the Sun wrote. Smith had pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. After his arrest, he allegedly tried to hide his investments and worked to get some of his assets  liquidated or hidden, authorities said. Pricey: He also had a condo at this downtown Baltimore apartment block and spent thousands on designer clothes, hotels and jewellery. In his defense he simply said he was 'a work in progress' Home: This property in Georgia was just one of many that Smith bought or rented with his $10 million earning from his cocaine trafficking business. Authorities also seized a condo and 19 vehicles . 'Smith carefully laundered his drug . money, utilized friends and relatives as title-holders on cars, . established multiple aliases to conduct financial transactions, and . created businesses which functioned to disguise the source of his . wealth,' prosecutors wrote to the judge. He made the money selling cocaine he shipped from California, hiding it in compartments in vehicles that were then loaded on to car carriers. It was a slick operation - with his workers using new cell phones on every trip. But in 2011, Arkansas state troopers stopped one of the shipments and seized over $2.3 million. Afterward, Smith found a new supplier, resumed his cocaine shipments and started trafficking heroin, prosecutors said. Luxury: Nineteen expensive vehicles were seized including this Lamborghini Murcielago . He also had a Maybach, which stopped being made in 2012 but was a peer to cars like Bentleys . No doubt less conspicuous than his Maybach and Lambo, he had this Beetle . Hidden: His Toyota Cruiser doubled as a vehicle for drug running . But an SUV was stopped in Texas, where authorities found a stash of heroin in a compartment. Authorities used one of Smith's middlemen to deliver it to Smith, arresting him when he opened the compartment. 'Smith will now spend the prime of his life in prison and will not be eligible for parole until he is a senior citizen,' said Gary Tuggle, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Baltimore office. In his sentencing, Smith, who has previous arrests for drugs and paraphernalia possession, apologized and said he is not the monster he was made out to be. 'I'm a work in progress,' he told the court.","Garnett Gilbert Smith shipped a ton of cocaine from California to Maryland between 2010 and 2011 and 'trafficked heroin'

"Two former Navy SEALs found dead aboard the Maersk Alabama last week had suffered respiratory failure caused by a possible heroin overdose. Seychelles police today said security guards Mark Daniel Kennedy, 43, and Jeffrey . Keith Reynolds, 44, may have suffered heart attacks, with a syringe and traces of heroin found in their cabin. The samples are being sent to . Mauritius to establish if the drugs were responsible for the deaths. Official: Seychelles police said Jeffrey Reynolds, 43 (left) and Mark Kennedy, 44 (right) died of respiratory failure . Security guard: Mark Daniel Kennedy, 43, worked for Virginia-based maritime security firm The Trident Group . Life of service: Mark Kennedy (left, and pictured with his wife Julia right) was a former Navy SEAL . After the incident, a government official told CNN the presence of drug traces and paraphernalia 'would suggest that their deaths were a result of drug overdose.' Reynolds and Kennedy worked for Trident . Group, a Virginia-based maritime security services firm. The company's . president, Tom Rothrauff, confirmed to CNN the men were former Navy . SEALs. 'It's bizarre. Of course, it's a shock. They're all great guys,' Rothrauff said. 'I'm absolutely clueless as to what happened.' Before working as security guards, the men belonged to the SEALs, an elite unit of the military's special . operations forces who are sometimes called upon to combat piracy. The Maersk Alabama is a Norfolk, Va.-based . container ship that provides feeder service to the east coast of Africa . and employs security contractors to provide anti-piracy services. Kevin . N.

"Many fathers might find themselves with their hands full when looking after their children, but this fish has his mouth crammed full with scores of his offspring. Among yellow-headed jawfish - which are mouthbrooders - it is the male that takes responsibility for looking after the eggs until they hatch. These incredible images were captured on the sea floor in the ocean off the Cayman Islands, in the Caribbean. What a mouthful: The male yellow headed jawfish was captured with its mouth stuffed full of eggs on the seafloor at Little Cayman on the Cayman Island, in the Caribbean . Dr Peter Allinson was 18 metres beneath the surface off Little Cayman when he spotted the reclusive jawfish with its mouth stuffed with eggs. Yellow-headed jawfish, which are found on coral reefs in the Caribbean, are typically only seen with their heads and upper bodies protruding from their burrows - although occasionally they can be spied hovering a short distance from their territory. After noticing the mouthbrooding fish, Dr Allinson, who specialises in underwater and hyperbaric medicine, waited 20 minutes to get a shot of it opening wide to aerate its brood. Rotating the egg mass in this way keeps them clean and hydrated. 'The eggs being spit out is a very rare shot,' Dr Allinson said. Mouthbrooder: Among yellow headed jawfish, it is the male who looks after the eggs until they hatch . Lucky spot: Photographer Dr Peter Allinson was 18 metres below the surface when he spied the jawfish . 'I had to spend more than 20 minutes with the fish waiting to get those pictures. 'The jawfish at this dive site in Little Cayman live in what is . known as a rubble field next to a reef, and this group was about 52 feet . deep,' he said. 'I swam along the rubble field looking closely at the jawfish. 'When you see them they are at most a foot above the bottom and as you approach them they retreat into their burrows. 'The key is to locate a male with eggs in his mouth, then slowly sink to the bottom near the burrow. 'You have to wait till he starts poking his head out, slowly getting within a foot of the burrow. 'As he grows comfortable with your presence, he will rise out of his burrow to aerate the eggs. 'If you are in the right position, you can capture him with the eggs out of his mouth,' Dr Allinson added. Marine life: Found in coral reefs in the Caribbean sea, yellow-headed jawfish are rarely seen outside of their burrows . Reclusive: The jawfish (left) is typically only seen with its head and upper section protruding from its burrow, meaning this photograph of it aerating the eggs in its mouth (right) is a 'very rare shot' Among mouthbrooders, after courtship, the male fertilises the eggs and then collects them in his mouth, protecting them until they hatch at which point the fry swims off to fend for themselves. During this period the male cannot feed, meaning mouthbrooding fish are underweight by the time the eggs hatch. Once the eggs have hatched, the fish will spend a period of time feeding and recuperating. Rare: The incredible images show paternal mouthbrooding - which is relatively rare - in action . Crammed: This image captures the mouthbrooding yellow-headed jawfish in its burrow on the sea floor in the Caribbean . Taxing: The fish cannot feed while it is mouthbrooding, and will be underweight by the time the eggs eventually hatch .","Yellow-headed jawfish spied opening its mouth to aerate its brood .

"It is not the material that immediately springs to mind when building your dream home, but it certainly makes the property affordable. Farmer and architect Patrick Bradley decided to create his perfect home out of four shipping containers, but that doesn't mean he held back on the luxury elements. His mother Ann thinks that by building this house, her 34-year-old bachelor son will attract a wonderful wife. The house Patrick Bradley built: The four shipping containers have been cantilevered over a stream at a beautiful and secluded spot on the family farm . Getting the containers to the site proved to be a difficult task and at times it looked as if Mr Bradley's dreams would be shattered . 34-year-old architect Patrick Bradley  is relieved when the lorries are able to maneouver through the narrow lanes and get his shipping containers safely to the site . 'I'm desperate for him to get a gorgeous girl. I just want to see him happy,' she explains when the Channel 4 Grand Designs team turn up to cover the project. But as the lorries carrying the huge container ships turn into the country lane, Ann's expression is one of distaste rather than excitement. 'They're not very pretty, are they?' she says to the camera. 'Just as is, they're not pretty.' In the latest episode, Mr Bradley, a farmer and architect from Northern Ireland, hopes to make a home out of the shipping containers, which will be welded together to form a giant cross. The £133,000 house design is cantilevered over a stream at a beautiful and secluded spot on the family farm. The qualified architect, who has three sisters, will one day inherit the farm and needs a home that will work on a dual level, fulfilling his needs as farmer, and also an architect. Expensive bath: This bath cost the architect and farmer £16,000, which contributed to him going over budget . But in the episode, the first issue he needs to overcome is the fact the massive trucks find it difficult to turn into the roads leading to his farm. Eventually the driver manages to manoeuvre the truck, as instructions are shouted at him from the observers. But the worst is not over. The shipping containers have to be precisely placed on their concrete pad foundations and Mr Bradley can only pray that his measurements are correct as if they're even slightly out, the structure could buckle. Before and after: The containers were sourced from a supplier in Belfast Docks. Mr Bradley's dream home is featured on tonight's episode of Grand Designs on Channel 4 . 'Pull, pull, would you pull, would you,' the movers shout at each other as Mr Bradley leans low, keeping his eyes on the bottom of the containers. But the experienced architect needn't have worried as, much to his relief, the bottoms of the container fit perfectly on their stone foundations. Mr Bradley designed both the interior and exterior of the containers, which were from a shipping container supplier in Belfast Docks. Grand designs: The four containers were welded together to form a giant cross . Stunning interior: The qualified architect will one day inherit the farm and needs a house that will work on a dual level, fulfilling his needs as farmer, and also an architect . His original budget was £100,000 but the architect found that he had expensive tastes and a few costly extras, including a £16,000 bath, pushed his total cost up to £133,000. Mr Bradley lives in a very close community in Northern Ireland and the architecture in the surrounding areas is very traditional and conservative. His design, in comparison, is radically modern.

"Culprit? Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline has been named as Jack the Ripper by a Spanish investigator . Suspects have ranged from a member of Royal Family to a local butcher – but it is now claimed that Jack the Ripper was the very detective who led the hunt for the killer. Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline of Scotland Yard was the man who murdered and mutilated at least five women in Victorian East London – at least according to Spanish writer Jose Luis Abad, 84. He makes the claim in his book Jack the Ripper: The Most Intelligent Murderer in History, published in Spain this week. Mr Abad is a handwriting expert and has compared Abberline’s writing with that in the Ripper’s diary – which surfaced in Liverpool in 1992. Mr Abad, says: ‘I have no doubt Abberline was the Ripper. Handwriting does not lie.’ The diary was attributed to a Liverpool cotton dealer called James Maybrick – whom others have identified as the Ripper. But many experts say the diary is a hoax. Mr Abad believes it is real, but that the author was Abberline, not Maybrick. Other theories link the Ripper murders to Queen Victoria’s grandson, Prince Albert Victor. The detective was placed in charge of . the Ripper investigations following the murder of Mary Ann Nichols in . August 1888. He died in 1929 aged 86 at his home in Bournemouth.

It has been claimed that before every slaying the Ripper . would spend time drinking spirits in the pub before taking a stroll . throughout the Whitechapel neighbourhood with lowered inhibitions. After each killing he would return to a safe area where he could wash the blood from his hands and get rid of soiled clothing.

"A group of dolphins living off the Carolina and Georgia coast have come up with an unusual way in which to hunt. Knows as ‘dolphin stranding’, the term is normally used to describe dolphins that have beached themselves for some reason. However, new footage from ABC News and National Geographic show the mammals are using the same technique to hunt fish – essentially by forcing the fish up on shore. Scroll down for video... Don't be fooled: They may appear cute and cuddly but dolphins are intrepid hunters of the sea . Remarkable: The footage was captured by National Geographic as part of their 'Secret Life of Predators' series . Plotting: The dolphins rush to the shore to capture the fish but first they confuse them . Scott Snider, National Geographic’s director of photography, says the dolphins use their echolocation to confuse their prey and then  chase them to the shore. The dolphins’ strange feeding pattern while filming the documentary, ‘Secret Life of Predators.’ ‘They’re constantly echolocating and hunting and trying to find these schools of mullet. And when they do, they’ll start to work them up. Once they get them right where they want them on just the right stretch of beach, there’s a vocal cue and they make a sound and they all rush at the same time,’ Mr Snider told ABC News. ‘They all make this bow wave and it throws and crashes and breaks these mullet up on the beach,’ he continued. ‘Then they lay there on their sides, mouths open, waiting, trying to catch these mullet that are flopping back down.’ Confusion: Underwater the dolphins make sounds that disorientate the fish making them easy prey . Thrashing: The dolphins race towards the shore and using underwater cues ready themselves for the onslaught . Full steam ahead: The dolphins beach themselves and literally force the fish ashore too . Right before they beach themselves, the dolphins make a ‘strong’ noise, Snider said. ‘You’ll hear a lot of clicks and whistles while they’re shoring up the fish,’ he said. ‘Then all of the sudden there’s a strong vocalization — a much louder noise — right before they’re going to strand, switching a half a second to a second every single time.’ After rushing the fish, the dolphins beach themselves, and wait for the fish to make their way back to the shoreline, hoping to catch one in their mouths as they wait. Dolphins are often thought of as friendly, innocent, almost cuddly creatures of the sea, but biologists say we should see these mammals as the cunning and ruthless hunters they really are. Good idea? Scientists believe it's either an ingenious way of catching fish or a suicide mission . Beached: The dolphins can't afford to hang around long as they could get burned by he sunshine or damage their internal organs as the water is no longer supporting their 400lb weight . On target: Looks as though the tactics worked on this occasion as this fish has no chance as approaches the jaws of a dolphin . Dinner: The dolphins have proven to be adept at catching fish in this manner . ‘They need to make a living, they’re predators, and they are good at it,’ Snider said. ‘They’re just like lions or tigers or anything else for their niche.’ Scientists are divided on whether this is really an effective hunting method or more of a suicide mission. For although the dolphins seems to be experts at this method of hunting, they could also be causing themselves more harm than good. If they stay on the beach shoreline too long, they can burn or crush their internal organs. ‘A lot of bad things can happen,’ said Mr Snider.’ There is of course the ongoing threat of humans getting in the way of their hunting patterns, and other threats such as oyster shells and other trash that could slice open a dolphins’ rubbery skin.’ So although these creatures may be among the most intelligent mammals, this new found style of hunting, may not be the more practical. Worried: Scientists are concerned that the dolphins may injure themselves permanently or slice their skin open on sharp objects that are left on the beach . Wonder if it will catch on? A group of dolphins off the Carolina coast have come up with a unique way of hunting fish. It involves a great deal of thrashing before beaching themselves on shore .","Unusual hunting techniques witnessed off the Georgia and Carolina coasts .

"Sonar scans have shown that the mysterious object could be a huge Nazi anti-submarine weapon lost beneath the waves since World War II . Since its discovery at the bottom of the Baltic Sea in May 2011, the anomaly has fascinated observers. The apparently man-made object sits at the bottom of the ocean, looking for all intents and purposes like a drowned Millennium Falcon from the Star Wars movies. Theories have ranged over its purpose since the Ocean X Team discovered the object on sonar scans. To some observers, it is a UFO - The 'Roswell of the Ocean', while others speculate that it is a Nazi anti-submarine defence, or a plug to the underworld. But according to one expert, the 'strange' and 'mysterious' object, as described by the team who found it, is nothing more than glacial rocks that have been dragged across the ocean floor. Volker Brüchert, an associate professor of geology at Stockholm University, was handed stone samples of the object for analysis. He said he believed he was seeing nothing more than normal rocks, and told Live Science: 'It's good to hear critical voices about this 'Baltic Sea mystery. 'What has been generously ignored by the . Ocean-X team is that most of the samples they have brought up from the . sea bottom are granites and gneisses and sandstones.' He told Live Science that these are 'exactly what one would expect to see in a . glacial basin, which is what the Baltic Sea is - a region carved out by . glacial ice long ago'. The divers from Ocean X also gave Brüchert a single loose . piece of basaltic rock, a type of rock that forms from hardened lava, which he told the website was 'out of place on the seafloor, but not unusual'. He said: 'Because the . whole northern Baltic region is so heavily influenced by glacial thawing . processes, both the feature and the rock samples are likely to have . formed in connection with glacial and postglacial processes. 'Possibly these rocks were transported there by glaciers.' Artist Vaghauk, inspired by the story, created this artist impression, posted on Deviant Art, of the anomaly deep under the Baltic Sea . 'This device dwarfs anything ever found before and is an important weapons discovery,' said the dive team which discovered the strange structure . But now former Swedish naval officer and WWII expert Anders Autellus has revealed that the structure - measuring 200ft by 25ft - could be the base of a device designed to block British and Russian submarine movements in the area . Landing spot: The exact coordinates of the object have not been released, but it is confirmed to be somewhere at the bottom of the Botnia Gulf in the Baltic Sea between Finland and Sweden . The sonar picture of the unidentified object resembles the famed Star Wars ship the Millennium Falcon . Based on the scans, the object . appears to be raised 10ft above the seabed and measuring 200ft by 25ft - . but the scans have also been called into question. Sonar-scanning expert Dan Fornari, . from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusett, told . Yahoo: 'The sonar image has numerous artifacts in it that make it . difficult to interpret, and I would not place too much confidence in any . interpretation until a better processing is done and the details of the . type of sonar and particulars are provided. 'I'm saying the data are lacking in resolution, detail and quantification.' One plausible explanation is that the formation is an anti-submarine base. Swedish submarine officer, Anders . Autellus said the object has the shape of a . German submarine trap from the Second World War. These huge concrete structures were built to make navigation more difficult for Soviet submarines. Speaking . to the Swedish newspaper Expressen, Autellus said that similar concrete . structures had been built by the British during World War II. Autellus says it is likely that the . object is built from double-skinned concrete for the purpose of holding . large steel wire mesh structures, expected to disturb the propagation of . radar and other signals used by any nearby submarines. During the decades after the war, the . wire mesh structures would have eroded away, leaving only the holes . shown on the images provided by Ocean X. Hefty trajectory: The Swedish diving team noted a 985-foot flattened out 'runway' leading up to the object, implying that it skidded along the path before stopping but no true answers are clear . The team did get some pictures, such as these soot-covered rocks that encircled an egg-shaped hole which went into the object at its center, and have no idea what any of it means .","Object 'is raised about 10 to 13ft above seabed and curved at the sides like a mushroom'

"A multi-millionaire investment tycoon and space travel enthusiast is said to be planning a privately funded trip to Mars. Dennis Tito, who became the first paying passenger to visit the International Space Station in 2001, is understood to be plotting a 501-day mission to the red planet in 2018 - by which time he will be 77 years old. Details of the American entrepreneur's plan for a Mars flyby emerged ahead of a news conference due to take place in Washington next week. Mission to Mars: Dennis Tito, 72, who became the world's first paying space tourist in 2001, is understood to be planning a privately-backed trip to Mars in 2018 . The plans came to light in a media advisory notice published on the SpaceRef website this week. Attributed to the Texas-based Griffins Communications Group, the advisory contained details of a 'Mission for America' capitalising on an opportunity to launch a round-trip mission to Mars in January 2018. An NBC News report said the notice also included details of a news conference due to take place in Washington at the end of this month, organised by the Inspiration Mars Foundation. The foundation is described as 'a newly founded non-profit organisation led by American space traveller and entrepreneur Dennis Tito'. Mr Tito, a former rocket engineer, founded Santa Monica based Wilshire Associates, a multi-billion dollar investment firm. Flying visit: Mr Tito is understood to be planning an attempt at a two-person flyby of the red planet in five years time . He made history as the world's first . space tourist in 2001 when he paid a reported $20million for an eight . day round trip to the International Space Station on board Russia's . Soyuz TM-32 spacecraft. The trip was highly controversial at the time, but six other tycoons have gone on to take similar trips in the years since. Mr Tito's newly-fledged Inspiration Mars Foundation is 'committed to accelerating America's human exploration of space as a critical catalyst for future growth, national prosperity, new knowledge and global leadership,' according to the media advisory. Jonathan Clark, a former NASA flights surgeon who now acts as an advisor on space ventures, is also due to make an appearance at the press conference on February 27. Mr Tito is also due to give a presentation at the IEEE Aerospace Conference in Montana next month, the NBC News report said. His mission is expected to involve a flyby of Mars, without stopping, followed by a return to earth. According to an advance copy of Mr Tito's presentation seen by spaceflight consultant Jeff Foust of the NewSpace Journal, the special set of orbital circumstances required to create that kind of low-energy trajectory are expected to come about in 2018, but will not be repeated until 2031.","Dennis Tito said to be planning a privately funded mission to Mars in 2018 .

"Ed Miliband was accused of being out of touch yesterday after he was stumped by basic questions about his household budget. The Labour leader suffered further humiliation in a subsequent radio interview because he did not know the name of the Labour party leader at a battleground council. His blunders were seized on by the Tories, who accused him of being a ‘champagne socialist’. Scroll down for video. Ed Miliband suffered a disastrous interview on 'Good Morning Britain' this morning, which he followed up with a car crash performance on local radio . The Labour leader appeared tired during his 7.24am appearance as the . grueling campaign for this week's European elections appeared to have . taken its toll . The interviews made for a day of woe . for Mr Miliband as voters prepare to go to the polls tomorrow for . European and local council elections. He has been under pressure after two polls last week put the Tories ahead for the first time in two years. His misery began with an apparently simple question about how much his family spends on groceries a week. Looking . tired and drawn, he flailed, before telling the Good Morning Britain . presenters the budget for him, his wife  and their two children was . between £70 and £80. Susanna . Reid then pointed out to him a family of four typically spent more than . £100 and suggested he would be spending ‘significantly’ more than . that. The ITV1 . presenter added: ‘People would say one of the problems with politicians . is that they are actually talking  about something but are out of touch . with the reality.’ Next Mr Miliband said he was  ‘relatively comfortably off’ – a claim that sparked derision. ‘Sure, . lots of people are facing real struggles and I’m relatively comfortably . off but what l know is that  there are deep issues that need to be . tackled and we’re determined to tackle them,’ he said. Mr . Miliband earns some £140,000 a year as leader of the opposition and . lives in a £2.5million house in one of the most affluent parts of north . London and the mortgage is a relatively modest £400,000. His wife is believed to earn as much as £200,000 a year as an  environmental lawyer. Labour has attempted to show that despite the economic recovery, ordinary people are not feeling better off. Following . that interview, Mr Miliband attempted to correct his blunder, saying . his overall shopping bill would  be ‘slightly higher’ than he . suggested. The correction backfired because he implied that the  £70 or . £80 was for ‘basic fruit and vegetables’. Speaking . on BBC Radio Oxford, he said: ‘Well, I said this morning  it was on the . basic groceries, the basic fruit and vegetables, about £70 or £80 – the . total shopping  bill was slightly higher than that, obviously.’ Mr . Miliband’s day then got worse during an interview on BBC Radio . Wiltshire in which he was shown to lack knowledge of local politicians. Ben Prater, the interviewer, asked him what he made of ‘Jim Grant’ without saying who he was. Mr . Miliband asked him to repeat the question but then admitted he had no . idea who he was talking about, and asked the presenter to ‘enlighten’ him. In a toe-curling exchange, Mr Prater told him Mr Grant was the Labour leader on Swindon council.  Mr . Miliband then blundered again by referring to Mr Grant as the leader of . Swindon council, when in fact the council is controlled by . Conservatives. Flailing, Mr Miliband said: ‘I think he is doing a good job for Labour on the council.’ Tory . MP Julian Smith said: ‘Ed Miliband has sealed his credentials as an out . of touch champagne socialist who has no idea how hard-working people . live. 'The Labour . leader is the man without a plan, stumbling from opportunist gimmick to . gimmick, with policies unravelling by  the day. Even his own MPs don’t . trust him.’ The groceries blunder is the latest embarrassment for Labour in its cost of living campaign. The party faced ridicule for an attack ad which claimed a VAT rise to 20 per cent had added £450 to the average bill. But it showed pictures of fruit and vegetables, which are not covered by VAT. Last . night Labour said Mr Miliband was visiting ten different places today . on the final day of campaigning for the European and local elections. Aides said the visits would largely be ‘private’.","Miliband was asked who Jim Grant was - the Labour Party leader in Swindon .

"A race against time is taking place to extract oil from a massive container ship stranded in New Zealand due to concerns of a major ecological disaster. The 775-foot Liberia-flagged 'Rena' struck the Astrolabe Reef about 12 nautical miles from Tauranga Harbour early on Wednesday, and has been foundering there since. The ship has been leaking fuel, leading to fears of a major environmental disaster if it breaks up further. Potential disaster: An aerial view of the stranded cargo vessel Rena shows the boat listing to one side and patches of oil leaking from its storage tanks . Clean-up: A shag covered in oil is helped by wildlife veterinarian Dr Brett Gartrell and Aimee Forster at the wildlife rehabilitation facility in Tauranga, New Zealand . Maritime New Zealand (MNZ) said in a statement today that a barge, the Awanuia, has pulled up alongside the Rena and should soon begin pumping fuel from the stricken ship. Despite initial thoughts that any leaks of oil had stopped, a new patch of fresh oil has been sighted on the surface of the sea. Officials now estimate that 10 tons of oil have leaked from the vessel. The operation to extract the oil from the ship is expected to last at least two days, although it could be delayed by bad weather. Concern: The size of the oil spill from the Rena can clearly been seen in this image . So far, eight birds suffering the effects of the oil spill have been found and helped. The ship has been listing violently to one side since it became trapped. Its cargo of 2,000 containers can be seen balancing precariously on deck. None of the 25 crew members have been injured. MNZ spokesman Renny van der Velde, speaking shortly after the Rena became stranded, said: 'There is significant flooding in two cargo holds, there is a significant amount of water, some pumping has occurred and is ongoing.' Refloating the vessel is the responsibility of the owners and salvage experts, but any plan would need official approval. Mr van der Velde said: 'The . vessel is hard and dry on the reef so it may take some time, certainly . from current indications this will be an ongoing and quite a long . process.' He said it was not yet known how the ship came to hit the reef. Help: Vessel The Northern Star prepares to take out oil spill response equipment to the Rena. The Rena, operated by the Mediterranean . Shipping Co, was headed for Tauranga to load further cargo. Tauranga, 120 miles south east of New Zealand's biggest city, Auckland, is one of the the country's largest ports. The district is a popular holiday resort, with long beaches renowned for surfing.","Officials believe ten tons of oil have leaked from stricken vessel .

"Tony Blair is preparing a new push to re-enter British politics as he hires a new spin doctor to put a gloss on some of the criticism that has followed him since leaving Number 10. The former prime minister ‘has things to say’ and believes the time is right for him to make an impact on the home front after years in political exile. Mr Blair's is expected to launch his comeback as he appears on a joint platform with Labour leader Ed Miliband in July at an event to celebrate the Olympics. His wife Cherie is also due to attend, making it a rare public outing for the Blairs together. 'I have things to say': Tony Blair wants to re-engage with British politics after amassing an estimated £20million fortune since leaving office five years ago . Could the return of Tony Blair be good for British politics? Could the return of Tony Blair be good for British politics? Now share your opinion . The ex-PM is understood to believe that . enough time has passed for people to have forgotten the disastrous . effect of the Iraq war on his image and how he was humiliatingly forced . from office by Gordon Brown. The move to hire a public relations expert is proof that Mr Blair wants to be heard on a range of subjects. The spin doctor will also attempt to portray Mr Blair's cash schemes - such as charging up to £300,000 for after-dinner speeches - in a more positive light. In the latest accusation of greed, it was revealed in January that Mr Blair . made millions of pounds last year but paid just a fraction of it in tax . thanks to a complicated web of companies he has established. Prime Minister David Cameron, left, is understood to be in the sights of Mr Blair, who has been having regular chats with Labour Leader Ed Miliband, right, a great admirer of the politician turned businessman . The former prime minister’s secretive . business empire declared an income of £12million. But he was able to . reduce his tax bill to just £315,000 after writing off almost £11million . as ‘administrative expenses’ – a ‘surprisingly’ high figure, according . to one accountant. Being driven out of office by a plotting former ally may not have seemed like the most edifying climax to his premiership. But for Tony Blair his fortunes have gone from strength to strength since since leaving Downing Street in June 2007. It's perhaps no surprise then that he quit his job as an MP for Sedgefield - a post he had for two-and-a-half decades - with its £65,000 salary. Instead, he seems to have left his socialist ideals in County Durham and quickly embarked on the lucrative after-dinner circuit where he can pocket up to £250,000 a night for a 90-minute delivery. The ex-PM signed a £5million deal with Random House in the same year as leaving office to write his Number 10 memoirs. The royalties from those are said to have earned him millions more. He was later appointed Middle East peace envoy. But if he that wasn't keeping him busy enough, Mr Blair set up the the Tony Blair Faith Foundation in May 2008 to spread his message around the world. This spawned the Tony Blair Sports Foundation and the charities are now moving into bigger buildings. He is also a senior advisor at investment bank JP Morgan (salary estimates range between £500,000 and £2.5m) and advises the Swiss insurance firm Zurich Financial Services on climate change issues for a reputed £1m a year, not to mention his consulting role with luxury goods firm LVMH. And he was said to have been paid an estimated £1m for writing a report for the government of Kuwait on the future of the oil-rich state. Indeed, such is the demand for Mr Blair's advisory services that he set up a commercial consultancy firm, Tony Blair Associates, which by then end of 2010 had banked at least £2m advising foreign countries and businesses. Finally, Blair, who is married to Cherie Booth QC, the barrister daughter of actor Tony Booth, also boasts an enviable property portfolio. At one point he had seven homes around the country worth at least £15m. On top of this, Blair receives £84,000 of taxpayers' money to run a private office, and he is also entitled to draw a pension of £63,468. The figures show that Mr Blair employed 26 staff, paying them total wages of almost £2.3million, while another £850,000 went on office rent and equipment. Yet that leaves almost £8million of unexplained ‘expenses’ in the accounts, lodged at Companies House. Mr Blair has now recruited Rachel Grant, an ex-Downing Street and Whitehall press . officer who is now communications director at charity the National . Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (Nesta). The former PM is still employed as a Middle East peace envoy, as well as running a faith foundation and earning millions of pounds in consultancy fees through a complicated web of companies. But for several months he has been privately meeting small groups of Labour MPs to discuss domestic politics. Mr Blair has targeted old allies and members of the 2010 intake, advising on how to target the Tories and the Liberal Democrats, who he believes made a historic error by joining the Coalition. Mr Miliband’s aides say the pair now talk ‘regularly’ – code for chats every few weeks – about domestic politics and foreign affairs. Mr Blair’s aides think the time is right for him to speak out in the UK. They believe enough time has passed since he was driven from office in 2007 on a wave of disgust at the Iraq War. A source close to Mr Blair said: ‘He wants to re-engage in the UK. He has things to say and he thinks it’s the right time. ‘The question is how he re-enters the UK scene without re-entering domestic politics and interfering with the Labour Party. 'He wants to intervene where he can add value to political debate, but it will be above party politics.’ Mr Miliband opposed the war in Iraq but respects Mr Blair as one of the most accomplished political message-makers of his time. Rachel Grant will take up her role later this month, overseeing the former prime minister’s personal public relations and taking charge of the communications strategy for his extensive business operations. Her appointment has been seen in the PR industry as an attempt to rebuild Mr Blair’s reputation at home, following adverse publicity over his money-spinning ventures. He has attracted criticism for . combining his business interests with charitable work and his Middle . East role and is thought to have amassed a fortune in excess of . £20million in the five years since he left Downing Street and stepped . down as MP for Sedgefield, County Durham, which he had served since . 1983. Mr Blair has also amassed a property portfolio, including homes in London and  country retreats, that at one point was worth £15m. He has also been criticised for earning cast sums for his after-dinner speeches. He charges up to £250,000 a time for just 90 minutes. Miss Grant . previously worked in No 10 as a senior press officer, going on to be . head of news at the Department for Work and Pensions and then the . Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Tony Blair next to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen, left, and News Corporation Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch, right, as they accept their Leadership Awards at Atlantic Council's 2008 Gala . Former Tory Cabinet minister Lord Tebbit attacked the former PM, branding his political legacy ‘debt, war, ignorance, welfare dependency, social division’. He said: ‘Blairite education policies have brought about an upsurge in illiteracy and innumeracy, and left a generation of near-unemployable young people.’ Blair's apparent political comeback will mean less attention for his charitable ventures. Upon leaving office he set up the Tony Blair Faith Foundation then the Sports Foundation. The charities have been so successful that last month it was reported that they were moving out into bigger offices. There is . no doubt that the Tony Blair was one of the smartest political operators . in Westminster since World War Two, but he was not a flawless . character. Blair will be remembered for the Iraq War, and all the accusations of lies and evasions that that spawned. Many in . the Labour Party would simply like to forget him, even though he brought . them an unprecedented three general election wins.

In a news release, Sheriff Ted Paxton said: ‘Because of the extenuating circumstances, one of the deputies pulled the screen off of the window and entered the home.’ He said that the deputy then went through the window and into the room where he hear the child’s cries. ‘What he found was a child that was trapped in his room by a closed door, equipped with a safety device on the inside doorknob that prevented the child from opening the door.’ The sheriff’s report then describes in graphic detail the sordid conditions in which the boy was living, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Fighting spirit: Police said clothes and old food was strewn about Davis' house . ‘The child was dressed in a dirty white (T-shirt). He had removed his diaper himself and it was on the floor, filled to overflowing with feces. The child had feces on his hands, feet, and legs,’ Mr Paxton said. Mr Paxton said that the deputies’ first course of action was cleaning the waste off of the crying child and putting a clean diaper on him. But the sheriff noted that because of the general squalor of the home, it was impossible to find clean clothes for the boy. One deputy took it upon himself to retrieve clothes and food from his own home to give to the child, while others went to find clean water for him to drink. Living in filth: Deputies said there were around 50 bags of garbage on Davis' porch, and the house was in a state of disarray . It is unclear how long the boy was alone and without food or drink, Patch reported. According to the release, the room in which the boy was found had only a mattress and box springs in it. Other rooms were in equal states of disarray. 'I commend the deputies for their response and for the caring actions at the scene. This is a situation that could have ended quite differently.' -Sheriff Ted Paxton . Officers described a pungent odour of urine, rotting food, and feces coming from the house. In their search of the home – which was full of garbage and clothing strewn about the home – they found two dogs, one of which had been barking outside of the house. The other dog was found locked inside a cage. Both were given water and taken to Animal Control. On the porch, there were more than 50 bags full to bursting with garbage, and inside, there was clothing strewn about on the floor of the residence. Deputies also found used razors and towels littering the home, and broken window panes. Davis was charged with cruelty to children in the second degree, as well as reckless conduct. Sheriff Paxton said he was thankful that his deputies found the child when they did. ‘I commend the deputies for their response and for the caring actions at the scene,’ he said in the release. ‘This is a situation that could have ended quite differently.’","Crying toddler found in locked room 'covered in feces with no access to food or water'

"When his children brought two goldfish home from the fair in a water-filled plastic bag, Richard Wright thought they might survive for a few months. But for 35 years, Splish and Splash proved him wrong … until this week, when Splish sadly departed this world for that great big fishbowl in the sky. It means Splash, believed to be Britain’s oldest living goldfish, is alone for the first time since 1977. End of an era: Splish (left) died on Sunday leaving Splash (right) alone for the first time in 35 years . Happier times: Splish and Splash had been companions for more than 35 years after being brought home from a funfair . Flying solo: Splash is now living alone for the first time in more than three decades . Mr Wright, 68, said: ‘I found Splish floating dead in the bowl. Splash looks as if he is coping fine and he’s just swimming around as normal.’ ‘It was actually quite sad to see him go, because we’d known him for so long... more than half my lifetime.’ He and his wife Ann had looked after the two fish ever since their children Hayley and Matthew, then aged six and nine, won them at the fair. Mr Wright, a retired human resources consultant from Brockworth, Gloucestershire, said: ‘We certainly didn’t expect them to live this long – it’s incredible. The children eventually grew up and left home but Splish and Splash stayed put with us. The kids are in their forties now.’ Gold oldies: Splish and Splash had lost some of their gold colouring over the years but were otherwise healthy . Mr Wright said there was no particular secret to their longevity: ‘We just fed them normal goldfish food, but they have thrived on it.’ In the last three or four years they had finally begun to show their age, however, losing their gold colour and turning  silver. Splish and Splash shared the same bowl for more than two decades. Around ten years ago they moved house – into a new tank equipped with a filter, which Mr Wright nicknamed the ‘Old Fish Home’. Shocked: Richard Wright had expected the fish to live for no more than a few years after winning them at a funfair with his children in 1977 . Common goldfish normally live for between five and 15 years. Those kept in small tanks, like Splish and Splash, are not generally expected to live for more than ten. But Splash still has a long way to go to beat the world record holder – Tish, a goldfish which died at the grand old age of 43 in 2005.","Pair were won at a funfair in Brockworth, Gloucestershire, in 1977 .

"Labour MP Simon Danczuk says he was warned against naming Leon Brittan at the home affairs select committee . Senior politicians warned a Labour MP against challenging former Tory Home Secretary Leon Brittan about a dossier detailing allegations of child sex abuse. Simon Danczuk claims he came under ‘pressure’ from several people, including a current Conservative minister, not to name Lord Brittan in front of a Commons committee. Amazingly, Mr Danczuk was even warned he could be responsible for Lord Brittan’s death if he was subjected to the stress of becoming embroiled in a public row. Mr Danczuk who has carried out his own investigation into child abuse by the former Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith, said there was a culture of 'move along, nothing to see here'. At an appearance in front of the home affairs select committee last week, Mr Danczuk revealed that Lord Brittan had been sent a dossier of allegations about paedophiles between 1983 and 1985 by Geoffrey Dickens MP. The Labour MP said he believed politics was the 'last refuge of child sex abuse deniers' and repeated his call for a Hillsborough-style inquiry into historical paedophile allegations. Lord Brittan said in a statement later that he was handed a ‘substantial bundle of papers’ by Mr Dickens in November 1983 and passed them to his officials for further investigation. But Mr Danczuk claims he was warned off putting Lord Brittan’s name into the public domain in connection with the files said to contain details of a vile paedophile network in Westminster. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, he said he was approached by a current government minister and urged not to name Lord Brittan. ‘As I was I was making my way from the House of Commons on Monday night after a late vote a Tory minister stepped out of the shadows to confront me. ‘I'd never spoken to him before in my life but he blocked my way and ushered me to one side. ‘He warned me to think very carefully about what I was going to say the next day before the Home Affairs Select Committee when I'd be answering questions on child abuse.’ Mr Danczuk did not name the Tory minister, but said he was told: 'I hear you're about to challenge Lord Brittan about what he knew about child sex abuse.’ He was told it would not be a ‘wise move’ to name Lord Brittan, adding: ‘It was all put to bed a long time ago.' Mr Danczuk added: ‘We looked at each other in silence for a second. I knew straight away he wasn't telling me this out of concern for the man's welfare. There was no compassion in his voice.’ The Rochdale MP believes similar conversations were being held across Westminster, as allegations swirled over the handling of child abuse claims in Parliament and Whitehall. He claimed members of the home affairs committee were ‘paid similar visits... phone calls had been made’. Lord Brittan said in a statement later that he was handed a ‘substantial bundle of papers’ by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens in November 1983 and passed them to his officials for further investigation . MPs who had previously indicated they would ask him who he thought knew about the VIP child abuse ring at the notorious Elm Guest House in southwest London were ‘suddenly silent’, Mr Danczuk added. To his surprise, when he confirmed that he had been put under pressure ‘to keep quiet about suspected child abusers’ no further questions were asked. He said the MPs did not need to ask here the pressure was coming from ‘because they all knew’. He also claimed police officers feared political interference. 'Among the higher echelons of party politics, where the real power resides, my impression is that there is little appetite to confront the abusers in their midst,' Mr Danczuk said. 'Quite the opposite. The mood is defensive, the approach is dominated by silence. 'Move along, nothing to see here,' or 'what's the point in raking all that up old boy?' is the attitude I have seen time after time.' He said he was visited by police officers 'to discuss an investigation into a current parliamentarian accused of horrific child abuse'. He said the police asked him: 'Did I think it was likely that their inquiries would be met by political interference.' He went on: 'I looked at them in utter disbelief. How can the police put a Cabinet Minister behind bars for lying about speeding points but be worried they couldn't properly investigate someone for child abuse? 'The incident spoke volumes about the mindset that pervades politics. This kind of obstructive, 'Look the other way, sweep it under the carpet' thinking threatens to drag politics to new depths of public hate.'

"A playground has been closed after a single complaint from a resident about the noise of children playing. The Bakewell Recreation Ground in Derbyshire attracts . parents and children from as far as 20 miles away from Sheffield, South Yorkshire. But families have been stunned to discover that the popular outdoor area has been closed for three days a week after the local council received just one complaint about noise. The splash play area at Bakewell Park, Derbyshire, which has been partially closed after a single complaint from a resident about the noise of children playing . Kate Hunt, of Sheffield, often visited the park with mother Jayne, and her son George and niece Molly, both aged four, said: 'I can’t believe one person can ruin so many children’s fun. 'We’ve been visiting the park for years so were shocked to find the wet area closed - it was particularly upsetting for George and Molly. 'Upon investigating we were told the opening hours had been reduced due to one nearby resident complaining about the noise of children playing. 'It’s beyond belief someone would complain about children having fun - I’m sure the traffic noise from the main road is far more disruptive. 'The council were apologetic and . explained the area would still be open at certain times, but these . aren’t convenient for everyone.' The . wet play area was open seven days a week up before council bosses . slashed its opening times to just four afternoons a week following the . complaint. Kate Hunt, of Sheffield, often visited the park with her son George (pictured) and niece Molly, both aged four. She said: 'I can't believe one person can ruin so many children's fun' The area, which features splash pads, is now open from noon to 5pm on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays. It will also be open every afternoon but only during the school summer holidays. Ms said: 'Weekday mornings during term-time were an ideal time for parents to visit with pre-school children because bigger children are at school, so it’s less busy and there’s less chance of them getting hurt or knocked over. 'Visiting in the afternoon would mean less play time, as we would have to leave quite early to pick up my other children from school. - Mother Kate Hunt . 'Also you can’t control when the sun is going to come out, so there could be hot days where it’s going to waste. 'I just can’t believe one person’s view outweighs everyone else and they can ruin so many children’s fun.' Another mother added: 'Obviously, children aren’t supposed to have fun in this supposedly fun area. It beggars belief.' Grandma Anne Barrett, 76, regularly visits Bakewell Recreation Ground with grandson Isaac.Anne, . who lives in the nearby village of Eyam with partner Stewart Delk, 66, . said: 'I think it's ridiculous that the council has cut the opening . hours because of one noise complaint. 'The council should reconsider their decision. 'People aren't always free to come to the park at weekends and it's nice to come here when it's not so busy. 'I can't see how the restricted hours will make any difference to the resident that has complained either - it just means there will be lots of disappointed children this summer, which is sad.' Residents on the road where the complainant arose said they expected noise from the park but said they can understand why their neighbour complained. Marian Lomas, 75, who lives in a house which backs onto the park, said: 'The noise from the play area does get very loud sometimes but I would never complain about it as you would come to expect some noise where we are situated. 'The main noise is from the children playing. They scream and laugh together. 'But it doesn't bother either of us too much, and luckily we are both mobile and can get out of the house.' She added: 'I can understand why the couple that complained did. 'But I think it's a real shame that the council have restricted the opening hours. 'I used to bring my own daughters here when they were children, they're both in their fifties now - that's how long ago it was - and it's always been open in the summer months. 'The noise was worse when it was a paddling pool there - not the padded play area.' A spokesman for Derbyshire Dales District Council said: 'The council freely acknowledges it is in a no-win situation here. 'Some . time ago, a local resident complained to us about what he claimed was . an increase in noise from the play area since the replacement of an old . paddling pool in 2010 by new splash pads. 'Our . officers carried out tests which showed the noise generated from the . play area has the potential to represent a statutory nuisance. It’s not . only the noise generated by screaming children, but also the pump that . works the splash pads. 'The complainant’s view is the play equipment should be re-sited or closed. 'However, . as the cost of such a move would be significant and its closure . unacceptable, we’re trialling a restricted hours operation. 'We . are attempting to strike a balance between two sets of views. All . feedback will be reported to councillors for further consideration at a . meeting early in July.'","Bakewell Recreation Ground, Derbyshire, closed for three days a week .

"These incredible photographs show the moment a diver got to within touching distance of a 33ft (10m) shark.

There were a whole group of whale sharks eating all around us but they were so busy feeding that they didn't care very much about our presence. ‘In the water the shark looked really big and I felt like a small piece of paper floating in the sea when the shark got close. When I say close, I mean close - he was less than 30cm (1ft) from me. The shark's movements were graceful and slow, but he still managed to cover distances very fast compared to us humans.

"Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s campaign against over-fishing hit choppy waters yesterday after a marine scientist featured in his TV show branded it ‘poorly researched and misleading’. Dr Ruth Brown, a supporter of his fight for sustainable fishing, accused the multi-millionaire chef of ‘glaring inaccuracies’ in his investigation into krill fishing in the South Atlantic and of presenting her in an ‘unfair and unflattering light’. She is unhappy about apparent suggestions that the penguin population is falling because they are struggling to find food as a result of krill fishing. Dr Ruth Brown, left, pictured during her interview with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, said she was 'ashamed' of having taken part in the programme Hugh's Fish Fight . Fearnley-Whittingstall travelled 8,000 miles to speak to the 36-year-old zoologist and other conservationists working in South Georgia, the British territory close to Antarctica, for the latest episode of Hugh’s Fish Fight. Fishing for krill is burgeoning in the surrounding waters. The tiny shrimp-like crustaceans are used for feed that helps turn farmed salmon pink and to make krill oil tablets, part of the lucrative health food market for products containing omega 3 fats. It is understood Dr Brown, who has worked there as a field assistant for the British Antarctic Survey collecting data on penguins and other seabirds since 2010, was interviewed for around three hours for the programme. But she was left ‘ashamed’ of having taken part after she saw the programme, aired last Thursday on Channel 4. The Old Etonian chef claimed people on the island might be ‘wary’ of backing a new protected area around it where no fishing could take place because the fishery generates £3million a year for the government and ‘that money is what keeps the whole place running’. The chef, who this week marched to Westminster, insisted the programme was 'meticulously researched' In fact, the BAS receives no funding from fishing firms. In a letter to Fearnley-Whittingstall, Dr Brown wrote: ‘You implied that the research I do is paid for by licence money received from the krill fishing industry, and that I am therefore unable to speak freely about my opinions of that industry. This is not true.’ She also criticised him for implying that penguin numbers are falling because of competition with the krill fishery for their main food. Dr Brown said research has indicated the most likely reason for declining populations of macaroni penguins is an explosion in the population of Antarctic fur seals, which also feed on krill. Her letter ended: ‘[This] episode of Fish Fight was poorly researched and misleading...’ Fearnley-Whittingstall, 48, who this week led a march to Westminster to urge the Government to do more to protect UK seas, insisted the programme was ‘meticulously researched’ and denied it said or implied that BAS research was funded by krill fisheries. He said the show made clear that it was not yet known what effect fishing for krill would have on penguins.

"It may sound like a scene out of the 1980s hit comedy film Crocodile Dundee, but an Australian fisherman had a real-life fight with this five-foot-long reptile. Ashley Sala became so enraged when he discovered yet another crocodile on the end of his fishing line that he tackled the animal before taking it home and spending the night with it sleeping below his bunk bed. Mr Sala had been spending his 45th birthday fishing for Asian seabass, barramundi, at Ninds Creek, in the river mouth at Innisfail, approximately 55 miles south of Cairns, when he thought he'd caught a fish. Bunking down for the night: Ashley Sala with the five-foot-long crocodile that became tangled in his fishing lines at Ninds Creek, Innisfail, Australia . But when he went to reel his catch in, he discovered a five-foot-long crocodile at the end of his line. He told cairns.com: 'I threw my line out to catch a barra for my birthday and I ended up catching a croc. 'I thought I'd caught my one-metre barra. I was so happy, I was yahooing and carrying on. 'Twenty minutes later after fighting it I brought it to the surface and when the moon came out from behind the clouds I realised it was a croc tangled up in my fishing line.' Real-life Crocodile Dundee: Ashley Sala, pictured with Cassowary Coast Councillor Mark Nolan, watched the reptile overnight until animal rescue services could attend to it in the morning . Mr Sala said he didn't want the crocodile to die in the netting but was also still fed up with the reptiles stealing his bait and stalking him at local fishing haunts. So Mr Sala placed the crocodile in his car to drive to his local councillor's to complain about the overpopulation of reptiles in the area. Unfortunately Cassowary Coast councillor, Mark Nolan, who also holds the council's crocodile management portfolio, was asleep so Mr Sala was left with no choice but to bunk down with the animal for the night until it could be taken to a wildlife park. His girlfriend was far from impressed by their unexpected house guest and made the pair sleep in an empty 'donga' – cabin – at his family's caravan park. To the rescue: Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services officers arrive to remove a the crocodile from the tangled up fishing lines . Close-up: Queensland Parks and Wildife Services officers tie a rope around the crocodile's jaws to prevent it from snapping at them . Mr Sala explained: 'I sat on the top bunk and had a few birthday beers by myself and watched the croc on the floor until I fell asleep.' Councillor Mark Nolan praised Mr Sala's care of the animal and compared him to Crocodile Dundee actor Paul Hogan. He said: 'Paul Hogan's got nothing on Ashley Sala. Paul Hogan never slept with a saltie. Ashley has, and I witnessed it.' He added that the reptile was untangled by Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services officers the next day and it has now been relocated to a crocodile farm. The reptile has been relocated to a crocodile farm where it can no longer get trapped in fisherman's netting .","Ashley Sala spent his 45th birthday fishing for Asian seabass near Cairns .

"Three men have been charged with slavery offences following an investigation at a travellers’ site. Thomas Doran, Daniel Doran and David Daniel Doran are accused of false imprisonment, conspiracy to hold a person in servitude and conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. The charges come after a third alleged victim was recovered from one of the sites being searched by detectives in South Wales. Hunt: Police officers are pictured here on Monday as part of the operation . Large-scale: The investigation - called Operation Imperial - involves more than 150 officers . The CPS said Thomas Doran will also face an additional charge of kidnapping by fraud. Catrin . Evans, head of complex casework unit, CPS Wales, said: 'The Crown .

"Facing a new enemy, the White House has instituted new rules in carrying out airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syria. Last year, President Obama made a famous speech acknowledging civilian casualties in drone strikes for the first time, saying he would do his best to prevent though needless deaths in the future be instituting a new rule that would only allow attacks if there was a 'near certainty' innocents wouldn't be hurt. He called it 'the highest standard we can meet'. But apparently that standard has been abandoned in Syria and Iraq, where the U.S. and its allies are now engaged in a fight against the savage terrorist group ISIS. Scroll down for video . Innocents: The White House has reportedly relaxed rules on airstrikes in the battle against emerging terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq. This new policy was revealed a week after reports that a dozen women and children were killed by an errant Tomahawk missile in the Syrian town of Kfar Daryan. Local boys inspecting the damage in the town on September 23, above . Not the same: President Obama made a new policy on drone strikes in May 2013, saying he would only allow the attacks if there was a 'near certainty' civilians would not be injured. That policy is allegedly not in place in the latest airstrikes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Mr Obama pictured above making the monumental speech at the National Defense University . Precision? The guided-missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea launches a Tomahawk cruise missile, as seen from the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush, in the Arabian Gulf in this photo taken on September 23, 2014 . When Yahoo! News asked if the drone strike policy had changed, following rumors of a dozen civilian deaths in a Syrian town last week, National Security Council spokesman Caitlin Hayden confirmed that the same rules no longer apply. Hayden said the 'near certainty' standard was created for attacks 'outside areas of active hostilities' which 'simply does not fit what we are seeing on the ground in Iraq and Syria right now.' The revelation of this latest policy change comes after reports that a dozen civilians were killed by an errant Tomahawk missile in the Syrian village of Kfar Daryan on September 23. The town in the Iblib province is thought to be a stronghold for the al-Qaeda linked Nusra Front, and U.S. officials allegedly believed that members of the Khorasan terrorist group were there planning attacks. Rubble: Another view of the damage done to the Syrian town of Kfer Daryan, where U.S. officials believed members of the group Khorasan were plotting terrorist attacks . Mistake: Another view of Kfer Daryan the day after the attacks. A Syrian-backed rebel told the Foreign Affairs Committee late last week that a building for displaced people in the community may have accidentally been targeted . U.S.-backed Syrian rebels told the House Foreign Affairs Committee late last week that women and children were pulled from the rubble of a home for displaced civilians that may have been accidentally targeted in the strike. 'They were carrying bodies out of the rubble. … I saw seven or eight ambulances coming out of there,' said Abu Abdo Salabman, a political member of one of the Free Syria Army factions, who attended the Foreign Affairs Committee briefing. 'We believe this was a big mistake.' However, U.S. officials have not yet confirmed the civilian deaths. Hayden said they are investigating the reports. It's still unclear who ultimately signs off on the current airstrikes going on in Syria and Iraq, but sources say they've been relaxed and that more power has been given to commanders in the area to approve attacks. Following President Obama's policy-changing speech last year, sources at the time reported  that drone strikes would thereafter need presidential approval before being carried out. But apparently the new policy gives theater commanders more responsibility in selecting targets without as much presidential oversight.","President Obama announced a new policy on drone strikes last year, saying they wouldn't be carried out unless there was a 'near certainty' civilians wouldn't be hurt .

"Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell's marriage was broken and his wife had developed a crush on a businessman who lavished her with expensive gifts and attention, an attorney for the first lady said on Tuesday during the couple's corruption trial. A prosecutor said the former first couple betrayed the public's trust by promoting the businessman's company so they could line their pockets with ‘secret gifts and cash.’ The McDonnells are charged in a 14-count indictment with accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from former Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams in exchange for promoting his dietary supplements company.

Spencer, left, presides during jury selection on Monday in Richmond, Va. This May 5, 2011 photo shows McDonnell campaign donor Jonnie Williams left, and Maureen McDonnell during a reception for a  NASCAR race at the Executive Mansion in Richmond . Burck said Williams and Maureen frequently exchanged text messages and phone calls, and that Williams often visited the Executive Mansion. Burck said the pair had a relationship that ‘some people would consider inappropriate’ and that one potential witness may describe Williams as Maureen McDonnell's ‘favorite playmate.’ He did not indicate if their relationship was physical. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jessica Aber told the jury that the luxury gifts and frequent text messaging between Williams and Maureen McDonnell were ‘always just a business relationship and nothing more.’ Bob McDonnell, a once-rising star in the Republican party, received a six-figure salary and other perks as the most powerful elected official in Virginia, and had a duty ‘not to sell the power and influence of his office to the highest bidder,’ Aber said. ‘This case is about the McDonnells lining their pockets with secret gifts and cash,’ Aber said. ‘Mr. and Mrs. McDonnell knew what Mr. Williams wanted and gave it to him.’ Bob and Maureen McDonnell, pictured in 2012, married in 1976 and they have five children together, while Jonnie Williams is married to Celeste and they have four children . Bob and Maureen McDonnell are charged in a 14-count indictment with accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from the CEO of a dietary supplements company in exchange for helping promote his products . Legal experts have said one of the key questions for the jury will be whether McDonnell believed it was criminal to accept the gifts - including a Rolex watch, designer clothing, golf trips and $15,000 for a daughter's wedding expenses - while supporting Williams' efforts to grow a Virginia business. Defense attorneys have signaled in court papers that part of their strategy will be to put Williams' character on trial. They have said the case boils down to ‘a credibility contest’ between a former governor with a distinguished career in public service and a businessman whose companies have been investigated by regulators and sued by shareholders, and who is now getting a sweetheart deal for cooperating with prosecutors. Burck said Williams cannot but trusted, and had changed his version of events several times in order to receive a full immunity deal from prosecutors. Williams needs immunity because he may have illegally sold $10 million worth of Star Scientific shares to a friend in secret, according to Burck.","Bob and Maureen McDonnell are charged with .

"Imagine being able to devour a slab of chicken terrine, lashings of mayonnaise and creamy pavlova drenched in double cream without feeling guilty. Now you can, according to a controversial new diet book that's topped best-seller lists in America. Nina Teicholz, an American journalist, debunks the nutritional myth that saturated fat is bad for you in her new book, The Big Fat Surprise, which lands in the UK this week. Scroll down for video . Can eating cream be GOOD for you? A new book called The Big Fat Surprise by Nina Teicholz, an American journalist, debunks the nutritional myth that saturated fat is bad for you . Her best-selling book comes at the same time as new research, which questions the long-held belief that cardiovascular disease is related to high fat and cholesterol intake. 'For decades, we have been told that the best possible diet involves cutting back on fat, especially saturated fat, and that if we are not getting healthier or thinner it must be because we are not trying hard enough,' she says. 'But what if the low-fat diet is itself the problem? What if those exact foods we’ve been denying ourselves - the creamy cheeses, the sizzling steaks - are themselves the key to reversing the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease?' She documents how the past sixty years of low-fat nutrition advice has amounted to a vast uncontrolled experiment on the entire population, with disastrous consequences for our health. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, she said: 'There has never been solid evidence for the idea that these [saturated] fats cause disease. 'We only believe this to be the case because nutrition policy has been derailed over the past half-century by a mixture of personal ambition, bad science, politics, and bias.' Her new tome, which is packed with notes and citations based on decades of nutrition research and a nine year investigation on her part, was inspired by her own journey as a food critic. Keep the fat ON, says Teicholz: She argues that the original hypothesis  that saturated fats raise your total cholesterol and cause heart attacks is not true. 'Saturated fats do cause total cholesterol to go up but your total cholesterol is not a good predictor of your heart attack risk,' she writes . Slather on the butter: Her new tome, which is packed with notes and citations based on decades of nutrition research and a nine year investigation on her part, was inspired by her own journey as a food critic where, she claims, she lost 10lbs by eating a diet high in saturated fat . Speaking to The Sunday Times, she explains that when reviewing rich and creamy dishes for years in her role as a food reviewer, she actually lost 10lbs and her cholesterol levels improved. Best-seller: The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet is a best-seller in America and lands in the UK this week . 'Saturated fat was condemned based on very early, now antiquated notion of cholesterol,' she explains. 'The original hypothesis was that saturated fats raise your total cholesterol and cause heart attacks. This is not true. Saturated fats do cause total cholesterol to go up but your total cholesterol is not a good predictor of your heart attack risk.' Just as your body has requirements for cholesterol, it also needs saturated fats for proper function and she argues that there's two types of cholesterol and one of them actually helps the body. She claims that whole milk is better for you than skimmed milk because the fat within it helps absorb vitamins A and D. Plus, she says, it's lower in sugar and when manufacturers take the fat out of skimmed milk, they replace it with carbohydrates. Teicholz's main point is that the low-fat craze that's gripped the world for years has resulted in excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates, which have caused increased inflammation and disease. She explains how carbs turn into glucose in our body and becomes a long-term fat deposit making them, not fat, the main enemy in our diet. Obviously, not everyone agrees with her theory. 'Putting saturated fats back at the centre of our diet would be a tragic mistake,' Dr David Katz, a nutritionist and academic at Yale University told the paper. 'There is no diet that is mostly meat, butter and cheese anywhere is the world that is associated with good health outcomes. A healthy diet still features all the usual suspects: vegetables, fruits, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, wholegrains. Optional is fish, seafood, dairy and lean meats. But it reliably excludes saturated fats.'","Nina Teicholz debunks myth that saturated fat is bad for you .

"As deadly clashes between government forces and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood continued in Egypt Friday, a disturbing video has emerged that appeared to show the military firing on unarmed demonstrators. The footage clocking in at just under a minute was uploaded to YouTube August 16. The caption written in Arabic read: 'The army shoots on peaceful protesters in Ismailia.' Ismailia is a city in northeastern Egypt, where Reuters reported that four protesters were killed Friday during a 'Day of Rage.' Scroll down for videos . Appalling conditions: After they were arrested at a protest in August (pictured), the pair said they were beaten and subjected to degrading treatment in the Egyptian prison . Under fire: About 30 seconds into the video, rapid gunfire erupts, prompting some of the protesters to drop down to a crouch and others to flee . It has not been established if the four deaths confirmed in Ismailia are related to the events depicted in the video. NBC News foreign correspondent Ayman Mohyeldin tweeted that the news agency Storyful had confirmed the video's authenticity. A YouTube user by the moniker ahmedkhtr wrote in the comments section, apparently referring to one of the protesters who was allegedly shot in the video: 'He is my friend. His name is Ahmed Hachim one of the best guys ever he is a communication engineer, had a family son&daughter.’ The unsettling clip begins with a group of men numbering more than two dozen marching on four tanks positioned on a city street. Defiant: As most people ran away, one man remained standing directly in front of a tank with his arms raised . Gunned down: The demonstrator (seen in background) appears to be struck repeatedly struck by bullets, and then falls down . Aftermath: The alleged shooting victim is seen rolling over on the ground next to another man . Fact or fiction? NBC News foreign correspondent Ayman Mohyeldin tweeted that the news agency Storyful had confirmed the video's authenticity . The demonstrators appear unarmed, many of them raising or waving their hands in the air. Two of participants are carrying an unfurled banner. About 30 seconds into the video, rapid gunfire erupts, prompting some of the protesters to drop down to a crouch and others to flee. As more shots are fired, most of the people abandon the street. One person, however, remains standing directly in front of a tank with his arms raised above his hand. Just seconds later, the defiant protester wearing blue jeans, a T-shirt and a white hat appears to be struck by a bullet in his leg. He then falls down after apparently being shot again. A young man in the foreground who witnessed the shooting grimaces and gesticulates in anguish before running away, while the alleged shooting victim is seen rolling over on the ground next to another man. Pivotal moment: The alleged shooting of the unarmed man was also captured on a cell phone video taken from a different angle .

"From buying new outfits to spending hours applying their makeup, it seems that women are more interested in impressing other women  than the opposite sex on a night out. Researchers found half of the British women polled in a new survey doll themselves up when they hit the town purely to impress their friends. And one in twenty women said they care far more about the opinions of their best friends than that of their other half when it comes to make-up, hair and clothes. Scroll down for video . Dress to impress: A new survey reveals that 50 per cent of British women polled  doll themselves up when they hit the town purely to impress their friends . In fact, nearly two thirds of women said getting a compliment from another woman meant much more than receiving one from a man they didn’t know. The poll also found that eight in ten women get a genuine buzz when someone they don’t know compliments them on their image. And when asked who gave the most genuine praise, a third said it was women that approached them when they were out and about. When it comes to compliments, one in ten women said other girls comment on their make-up the most, with one in twenty claiming their shoes got the most attention. But a quarter said it was their hair that attracted the most comments from their peers. Men, meanwhile, are most likely to comment on a woman's chest area than anything else and often say ‘you look nice’ regardless of what women actually look like, according to 65 per cent of the women surveyed. Complimentary: The poll also found that eight in ten women get a genuine buzz when someone they don't know compliments them on their image but canny women won't compliment their friends because they're jealous of their appearance . When it comes to getting ready, the poll reveals the typical female will spend an hour and half preparing her hair for a night on the tiles. Preparation: The poll reveals the typical female will spend an hour and half preparing her hair for a night on the tiles - and their footwear often receives a lot of compliments on a night out . A further one hour and eight minutes will be spent showering and applying makeup and a further sixty minutes will be dedicated to choosing what to wear, totalling three hours and 38 minutes. The poll also found there is fierce competition between girlfriends over who goes to the longest lengths to look good. Nearly one in ten of the ladies polled said there is rivalry over who looks the best amongst their group of girlfriends, although a more diplomatic 26 per cent said there was ‘friendly competition.’ But a competitive 15 per cent of women said they refuse to tell their girl pals they look nice and one in five said after a night out, they critique what one another was wearing. So jealous are these women that four in ten claim they often copy what their friends are wearing. A spokesperson for feelunique, who commissioned the research, said: 'It’s great that women are out to impress other women and not necessarily the opposite sex. 'The chances are other females will be a lot more in tune with make-up and style than men will be so it’s no wonder new clothes and the latest beauty look are lost on men. 'We know from our customers that women love woman to woman advice so it’s no surprise they’re out to impress the same sex. 'It’s sometimes great to hear from another woman that they love your new hairstyle – it can often mean you’re bang on trend.'","Half of British women doll themselves up purely to impress their friends .

"President Obama groveled over the phone to a newlywed couple who had to scrap their plans for a golf course ceremony at the last minute so their Commander in Chief could tee off. The President said he felt 'terrible' that Captains Natalie Heimel and Edward Mallue Jr were forced to move their big day because of his vacation plans at the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course. Obama, speaking to the couple just after their said their vows, crackled over an iPhone loudspeaker, saying he would have skipped the 16th hole if anybody had told him there was a wedding going on - and joked he would have come away with a better score, too. Scroll down for video . Big man on the line: Captains Natalie Heimel and Edward Mallue Jr (center) gasp alongside bridesmaids and best men as the President dials in to their wedding ceremony - which his golfing plans forced to relocate . 'Feeling terrible': The President said he would have been willing to forgo one hole's worth of golf had he known . Wave goodbye to your plans! The newlyweds told Obama that the move was 'a blessing in disguise' The President said: 'I feel terrible. Nobody told us. If they had just mentioned that they were going to have a wedding on the 16th hole, we would have skipped the 16th hole.' Obama later said that this would have improved his score - an 84 - by six strokes, giving him a 79. The gracious couple described the move as a 'blessing in disguise' because of the better view from their new spot. They told the President how they met while posted in Germany in 2011 - then cheekily invited him to their wedding reception. But Obama declined, saying that his inescapable security detail would be a downer at the party. The bride and groom learned of the decision the day before their ceremony was planned to take place at the 16th tee box of the course, which has picturesque views of the Pacific Ocean. Sorry: Army Captains Natalie Heimel and Edward Mallue Jr planned to get married at the 16th tee box of the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course on Sunday, but had to move their ceremony at the last minute because President Obama wanted to play the course. Pictured above speaking to the president on the phone when he later called to apologize . Ironically, the couple knew the president would be in town and sent him an invite on a whim, and received a polite decline just hours before they learned they could no longer get married at their desired location. 'It was emotional, especially for [Heimel]—she’s the bride and in less than 24 hours they had to change everything they had planned,' the groom's sister Jamie McCarthy told Bloomberg. The wedding instead took place on the green lawn of the Marine Corps base where the golf course is located, and many attendants posted pictures of the ceremony online with the hashtag #ThanksObama. Tying the knot: The Mallues instead got married on the green lawn of the military base where the golf course is located . The newleyweds pictured above in an older picture posted to Facebook, posing on what appears to be the Hawaiian coast . President Obama and his family are currently vacationing on his home state of Hawaii for the Christmas holidays, and he has played golf six times in the past nine days. Yesterday he took to the course with friends Mike Ramos, Greg Orme and Bobby Titcomb. However, it appears the president didn't know that his golf game interrupted a military wedding, since he reached out to the newlyweds to apologize. In a picture posted to Instagram, the couple were seen at the ceremony answering a call from the commander in chief. 'He apologized and congratulated them,' McCarthy said. 'We were all there, it was perfect,' she added. 'Made their day.' According to Naile Brennan, manager of the catering company which worked on the wedding, anyone planning a wedding at the course are warned that the president can interrupt events when he is in town.

"After decades as an underwater wildlife cameraman Darren Rice changed his angle of approach to shoot humpback whales from the sky with a remote-controlled drone off the stunning island of Foa in Tonga's Ha'apai region. Rice, 47, captured remarkable scenes of the majestic creatures in their natural state from a distance as he controlled the drone, fitted with a GoPro camera, from a boat driven by his wife Nina. In a remarkable series of footage Rice filmed a mother with newborn calves and a group of males chasing a female in part of a dramatic mating ritual. Scroll down for video . Darren Rice captures incredible scenes of humpback whales in the wild off the island of Foa in the Kingdom of Tonga . A protective mother humpback whale is shadowed by her newborn calf, as seen by the drone camera operated by Rice . Rice, 47, has been a wildlife cameraman for years but usually the footage he captures comes from below the water . Rice, who grew up in London, moved from his base in Crawley in West Sussex five-years-ago to run a dive resort but he also continues to work as a cameraman or a guide for film crews. This recent footage of humpbacks was take over two days using his remote control drone, the DJI phantom, with Darren seeing what the GoPro is filming  via a special pair of goggles. 'The first day's footage is featuring a mother and baby whale and then a mother baby and escort,' he said. 'The bond between mother and calf is very special and they are never far apart. 'The escort can be male or female and not the father or relative but a passing whale that adopts a protective role and stays with a mother and baby to look out for them.' Rice captures a less serene sight in his second set of footage, a pod of fighting males in pursuit of a female humpback vying for the chance to mate. 'This is called a 'heat run' where a group of males chase down and fight for the dominant position behind a female for the opportunity to mate,' Rice said. 'These battles can rage on for hours eventually leaving the strongest male to mate.' The drone, fitted with a GoPro camera, films a humpback as it begins to breach in the serene, warm waters off Foa . Rice controls the drone from a boat driven by his wife Nina, and watches the footage of the GoPro through a special set of goggles . The stunning islands of Foa, part of Tonga, where Rice moved from Crawley in West Sussex five years ago to run a dive resort . The drone gets up close and personal with the mother humpback, giving remarkable access to the veteran wildlife cameraman . Darren and Nina also use the drone as an information gathering tool as they assist in the research into the whale population's movement through their region. 'When you are flying over water it is a great risk but the footage is worth it,' he said. 'Launching and landing from a boat can be very difficult and if the drone hits the water it is finished. More than  2,000 whales come to the warm sheltered waters of Tonga every year between July and November to mate and give birth offering Rice a front-row seat to the life of the giant sea mammals. Darren also captures a pod of male whales in pursuit of a female whale in an ocean mating ritual . Darren's best known for his work underwater for the likes of National Geographic TV and the Discovery Channel . A touching scene of the mother humpback with her calf taken by Rice in the waters off Foa . The young humpback family bond, surrounded by jellyfish, as sun beams through the warm Pacific Ocean water . Darren's business also gives visitors the chance to go diving with the whales: 'Tonga is still one of the best places to swim with these gentle giants. 'Strict rules have now been put in place by the Tongan government to look after the welfare of the Whales and to ensure that the swimming is done in such a manner as to impact the whales as little as possible. 'We also log all the data from our encounters to try and give us a better understanding of these majestic creatures - the drone has really helped us with this and given us a whole new perspective.'","Darren Rice films humpback whales in waters off Foa in the Kingdom of Tonga with a flying drone camera .

"Getting plastered every Saturday night before heading back to a respectable office job on Monday morning has become the norm for a lot of young adults in Britain. Now scientists have discovered a possible reason for such childish behaviour - people don't become true adults until they're 24. Scientists believed adolescence started with the onset of puberty and finished in the late teens. But in a series on adolescent health published in The Lancet today, researchers describe how the brain is not fully developed until the age of 24. People can legally smoke and have sex at 16, drive at 17, drink alcohol, vote and are deemed adults at 18 in Britain. Too young to cope? Scientists have discovered people don't become true adults until they're 24 . But the research suggests the adolescent brain is ill-equipped to deal with the effects of drinking and drug-taking and less able to assess risk. As a result more adolescents die from injury caused by accidents where, often unnecessary or excessive risks were taken, than anything else, scientists found. The study found that today’s 1.8 billion adolescents were more exposed to harmful alcohol consumption, sexually transmitted diseases, and other risks than in the past, and face other new threats, including: sexting, cyberbullying, internet addiction and the so-called ‘social norms’ of suicide, self-harm and school shootings. Overload: Research, published in The Lancet, suggests the adolescent brain is ill-equipped to deal with the effects of drinking and drug-taking and less able to assess risk . Binge Britain: When it came to adolescent health behaviour British teenagers were among the worst in the world . When it came to adolescent health behaviour, British teenagers were among the worst in the world. England ranked fourth out of 40 high-income countries for the number of 13-year-olds who had been drunk, the study found. Wales came fifth and Scotland was eighth. One in five adolescents was found to binge drink on a weekly basis in the same high-income countries. The UK also ranked high in the number of adolescents aged 13-15 who had indulged in sexual activity, coming third behind Denmark and Iceland in girls. The outlook for an 18-year-old today is wildly different to one 50 years ago. Then a large number of people were married and had started having children. Risks: As a result more adolescents die from injury caused by accidents where, often unnecessary or excessive risks were taken, than anything else, scientists found . Yet despite the sweeping changes to adolescence and the knowledge that health in adolescence weighs heavy on future health, this period has been neglected in scientific and medical research. Writing in The Lancet, Professor George Patton, from the University of Melbourne, Australia, and colleagues said: ‘For the largest generation in the world's history, the available global profile of youth health is worrying.’ In an editorial The Lancet identifies four areas to improve adolescents’ lives: the international comparisons of their behaviour, goals for their healthy development, preventive measures to reduce obesity, alcohol and drug abuse, and monitoring of their progress. It adds: ‘Young people are our future assets. They provide energy, innovation, productivity and progress. Adolescent health (should be]) an equal concern alongside existing health priorities in the world.’","Researchers describe how the brain is not fully developed until the age of 24 .

"The majestic humpback whale is one of the most enigmatic creatures of the deep sea. When it surfaces, this acrobatic mammal can throw itself out of the water completely. But under the waves, the creature lives a life of mystery. Now a group of underwater divers from Mexico has captured the incredible humpback whale enjoying one of life's everyday pleasures: a long, peaceful nap. Scroll down for video . Whale of a time: In this video, the humpback whale sleeps upside-down. Other species of whale sleep while drifting horizontally – a behaviour known as 'logging' - while others rest on the bottom . 'We encountered a sleeping humpback whale and managed to get an in-water encounter with her,' Kieren Bown from the group, known as Panga MX wrote on YouTube. 'This is a short clip of a 20 minute encounter showing her come up to breathe and check us out.' For a long time, people believed that whales never really slept with some pointing to the fact that some have one eye open when resting. Sweet dreams: For a long time, people believed that whales never really slept with some pointing to the fact that some had one eye open when resting. But researchers have now found out that whales only allow one side of their brain to sleep at a time, so that they remember to breathe . But researchers have now found out that whales only allow one side of their brain to sleep at a time, so that they remember to breathe. This is because, unlike humans, humpback whales breathe voluntarily with the time frame between breaths anything from 50 minutes to two hours. Males measure 40-48 feet (12.2-14.6 m), while females measure 45-50 feet (13.7-15.2 m). They can weight between 25 to 40 tons (22,680-36,287 kg). Their flippers are very long, between a qyarter and a third of their body length. Their tail, which can be 18ft (5.5 m) wide, is serrated and pointed at the tips. They live mostly in polar to tropical waters, including in the Arctic and Pacific Oceans. Humpbacks migrate at 3-9 mph (4.8-14 kph) and can travel over 3,100 miles (5000 km) during each seasonal migration . On average, these incredible creatures have a life expectancy of 45-50 years . In this video, the humpback whale sleeps upside-down. Other species of whale sleep while drifting horizontally – a behaviour known as 'logging' - while others rest on the bottom. Sperm whales, however, sleep vertically near the surface of the water. This was discovered several years ago when a team of researchers off the coast of northern Chile stumbled upon a pod of vertically bobbing sperm whales. Strangely, none of the whales responded to the team's presence until one of them was gently nudged, making it swim away with the rest of the group. Researchers also believe that whales can dream. In one study, scientists with the Russian Academy of Sciences of Moscow found that the grey whale could sleep in various states of consciousness. Sometimes, when resting on the bottom, the whales would exhibit sudden twitches or contractions, combined with eyelid movement, suggesting that they may have been dreaming.

"Trinny Woodall's former husband Johnny Elichaoff was talked down from the same ledge from which he fell to his death on Wednesday weeks ago, it has been claimed. The 55-year-old was pronounced dead near Whiteley's shopping centre in Bayswater, west London, on Wednesday morning, where is thought to have fallen from the roof of a building. Mr Elichaoff, a drummer and antiques dealer, had reportedly shut down some of his businesses in the weeks before his death. Johnny Elichaoff, the former husband of Trinny Woodall, was pronounced dead after falling from the roof of a building in Bayswater, west London . Two weeks ago he was 'talked down' from the roof of a multi-storey car park by police, the Telegraph reports. 'Around two weeks ago the same guy was talked down from up there,' Yousef Long told the newspaper. '​That car park has been unsafe for years though, the fence is only three feet high,' he added. The man, who became a financial adviser after a career in music, had 'shut down' some of his businesses in the weeks before his death, the Sun claims. Tributes were this afternoon left at the shopping centre where Mr Elichaoff was pronounced dead. Among floral arrangements and photographs of the musician was a small white card believed to have been left by his estranged wife, reading: 'Miss you always, T'. It was accompanied by a picture of the 55-year-old with the former couple's 11-year-old daughter, Lyla. Another photograph of Mr Elichaoff and his son from a previous marriage was also left among tributes. Scotland Yard confirmed the 55-year-old's death was not being treated as suspicious. Ms Woodall, who is dating Nigella Lawson's former husband Charles Saatchi, was said to be devastated by his death. The former couple battled drugs and alcohol addiction throughout their marriage and remained friends after their split in 2009. Mr Elichaoff regularly featured on the Channel 4 programme Four Rooms. In the series, members of the public pitch weird and wonderful objects to professional dealers. Mr Elichaoff was one of the dealers on the programme. Westminster Coroner's Court in London confirmed they  may open an inquest next week. Trinny Woodall is thought to have left a tribute to her former husband at the department store from which he fell to his death on Wednesday, writing: 'Miss you always, T' Flowers, photographs and a candle were scattered on the corner of the Whiteleys department store in Bayswater, west London . A tribute left by friends today. Mr Elichaoff was pronounced dead at the scene on Wednesday morning . Sudden death: Trinny Woodall's ex-husband Johnny Elichaoff has died aged just 55 after he fell from the roof of a London shopping centre . A Met Police spokesman said: 'Officers and London Ambulance Service attended the scene. The man, believed aged 55, died from his injuries at the scene. 'Next of kin have been informed. At this stage the death is not being treated as suspicious'. Alex Fakhre, 25, who witnessed the fall, told the Evening Standard: 'I was coming back from my girlfriend’s and the road was all blocked off. The police said a guy had fallen from the car park (roof). He looked in a pretty bad way.' A source told The Sun Miss Woodall, 50, was 'grief-stricken' by the loss of her former partner. Her ex-husband's family are also too upset to speak. The pair married in Knightsbridge in 1999 at St Columba's church where Miss Woodall was christened, her parents had married and her grandfather was buried. Couple: Miss Woodall and Mr Elichaoff were married for 10 years and have an 11-year-old daughter together . Trinny's wedding dress was made by designer Elspeth Gibson, but she created the designs for her bridesmaids' dresses, while their shoes were made by Christian Louboutin and differed according to the shape of the bridesmaids' ankles. Back in 1982, it was Johnny who first found fame, as a madcap rock drummer who toured the world supporting U2 and Siouxsie Sioux. Nicknamed Johnny Too Bad, he played in a Seventies band called Stark Naked And The Car Thieves before defecting to the equally bizarrely named Baby And The Black Spots and then playing in guitarist Robert Fripp's League Of Gentlemen. His musical career was interrupted by a two-year spell in the Army in 1984, and he went on to help manage rock bands Tears For Fears and Fairground Attraction. But the musician changed his career to become a financial adviser. However, he developed an addiction to prescription painkillers in 2006 when he had 20 operations after breaking his leg in a motorbike accident. He was then treated in a Californian rehab clinic in October that year. Investigation: Police said they were called to Whiteleys Shopping Centre, in Bayswater, London, but said the death was not suspicious . New love: Miss Woodall, famous for presenting What Not To Wear, is now dating Nigella Lawson's ex Charles Saatchi . Following their split in 2009, the couple remained on good terms. They would regular dine out together with their daughter Lyla. Friends said the marriage had broken down partly because of Miss Woodall's busy work schedule but his dependence on painkillers proved a strain. Mr Elichaoff suffered from an addiction to prescription painkillers. Miss Woodall also had her own battle with substance and alcohol abuse. The couple have both spoken openly about their issues. A friend said Trinny felt 'let down' that he did not make the same inroads she did. He said of his wife before their divorce: 'Trinny comes across as cold and aloof, but in fact she is the kindest woman I have ever met. She has a heart of gold. The steeliness people see in her is really a cover for her chronic shyness, believe me.' Last year, during talk hosted by The Spectator magazine, Miss Woodall talked publicly about her battle with cocaine and alcohol. She said: 'I'm Trinny, I'm an alcoholic and I'm an addict. When asked whether addiction is a disease, I didn't have to think twice. Knowing that I have a disease is how I manage to have a healthy life today.' Fame: Mr Elichaoff (right) made regular appearances on Channel 4 programme Four Rooms . Heritage:  Johnny Elichaoff with Trinny Woodall, Perla Ferrar, and guitarist Slash in 2007. Mr Elichaoff was a drummer with various bands and also managed Tears for Fears . Trinny's work parter Susannah - married to Danish entrepreneur Sten Bertelsen and the mother of their three children – fell into motherhood effortlessly. But Trinny was diagnosed with blocked fallopian tubes and endured nine rounds of IVF and two miscarriages before she conceived. Tribute: Trinny's ex-husband said of her: 'She is the kindest woman I have ever met. She has a heart of gold' This was said to have put pressure on her marriage to Elichaoff. She said at the time: 'It is stressful having IVF. I'm a hormonal cow for a month, but luckily my husband is very patient.' When she finally became pregnant she spoke glowingly of Johnny. 'I still feel a sexy woman, which is important,' she said. 'Some husbands are very funny about their wives when they're pregnant and go off them sexually, but my husband never puts me down. I'll say, 'I hate my thick legs,' and he'll say, 'Trinny, you can cover them – and your t*** look fab.' He always makes me feel great.' Of all the storms they weathered, it was said Trinny’s struggle to become pregnant was the toughest. Miss Woodall began a relationship with Charles Saatchi, 71, in the summer of 2012, eight weeks after he split from his former wife, Nigella. The couple's 10-year marriage ended after Mr Saatchi was photographed clutching the celebrity chef's neck outside Mayfair restaurant, Scott's – one of the art dealer's favourite haunts. This summer, less than 12 months after the incident, Miss Woodall was pictured with Mr Saatchi sobbing at a table outside the same restaurant. Confirming Mr Elichaoff's death last night, a Channel 4 spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with his friends and family'.","Trinny Woodall's ex-husband Johnny Elichaoff has died aged just 55 .

"With blue waves tumbling over them, these surfers glide underneath a tunnel of water. The surfers are pictured in a barrel, where the wave is hollow when it is breaking, and wiping out from the unique perspective of under the water. These stunning photographs are from two different sets, one taken across the beaches of Western Australia, by Michael Riley, 28, and the other taken off the coast of Tahiti, by Ben Thouards, 27. Both of the photo-sets manage to capture the very different and distinct experiences happening to surfers every time they take to the waves, from the elation of riding the waves, and the spectacular feeling of wiping out. Surfer Jack Robinson inside a wave in Western Australia, captured by photographer Michael Riley, who is originally from San Diego . Naum Ildefonse under the waves in Teahupoo, Tahiti. The images in Tahiti were taken by underwater photographer Ben Thouard, who used a diving kit and an underwater camera to take pictures of people surfing from below the surface of the waves . The underwater photography was not just of wipeouts, also documenting skilled surfing from a unique perspective . Riley, originally from San Diego, California, spent yeas working as a fisherman before moving to Australia. He said: 'My childhood bedroom was wall to wall surfing barrel shots and even the . ceiling was covered with all the different covers from magazines. 'It wasn't until I moved to Australia and started to earn some decent . money fishing that I could afford the equipment I would need to help me . pursue my dream of shooting in the water. 'When I look at my photos I want to see the most perfect moment of the . wave; no water drops on the port of the camera, perfect back lit waves, . and a surfer nice and deep in the barrel.

Surfers glide underneath a tunnel of water, in a barrel, where the wave is hollow when it is breaking . Some of the waves reach massive heights, while others are a lot smaller but with a higher speed, making surfing them masterful and challenging . Riley, who took the Australian set, would sit for hours in the water narrowly avoiding the surfers to capture the high-resolution images in stunning detail . Standing for hours in the water observing and shooting the waves, Micheal has to decide where the prime position for getting the shots was. He said: 'I get a lot of positive feedback from people about my photos and that really helps me keep really interested in what I do. I love capturing all the moments that would otherwise go unnoticed, and when people see them they seem to be happy and excited. 'It's a really good feeling to see everyone freak out when you take a really special shot. However I do think that it will take a lifetime to get the perfect shot. 'I don't know if I will ever consider anything that I created to be perfect, but I will do my best to get as close as I can until then.

Trying his hardest to sidestep any sharks that might be lurking in the waters, Michael explains the risk of shooting in this type of location. He said: 'There have been a number a recent shark attacks in Western Australia and the water is become a very terrifying place to be. 'When you are out in a remote location and the waves are a bit slow you start to think sometimes and it really can mess with you head. 'You know they are out there, you just pray that you aren't going to run in to one. The water can be very shallow where the waves are breaking but sometimes you have to swim over deep waters to get to certain spots.

"Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is planning to take part in London Fashion Week as a model . Julian Assange is still cocking a snook at the establishment. The Australian founder of WikiLeaks, who has cost the British taxpayer £6million in police bills since seeking asylum in the Ecuadorean Embassy two years ago, continues to receive celebrity visitors such as Lady Gaga and hold press conferences via video link. But in his most brazen move yet, I hear he is planning to take part in London Fashion Week as a model. Assange, wanted for extradition to Sweden on sex assault charges, will not even have to risk arrest by leaving his bolt-hole, as the catwalk is coming to him. Assange, 42, will be joined at the embassy — opposite Harrods — by six models to show off outfits designed by Dame Vivienne Westwood’s son, Ben. The clothes have been inspired by actor Clint Eastwood’s costume in his spaghetti western films, and the show will be accompanied by music from The Good, The Bad And The Ugly. Hollywood actor George Clooney and his lawyer fiancee, Amal Alamuddin — who has acted as part of Assange’s defence team — have been invited to attend. Ben Westwood, 51, says: ‘I want to highlight Julian Assange’s plight. What happened to him is totally unfair.’ He adds that inspiration for some of the clothes on show has come from Assange himself and his combat/beret look. ‘I’ve designed something for him along those lines and will be getting him to wear it,’ says Ben. ‘I’ve got another garment with a Julian Assange print.’ Assange, 42, will be joined at the embassy - opposite Harrods - by six models to show off outfits designed by Dame Vivienne Westwood's son, Ben . Ben Westwood, 51, (left) says he wants to highlight Assange's plight, and that some of the inspiration for the clothes has come from Assange (right) himself . The show, in September, will be a fringe event for London Fashion Week. ‘Julian’s been in the embassy for two years and it’s important that he doesn’t slip into obscurity,’ adds Ben. Assange is not known for having any fashion sense. Author Andrew o’Hagan, who was hired to ghost-write his memoirs before falling out with him, noted how Assange wore suit trousers over a pair of Tesco tracksuit bottoms. Which might explain his appeal to Ben’s mother Vivienne, who was an early supporter of Assange and designed an ‘I am Julian Assange’  T-shirt with which she closed her London Fashion Show two years ago.

"Google has bought a satellite firm as the first step in its project to improve its maps and bring the internet to developing countries. The $500 million acquisition of California firm Skybox will initially be used to boost the quality of Google's maps images as it battles Apple. Skybox has already hit the headlines for capturing the first HD video footage of Earth from its tiny satellite - which many dubbed at the time as being 'like live Google maps.' Scroll down for video . Google is buying Skybox Imaging in a deal that could serve as a launching pad for the company to send its own fleet of satellites in to space. These satellites would take aerial pictures and provide online access to remote areas of the world. This photo of Kiev, Ukraine was taken by Skybox on 18 February 2014 . SkySat-1, which was launched in November, captured up to 90-second video clips at 30 frames per second. Satellites today are capable of taking imagery better than a metre in resolution, but they weigh thousands of kilograms. SkySat-1 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites. The circuitry that drives it is about the size of a phone book and consumes less power than a 100w light bulb. The U.S. group, Skybox Imaging, is now planning a constellation of 24 satellites that will be able to cover almost the entire expanse of the Earth. SkySat-2, an identical version of SkySat-1, is scheduled to launch in 2014. Google is also believed to be mulling plans to launch its own fleet of satellites to bring the internet to developing countries - a project Facebook is also pursuing. Google plans to use Skybox's satellite already in orbit to supplement the material that it licenses from more than 1,000 sources, including other satellite companies such as DigitalGlobe and Astrium. Eventually, though, Skybox could turn into another Google 'moonshot' - a term that CEO Larry Page has embraced for describing ambitious projects that could take several years to materialize. Google hopes to build more satellites that could be used to beam Internet access to points around the world. 'Skybox’s satellites will help keep Google Maps accurate with up-to-date imagery,' the firm said. 'Over time, we also hope that Skybox’s team and technology will be able to help improve Internet access and disaster relief — areas Google has long been interested in.' That would expand an effort that Google began a year ago when it unveiled ""Project Loon"" — a venture featuring jellyfish-shaped balloons equipped with antennas to bring the Internet to parts of the world without the proper wiring to get online. As the owner of the world's most popular search engine and email service, Google typically benefits when more people are on the Internet to see the ads that generate most of the company's annual revenue of $55 billion. Page and other Google executives say they are primarily interested in getting more people on to the Internet to create a more egalitarian and knowledgeable society. The expansion into satellites comes two months after Google bought drone maker Titan Aerospace for an undisclosed amount. Satellites today are capable of taking imagery clearer than a metre in resolution, but they weigh thousands of kilograms. SkySat-1 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites. Shown here is a view of Abu Dhabi . Google made about 250 acquisitions during the past decade, using many of them to expand into new markets, including maps and mobile devices. To the frustration of some investors, Google also has been spending billions of dollars exploring new frontiers of technology, including driverless cars, Internet-connected headwear, robots and a startup called Calico striving to find ways to slow the aging process. Other investors have applauded Google for having the vision and audacity to make big bets on bold ideas that analysts say could hatch lucrative products in the rapidly changing technology industry. Google's most-widely traded class of stock dipped $2.81 to $567.92 in Tuesday's afternoon trading. Skybox is a 5-year-old startup in Mountain View, California, located a mile-and-half from Google's headquarters in the same Silicon Valley city. A mine in Turkey captured using the Skybox satellite. Led by aerospace industry veteran Tom Ingersoll, Skybox has been working on additional satellites that should be easier to complete with Google's backing . Skybox develops small, relatively cheap satellites. Traditional satellites capable of taking imagery at better than 1 meter resolution weigh thousands of kilograms, which makes it prohibitively expensive to launch enough of them to capture timely imagery. The firm says it has produced similar performance in a box 20x smaller. 'The circuitry that drives our satellites - providing power, attitude control, communications, thermal management, and imaging support - are about the size of a phone book and consume less power than a 100w light bulb,' it says. 'We've integrated the latest, greatest, and fastest commercially available FPGAs, processors, and memory to ensure our small satellites pack the largest possible punch.' The newly released images also show Port Fuad in Egypt, with boats clearly visible in the harbour. the Color Infrared Imagery was collected by SkySat-1 on February 14, 2014 . Led by aerospace industry veteran Tom Ingersoll, Skybox has been working on additional satellites that should be easier to complete with Google's backing. 'The time is right to join a company who can challenge us to think even bigger and bolder, and who can support us in accelerating our ambitious vision,' Skybox said in a blog post. Skybox had previously raised about $91 million in venture capital. The company says it employs about 100 people. Google is hoping to gain regulatory approval to take control of Skybox Imaging within the next few months.","California firm Skybox will be used to boost the quality of Google's maps .

"A hundred years ago, Giovanni Bergoglio fought in some of the fiercest battles of the First World War. Luckily he survived, but his grandson Jorge Mario Bergoglio, now Pope Francis, remembers how the old man would only speak of the 'painful memories' of the Great War. And today the pontiff made a holy pilgrimage to Italy's largest war memorial to pay homage to the sacrifices made by Giovanni and millions of others. Standing amid row upon row of tombstones dedicated to Italian soldiers who fell during the First World War, Francis warned of a 'third world war' amid new threats from the Middle East and Eastern Europe. He said: 'Humanity needs to weep and this is the time to weep. Even today, after the second failure of another world war, perhaps one can speak of a third war, one fought piecemeal, with crimes, massacres, destruction. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis visited two First World War graveyard in modern-day Slovenia today which is located along the Isonzo River where his grandfather fought . The Italians launched a series of offensives against Austro-Hungarian forces along the river, losing almost half of all soldiers killed during the conflict there . Francis laid a wreath among the 100,000 graves  close to the Isonzo River. Around 60,000 of the tombs are unmarked as their occupants have never been identified . The Isonzo campaign claimed the lives of almost half the Italian soldiers to die during the First World War, and was the worst defeat in the country's military history . 'War is irrational; its only plan is to bring destruction: it seeks to grow by destroying. Greed, intolerance, the lust for power. These motives underlie the decision to go to war and they are too often justified by an ideology.' He recalled the trauma suffered by his own grandfather, who fought during Italy's bloody campaign along the Isonzo River, close to the graveyard, before emigrating to Argentina after the war. Between 1915 and 1917 the Italian army launched a series of bloody attacks against the Austro-Hungarian forces stationed along the Isonzo River, losing almost half of all soldiers killed in the conflict there. The pontiff prayed among gravestones  in an Austro-Hungarian cemetery, before visiting Italy's largest war memorial where he held an open-air mass beside a Fascist-era monument to 100,000 fallen soldiers. Francis' grandfather, Giovanni Bergoglio, was one of thousands of Italians who fought in the trenches near the Isonzo River, which was part of Austria at the time, but now part of Slovenia close to the border with Italy. Italian general, Luigi Cadorna, believed an attack across the fortified mountainous terrain could  pierce the Austro-Hungarian defenses, shattering their defensive line and allowing large territorial gains. However, the entrenched opposition made the Italians pay dearly for even modest moves forward, and following reinforcements by the Germans in October 1917, they overran the Italian lines, inflicting the largest defeat in the country's military history. The 12 battles of the campaign are memorialized at the Redipuglia monument which was dedicated by Italy's Fascist government in 1938 on the eve of World War II. 'I have heard many painful stories from the lips of my grandfather,' the pope has said. Pope Francis prays at military cemetery for World War I soldiers at Redipuglia, near Gorizia, a town his grandfather fought against Austro-Hungarian troops to capture . Francis held an open-air Mass today near to the Redipuglia monument today, close to where his grandfather fought during the war before emigrating to Argentina . Francis recalled the 'painful memories' his grandfather shared with him about the First World War today, before reiterating his calls for peace between nations . Francis visited an Austro-Hungarian cemetery where he prayed briefly (pictured) before going to Italy's largest war memorial 100 yards away . Paying tribute to the war dead on the 100th anniversary of the start of the conflict, Francis recalled 'many painful stories' his grandfather told him of the fighting . Hundreds of thousands of Italian troops died trying to cross the Isonzo River between 1915 and 1917. The only meaningful success came with the capture of Gorizia (pictured left) in August 1916, but the town was quickly overrun by German and Austro-Hungarian forces the following year . The elder Bergoglio, who was drafted at age 30 as Italy entered the war, took part in the Isonzo campaign, obtaining a certificate of good conduct and 200 lire at the war's end, according to documents from the time. With postwar Italy's economy stalled, he emigrated to Argentina where Pope Francis - then known as Jorge Mario Bergoglio - was born. The enduring impact of war, is evident in the visitors who still make pilgrimages to the monument, although in ever decreasing numbers, said Fogliano di Redipuglia Mayor Antonio Calligaris. 'The Repiduglia sanctuary until 20 years ago was always full of visitors, but it has been forgotten by institutional memory,' Calligaris said. 'The papal visit is very important because it renews attention on this history.' The monument consists of 22 granite steps leading upwards to three large crosses. It marks the burial spot of 100,000 Italian soldiers, around 60,00 of which have never been identified. Pope Francis standing near the Austro-Hungarian cemetery in Fogliano before be went on to hold an open-air mass at the nearby Redipuglia memorial to Italian soldiers . Italy's entrance into the war was long-anticipated, and Austria-Hungary heavily reinforced the Isonzo beforehand with trench systems and artillery emplacements . Mounted units from the Austro-Hungarian army wade into the Isonzo Rover in 1915. Despite years of attacks, Italian forced were never able to capture it . Francis' grandfather, Giovanni Bergoglio, was drafted into the Italian army aged 30 as the country entered the war, before emigrating to Argentina after it finished . The Austro-Hungarian cemetery, one of several in the area, contains 14,406 dead from five nations that fought under the Austro-Hungarian empire, with only 2,406 identified. Many visitors to the Italian monument search the engraved names for their forbears. 'They are making a lot of saints these days. Even popes,' said Margherita Braga, 52, of Brescia, who was visiting the site with her Italian military veteran husband. 'But for me, these are the real saints.' Just two levels up from the altar where Francis will say Mass, the name of a fallen soldier named Adolfo Bergoglio is engraved in a wall. Nardin, the local priest, said he is not believed to be related to the pope. But World War I historian, Col. Lorenzo Cadeddu, who has found two Bergoglios listed among the Italian casualties of World War I, said it remained a possibility. 'Bergoglio is not a common name,' Cadeddu said. 'It is likely that they are related.' Antonio Calligaris, the mayor of Fogliano di Redipuglia, said the Pope's visit was important to spark interest in the grave sites, which have been largely forgotten . The Redipuglia monument is a Facsit-era monument dedicated just before the outbreak of the Second World War and contains 60,000 unmarked graves . Among the 40,000 named soldiers buried there are two with the surname Bergoglio, though it is not known if they are related to the Pope . Austro-Hungraian troops fire at advancing Italian soldiers along the Isonzo River . When Italy joined the First World War in 1915, one of its first moves was to launch an attack against Austro-Hungarian forces massing along a mountain range at the head of the Adriatic Sea, in what is modern-day Solvenia. Italian General Luigi Cadorna believed the best chance of breaking through the defensive line was to cross the north end of the Isonzo River, bypassing the mountains and coming at the Austro-Hungarian forces from the rear. However, Italy's entrance to the war was well anticipated, and Austria-Hungary had sent large numbers of men and artillery to the region ahead of time which were dug in along mountainous ridges overlooking key attacking positions. Modern historians largely accept that there were 12 battles of the Isonzo, though the fighting was so fierce and prolonged that one battle often merged into the next, and the total has long been disputed. Between June 1915 and March 1916, the Italian forces tried to cross the river on five separate occasions, but on every one they were repelled, suffering heavy losses for only modest gains in territory. During the sixth battle, from August 6–17, 1916, General Cadorna finally captured the town of Gorizia and with it a bridgehead across the Isonzo, which marked the first victories of the campaign. A series of small, intense attacks followed as the Italians attempted to limit their casualties, before two large assaults. The second, between August 19 and September 12, 1917, involved 51 divisions and 5,200 guns, and succeeded in forcing the defending troops back. Fearing that the line was in danger of being overrun, the Germans reinforced their allies and in October 24 their combined forces took to the offensive, forcing the Italians to retreat. Many war-weary soldiers simply threw down their weapons and were captured, though many units continued to fight as they retreated toward the Piave River where they finally held the line. In total, between 300,000 and 600,000 troops died during the fighting, almost half of all the Italian soldiers to be killed during the war, making it the worst defeat in the country's military history. Hemingway's book, A Farewell To Arms, captures the conflict through the eyes of protagonist Frederic Henry, though the author himself was never involved in the fighting. Instead, Hemingway served as an ambulance driver at Piave between June and July of 1918, after Italian forces had retreated away from Isonzo. He spent three weeks with American Red Cross Ambulance Section Four before asking to be transferred to canteen duty along the more active from along the Piave river. It was herem, at Fossalta di Piave on July 8, 1918 that he was hit by Austrian trench mortar. He was evacuated to a hospital in order to recover and never rejoined the war on active duty.","Pope Francis visited the Redipuglia monument, the resting place of 100,000 Italian soldiers killed during the war .

"A mysterious crater that suddenly appeared underwater in southern Utah has baffled scientists. Theories ranged from it being Martian art to a volcanic eruption– but now geologists believe there could be a simpler explanation. They claim it was caused a geologic condition called 'collapsible soils' where refilling of a lake caused soil to collapse, creating a small eruption. Gary Dalton and his two brothers recently discovered a round hole or crater in the bottom of their irrigation pond on their farmland in Circleville, in Piute County, Utah. The outer ring is a depression filled with algae. An inner circle looks as though something erupted from beneath, forming what looks like a small volcanic crater . This type of soil that can rapidly settle or collapse the ground is known as collapsible soil. 'Hydrocompactive soil' is the most common type of collapsible soil. The term hydro – implies the introduction or presence of water, which is the case with the mystery crater. The pond has been drained and refilled more than a dozen times in the last two years. The theory is that the repeated loading of weight on the soil eventually led some of the soil under the pond to collapse, creating a small eruption. 'As it collapsed and compacted,' said geologist Bill Lund, 'it forced some air and some water up and created this thing. It looks like a one-off thing. It just happened one time. That's it.' The crater was discovered last month by Gary Dalton of Circleville after he saw an unusual hole in a lake. 'The sun was just right,' Mr Dalton said. 'So, I saw this blasted thing that no one had ever seen.' He noticed it after most of the water was drained from the pond for irrigation. Just beneath the surface he saw concentric circles in the pond bottom with a diameter of about 25ft (7.6 metres). The outer ring is a circular depression filled with algae. An inner circle looks as though something erupted from beneath, forming what looks startlingly like a small volcanic crater. 'My heck, I guess that's Martian art,' Mr Dalton said. 'I don't know.' Experts from the Utah Geological Survey took a look and were initially baffled. 'Well, yeah, we've got several theories,' said veteran geologist Bill Lund as he examined the pond. 'Most of them have gone up in smoke.' Most of the theories were disposed of almost immediately. Some had speculated that the feature was caused by a natural spring, pushing up from under the pond after being supercharged by recent rains. But Mr Lund said that theory was quickly disproved by aerial photos that were taken before the pond was excavated two-and-a-half years ago. 'This was an alfalfa field and there was no spring here,' Mr Lund said. 'It's not a spring.' The central depression is about 17.8cm (7in). The Dalton family were able to push the handle of a pitchfork another 33cm (13in) or so straight down in the soft centre . Some had speculated that the feature was caused by a natural spring, pushing up from under the pond after being supercharged by recent rains. Another theory was that a buried pipeline had been punctured during construction of the pond. But experts said there is no pipeline. Scientists then proposed that there was a burp of methane gas from decaying organic material under the pond. Earthquakes sometimes will cause similar features in sand or mud, due to liquefaction of soils. But there have no earthquakes in the Circleville area powerful enough. The leading theory is a geologic condition called collapsible soils. It suggests that the repeated loading of weight on the soil eventually led some of the soil under the pond to collapse, creating a small eruption. Another theory was that a buried pipeline had been punctured during construction of the pond. But experts said there is no pipeline. Another possibility is that there was a burp of methane gas from decaying organic material under the pond. Mr Lund strongly doubts that theory because the local geology isn't the type that sometimes causes such events. 'If we were in coal country,' he said, 'I'd be thinking about that a little harder but - you know - we're not.' Earthquakes sometimes will cause similar features in sand or mud, due to liquefaction of soils. But scientists have ruled that out because there have been no earthquakes in the Circleville area powerful enough to trigger liquefaction. When Mr Dalton's son Michael was asked what his own pet theory is, he said the obvious: 'I have no idea.' Another son joked that it was either a volcanic eruption or a Martian landing. During the geologists' visit, Mr Dalton and his sons maneuvered a platform-lift over the crater to get a closer look. Although the Daltons saw a fiery meteor in the sky a few weeks ago, Mr Lund has essentially ruled that out as the cause; the sighting took place long before the crater appeared. And no one in nearby Circleville reported hearing any loud booms. 'We don't think it's an impact crater,' Mr Lund said. 'We don't think anything hit there.' Hovering over the crater in the lift, the curious farmers and geologists lowered a tape measure into the crater. The central depression is about 17.8cm (7in). They were able to push the handle of a pitchfork another 33cm (13in) or so straight down in the soft centre. The leading theory is a geologic condition called collapsible soils. It suggests that the repeated loading of weight on the soil eventually led some of the soil under the pond to collapse, creating a small eruption . The crater was discovered last month by Gary Dalton on his farm in the town of Circleville, Utah. The town has a total area of 9.1 square miles (23.5 km²), all of it land . 'Obviously something came up and created this ring,' Mr Lund said. 'But then it collapsed back on itself and closed off the vent. Whatever the vent was is closed.' From those observations, a leading theory emerged: a geologic condition called collapsible soils. The pond has been drained and refilled more than a dozen times in the last two years. The theory is that the repeated loading of weight on the soil eventually led some of the soil under the pond to collapse, creating a small eruption. 'As it collapsed and compacted,' Mr Lund said, 'it forced some air and some water up and created this thing. It looks like a one-off thing. It just happened one time. That's it.' That remains the most likely explanation, even though Mr Lund said he has never seen such a phenomenon take place under water. 'I mean, there are still some unanswered questions here,' he said. 'That's for sure.' Earlier this year, a series of mysterious craters appearing in Sibera were found to have been created by methane gas, released by the thawing of frozen ground.

"A transgender teenager has killed himself after explaining in a heartwrenching message: 'I'm a prisoner of my own body.' The death of Riley Matthew Moscatel, 17, has devastated friends and relatives, who said they had accepted his decision to drop his birth name, 'Jessica', in favor of 'Riley' in the spring. On Monday afternoon, surveillance cameras recorded the high school senior stepping out in front of an Amtrak train near to his home in Croydon, Pennsylvania, ending his life. 'My mirror reflects Jessica, my heart and mind say Riley,' he posted in an Instagram picture just before. 'You see me as the happiest person in school, I'm a prisoner of my own body. Proud: Riley Matthew Moscatel, 17, was open about his transgender identity and shared this image to Instagram showing how far he had come since freshman year, when he was still known as 'Jessica' 'You see me having a successful future, I can't see me at my graduation day. I say my hearts beating, but it's beating slower and slower each day... I've had enough.' The lengthy message, which also apologized to his parents for not being the daughter they had wanted, was written on the backdrop of a train track and posted to his account. Shocked friends said that he had apparently got through childhood depression but still struggled with his female body, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. 'Everyone supported him,' said Kate Cimino, who had been in a relationship with Riley. But he 'still really wasn't a guy physically', she explained. 'Even though everyone showed support and called him Riley, it didn't match up to what he felt of himself.' Struggle: Before he killed himself on Monday, Riley posted this message to Instagram detailing his pain . Friends said that he had been researching hormone treatments that he hoped to start when he turned 18. His parents had also bought him a breast binder. In June he wrote beneath a photograph of himself on Facebook: 'I just wanna wake up to my actual body, not to what leftovers I've been given.' Speaking to The Trentonian, Riley's family said they were 100 per cent supportive of their son - but admitted that they were so used to calling him their daughter that they sometimes slipped up. 'We knew that it was important to her,' his dad Rich Moscatel said of Riley's male identity. 'If it was important to her, it was important to us whether we understood it or not.' His mother Kristine Moscatel said he had started calling himself Riley a year ago. 'We went from her thinking she was a lesbian, to bisexual, to finally transgender,' she said. 'She didn’t know what she wanted to try and fit into.' Support: Riley had been dating Kate Cimino, who said people's support could not change his opinion of himself . Missed: Surveillance footage captured Riley walking in front of a train on Monday afternoon, police said . When he spoke about his identity to his parents, Kristine Moscatel said she drove him to a local high school to take part in its Gay-Straight Alliance. The teenager also had the support of his teachers at Bucks County Technical High School, where other transgender and gay students attend. Kevin Gentilcore, supervisor of Pupil Personnel Services, said the boy's teachers were devastated. Rates of suicide and suicide attempts are much higher among transgender people - as much as 41 per cent, according to one survey, which is nearly nine times the national average. Arnold Grossman, a New York University professor, told the Inquirer the suicide attempts often came from feelings of not belonging, burdening family members, and seeing no way out of the situation.

"A bill that would make the death sentence mandatory for gays who are 'repeat offenders' was reintroduced in Uganda's parliament today. The controversial move likely to draw fresh condemnation from Western aid donors. A private member's bill was originally proposed in 2009 by David Bahati, a legislator with the ruling National Resistance Movement party. President of Uganda Yoweri Museveni is under pressure from world leaders to drop Uganda's anti-gay laws . It provoked a widespread international outcry. U.S. President Barack Obama denounced it as 'odious', Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to reject it and some international donors threatened to cut aid if it became law. The bill was shelved last May. The cabinet took it over and, after international condemnation, said in August it had decided to drop the bill because existing laws were sufficient to deal with homosexual crimes. A small but vocal anti-gay movement, led by several MPs and a group of bishops, said it was determined to reintroduce the proposed legislation. 'The anti-homosexuality bill was re-tabled on the floor of the House today and has been referred to parliament's legal and parliamentary affairs committee for scrutiny,' parliamentary spokeswoman Helen Kawesa said. 'The committee is expected to examine it and conduct public hearings and then it will report back to the House for a formal debate on the bill,' she said. U.S. President Barack Obama denounced a previous bill as 'odious' and called on President Yoweri Museveni to reject it . Homosexuality is taboo in many African nations. It is illegal in 37 countries on the continent, including Uganda, and activists say few Africans are openly gay, fearing imprisonment, violence and loss of jobs. The bill has given Uganda a reputation as the 'world's homophobia capital'. Ghana and Tanzania have said they will resist pressure to legalise homosexuality after Britain threatened to cut aid to countries that deny gay rights. 'We've always said it's not over until it's over. It's disappointing that this bill has been revived,' Ugandan gay rights activist Julian Pepe said. 'We're expecting a backlash from the public but we're not giving up our fight. We'll engage our partners and talk to MPs and hope sense prevails at the end of the day,' he said.","Move will spark widespread international condemnation .

"A father of three who was cycling for charity was killed by a drunk teenage girl just moments before he crossed the finish line of a race. Bethany Mackie, 18, yesterday admitted killing Christian Smith, who was raising money by cycling 248 miles between Kent and Sussex in just 24 hours. On March 22, moments before he finished the race, the 38-year-old was struck by a car near Whitstable, Kent. Police said Mackie drove for another 400m before stopping. Bethany Mackie, left, admitted causing the death by dangerous driving of cyclist Christian Smith, right, while she was over the legal blood alcohol limit on March 22 near Chestfield in Kent . Mackie, who was driving a blue Peugeot 206, was arrested at the scene and admitted causing death by dangerous driving and being at the wheel with excess alcohol in her system when she appeared at Canterbury Crown Court yesterday. Since Mr Smith’s death, more than £82,000 has been donated to mental health charity Mind on his JustGiving page – breaking his original target of £1,000 by more than 8,000 per cent. On his page, Mr Smith, from Boughton Aluph in Kent, spoke of his own mental health problems. He wrote: ‘I have had my own misfortune to suffer from a spate of poor mental health, which was unexpected and has been a real “game changer” in how I now view the future. ‘It has been a tough road to get to this point but I have been fortunate enough to have the support of my family and friends.' Mackie, left, struck Mr Smith from behind in her Peugeot 206 and carried on for a further 400 yards . Recent donors described Mr Smith as ‘kind’, ‘generous’ and ‘amazing’. One person wrote: ‘A great loss to his friends and family, but an inspiration to many’. Inspector Martin Stevens from Kent Police said: ‘Christian Smith was a keen cyclist and was raising money for a cause close to his heart. His death, caused by this tragic and avoidable incident, is another reminder to everyone of the dangers of drink-driving. ‘Mackie will have to live with the consequences of her actions for the rest of her life. Her breath contained 73 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, more than twice the limit. 'Our message is that any amount of alcohol affects your ability to drive, so the only safe option is not to drink alcohol if you plan to drive.’ Mackie, from Herne Bay, Kent, was handed an interim driving ban. She has been released on bail until December 19 when she will be sentenced.

"Sir Richard Branson insists he still intends to travel to space with his family on Virgin Galactic, despite a test flight crash last week that killed one pilot. Speaking from Necker Island - his private resort in the Caribbean - Branson said surviving pilot Peter Siebold, 43, escaped serious injury and should be out of hospital in the next few days. US investigators say they have not ruled out the possibility of pilot error on board SpaceShipTwo, which crashed in the Mojave Desert in California on Friday, killing co-pilot Michael Alsbury, 39. Scroll down for video . Branson told Sky News he still intends on travelling to space with his family on the Virgin Galactic despite the fatal crash during a test flight last week . Branson the Virgin group's founder, said Virgin Galactic could 'move forward' following the disaster as he vowed to travel on board the space flight with his relatives once safety tests have been completed. Branson told Sky News: 'We've spent many, many years building a spacecraft, a mothership, a space port, that I think can do the job and do the job safely. 'We will not start taking people until we've finished a whole massive series of test flights and until myself and my family have gone up, and until we feel that we can safely say to people 'we're ready to go'.' He added: 'All I can say is we will not fly members of the public unless we can fly myself and family members. Sheriffs' deputies look at wreckage from the crash of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo . 'We need to be absolutely certain our spaceship has been thoroughly tested - and that it will be - and once it's thoroughly tested and we can go to space, we will go to space. 'We must push on. There are incredible things that can happen through mankind being able to explore space properly.' Sir Richard insisted that 'we must push on' following the disaster that killed one pilot on Friday . Speaking on the Today show this morning, Branson insisted the team intends to continue working on the spaceship, despite what he called a 'horrible setback'. 'We have a wonderful spaceship,' he said. 'They're not going to down tools - they're going to move forward and create a spaceship company that will one day be the marvel of the world… It's worth the risks.' He added they owed it to Alsbury to carry on with the project. 'We owe it to him to continue and that we will do,' he said. 'It's a grand program which has had a horrible setback, but I don't think anyone watching this program would want us to abandon it at this stage.' He would not speculate on the cause of the crash and said he will follow the National Transit Safety Board's (NTSB) lead. Speaking to Sky News, Branson also criticised the 'irresponsible innuendo' in some of the reports of the crash, including claims there had been a mid-air explosion and that some engineers had left the project over safety concerns. 'It was incredibly hurtful to the 400 engineers who have worked so gallantly at Virgin Galactic,' he said. 'It was insulting. If the press had looked at the photographs they would have seen full fuel tanks and engines all intact on the ground and yet they were talking about a massive explosion. 'They were talking about people ejecting out of the plane and ejector seats. We don't have ejector seats. 'It was the British press at its worst and some of them should hang their heads in shame.' Speaking on the Today show this morning, Sir Richard insisted  the team will continue working on the spaceship, despite what he called a 'horrible setback' Last year, Branson said he hoped to to take his children Sam (left), 29, and Holly (right), 32, into space with him aboard Virgin Galactic's first passenger spaceflight on SpaceShipTwo . Branson said there was 'overwhelming global support' for the project and he had received hundreds of supportive emails, including two people who signed up for flights on the day of the disaster. 'I'm absolutely convinced Virgin Galactic has a great future,' he added. Last year, Branson spoke about his hopes to take his  children Sam, 29, and Holly, 32, into space with him aboard Virgin Galactic's first passenger spaceflight on SpaceShipTwo. 'I think any rational person would be slightly nervous, but it's going to be the most incredible experience ever,' Sam Branson told NBC in an interview. These images show the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rocket separating from the carrier aircraft, left, and then disintegrating, right, during a test flight on Friday . 'We've had people like myself who booked the whole spaceship for their families,' Richard Branson added, 'and I think you know it'll be just a magnificent experience for everybody.' NTSB, which is leading the probe into the crash, has revealed that seconds before the crash a safety device to slow the descent of the craft had been deployed prematurely. Investigators found that the spaceship's 'feathering' system - which lifts and rotates the tail to create drag - was activated before the craft reached the appropriate speed. The system of deployment is a two-step process, but Christopher Hart, acting chairman of the NTSB, said that, while the co-pilot unlocked the system, the second step occurred 'without being commanded'. Debris from Virgin Galactic SpaceShip 2 sits in a desert field  north of Mojave, following the crash that killed one of the two pilots . Michael Alsbury (left) was killed in the crash on Friday, while co-pilot Peter Siebold (right) survived . 'After it was unlocked, the feathers moved into the deployed position and two seconds later we saw disintegration,' he told a press conference. Mr Hart said investigators would look at a wide range of issues including training, the spacecraft's design and whether there was pressure to continue testing, over the coming months to determine the cause of the crash. Asked whether investigators were 'edging' towards the possibility of pilot error, Mr Hart replied: 'We're not edging towards anything. We're not ruling anything out. 'We're looking at all of these issues to determine what was the root cause of this mishap. 'We are looking at a number of possibilities including that possibility (pilot error).'

Virgin Galactic - owned by Sir Richard's Virgin Group and Aabar Investments PJS of Abu Dhabi - plans to fly passengers to altitudes more than 62 miles (100km) above Earth. The company, which sells seats on each prospective journey for 250,000 US dollars (£156,000), has denied reports it ignored safety warnings ahead of the test flight crash. In a statement, the company said: 'At Virgin Galactic, we are dedicated to opening the space frontier, while keeping safety as our 'North Star'. This has guided every decision we have made over the past decade, and any suggestion to the contrary is categorically untrue.'

Santa Monica Pier in California has two very difference sides as this images shows - from the bright sandy beach with blue waves hitting the shore in the day to a bustling, illuminated pier at night . The unusual images were taken by photographer Stephen Wilkes who spent up to 15 hours and shot up to 1500 photos to create just one composite image. The collection entitled Day to Night features 15 images including works from Times Square, The Western Wall and The Capitol. To create the images, Stephen, 55, from Connecticut, U.S.A., shoots across the entire landscape from sunrise to sunset. He then returns to his studio to blend around 50 of the best photographs to create one seamless image. Each piece takes around one month to edit.

Stephen said he first came up with the idea of shooting multiple images across a landscape when taking the cast picture for Baz Lurman's blockbuster Romeo and Juliet for Life Magazine, in 1996. But it wasn't until he was asked to shoot the High Line for New York Magazine that Stephen used this technique to show the passing of time. Stephen said while he is fascinated by architecture, people and the cities of the world, what he really loves to shoot is history. And he has even shot Day and Night images of President Obama's inauguration speech as well as New Year's Eve in Times Square. There are currently 15 images in the collection but he is currently working on images from Chicago, and hope to add works from London and Paris in the near future. Stephen wants to add as many images as possible to his collection. No matter what time of the day it is, New York is always heaving with people and always alight with adverts .

"Looters have robbed the bodies of belongings of victims of the MH17 jet, including fanatical Newcastle United fan John Alder, after the passenger jet was shot down over Ukraine on Thursday. Some 298 people were aboard the Boeing 777-200 when it was blasted out of the sky by pro-Russian rebel forces. Freelance journalist Demjen Doroschenko who was at the scene discovered Mr Alder's body outside the village of Grabovo within hours of the disaster and saw that his belongings had been disturbed. Scroll down for video . John Alder's body was found by a freelance journalist outside the village of Grabovo after pro-Russian separatist rebels looted his belongings. Heavily armed men stole cash, cameras and credit cards from victims . Heavily armed pro-Russian separatists were observed at the scene of the disaster rifling though the belongings of the people on board flight MH17 which was shot down over Ukraine on Thursday afternoon . He said: 'I saw John Alder's body and took a picture of a medicine box he had with him. You could see they had been through his things. 'He had a pair of Tesco binoculars with him in a case. They had pulled the binoculars out of the case. But when they say the glass had been broken they threw them back because they weren't any good for them.' Mr Doroschenko told The Sun: 'They were rifling belongings with torches 50 yards away. Once they'd gone I went over to the body where they had been and found wallets left open, purses empty and papers all over the ground. It's awful.' Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Kiev government, said: 'I have received information that terrorist death-hunters were collecting not only cash and jewellery of the crashed Boeing dead passengers but also the credit cards of the victims.'

"A 'vulnerable' man who went missing for 13 years has claimed he was kept as a slave by Irish travellers. Darrell Simester, now 43, disappeared after arguing with friends on a holiday in Wales in August 2000. His desperate parents Tony, 66, and Jean, 61, contacted the police around 50 times but were never able to locate their son. But after years of searching, they have finally tracked him down in a remote farm in south Wales following an anonymous tip-off. Found: Darrell Simester has been reunited with his family (right) 13 years after he went missing in Wales (left) They found Darrell living in a filthy caravan in a farmyard with no running water. He was starving, wearing dirty, torn clothes and had teeth missing. 'Darrell is settling down to a peaceful family life, something he has missed out on in the last thirteen years.' - Jean Simester, Darrell's mother . Now reunited with his family in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, Darrell has a host of medical problems caused by his poor treatment over the past 13 years. He told The Sun he had been treated like a slave by his masters, who lured him in by offering him a job. He claimed he was forced to work 12 hours a day and was never given a day off or allowed to visit a doctor, but his fear of repercussions stopped him from running away. 'I never had one day off in 13 years,' he told the newspaper. 'I was scared what they'd do to me if I didn't stay there.' He described how he had been forced to sleep in a rat-filled shed at the farm before being moved into the caravan two years ago, but still had to shower using water from a horse trough. His father described his son's treatment as 'inhumane' and 'horrendous'. He added: 'These type of people roam the streets picking up the vulnerable and offering them a new life. Then they are treated like dogs.' Darrell had managed to call his parents every six months for the first eight years to let them know he was alive, but was too terrified to tell them where he was. Once he implied he was in Ireland but they had no luck finding him there. Then when the calls stopped in 2008 they feared the worst had happened. Mrs Simester set up a Facebook group to help find her son, which had up to 9,000 members at a time helping with the search. 'These type of people roam the streets picking up the vulnerable and offering them a new life. Then they are treated like dogs.' - Darrell's father Tony on his son's masters . In February Mr and Mrs Simester put out an appeal in a Welsh local paper after receiving information through the group that one of the calls their son had made could have originated in Cardiff. The next day they received a call from an anonymous person who said they were 95 per cent sure they had seen Darrell at the farm, near Cardiff. Mr and Mrs Simester and their youngest son Duncan travelled to the site with police where they found their son. Speaking to the South Wales Echo, which had run their appeal, as she was reunited with her son, Mrs Simester said: 'Not . having heard from him for four years you’re thinking the worst. When the phone calls stopped... What can I say? This day has made my life.' Later the family posted a statement on their Facebook group saying: 'We will share our good news..WE HAVE OUR SON DARRELL BACK HOME..So . this has been' THE GREATEST DAY OF OUR LIVES'. 'Please respect our . privacy for the next few days we have to let him recover. Many thanks . for all your good wishes over the years and not giving up ..x x x . 'You . are wonderful people and I feel that I know you all. From the bottom of . my Heart a VERY BIG THANKYOU..X X X.' Filthy: The farm in south Wales where Darrell Simester claims he was treated like a slave and kept in 'horrendous' conditions . The family said Darrell had been to the hospital several times since he came home and had undergone an operation. His father said his problems were 'all down to the conditions he has been subjected to over the last 13 years', but his mother confirmed he was 'getting stronger and coping very well'. In a message on Facebook, she said: 'Darrell is settling down to a peaceful family life, something he has missed out on in the last thirteen years... his health is our priority and each ailment is being dealt with even though it seems to take ages to get anything done for him... he at last sleeps in a proper bed with bed linen and proper washing facilities, clean clothes, all of which he has not had.' She said he was slowly being reunited with members of the extended family - including nieces and nephews he had never met - as he felt ready to. Mrs Simester added: 'I have shown him the Missing Darrell Simester page and he couldn't believe that so many people have been involved. 'Thank you to everyone that has supported our family in finding Darrell, without your help, the appeal in the (South Wales) Echo and the One Person who telephoned me with where Darrell was, we still would not have him home. 'You are all forever in our hearts and thoughts God Bless you all.' Gwent Police said investigations were ongoing into 'the conditions in which Mr Simester was living and working during the time he was not in contact with his family to establish whether any offences were committed'.","Darrell Simester disappeared while on holiday in Wales in August 2000 .

"Jailed for eight years: Gary Bennison, 24, of Hornchurch, Essex, fractured the spine of the infant . A father who shook his four-month-old son to leave him brain damaged and blamed the tot’s older brother for inflicting the injuries has been jailed for eight years. Gary Bennison, 24, of Hornchurch, Essex, fractured the spine of the infant - now aged two - and broke three of his ribs after attacking him when he was just three weeks old. Three months later he left the child with multiple bleeds to the brain and cerebral swelling after shaking him in fury, a court heard. But Bennison claimed his other son was responsible for the injuries. After a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in north-east London the father-of-two was convicted of carrying out two separate attacks on his son. Judge Joanna Korner QC told him: ‘The victim of this serious assault was your own son - he was not even four months old. 'You shook him with such violence that the doctor said it must have been repeated cycles of shaking to cause multiple haemorrhages to the brain and cerebral swelling. ‘Despite overwhelming evidence that all injuries were caused by you, you continued to deny it and persistently blamed your older son - who was only two years old - for the injuries to the brain. ‘Had you persuaded the jury that he was responsible for those injuries, for the rest of his life he would have to live with the false information that he had injured his younger brother so badly that his life was irreparably changed for the worse’. Bennison had savagely attacked his son when he was just three weeks old in February last year. Then on May 19, he deliberately shook the infant while he was looking after his two sons. The baby started vomiting and had to be taken to hospital, said Mark Horsley, prosecuting. Doctors then found rib and spinal injuries consistent with heavy blows to the back, the court heard. ‘He was left with fractures to the ribs and spine which was only found by doctors after he was examined fully at the hospital’, Judge Korner added. ‘Doctors found healing fractures to three ribs and fractures to his spine - compression fractures. Both sites required considerable force to have been caused by you. Scroll down for video . Sentencing: The father-of-two was convicted of carrying out two separate attacks on his son after a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) in north-east London . ‘The rib fractures were caused by compression to the chest and to the spine, slamming the baby on his bottom or the bottom of his spine. ‘It is not possible to accurately date . when these injuries occurred, but it was three to four weeks before May . 19 - therefore when he was only three months old’. Recent tests have shown the victim . still has abnormalities to the frontal lobe of his brain and that his . development has been delayed by his injuries. Mr Horsey said further research has to be done to ascertain the long-term impact of his injuries. The court heard Bennison has since . been in a relationship with another woman with young children after the . mother of his two children left him. Sentencing . Bennison to eight years behind bars, Judge Korner said: ‘There is a . high risk of reoffending if you engage in relationships, as you have . done, with women who have young children. 'There can be no greater position of trust than a parent left in charge of their young baby - and you abused that trust' Judge Joanna Korner QC . ‘One thing that emerges from the injuries is that the level of violence you inflicted on your son was quite clearly escalating. ‘It is clear to me that you are an intelligent young man and because of that you could not have been unaware that you were hurting your son - on each occasion he would have cried. ‘There can be no greater position of trust than a parent left in charge of their young baby - and you abused that trust’. Bennison had denied charges of grievous bodily harm in respect of the first attack, and grievous bodily harm with intent for the second.","First attacked him when he was aged three weeks, then three months later .

"The Foreign Office has spent more than £450,000 on media training for ministers, ambassadors and mandarins to look good on TV, it can be revealed. Almost 700 officials working for the government around the world have been given taxpayer-funded lessons in dealing with the media since 2010. Critics condemned the ‘absurd’ waste by Foreign Secretary William Hague's department at a time of deep spending cuts across Whitehall. William Hague's Foreign Office has spent £450,000 on media training since 2010, although the Foreign Secretary himself has no trouble with appearing in front of the cameras . While the amount spent each year has fallen since 2010, the cost per person has risen to an average of £677.92 per person, up 22 per cent on 2012 . Figures released under Freedom of Information shows that in the last four years the Foreign Office has spent £451,573 on media training. The taxpayer has paid to hire firms which have previously worked for food manufacturers Kraft, mobile firm Orange and fashion house Chanel. It includes a course for ambassadors in ‘Strategic Media Skills and Techniques’ and another for press officers called ‘International Communication Skills’. The Foreign Office insists its most senior staff around the world need to know how to deal with the media. But with government departments facing at least two more years of cuts, Labour condemned the ‘vanity spending’. In 2013 alone, 146 people were trained at a cost of £98,977 - an average of £677.92 per person, up 22 per cent on 2012. It has previously emerged that Energy Secretary Ed Davey has received taxpayer-funded media training twice . In July last year, an unnamed minister at the Foreign Office received media training costing £1,150  from Robert Taylor Communications, which promises  to help ‘spokespeople to speak with confidence, authority and effect in TV and radio interviews, press conferences and more’. Labour’s shadow Cabinet Office minister Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘While families are suffering a cost-of-living crisis Ministers are spending hundreds of thousands of taxpayer pounds trying to sell their flawed policies. ‘Instead of wasting money to help them sell bad news Ministers should focus on how to earn our way to higher living standards. ‘To many this will look like vanity spending. Is there no end to this Whitehall waste?’ The prestigious Strategic Media Skills and Techniques is offered to Ambassadors and Deputy Heads of Mission – the senior representatives of HMG overseas - to ‘give them the skills they need to act as the senior spokesperson for HMG in their country’. It has been provided by Group K Broadcasting Ltd, which promises help in how to ‘handle the Media and Press confidently, effectively and convincingly’ and has worked for Chanel, Kodak, Goldman Sachs and Kraft Foods. The International Communication Skills course is ‘aimed at members working in our communications teams overseas and in the UK, and it covers the basic skills needed to work as a press or campaigns officer, in an international context, and overseas’. It is provided by Caroline Black Associates, which has also advised the Premier League, British Red Cross and Transport for London. Robert Oxley, Campaign Director of TaxPayers' Alliance said: ‘It's absurd that the Foreign Office is wasting taxpayers' money teaching staff to spin the media. Whitehall needs to cut out waste, not squander cash on making ministers and mandarins look better on TV.’ But the Foreign Office said: ‘It is important that HMG’s workforce receives the right training to carry out their duties. ‘Being skilled in a range of communications techniques, including working with the media is essential to explain and promote British prosperity, security and the interests and welfare of UK nationals across the world.’ In October 2012, MailOnline revealed how eight government departments had spent thousands of pounds on training for at least 19 ministers. Business ministers Matthew Hancock and Jo Swinson are among the latest crop of ministers to receive media training . But new details have emerged revealing that another six ministers, including high fliers like Tory Matthew Hanock and Lib Dem Jo Swinson, have been sent on courses in how to smile for the camera, deliver soundbites and dodge tricky questions from journalists. Transport ministers Baroness Kramer and Robert Goodwill were trained by Angela Coles last year, a cost of £1,907.40. At the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Matthew Hancock, Jo Swinson and Viscount Younger all received media training from Millbankmedia at a total cost of £7,700. The Department of Health spent £500 on media training for minister Earl Howe. The figures are in addition to companies previously hired by the government tell politicians how media interviews are ‘a mixture of opportunity and danger’. One Cabinet minister - Energy Secretary Ed Davey - has been sent on media training twice. In June 2010 when a minister at the Department for Business, Innovation and Climate Change Mr Davey had £700 worth of media training. Then in July 2012, the Department for Energy and Climate Change spent another £2,160 on extra training for Mr Davey with private firm Electric Airwaves, which has previously worked with the Disney empire.","Ambassadors sent on courses in having 'authority and effect' on TV .

"At least 10 protesters have been killed and 441 others wounded as troops and pro-democracy protestors clashed during three days of violence in the Egyptian capital Cairo. The fighting, sparked when troops tried to break up a sit-in outside the Cabinet headquarters, has seen a particularly heavy hand by the military.

Activists . behind the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak's autocratic regime 10 months ago . have accused the military government of mismanaging the transition . period and committing human rights abuses. In . a statement posted on its Facebook page, the ruling military council on . Sunday called the clashes part of a 'conspiracy' against Egypt. It said . its forces had the right to defend the 'property of the great people of . Egypt.' This shocking image of a female protester being kicked and having her veil and shirt torn off by troops caused widespread condemnation although the protesters numbers have remained smaller than earlier rallies . Disorder: A solider hurls a rock during the clashes which have left at least 10 protesters dead and around 440 others wounded . Seeking to depict the protesters as hooligans - and apparently to counter the widely published images of protesters being beaten - it also posted on the page footage of young men throwing rocks at a basement window of the parliament building and of at least one man trying to set the place ablaze. The ruling generals have taken advantage of the growing frustration of many Egyptians over worsening economic hardships and tenuous security, blaming demonstrations, strikes and sit-ins for their predicament. The tactic, coupled with the military's efforts to stain the reputation of the youth groups behind Mubarak's ouster, appears to have worked. State media and loyal private TV stations have project an image of the military as the protector of the nation.

A protester shows a bullet used by the army during clashes with riot police in Cairo while a protester covers his head with a makeshift shield as he runs from police . Protest leaders increasingly complain that they feel isolated in a society that has grown more concerned with making ends meet than political rights. Many Egyptians see the ongoing, multistage parliamentary elections as a path to stability and an end to military rule. 'The military council uses every opportunity to show itself as the land's strongest institution,' said Mohammed Abbas, an activist who defected from the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest and best organized political group, to side with youth groups more active in protests. 'We are making it easier for the generals by our divisions and isolation.' In Sunday's clash, protesters and troops battled on two main streets off of central Tahrir Square, trading volleys of stones and firebombs around barriers that the military set up to block the avenues. Slingshot: Egypt's military rulers have sought to depict the protesters as hooligans, blaming them for the country's worsening economic hardship . One of the streets is site of a research centre set up during the three-year occupation of Egypt by France in the late 18th century. The building was almost completely gutted by a fire which broke out during the height of the clashes on Saturday, when troops on its roof and on other nearby rooftops hurled rocks down on protesters below. Protesters, who blame the fire on the troops, have been trying to salvage valuable books and documents from the centre, whose two-story building is now in danger of collapsing after its roof caved in. No escape: A pro-democracy protester is beaten by a gang of Egyptian army soldiers . The deepening hostility between the ruling military council and the protest leaders is in sharp contrast to the days of the popular uprising against Mubarak in January and February when army troops ordered out on the streets to take over from the hated police were given a warm welcome by hundreds of thousands of protesters in Cairo and elsewhere. The military at the time said it wouldn't fire on protesters. When the military stepped into power after Mubarak's Feb. 11 resignation, it was largely embraced by the public. Sunday's renewed violence was also taking place as unofficial results from a second round of voting in parliamentary elections showed Islamist parties, led by the Muslim Brotherhood, continuing their dominance at the polls. Liberal and left leaning parties, many of which sympathetic to the revolutionaries, have been trounced at the ballots. Protesters use plastic crates to protect themselves from stone-throwing soldiers. Activists have accused the military government of mismanaging the transition period and committing human rights abuses . Medics help a young protester wounded by a rock. The military council called the clashes part of a 'conspiracy' against Egypt and said its forces had the right to defend the 'property of the great people of Egypt' The third and final round of voting is slated for next month in nine of Egypt's 27 provinces. The Islamists have been staying clear of the recent violence, fearing that they could jeopardize their electoral gains by taking part in the protests. Their stance has prompted many activists to accuse them of political opportunism. The Muslim Brotherhood's party list has secured about 40 percent of votes counted so far in the second round of Egypt's staggered parliamentary election, a party source said on Sunday. The list led by the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party  won about 37 percent of votes in the first round. The poll, held over six weeks, is the first since President Hosni Mubarak was ousted in February. Official results have not been released but party representatives watch the count and their predictions after the first round were broadly accurate. The third and final round of voting takes place in January. The FJP source said the 40 percent estimate was based on counting completed in 11 of the 15 second-round constituencies where seats will be allocated by party lists. Outcry: The clashes began early Friday when one of several hundred peaceful protesters staging a sit-in outside the Cabinet offices near parliament was detained and beaten by troops . In a separate statement, the FJP said it was concerned the final result would be skewed against it, saying it had noted differences between its tally and official numbers. It did not specify how the counting may have been flawed. Independent monitors have listed electoral abuses such as illegal campaigning outside polling stations. The first-round vote in one district of Cairo will be re-run after ballots were lost or damaged during counting. The election committee has said the violations did not undermine the vote's overall legitimacy. A youth throws stones from a window of the burning Egyptian scientific complex which was almost completely gutted by a fire which broke out during the height of the clashes on Saturday . Under Egypt's complicated election system, two thirds of parliament's 498 elected seats will be allocated to party lists with the rest going to individuals. In the second round, 60 individual seats were up for grabs. The FJP source said the party expected 45 of its candidates to contest run-off votes for individual seats, where no candidate won the more than 50 percent of votes needed for outright victory.    The source said turnout was around 60 percent, similar to that in the first round. The clashes began early Friday when one of several hundred peaceful protesters staging a sit-in outside the Cabinet offices near parliament was detained and beaten by troops. The protesters began their sit-in three weeks ago to demand that the nation's ruling military immediately step down and hand over power to a civilian administration. Activists have been trying to drum up public sympathy for their cause by flooding social network sites with photos and video from the troops' brutal assaults he past two days. 'Liars,' proclaimed a red headline on the front page of the independent Al-Tahrir newspaper, referring to repeated denials by the military council and military-appointed Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri that no force or live ammunition were used against the protesters. With the headline, the paper ran a photo of the woman protester who was half-stripped by attacking soldiers. Other widely circulating footage shows an army officer running toward protesters while firing a pistol at them, though it is not clear from the footage whether he was using live ammunition.",Muslim Brotherhood wins 40 per cent of votes in second round of election .

"Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes has called some of the football his old club are playing under Louis van Gaal 'miserable'. Despite Van Gaal taking United to third in the table so far in his first season in charge, some critics have had issues with the style of play employed by the Dutchman. Another ex-player, Gary Neville, caused a stir when he compared them to a pub side earlier this season, while Scholes also has issues. VIDEO Scroll down for Preston NE vs Manchester United: Facts, Stats and Betting Odds . Paul Scholes has labelled Manchester United 'miserable' and struggles to watch his former side . Wayne Rooney has been playing in midfield but United don't take enough risks going forward . Louis van Gaal's side have been heavily criticised for moving away from United's attacking principles . Writing in The Independent in the wake of the midweek win over Burnley, he said: 'Part of being a Manchester United player under Sir Alex Ferguson, perhaps the most important part of being one of United's attacking players, was that when you were in possession you had to take risks in order to create goalscoring chances. It was not an option; it was an obligation. 'In the periods of my career when I stopped passing the ball forward, or when I stopped looking for the risky pass that might open up a defence, the consequences were the same. The manager stopped picking me. I got back into the team when I went back to doing it the way he wanted. 'United's history was built on attacking football, which does not always mean that the team kept clean sheets or did not concede chances. Why do you think United have had some of the best goalkeepers in the world over the years? They needed them because the team committed so many players forward. 'It does not give me any pleasure to say that at the moment I am struggling to watch Louis van Gaal's team with any great enjoyment. They beat Burnley on Wednesday night but it was Burnley who had by far the best of the first half. Chris Smalling scored twice as United beat Burnley in the Premier League on Wednesday night . 'At times, United's football is miserable. To beat opposing teams you have to attack, and to attack you have to take risks. Too few of the players in the current team are prepared to take those risks.' Scholes scored 155 goals for United during their richest period of success and is at a loss to work out why Van Gaal is employing captain Wayne Rooney in midfield. He added: 'We come at last to the two strikers, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao. I feel they look like strangers at times, while Wayne Rooney is moved around the team to accommodate them. 'Wayne can play anywhere on the pitch. He is so willing, and he will give you at least a 7/10 performance most times. Against Burnley he ended up as a defensive midfielder. At other times he has been pushed out to the right-hand side, where he will look for the strikers early or switch the play. 'But if Van Gaal does not think Rooney is a better option up front than the other two then there really is a problem.'","Paul Scholes has stuck the boot into Manchester United .

"Pieces of debris from the Virgin Galactic spaceship that broke apart  mid-flight have been found 35 miles from the main crash site. Acting National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chairman Christopher Hart said investigators had recovered parts small enough to have been blown that distance by the wind. The main wreckage from Friday's crash that killed one pilot and injured another is spread over a five-mile area in the Mojave Desert in California. Scroll down for video . Virgin Galactic pilot Todd Ericson talks with National Transportation Safety Board investigator Joe Sedor at the SpaceShipTwo main accident site near Mojave . Sheriffs' deputies look at the main wreckage from the crash of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo. Tiny pieces of debris from the spaceship were found 35 miles away . Federal accident investigators have an early sense of what went wrong on SpaceShipTwo, but they still do not know why the craft prematurely shifted its shape prior to the deadly crash. Mr Hart said cockpit video and data showed the co-pilot unlocked SpaceShipTwo's unique 'feathering' system earlier than planned. The system works somewhat like the wing flaps airplanes use to slow for landing — except that SpaceShipTwo's entire twin tails rotate up at a far more extreme angle, to a position that creates strong resistance and slows the descent. Authorities say the co-pilot unlocked the system before planned, but this was one of two steps necessary to change the craft's configuration and was not enough on its own to do so. The main wreckage from the crash on Friday that killed one pilot and injured another is spread over a five-mile area in the Mojave Desert in California . Activating the feathering system requires the pulling of a lever, not unlike a gun that fires only when the trigger is pulled, not just because the safety has been disengaged. But unlocking the system may have set off a chain of events that led to disintegration of the craft. NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson said Monday investigators believe once the feathers were unlocked, 'aerodynamic forces' buffeting the craft as it hurtled along about 760 mph caused the feathers to start rotating. Within a few seconds, the craft began to disintegrate, NTSB investigators determined. SpaceShipTwo is carried aloft on the underside of a jet-powered mother ship. It then drops from that ship and fires its own rocket to head higher. These images show the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rocket separating from the carrier aircraft, left, and then disintegrating, right, during a test flight on Friday . The feathers are not supposed to engage until the craft reaches a speed of Mach 1.4, or more than 1,000 mph, Mr Hart told reporters. Mr Knudson stressed that a final cause will take months to determine, and that investigators were looking into other factors, including pilot training, mechanical failure and design flaws. Passenger jets typically fly about seven miles high. Virgin Galactic envisions flights with six passengers climbing to more than 62 miles above Earth. Seats sell for $250,000 and the company says it has booked passengers including Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher and Russell Brand. The ultimate goal of Virgin Galactic co-owner Richard Branson is to create an industry that can move people around the globe in a fraction of the current time it takes passenger jets, by rocketing them into space and back down. But the company now lacks not only a craft to fly, but also an understanding of what caused the crash. Michael Alsbury (left) was killed in the crash on Friday, while co-pilot Peter Siebold (right) survived . Though rival companies also are pushing ahead, the dawn of space tourism seems to have been pushed beyond the horizon yet again. SpaceShipTwo has been under development for years, and Branson originally predicted passengers would be enjoying the wonders of flight by now. In the weeks before the crash, he said he hoped to fly in 2015. Branson still plans to be on the maiden voyage, with his family. He said that day will not come before a new round of crew-only flights. 'We need to be absolutely certain our spaceship has been thoroughly tested — and that it will be,' he said. 'And once it's thoroughly tested, and we can go to space, we will go to space.' The largest piece of wreckage is a wing but tiny bits of debris have been found 35 miles from the main site . Friday's crash could trigger increased government regulation. To give the fledgling commercial space industry space to innovate, the Federal Aviation Administration has not overregulated test flights during the past decade, according to Diane Howard, an assistant professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University who specializes in space law. But the crash could allow the FAA to propose new rules that would affect future Virgin Galactic flights, and 'it will be very interesting to see how Congress and the FAA and industry respond,' Howard said. The FAA did not immediately comment Monday. The agency is able to initiate a rule-making process that would affect the design or operation of a spacecraft involved in a fatal accident, but is unlikely to do so before the end of the NTSB's investigation.","Disintegration so complete parts were small enough to drift miles in wind .

"The fast food chain Chick-fil-A has long been suspected of having an anti-gay agenda, and this week, the company’s COO has decidedly come out on the side of the 'biblical definition of the family unit.’ Dan Cathy, the president of the multimillion-dollar empire said in an interview with the conservative paper Baptist Press that his company is ‘very much supportive of the family,’ but only when it involves heterosexual couples. ‘Well, guilty as charged,’ Cathy responded when asked about Chick-fil-A’s backing of ‘traditional’ families with a husband and wife. Anti-gay: Chick-fil-A president Dan Cathy's comments against gay marriage have caused a huge amount of criticism from consumers . ‘We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives,’ Cathy continued, according to the Los Angeles Times. The Atlanta-based business currently has 1,608 locations and boasts sales of more than $4billion. According to the paper, Chick-fil-A workers are trained ‘to focus on values rooted in the Bible,’ and the eateries nationwide are closed on Sundays. ‘We don’t claim to be a Christian business,’ Mr Cathy said. ‘Companies are not lost or saved, but certainly individuals are. But as an organization we can operate on biblical principles.’ The company, founded in 1946 by Cathy’s father, S. Truett Cathy, has come under fire for donating more than $3million between 2003 and 2009 to Christian organizations with a well-known anti-gay agenda, among them the Marriage & Family Foundation and the Family Research Council. Activist business: It has been reported that Chick-fil-A has donated millions of dollars to Christian groups that oppose gay marriage . 'Going forward': The Atlanta-based fast food chain released a statement on Facebook saying they will 'leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena' According to a report from LGBT advocacy group Equality Matters, in 2010 alone Chick-fil-A gave nearly $2million to such causes. Ed Helms, known for his memorable roles in The Hangover and The Office, posted his two cents on Twitter today, writing: ‘Chick-Fil-A doesn’t like gay people? So lame. Hate to think what they do to the gay chickens,’ adding that the restaurant ‘lost a loyal fan.’ Other celebrities like Andy Richter took to the microblogging site to say: ‘Plenty of other chicken sandwiches out there, folks.’ Despite the food chain’s history of providing financial support to faith-based groups that oppose homosexuality, Cathy’s comments appear to contradict his previously stated position on the issue. In a 2011 interview with the Atlanta Journal Constitution, Cathy said that his business ‘opted not to get involved in the political debate. It's never been our agenda.’ However, in last month’s radio . interview on The Ken Coleman Show, Cathy stated in no uncertain terms . where he stands on the issue of gay marriage. ‘I . think we are inviting God's judgment on our nation when we shake our . fist at Him and say 'we know better than you as to what constitutes a . marriage,’ and I pray God's mercy on our generation . that has such a prideful, arrogant attitude to think that we have the . audacity to define what marriage is about,' he said at the time. Cathy . said this week that he realizes that their stance on same-sex marriage may not be . ‘popular with everyone,’ but his company’s leaders intend to stay the . course. Chick-fil-A’s record of donations to anti-gay groups through the company’s charity organization, WinShape, has already prompted Northeastern University in Boston to abandon plans to open an eatery on campus. The chain also faced criticism when it sponsored a relationship seminar in Pennsylvania that banned same-sex couples from attending, Philadelphia Magazine reported.

"Facing ban? Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin (above) may be refused re-entry into the U.S. after migrating to Singapore to cut his tax bill . Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin may not be allowed to return to the United States after he renounced his citizenship to save millions in tax. The 30-year-old, who has a $3.64billion stake in the social networking site, migrated to Singapore ahead of the company's massive stock market floatation tomorrow. The timing of the move has raised eyebrows since Singapore does not have a capital gains tax, which could vastly reduce his bill on any payout. According to an immigration law, he could be refused re-entry to the U.S. if he is judged to have relocated for the purposes of avoiding taxes. Section 212 of the law, highlighted by Talking Points Memo, states: 'Any alien who is a former citizen of the United States who officially renounces United States citizenship and who is determined by the Attorney General to have renounced United States citizenship for the purpose of avoiding taxation by the United States is excludable.' A link was also posted on TPM to a document that someone would need to file with the U.S. State Department's Bureau Of Consulate Affairs when renouncing citizenship. The document says: 'My renunciation/relinquishment may not exempt me from United States income taxation...I understand that if my renunciation of United States citizenship is determined by the United States Attorney General to be motivated by tax avoidance purposes, I will be found excludable from the United States under Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended.' Earlier this week, it emerged that Saverin had moved to Miami at the age of 13 because he was at risk of kidnapping. The 30-year-old was on a gangster's list of potential kidnap targets which led his wealthy parents to flee Brazil in a potentially lifesaving move. But now he has shunned the country in which he made his fortune through the social networking site. Playboy lifestyle: Eduardo Saverin (far right) enjoys a rooftop party with friends and models in his new home of Singapore. He may not be allowed to return to America if his move was judged to be down to tax avoidance . He moved to the U.S. in 1992 and became a citizen in 1998, his spokesman Tom Goodman said. 'Eduardo recently found it more practical to become a resident of Singapore since he plans to live there for an indefinite period of time,' Goodman told Bloomberg. His name falls on an IRS list of people renouncing their citizenship from April 30 - but his spokesman said Saverin gave up his U.S. citizenship last September. The 30-year-old joins a growing number of people giving up their U.S. citizenship in a move that can trim their tax liabilities in the country. Investment: Saverin has invested in a start-up cosmetics company run by Rachel Kum, former Miss Singapore 2009, to whom he also offers his business expertise . Despite leaving the U.S. behind, he will not avoid all taxes in the country. He owes what is effectively an exit tax on capital gains from stock holdings, even if he doesn't sell the shares, Reuven S. Avi-Yonah, from the University of Michigan’s law school, told Bloomberg. Giving up your citizenship in advance of an initial public offering (IPO) is 'a very smart idea', Avi-Yonah added. 'Once it’s public you can’t fool around with the value.' Facebook plans to price its IPO today, offering 337.4 million shares at $28 to $35 each, which will be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol FB, Bloomberg reported. His decision also means he avoids paying the increased income-tax rate when it comes into effect next year. It will rise from 35 per cent to 39.6 per cent for top earners in the country next year. Saverin has invested in Asian, U.S. and European companies, his spokesman said. Now he plans to invest in Brazilian and in other global companies that have interests in entering Asian markets. Despite a substantial boost in their collective fortune from the IPO, Saverin will unlikely celebrate with Zuckerberg and the former friends from his college posse. Saverin began with a one-third stake in the company which was watered down when Zuckerberg began bringing others on board. The founders became embroiled in a bitter legal battle which left Saverin with a 2 per cent stake, according to the Wall Street Journal - and still an incredibly wealthy man. Blogs have sprung up tracking his partying with many locals hoping to get close to the self-made billionaire. He also reportedly drives a Bentley and lives in a penthouse in one of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods. Party time: Saverin (second right) drinking champagne in Singapore where he has become renowned for his lavish lifestyle of fast cars and nightclubs . According to Asia Tatler, Saverin is a fan of hanging out at Singapore's only private members club Filter in the Conrad Hotel. DJs are regularly flown in from around the world and high-end tables come with ice buckets overflowing of bottles of Belvedere vodka and Moet champagne. The whirlwind of parties, adoring friends and fast cars seems to have left little time for business apart from Saverin's investment in Rachel K - a start-up cosmetics company run by Rachel Kum, former Miss Universe 2009 whom Saverin also mentors. He has also ploughed money into information site Qwiki and online payment service Jumio. The Facebook share flotation is expected to happen tomorrow, with Mark Zuckerberg planning to start the 'roadshow' preceding the initial public offering (IPO) on Monday. How it all began: Eduardo Saverin was an initial investor in Facebook at Harvard, the story of which was depicted in movie The Social Network where he was played by Andrew Garfield (right) The social network, now eight years old, has 900million members and was valued at up to $79.3 billion. It is one of the most anticipated - and potentially the world's biggest - stock market entry of an Internet company since Google floated in 2004. Zuckerberg, Saverin and the original start-up Facebook team including Dustin Moskovitz, Sean Parker and Chris Hughes were immortalised in the 2010 film The Social Network. Saverin was played by Andrew Garfield and is portrayed as a slightly naive player in the game. In reality, Saverin's former friend Mark Zuckerberg, who is worth an estimated $17.5 billion and is set to make another $1 billion from the Facebook flotation, lives a polar opposite lifestyle. The 27-year-old is rarely seen out of a hoodie and lives a low-key existence with his long-term girlfriend in Palo Alto, California. He only bought his first property last year. High class hang-out: Filter, the only private members club in Singapore at the Conrad Hotel, is said to be one of the Brazilian playboy's favourite night spots . World's apart: Mark Zuckerberg in his habitual hoodie talking to ABC's Robin Robert's earlier this from Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California . One thing Saverin does prize highly is his privacy and closely guards details of his life. He attends few of the many public events he is invited to speak at and endorse and rarely gives interviews. It is presumably why he chose to set up home in Singapore which has relatively few tabloids and paparazzi who follow the rich and famous compared to the U.S. and Europe. Those who wish to speak to him on a business level must try to make contact through an intricate network of society contacts and similarly rich friends. John Fearon, CEO of Singapore-based start-ups dropmysite.com and dropmyemail.com told the WSJ: 'Eduardo doesn't invest in much. He doesn't invest in Singapore companies.' Last August, Saverin was spotted partying with dozens of models in St Tropez and spending $50,000 on champagne. He flew a number of his friends over from Singapore and checked into the $8,000-a-night Hotel Byblos before going clubbing until the early hours. The entrepreneur was also seen at the trendy Bagatelle Brunch in Nikki Beach with three friends and ten beautiful women drinking Cristal champagne from the bottle and spraying it over each other. The bar tab reportedly came to a cool $50,000.","Saverin, 30, migrated to Singapore ahead of site's stock market floatation .

"The Australian radio DJ who made the prank call to the London hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated during her pregnancy has admitted she 'should have tried harder' to stop the call going to air. The hoax by Mel Greig and her colleague Michael Christian in December 2012 was linked to the death of British nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who blamed them in her suicide note. Ms Greig's mother has since received death threats, while the 2DayFM presenter has battled depression. 'I felt like a failure as a human being,' Ms Greig said in a tearful interview with Channel Seven's Sunday Night. 'I am ashamed of myself. I should have tried harder to not let that prank call air.' Scroll down for video . The truth: Mel Greig has given her side of the Royal prank call story during a tearful interview on Channel Seven's Sunday Night . Upset: 'I felt like a failure as a human being,' Ms Greig said, as she described the moment she found out British nurse Jacintha Saldanha (right) had died . The presenters were pretending be the Queen and Prince Charles during the call, when they found out the sensitive news that Kate was being treated for acute morning sickness. Ms Greig has now revealed how she urged senior managers at 2DayFM to alter the recording but they ignored her. She asked her bosses to use radio staff members' voices instead of the actual voice of nurse Jacintha Saldanha. The nurse at King Edward VII Hospital - who transferred Ms Greig's call to the Duchess's ward - was found hanged three days after the prank, on 7 December. Just before she took her own life Mrs Saldanha wrote three notes; in one she held the Australian presenters responsible for her death. Information about how Ms Greig tried to stop Mrs Saldanha’s voice being used has only emerged now, as she was previously legally gagged from revealing details about the day. 'I want to answer everything so hopefully everyone can move forward,’ Ms Greig said in September, when the first part of the Channel Seven interview was recorded. 'I think of the Saldanha family all the time, I just want them to see that I’m sorry.’ Speaking out: Ms Greig has now revealed how she urged senior managers at 2DayFM to alter the hoax recording but they ignored her . Controversy: Ms Greig has received death threats towards her family since the 2DayFM prank with Michael Christian (left) In a statement from the Southern Cross Austereo radio company in December 2013, the station said the dispute arising from the royal hoax had been 'amicably resolved' and Ms Greig had resigned, effective from December 31. The company reiterated its position that recording and broadcasting the fateful call was 'not unlawful' and said 2Day FM decided to broadcast the call despite suggestions from Ms Greig that it should be changed. In a statement, Austero said: 'Prior to the call being broadcast she made suggestions for changes to be made to the recording of the call. '2Day FM decided that the call should be broadcast without alteration.' The stunt drew widespread criticism around the world. The hospital's boss John Lofthouse said: 'This was a foolish prank call that we all deplore.' Ms Greig started crying just seconds into the interview and revealed how she has suffered from depression since the incident . The radio presenter refused to listen to the prank call again, the first time interviewer Mel Doyle asked if she could play it back to her . On Sunday night, Ms Greig also told how she’d had lost her career and health and how she and her family has had to endure constant attacks. People who blamed her for Mrs Saldanha’s death went on to threaten her mother. Less than 18 months after Jacintha Saldanha tragically killed herself in the wake of the Royal DJ prank fiasco, her son Junal Barboza was named student of the year at his sixth form college. The 17-year-old, who uses his father's surname, picked up the gong from St Brendan's Sixth Form College in Bristol. 'I was shocked and honoured. I wouldn't say I was a model student. I just get on with things on a daily basis and don't do anything too outrageous,' he said at the time. 'I came back as early as I could because if I had stayed at home I would have been thinking in a negative state.' He was praised for his determination, strength of character and resilience when he was crowned the college's student of the year. 'They would call my mum and say “an eye for an eye - she died… and now you have to die”.’ Ms Greig started crying just seconds into the interview and revealed how she has suffered from depression since the incident. 'I don't feel like myself any more. For nine months I feel like I've been living a stranger's life… You're meeting a Mel that has no confidence, a Mel that is so lost in her life.’ She said she has 'so much shame and so much guilt’. The radio presenter refused to listen to the prank call again, the first time interviewer Mel Doyle asked if she could play it. ‘I don’t want to ever listen to it again… I’m ashamed of myself,’ she explained. ‘I should have tried harder not to have that prank call air, it never should have aired. We were never meant to get anywhere near Kate, it was meant to be something silly.’ Ms Greig - who recently became engaged to her boyfriend Stephen (right) - remains unemployed, having even been turned down by community radio stations . Ms Greig was at home with her boyfriend Stephen when she found out about the nurse’s death. ‘I felt like the worst person alive and that feeling hasn’t really gone away,’ she cried. In a follow-up interview with Ms Greig, in part of the Sunday Night show, she agrees to listen to the two minute, 11 seconds recording of the prank call. ‘I feel disgusted in myself listening back to it,’ she cried. Despite the decision to broadcast the hoax being down to the bosses at the radio station, Ms Greig’s lawyer claims she remains the ‘fall guy’. An inquest into Mrs Saldanha’s death is still waiting to be heard. It has now been postponed three times. Meanwhile, Ms Greig - who recently became engaged to her boyfriend Stephen - remains unemployed, having even been turned down for jobs by community radio stations. ‘I wish I could go back to that day and have called in sick,’ she said. After the TV interview aired on Sunday, Ms Greig wrote on Twitter: 'Thank you to @sundaynighton7 and @melissadoyle for sharing my story tonight and thank you for the support x'","Mel Greig has opened up about the 2DayFm hoax in 2012 .

"Organ traffickers gouged out the eyes of a six-year-old boy to sell on China’s transplant black market, it was claimed yesterday. Police said the child, Binbin, was drugged after being kidnapped while playing outside his home. His family found him covered in blood and crying in pain three to four hours later. His eyes were found nearby with the corneas missing, police say, implying that an organ trafficker was behind the attack. Scroll down for video . Horrific: The Chinese boy lies in hospital after he had his eyes gouged out . Recovering: The youngster was playing alone outside his home in Linfen, Shanxi Province, when he was snatched on Monday evening . An entire eye cannot be transplanted, but a cornea could be vital for a patient with faltering vision. Police are seeking a woman suspect and have offered £10,500 for information leading to an arrest. About 300,000 patients in China need . transplants each year, but only about 10,000 people can get them due to a . lack of donors, state media said. Few Chinese agree to donate their organs after death, fuelling the rampant illegal market activity. Child organs are . usually more expensive on the black market, an organ trafficker told . Sina Internet news portal in 2010, as 'most people think the younger the . donor is, the better the quality of organs'. Seven . people were jailed last year when a teenager sold a kidney for an . illicit transplant operation and used the proceeds to buy an iPhone and . iPad. Binbin’s . devastated father said: ‘We didn’t notice his eyes were gone when we . discovered him – he had blood all over his face. We thought he had . fallen down and smashed his face.’ The . boy was rushed to hospital where doctors were shocked to find his eyes . had been removed. His father said: ‘His eyelids were turned inside out, . and his eyeballs were not there.’ Illegal . organ harvesting is booming in China, where there is a shortage of . donors, and last night, amid domestic and international outrage, Beijing . was urged to crack down on the country’s multi-million-pound transplant . industry. Binbin was shown . on state TV  being taken in bandages from an operating theatre to a . hospital bed, writhing in agony as his shocked family wept. China Central Television said he had been drugged and ‘lost consciousness’ before the attacker removed his eyes. His parents discovered he was missing when they called for him to come in around 8pm on Monday but received no response. Mortified: Relatives of the youngster talk to a nurse. His parents realised he was missing when they tried to call hm inside the house but received no response . 'Extraordinarily vicious': The child's eyes were found nearby but the corneas were missing, reports said, implying that an organ trafficker was behind the harrowing attack . After . a frantic search with relatives, they found him screaming in a field . near their home in Fenxi, north China. The kidnapper had reportedly told . Binbin: ‘Don’t cry and I won’t gouge out your eyes.’ The organ trafficker may have been motivated by money. But they could also have been driven to such a horrific crime by the hope of saving someone's sight - or even their own. Problems . with the cornea - the clear front part of the eye - can cause the eye . to mist up and, if left untreated, lead to blindness. But . the most serious conditions such as Fuchs' dystrophy, a degenerative . condition that affects older people, can be cured with a transplant, above (file picture). Until . recent years, the only operation was a full cornea transplant, an . operation that involved 24 stitches in each eye and an 18-month recovery . period. But advances in . technology have meant surgeons can now carry out a partial replacement . under local anaesthetic with a recovery time of just four weeks. China . does not have a donor culture, but about 300,000 patients need . transplants each year. Only about 10,000 receive organs, mainly taken . from death-row prisoners. Though . the sale and transplant of organs for money is prohibited, lax laws and . widespread corruption have fuelled a booming industry. China is also a leading destination for ‘transplant tourists’ who travel there to obtain organs. Last night international doctors appalled by Binbin’s suffering called . on leading medical journals to ban publication of Chinese research . papers on organ transplants, to shame the country into tackling the . problem. Professor Arthur . Caplan, head of medical ethics at New York University and spokesman for . Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting, said: ‘As unimaginable and . untrue as this boy’s torment sounds, it shocks but does not surprise. ‘Whereas . hearts, livers and kidneys must be sourced from donors who match the . same blood and body type of recipient patients, in-demand corneas for . corrective eyesight operations can be taken from any age and body type. ‘Anyone . who knows where the corneas are located in the eye can extract them, . and I fear for the unsterile conditions and the  barbaric methods used, . and that infection may add to the boy’s suffering. ‘He will suffer unthinkable physical and psychological pain.’ Professor . Caplan urged international governments to ‘stand up to China’ and take . action to make it clean up its transplant industry. ‘Transplant . tourists who travel to China with the right amount of money can order . the organ needed,’ he said. ‘A prisoner is found to match the recipient . and is taken out and shot.’ Last weekend, Chinese police detained members of a kidney- trafficking ring, including a team of four doctors and nurses.

"Ed Miliband will not win the next election if he continues to lurch to the left, Labour former spin doctor Peter Mandelson has warned. In a challenge to the Labour leader, the former business secretary, who was one of the founders of New Labour, said that those who believe the country has moved to the left following the financial crisis are wrong. ‘Those who don't give their political loyalty automatically to left or right – whose votes, therefore, are up for grabs – are a greater segment of the electorate now than they were when New Labour was being created in the 1990s,’ he said. Lord Mandelson: The former Trade and Industry Secretary believes that Labour must retreat to the centre ground . ‘Therefore, it is even more important now to win the centre ground to win electoral victory.’ Lord Mandelson made the comments in an interview with Progress magazine to celebrate 20 years since Tony Blair became leader, but it is clear he wants Mr Miliband to learn lessons from his electoral success. He said: ‘It is essential still to win on leadership and the economy, and to demonstrate that we are a party of conscience and reform that will talk to people's values and concerns, not simply keep driving an agenda of our own regardless of the electorate's views. ‘That is why I get frustrated sometimes when people argue now that the country has moved to the left, therefore if we are more unambiguously left-wing and raise our ideological vigour, we are more likely to win the next election.’ The Labour peer argued the party needs to heed the lesson of defeat in 1992 under Neil Kinnock. He said: ‘The truth was, however fed up people were with the Tories, they were not going to switch to Labour in sufficient numbers unless they were absolutely sure of what we were going to do in government. 'All right!' Neil Kinnock at the start of the ill-fated 1992 General Election campaign when people did not trust Labour despite being fed up with the Tories after 13 years in power; present Labour leader Ed Miliband who Peter Mandelson thinks is taking the party far too far to the left to win the next General Election . ‘We had to demonstrate that we really could manage people's money and steer an economic course that would deliver sustainable economic growth and jobs.’ Lord Mandelson said that Mr Blair’s opponents in the party had to wait for the Iraq invasion before they could remove him. ‘It gave them a stick to beat Blair with, knowing they were going to get media support, the right-wing media because he was Labour, and the left-wing media because he was New Labour. They hated his electoral success and Iraq was the opportunity to dislodge him,’ he said. Tony Blair is due to give a speech on 21 July to mark 20 years since he became Labour leader.","'The party needs to heed the lesson of defeat in 1992 under Neil Kinnock'

"Clicking 'Like' on Facebook is constitutionally protected free speech and can be considered the 21st century-equivalent of a campaign yard sign, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond reversed a lower court ruling that said merely 'liking' a Facebook page was insufficient speech to merit constitutional protection. Exactly what a 'like' means – if anything – played a part in a Virginia case involving six people who say Hampton Sheriff B.J. Roberts fired them for supporting an opponent in his 2009 re-election bid, which he won. The workers sued, saying their First Amendment rights were violated. Like it or not: A federal court has ruled that 'liking' something on Facebook is constitutionally protected free speech . Roberts said some of the workers were let go because he wanted to replace them with sworn deputies while others were fired because of poor performance or his belief that their actions 'hindered the harmony and efficiency of the office.' One of those workers, Daniel Ray Carter, had 'liked' the Facebook page of Roberts' opponent, Jim Adams. U.S. District Judge Raymond Jackson in Norfolk had ruled in April 2012 that while public employees are allowed to speak as citizens on matters of public concern, clicking the 'like' button does not amount to expressive speech. In other words, it's not the same as actually writing out a message and posting it on the site. Jackson acknowledged that other courts have ruled that Facebook posts are constitutionally protected speech, but he said in those cases there were 'actual statements.' Simply clicking a button is much different and doesn't warrant First Amendment protection, he wrote. In his ruling, Jackson acknowledged the need to weigh whether the employee's speech was a substantial factor in being fired. But the judge wrote that the point is moot if 'liking' something isn't constitutionally protected speech. Origin: The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia made the ruling Wednesday. It stemmed from a suit filed by employees of a sheriff who were fire after hitting 'like' on his opponent's page during an election . The three-judge appeals court panel disagreed, ruling that 'liking a political candidate's campaign page communicates the user's approval of the candidate and supports the campaign by associating the user with it. In this way, it is the Internet equivalent of displaying a political sign in one's front yard, which the Supreme Court has held is substantive speech.' The case was sent back to the lower court. Facebook and the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed friend of court briefs in the case, applauded Wednesday's ruling. 'This ruling rightly recognizes that the First Amendment protects free speech regardless of the venue, whether a sentiment is expressed in the physical world or online,' Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU Speech, Privacy & Technology Project, said in a written statement. 'The Constitution doesn't distinguish between `liking' a candidate on Facebook and supporting him in a town meeting or public rally.' An attorney representing Roberts, the sheriff, did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment, nor did an attorney representing the employees.","The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia gave its ruling Wednesday .

"Broadway producers who want big stars at their premier usually want ones with a pulse. But the folks who put Truman Capote’s Breakfast at Tiffany’s on Broadway wanted the late author cremated remains at the play premier’s after party, since Capote himself couldn't make it. They even went so far as to offer the ashes—and their owner—a flight from Los Angeles to New York for the show. Odd guest: In honor of the late writer, producers of Broadway's 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' tried to fly Truman Capote's ashes in for their New York premier . A source of the New York Post confirmed the bizarre offer. ‘We did try to get him here,’ the source said. ‘We thought it would have been poignant for the entire company.’ Former wife of Johnny Carson, Joanne Carson, keeps the In Cold Blood author’s remains in the Bel Air bedroom where he died in 1984. The two were close friends up until his death and Carson has seen the ashes argued over, stolen, returned, and nearly stolen again over the years. Old friends: Joanne Carson (here with then husband Johnny in 1969) possesses Capote's remains in her Bel Air home . The ashes were famously boosted during Carson’s 1988 Halloween party, along with $200,000 worth of jewelry. However, they were mysteriously returned shortly thereafter. That’s when Capote’s longtime partner questioned whether the ashes were those of his dead lover at all. Someone again attempted to steal the remains at a showing put on by Carson of the play Tru, which is adapted from Capote’s works. Broadway turn: The beloved book was first a film starring Audrey Hepburn (right) as Holly Golightly and saw its big stage debut March 20 with actress Emilia Clarke (left) in the role . It was the history of theft that doomed Capote's post-mortem trip to the theater, or so says the Post's source. 'Ultimately, the risk of theft was just too high.' In spite of the drama surrounding them, Carson has referred to her cremated friend’s remain as ‘her sanity’ over the years. And Carson claims Capote always wanted to see ‘Holly Golightly open on Broadway.’ Though he was not in attendance, Capote’s wish came true March 20 when Breakfast at Tiffany’s, starring Emilia Clarke, made its debut at the Cort Theater.","Producers wanted to fly the ashes in from Los Angeles to attend the March 20 opening party .

"A video experiment has shown most urban Canadians will leap to the defence of a Muslim person singled out for abuse, even in the wake of the country's recent Islamist terror attack. One angry resident of Hamilton, Ontario, punched a man playing the part of an Islamophobe having a go at a man wearing Muslim-style clothing at a bus stop. He was left bleeding from his nose for the part he played in what the YouTube filmmakers called a 'social experiment' This is what happens to racists in Ontario: After playing the part of an Islamophobe for a YouTube video 'social experiment' this man was left with a bloody nose after he was punched in the face by an angry Canadian . 'This is based on the events that happened in Ottawa,' said YouTube filmmaker Omar Albach, referring to recent bloodshed in the Canadian capital. 'We're going to see if people feel safe to be around Muslims or people that look like Muslims.' Within seconds of the filmmakers beginning their first charade - which involved a one telling another one wearing Muslim-style clothes he can't board a bus - a middle-aged man objects to the apparent racism. 'You know what? You can't stereotype and judge people by their clothes,' the casually dressed, silver-haired white man objects. 'Or their nationalities or anything else, you know what I mean?' 'You can't judge and stereotype people by their clothes': The scene as a middle-aged man in blue jeans and leather jacket, centre, defends the man in Muslim dress after he is accosted by the man on the right . No time for racism: The man was just one of many who stood up for the man dressed as a Muslim . The filmmakers repeat their play in several different locations, to get a range of responses. Although the footage is edited and not continuous, it seems they found difficulty finding anyone to go along with the racist behaviour. Asked to think of the recent shooting of Corporal Nathan Cirillo at Canada's national war memorial, a woman responds: 'It was awful and tragic, but I don't think that's any reason to persecute some just because of what they're wearing.' The video, published yesterday, has already attracted nearly 200,000 views and a storm of comment. The location was poignant, Hamilton is the hometown of Corporal Cirillo and it was today the emotional scene of his funeral procession, led by his five-year-old son Marco. Burnishing Canada's credentials as a tolerant, multicultural nation, the video shows Canadians of a range of ethnicities and walks of life objecting to vocal racism and Islamophobia. Finally, a hot-headed man in a baseball cap decides he's had enough of the haranguing being dished out to the Muslim man. He sneaks up next to the 'racist' and sucker punches him in the face. Speaking to camera, the man who played the role of the racist concluded: 'So err.. the social experiment had a negative ending to it but, you know what? It's positive because he stood up for him and I appreciate that. 'It's good.'","Three filmmakers contrived the scenario in Hamilton, Ontario .

"Close to the ear: Cancer scientists want a full investigation into the risks of using a mobile . A scientific conference starting in London today will urge governments across the world to support independent research into the possibility that using mobile phones encourages the growth of head cancers. The Children with Cancer conference will highlight figures just published by the Office of National Statistics, which show a 50 per cent increase in frontal and temporal lobe tumours between 1999 and 2009. The ONS figures show that the incident rate has risen from two to . three per 100,000 people since 1999, while figures from Bordeaux Segalen University show a one to two per . cent annual increase in brain cancers in children. Scientists and academics have long argued over the suggestion that radiation from mobile phones causes cancers. Those who believe there is a link say that - with five billion mobile phones being used worldwide - urgent research must be carried out to establish the risk. But not everyone agrees. While governments, phone companies, and health agencies give precautionary advice about minimising mobile phone use, the Health Protection Agency is likely to conclude in a report due on Thursday that the only established risk when using a mobile is crashing a car due to being distracted by a call or text. Professor Denis Henshaw, emeritus professor of human radiation . effects at Bristol University, is opening the three-day conference in Westminster today. He has previously advocated cigarette-style warnings on . mobile phone packets and urges more independent research. Professor Henshaw said: 'Vast numbers of people are using mobile phones and they . could be a time bomb of health problems - not just brain tumours, but . also fertility, which would be a serious public health issue. 'The health effects of smoking alcohol and air pollution are well . known and well talked about, and it's entirely reasonable we should be . openly discussing the evidence for this, but it is not happening. 'We want to close the door before the horse has bolted.' Keeping track: There has been an increase in the number of child brain cancer sufferers, and the ONS has also spotted a rise in brain tumours . The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) rang alarm bells last year when it classified mobile phones as 'possibly carginogenic'. Professor Darius Leszczynski, of the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority in Finland, said: 'For the first time a very prominent evaluation report states it so openly and clearly: RF-EMF [radio frequency electromagnetic field] is possibly carcinogenic to humans. Speaker Dr Annie Sasco, from the Epidemiology for Cancer Prevention . unit at Bordeaux Segalen University, will highlight the one to two per . cent annual increase in brain cancers in children. She has concerns over the effect of radiation on children's brains. She said: 'If the penetration of the electromagnetic waves goes for four centimetres into the brain, four centimetres into the adult brain is just the temporal lobe. 'There are not too many important functions in the temporal lobe - but in a child the more central brain structures are going to be exposed. 'In addition kids have a skull which is thinner, less protective, they have a higher content of water in the brain, so there are many reasons that they absorb more of the same radiation.' Speaking to the Independent about the rise in brain cancer in children, she said: 'It’s not age, it’s too fast to be genetic, . and it isn’t all down to lifestyle, so what in the environment can it . be? ''We now live in an electro-smog and people are exposed to wireless . devices that we have shown in the lab to have a biological impact. 'It is totally unethical that experimental studies are not being done . very fast, in big numbers, by independently funded scientists. 'The industry is just doing their job, I am more preoccupied with the . so called independent scientists and institutions saying there is no . problem.' 'One has to remember that IARC monographs are considered as ""gold standard"" in evaluation of carcinogenicity of physical and chemical agents. 'If IARC says it so clearly then there must be sufficient scientific reason for it, or IARC would not put its reputation behind such claim.' However not everyone believes there is a significant risk from mobile phone radiation. Ken Foster, professor of bio-engineering at the University of . Philadelphia, downplayed the IARC's classification. He is quoted on Science Based Medicine as saying: 'Saying that something is a ""possible carcinogen"" is a bit . like saying that someone is a ""possible shoplifter"" because he was in . the store when the watch was stolen. 'The real question is what is the evidence that cell phones actually . cause cancer, and the answer is - none that would persuade a health . agency.' The Independent said the research is split almost 50:50 on whether mobile phones pose a health hazard or not, but pointed out research from Joel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at the University of California, who said that the balance changes if funding sources are considered, with around three quarters of studies implying no health risks being funded by the mobile phone industry. He told the paper: 'The mantra that ""we . need more research"" is true, but there is already enough evidence to . warrant better safety information, tighter regulation, mass public . education and independently funded research carried out by teams of . specialists who are not beholden to industry. Conflicting views: . 'This is the largest technological experiment in the history of our . species and we’re trying to bury our head in sand about the potential . risks - risk we still know next to nothing about.' - Joel Moskowitz, University of California . 'Even if the risk is still only one in a million, with 5 billion phone users it means a lot of extra brain cancers.' - Professor Denis Henshaw . 'Saying that something is a ""possible carcinogen"" is a bit like saying that someone is a ""possible shoplifter"" because he was in the store when the watch was stolen.' - Professor Ken Foster . 'This is the largest technological experiment in the history of our . species and we’re trying to bury our head in sand about the potential . risks to cells, organs, reproduction, the immune system, behaviour, . risks we still know next to nothing about.' Governments and mobile phone companies . often play down the risks and the UK's Mobile Operators Association says there is 'no credible evidence of adverse health effects'. The Department of Health says: 'As a precaution children should only use mobile . phones for essential purposes and keep all calls short. We keep all . scientific evidence under review.' The NHS also advises children under 16 to minimise their use of mobile phones. The iPhone, Apple's smartphone which popularised mobile computing, comes with the advice . that you should keep your phone at least 15mm away from your body at all . times - which may come as a surprise to those who keep the phone in their pockets at all times. The guide that comes with the phone warns: 'When using the iPhone . near your body for voice calls or wireless data transmissions over a . cellular network, keep it at least 15mm away from the body, . and only use carrying cases, belt clips or holders that do not have . metal parts and that maintain at least 15mm separation between . iPhone and the body.' Other guides, such as the one that comes with a BlackBerry, have similar warnings. The BlackBerry guide suggests that users, particularly pregnant women and teenagers, keep their phone 25mm from their body. A study held in Denmark last October compared medical records against phone records of around 358,000 people. They correlated the data to see how long people owned their phones, and how many of these people developed brain cancer. Some users had owned mobile phones for more than 20 years. In total, the group had owned their phones for '3.8 million years', and suffered 10,729 cases of tumours. When compared to the average population, they found no indication of 'dose-response' relation either by years since first subscription for a mobile phone or by anatomical location of the tumour - that is, in regions of the brain closest to where the handset is usually held to the head. They concluded 'there were no increased risks of tumours of the central nervous system, providing little evidence for a causal association'. Even the iPhone manual states that people should keep their phone away from close body contact . The guide, almost ironically, also suggest that users 'reduce the amount of time spent on calls'. Professor Leszczynski will use the conference to urge for a stronger IARC classification - 'probably carginogenic'. He . told the Independent: 'Since 2001 I have continuously spoken about the . need for precautionary measures, especially for children. We have had . enough evidence to call for that for a long time.' The conference will also discuss other reasons for childhood cancer, such as chemical toxins in the air, food and water, and infection and . genetic effects. But the main message coming from the Children with Cancer conference is: more independent research is needed. Professor Denis Henshaw told the Independent: 'The . public have a right to know this information. 'We cannot and do not say . there is a causal link between brain cancer and mobile phones, but we . are right to consider them as one possible explanation for the increase . and the public have the right to expect that this is properly . investigated. 'Even if the risk is still only one in a million, with 5 billion phone users, it means a lot of extra brain cancers.'","Scientists at London conference call for independent research into potential links between using a mobile phone and brain cancer .

"A choirmaster yesterday admitted a brief but intense affair with a head girl at a world-renowned private music school where he worked. Michael Brewer, 68, told a court he would remove the 17-year-old’s blouse and touch her breasts while she was meant to be practising her oboe, adding: ‘I was in love.’ The father of four said that at the time, in the 1990s, his then wife was having an affair and he was left feeling ‘desolate’ when the former pupil of Chetham’s School of Music, in Manchester, ended the relationship. Michael Brewer: The choir director, 67, who denies raping a former pupil, told Manchester Crown Court his accuser was a 'fantasist' but admitted having a separate affair with a different pupil who was 17 at the time . He also admitted that when he was . arrested for raping and sexually abusing another ex-pupil in the . late-1970s and early-80s, he at first failed to tell police the truth . about the affair, saying they had agreed to keep it ‘private’. The prosecution say the affair with the head girl was part of a pattern which showed his unhealthy interest in teenage girls. Earlier at Manchester Crown Court, . Brewer described the alleged victim as ‘vivacious and talented’ but also . ‘a fantasist’. Asked whether he had ever had any sexual contact with . her, he replied: ‘No.’ Brewer, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, . denies the charges, while his ex-wife Hilary Kay Brewer denies indecent . assault and aiding and abetting rape. Giving evidence, he said students with problems would often be passed to him in . his early years at Chetham's, where he worked from 1975 to 1994. One of those students was the complainant in the case, the jury heard. Brewer said: 'She was largely living a . fantasy life. She was finding alcohol. Also she was being disruptive in . her boarding house and lessons, with hysterical outbursts and . threatening suicide and self-harm and so on.' His barrister, Kate Blackwell QC, asked him what his impressions were of her at the time. Trial: Michael Brewer, left, gave evidence at Manchester Crown Court, where his wife Hilary Brewer, right, is also on trial, accused of aiding and abetting rape . He . replied: 'I saw her as a very talented, vivacious musician but I was . already aware of her problems and her lack of discipline. She found . practice very difficult. 'Her creativity was exceptional and her application was really poor.' He added: 'She . was vivacious, dynamic, commanding on stage (but) underneath was . insecure, depressive, hysterical and a fantasist.' When asked by Miss Blackwell whether he touched the pupil 'inappropriately' in his office, Brewer replied 'no'. He also denied inviting the then 14-year-old to perform a sex act in his office. Brewer told the jury that he was 'very friendly' and 'jokey' with senior students at Chetham's and that he allowed them to call him 'Mike' on school trips. 'I regarded them as young adults,' he explained. 'I was very hard on their music making but very relaxed with them in every other way.' The jury was told that the former grammar school pupil graduated in music from the University of Wales in Aberystwyth before taking a masters degree in composition. He taught at the Royal Liberty . School in Romford in 1967 and four years later became director of music . at the Latimer School in Edmonton. In 1975 he joined Chetham's and stayed until December 1994. Prestigious: The 67-year-old choir director is accused of indecently assaulting the pupil while he was working at Chetham's School of Music in Manchester . Miss Blackwell said the choirs that Brewer had been involved with had won many prizes and he had been involved in many recordings. In 1995 he was appointed OBE for services to music. Brewer is said to have raped the complainant in the presence of his wife, Hilary Kay Brewer, also 67, while she was tied to their bed. She is also on trial accused of aiding and abetting the rape and committing a separate indecent assault on the alleged victim. The complainant said most of the abuse by Brewer took place at the school as she visited his office, and in his camper van which was parked in its grounds. She did not consider it sexual abuse so did not make an official complaint at the time, the court heard. On the directions of Judge Martin Rudland, the jury recorded not guilty verdicts on five counts of indecent assault on a child against Brewer due to insufficient evidence on how old she was at the time of the allegations. Michael Brewer, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, denies rape and eight counts of indecent assault. Hilary Kay Brewer, of Rossendale, Lancashire, denies one count of indecent assault and aiding and abetting rape. The trial continues.

"Sarah Palin has taken another jibe at President Obama - this time mocking his 'coffee cup' salute. The commander-in-chief was criticized after White House officials posted a video of him stepping off of Marine One in New York City and saluting waiting Marines while still holding a white cup. In response Palin, speaking at the Values Voter Summit in Washington D.C, said: 'To the commander -in-chief, we then salute him,' before sarcastically waving the Styrofoam cup over her head. However she soon became the victim of embarrassment herself when she said the White House is located at '1400 Pennsylvania Avenue.' It is actually at 1600. Scroll down for video . 'To the commander-in-chief': Sarah Palin raises a cup sarcastically above her head during a speech at the Values Voter Summit in Washington D.C. - mocking President Obama's 'coffee cup' salute earlier this week . The commander-in-chief was criticized on Wednesday after the White House uploaded a picture of him on Instagram stepping off of Marine One in New York City for a UN summit still holding the cup in his left hand . After realizing her mistake, she tried to turn it around by poking fun at herself on Twitter. She wrote: 'Doggone it. That explains why my Christmas cards keeps (sic) getting returned.' Palin then visited wrong address she had mentioned in the slip up and sent a photo underneath the street sign to CNN reporter Jake Tapper. Saluting military personnel is something presidents are expected to do since they're at the top of the Pentagon's chain of command. After realizing that she had got the address of the White House wrong, Palin tried to poke fun at herself . Obama caused a stir because it is customary for a commander-in-chief to salute uniformed servicemen and women who salute him first as a sign of respect. Many people took to Twitter criticizing his controversial method while Donald Trump said it was 'terrible'. President Ronald Reagan reportedly began the tradition and future presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, followed suit. Marine One lands at a heliport in New York City ahead of a UN Summit - moments later the President was captured giving a salute while holding a coffee cup to waiting Marines . Obama's casual approach to the moment as he left his Marine One chopper at a helipad in New York City came at a time when he had just ordered U.S. fighter planes to fly perilous missions in the skies over Syria. Twitter predictably erupted, with most commenters expressing outrage. Before the cup gesture and subsequent gaffe at the summit, Palin was asked questions about recent photos that were taken of her without her wedding ring. She denied her and her husband Todd were on the verge of divorce and added: 'Well, I rarely wear a ring, especially up in Alaska, you know it's choppin' wood or you're butcherin' a moose or something.' 'Terrible': Donald Trump was one of the people to have criticized the President's actions on Twitter . The 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee playfully confronted the issue on her own accord Friday afternoon, saying midway through her speech, 'I heard the other day that I'm in the middle of another divorce.' Palin didn't talk about the media coverage of the drunken brawl her family recently got into in Alaska during which her daughter Bristol allegedly punched a man in the face, her son Track broke four ribs and her husband Todd bloodied his nose. Instead, she used the divorce chatter as a bridge into a lengthier rant on the mainsteam media and the perceived bias against conservatives.","Raised cup sarcastically to her head while at the Values Voter Summit .

"Alex Salmond's ministers have bullied and threatened business leaders in an attempt to stop them speaking out against independence, according to damning claims to be broadcast in a TV documentary. Tonight's episode of Dispatches on Channel 4 will air claims from a former boss of the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) that his staff were told to stay out of the independence debate by SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson. The claims will reignite a heated debate about intimidation, only days after Prime Minister David Cameron accused the Nationalists of making 'threats and warnings' to businesses. First Minister Alex Salmond faces claims the pro-independence campaign has put pressure on companies not to support the Union . Gavin Hewitt, former chief executive of the SWA, told the programme: 'Angus Robertson and the SNP have regularly tried to get the message to the SWA that the Scotch whisky industry should stay out of the independence debate. 'He was, I think, trying to neuter business comment. There was a genuine fear that if we were seen to come out publicly against independence, there would be retribution down the track.' Five major figures in Scotland's business community told the programme they were contacted by the Scottish Government and 'felt pressurised to stay quiet about their views'. Of the five, one claimed they had been visited by ministers, two claimed they had received a phone call from a minister and two claimed they had received a call from Alex Salmond's office. A further 14 claimed to know of other businesses which felt under pressure. Lord Sutherland, former vice-chancellor of Edinburgh University, also told the programme some of those running Scottish universities had come under pressure to stay out of the debate. A former boss of the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) claims that staff were told to stay out of the independence debate . An independent Scotland could face higher interest rates that would add hundreds of pounds to mortgage payments, it was claimed last night. In an interview with BBC economics editor Robert Peston, Mike Amey of investment firm Pimco said rates of government borrowing for a separate Scotland could be higher. Pimco is the world's biggest investor in government bonds and, as such, the world's biggest lender to governments. 'Our best estimate, assuming a reasonably even split of assets and liabilities, would be the interest rate paid by a Scottish government would be between 0.5 and 1 per cent more than the UK Government currently pays,' Mr Amey said. 'Higher borrowing would reduce the Scottish Government's net income by up to 1 per cent.' The rate would rise because an independent Scotland would have no borrower track record. Blair McDougall, chief executive of the Better Together campaign, said: 'An increase of 1 per cent on interest rates would put the average Scottish mortgage up by £1,300 and add around £120 a year to household credit card, catalogue and store card bills.' But a spokesman for Finance Secretary John Swinney said Scotland was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, more prosperous per head than the UK, France and Japan and would be able to end Westminster's cuts and austerity. At the weekend, Nobel Laureate Sir Paul Nurse urged the Scottish and UK governments to pledge that academics who enter the referendum debate will not be penalised for expressing their views. Tonight's Dispatches episode also includes: . Evidence that Finance Secretary John Swinney seized on the CBI's decision to back the No campaign to put pressure on public sector bodies to quit the organisation, as reported in the Scottish Daily Mail. Documents which show British embassies around the world have been briefed about the UK Government's opposition to independence, as first revealed by the Mail. Another intervention from Professor Patrick Dunleavy of the London School of Economics, who has renewed his attack on the Treasury for suggesting start-up costs for separation could be £2.7billion, describing the document that included this figure as a 'dodgy dossier'. Although many business leaders have broken their silence, such as the heads of B&Q, Barrhead Travel and BP, there are continuing claims others fear they will face abuse or put their firms at risk if they speak out. Mr Hewitt told Dispatches he or senior members of his staff met Mr Robertson on at least six occasions over the past two years. He said: 'Regardless of whether the SNP win or lose the referendum vote in September, they will be in power for many years to come and that those people who have stood against them or worked against the central plank of their policy, independence, will be singled out and will be remembered.' Earlier this year, Mr Hewitt's successor, David Frost, used a dinner with the media - including the Scottish Daily Mail - to raise fears that losing access to the UK's diplomatic service could harm Scotland's most vital export industry. Last night, Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: 'If the Scottish Government has been caught threatening and bullying businesses, then that is a disgraceful indictment on Alex Salmond and other senior SNP officials.' But the Scottish Government said Mr Hewitt's claims were false. In a statement, it said: 'Angus Robertson, as the [Moray] constituency MP representing more than half of Scotland's malt whisky distilleries, regularly meets with the Scotch Whisky Association on industry regulation and taxation.' A spokesman added: 'Businesses on both sides of the debate have been open in making their views known and we encourage all views to the debate on Scotland's future.' Addressing Professor Dunleavy's comments to Dispatches, the spokesman said: 'This programme will make uncomfortable viewing for the No campaignand the UK Government. 'This is not the first time Westminster has been accused of producing a ""dodgy dossier"" in an attempt to mislead the public.'

"President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama enjoyed a romantic date night in a small  tapas restaurant in New York on Wednesday. The couple dined at Estela, a tiny tapas-style restaurant on East Houston Street in Manhattan where they ate burrata with salsa verde and bread, two endive salads, and tomatoes and croquettes.

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem told Brahimi that if 'serious talks don't begin Saturday, the official Syrian delegation will have to leave because the other party is not serious or ready,' according to Syrian state television. Scroll down for video . Troubles continue: As peace talks falter in Geneva, a reported air strike in Aleppo has left 16 people dead . Direct talks planned for Friday between the Syrian government and the Western-backed Syrian opposition were scrapped, and the opposition was to meet separately with Brahimi later. The Syrian government blamed the opposition Syrian National Coalition for the lack of direct negotiations, which were seen as the best hope for an eventual end to the three-year civil war that has killed at least 130,000 people. The bloodshed has destabilized the entire region and turned Syria into a magnet for al-Qaida-inspired militants. As the peace conference faltered, fighting raged throughout parts of Syria. Government forces bombed rebel-held areas in the northern city of Aleppo, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and local activists. The latest airstrike, which reportedly took place yesterday, left 16 people dead, including three women and eight children. Fighting also raged in towns around the capital Damascus, activists reported. Underscoring the extent of foreign involvement in the conflict, Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah fighters fought alongside forces loyal to President Bashar Assad around the area of eastern Ghuta, the British-based Syrian Observatory said. The rebels clashing against them included extremists from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, a hard-line group dominated by foreign jihadis, the Observatory reported. Death toll rises: The latest strike in rebel-held areas in Aleppo killed 16, including three women and eight children . Troubles continue: Syrians inspect the damage caused by the latest incident in the bloody civil war . In Switzerland, Bouthaina Shaaban, an adviser to Assad who traveled to Geneva for the talks, questioned whether the opposition coalition - made up largely of exiles based in Turkey - was prepared to negotiate an end to the violence. 'We came here with Syria and the Syrian people on our mind, only while they came here with positions and posts on their mind,' she said. The coalition's head, Ahmad al-Jarba, said late Thursday that he was committed to the talks and would give his negotiators full authority on their pace and scope. But on Friday, his chief of staff said the negotiations were never expected to be easy or quick, insisting that the coalition was simply not yet prepared to meet directly with the government. Mediating: UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon pictured earlier this week with UN Arab League envoy for Syria Lakhdar Brahimi at the Geneva peace talks . 'Everyone knows that these are proximity negotiations,' said the aide, Monzer Akbik. 'And for the time being, that's the way it is going to be.' Both sides have spent their time so far in Switzerland affirming positions hardened after nearly three years of fighting. They blamed each other for turning a once-thriving country into ruin and called each other terrorists. But their willingness to meet with Brahimi - even separately - gave the first sense that the negotiations might bear some fruit. President Bashar al-Assad has yet to put an end to the three-year civil war, which has claimed the lives of at least 130,000 people . Brahimi himself has said both sides had shown willingness to bend on humanitarian corridors, prisoner exchanges and local cease-fires - even if the terms were still murky. The Syrian National Coalition, which is made up largely of exiles, lacks influence with an increasingly radicalized rebellion, which has been pulled apart by an influx of militants. Infighting among rebels has left 1,400 people dead in the past 20 days, according to activists, who have counted more than 130,000 deaths since the rebellion began in 2011.","Syrian delegation handed ultimatum to UN mediator Lakhdar Brahimi .

"They're known for their love of sleep, so tit's not surprising this koala was far from happy when it was rudely awakened with a drenching from a garden sprinkler. The furry creature, which rests for up to 18 hours a day, was fast asleep in a tree when it was soaked by a gardener watering his trees. And as these images show, the koala was more than a little peeved at its unexpected soaking. A wet wake-up call: This koala looks far from happy after being woken up from a nap when a gardener drenched it while watering his trees in Adelaide, Australia . The images were taken by Matt Wilkinson, 39, in the garden of his home in Adelaide, Australia. He said: 'There was a particular bad heatwave in Adelaide recently and temperatures reached up to 40C. 'The koalas hang around in a tree in my garden when it is hot, it's on the southern side of the house and relatively cool. ""We use the sprinklers and garden hose to wet the house and surrounding trees when it's hot to avoid a bush fire but when I watered one of the trees, this koala got a bit of a soaking.' But while the koala may look far from happy about his soaking, Mr Wilkinson said it would have helped it cool off. He said: 'It was a boiling hot day so I'm sure it helped the koala cool down. Cooling off: But Matt Wilkinson, 39, who took the photographs of the animal, said the koala may have appreciated the soaking as it was an unusually hot day . 'Koalas usually don't need to drink, as they get their moisture requirements from gum leaves but on that day, the koala's were licking at the trunk of the tree where the water was trickling down. They were quite thirsty.' After accidentally drenching the animal, Mr Wilkinson quickly grabbed his camera before heading to the end of his garden to take these pictures. 'I wanted to use my camera to try and get a shot of the koala after wetting it down, so walked down and proceeded to snap away. 'Either the koala was curious, or wanted to thank me, as it climbed out along the tree branch and stayed at the end of it just looking at me. It even stuck its tongue out which helped me get some great photos.'","Koalas are known for their love of sleep and rest for up to 18 hours a day .

"'Relax - here even the sharks are friendly.' I am given this advice by my guide as, a few steps into the azure waters, I come face to fin with a shark. I can only watch in shock as a 5ft-long lemon shark glides within inches of my knees, before veering out to sea. Welcome to Fernando de Noronha, a tiny island off Brazil so abundant in marine life that you can barely get into the water without standing on it. A true slice of heaven: The Fernando de Noronha islands are Brazil at its most picturesque . Noronha is just one of the attractions in the Brazilian state of Pernambuco, a small region on the Atlantic coast in the north-east of the country. One of the first areas to be settled by the Portuguese in the 16th Century, the region is characterised by colonial buildings, multicultural cuisine and an ever-present carnival soundtrack. I quickly discover Olinda, the elegant Unesco-listed colonial town set high on a hill, five miles up the coast from Recife, the state capital. Its 22 opulent churches and 11 chapels emerge from a verdant froth of palm and banana trees. I saunter up steep cobbled streets lined with pastel-painted art galleries and workshops, and spend the sultry evenings sipping drinks in arty bars lit by candles. The road between Olinda and Recife is dotted with crumbling sugar mills. The 16th Century sugar trade founded both cities, though by the end of the 17th Century Recife had become the biggest, most important city in South America. These days, information technology drives its economy - and its regeneration. Over the past two years, hip bars, waterfront galleries and trendy restaurants have sprung up. With streets of gracious latte-tinted buildings set with Italianate columns and Moorish domes, the grand old Bank of London and Rua Bom Jesus with the oldest synagogue in the Americas, the place oozes history and charm. But Pernambuco is prized by all Brazilians for one thing. When I tell a Brazilian friend I'm going to Fernando de Noronha, she shrieks with excitement: 'You are not going to Brazil,' she trills. 'You are going to Heaven.' Colourful chaos: Olinda, in Pernambuco, is listed as a Unesco World Heritage Site . Brazil has some heavenly beaches, many of them in and around Recife. I stayed in Recife's Boa Viagem district - three miles of pure gold sand so magnificent that the sight of it whisked the fuzz from my jet-lagged brain like a cerebral bikini wax. Forty-five miles down the coast, past Porto de Galinhas, where tropical fish dip and dazzle in natural reef pools close to the palm-shaded shore, the powdery white beaches of Maracaipe are fringed by coconut plantations, and mangrove lagoons in which seahorses bob. But even these, say the guide books, are eclipsed by the beaches of Noronha - which is incredible as this tiny island is only six miles long and two miles across. Its pristine beaches and crystal-clear, marinerich waters are so popular that visitors to this Unesco-listed National Marine Park are limited to 500 a day (and they are charged an eco-tax). After an hour's flight from Recife, I spend three days discovering Noronha's 17 beaches. To the south, Lion Beach has the wow-factor. A huge fan of golden sand blasted by wind straight off the Atlantic, this is one of the most important turtle hatching sites in Brazil. The Bay of Pigs in the north is even more magical: I sit on pillow-soft sand watching huge seabirds soar on the thermals, then plunge into the rolling surf. A short clamber over volcanic rocks and I emerge into Sancho Bay. Framed by cliffs, the rockpool-dimpled beach is so impossibly pretty, overlooking waters so impossibly blue, it's hard to believe it is real. Even harder to believe is the view from the next headland, Mirante dos Golfinhos: multiple pods of spinner dolphins leap from the sea, light flashing from their slick bodies like disco balls. But nothing comes close to wading into the calm waters of Southeast Bay, wearing flippers, snorkel and mask. And not just because I nearly tread on a shark. The shore quickly falls away, and within moments I am swimming over coral reef. Friendly faces: Visitors are assured a warm welcome, whether it is during Olinda's famous spring Carnival (left), or from the lemon sharks Jennifer encountered in the warm waters around Fernando de Noronha (right) The water in this part of the Atlantic is 78C, with visibility up to 165ft. I have to force myself not to laugh with pleasure as, through a colourful curtain of tropical fish, I spot a huge octopus puffing along the ocean floor. Then a giant turtle appears just feet away.

"Soldiers baton-charged demonstrators in Cairo's Tahrir Square today just 24 hours after street clashes killed eight people and wounded more than 300. Protesters fled into side streets to escape the troops in riot gear, who grabbed people and battered them repeatedly even after they had been beaten to the ground. The violence - witnessed by a Reuters journalist -  marred the first free election most Egyptians can remember and highlighted the tensions in Egypt 10 months after a popular revolt toppled President Hosni Mubarak.

Shots were fired in the air and television footage showed soldiers pulling down protester tents and setting them on fire. The army assault followed skirmishes between protesters some of them had been throwing stones near fire brigade vehicles trying to douse a burning building. Army-appointed prime minister, Kamal al-Ganzouri, blamed the violence on the crowds, accusing them of attacking the cabinet and parliament buildings which had to be defended by security forces. He confirmed the death and injury toll in which one of those killed was a respected Muslim religious scholar, Emad Effat. Ganzouri claimed 30 security guards were injured and 18 people had gunshot wounds, as soldiers tried to end the three-week sit-in outside the parliament building.

Witnesses . accused military police of snatching the man and . beating him inside parliament, near Cabinet headquarters.

"The Russian web was ablaze with bizarre theories today at an extraordinary explosion seen by thousands of commuters in St Petersburg. It must have seemed like the end of the world was nigh when motorists driving along this busy motorway saw a huge flash light up the night sky on the horizon. So far, conspiracy theories of martians and bomb-testing have emerged to explain the astonishing sight. However, the reality was far less exciting. Scroll down for video . The calm before the electric storm: Unsuspecting motorists were driving along this motorway when the huge flash appeared on the horizon in front of them . Lit-up: This motorist's enjoyment of John Lennon came to an abrupt end when the huge flash appeared in front of them . Bright: Some of the conspiracy theories which have surfaced online in Russia claim the flash is the result of bomb-testing or martians . The flash was the result of an . explosion at an electrical power plant in St Petersburg, in what was . described as a 'technical malfunction' by officials. No one was hurt in . the incident. The amazing footage was recorded by one driver listening to John Lennon as he was stuck in a traffic jam. Footage has gone viral on YouTube and other blogs and social networking site, attracting a flurry of online theories from conspiracists. 'It's . the Martians landing,' said one comment, while several others also . suggested a spaceship had landed on Russia's second city and former . Imperial capital. Another commenter added: 'I know precisely what this is - tests of a neutron bomb in St Petersburg.' 'It's Vladimir Putin's new bomb - watch out,'  was another version, which brought a reply: 'We didn't have such a thing under Stalin.' One claim was that it was 'a test of after-election therapy for the people'. Different angle: The explosion was also captured on camera from another viewpoint - and a plume of smoke is seen rising from the power plant on the horizon . Armageddon? The shocking sight has been met with suspicion and hysteria in Russia, with footage of the explosion going viral online . Explanation? The Russian authorities said the flash was caused by 'technical malfunctioning' which led to a temporary blackout . Russians go to the polls to choose a . new President on March 4 following widespread complaints of ballot . rigging by the party of favourite Putin in the December parliamentary . elections. In fact the explanation was more mundane. The dramatic light show came from the latest explosion of an electricity substation in St Petersburg. Officials blamed a 'technical malfunction' for the spectacular display without further explanations of what went wrong. The breakdown of  small feeder power stations is by no means unusual in the former USSR, often plunging entire districts into darkness.

"A brave Abigail Hernandez today faced her alleged kidnapper with a surprise appearance in court  to see him held on $1million bail. Abigail arrived with her mother Zenya and sister Sarah and looked pale and drawn as she took her place on the front bench. It was her first public appearance since returning home last week after going missing nine months. The suspect Nathaniel Kibby, 34, walked into court flanked by his publicly provided legal team, wearing an orange jumpsuit and requested financial legal aid. Details of what led authorities to arrest Kibby were not released in Conway Circuit Court today, but a law enforcement source earlier revealed the suspicion that Abigail was held hostage in a shipping container on Kibby's property. Scroll down for video . Courage: Abigail Hernandez (pictured in black tank top and white hoodie on the left) sat in the front row of court today as her alleged abductor was arraigned on felony kidnapping charges .

Following Kibby's Monday arrest, investigators have surrounded a shipping container on his property in crime scene tape . Abigail's presence in court today, . sitting just steps away from Kibby, came as a surprise since family . friends told NBC News that she wouldn't show. As soon as the hearing finished the Hernandez family rushed from the court. Following . the hearing, Assistant Attorney General Jane Young held a press . conference where she said Abby has a 'level of strength that I'm not . sure many of us have'. During . the hearing, Young asked to have the case files sealed for 10 days . while they continue to search Kibby's home  in the course of the . investigation. At the press conference, Young added that they are not . currently investigating any other suspects. Kibby . is due back in court on August 12 for a probable cause hearing, at . which point more details of Abigail's disappearance may be revealed, . Young said. Confrontation: Abigail pictured walking into court Tuesday before Kibby was arraigned . Surprise: Abigail was not expected to attend Tuesday's hearing . Not alone: Abigail was supported in court today by her mother Zenya (far left), her sister Sarah and others. Above, Abigail walks into court with her legion of supporters . Before the hearing, Zenya looked . incredibly animated and upset, sitting next to her two daughters and . supporters Amanda Smith and Paul Kirsch. She . could be seen arguing with an officer, believed to be a member of the . FBI. Paul, who helped run the Find Abby webpage, had to talk to her to . calm her down. A line of State Troopers, FBI Agents and police officers . protectively sat behind the family. The . arrest yesterday of the 15-year-old's alleged abductor has only left . more questions in her mysterious nine-month disappearance, and surprise . return home. While little has been publicly said about what led to Kibby's arrest, a law enforcement source told NECN . that they believe he kept Abigail hostage in an orange shipping . container at the back of his property, located 30 miles north of her . hometown of Conway where she reappeared last week. That shipping container is now surrounded by crime scene tape and neighbors have described the large storage box to WMUR as an 'above-ground bunker' that they believed was soundproof. Mystery man: Kibby (left) is due back in court for a probable cuase hearing on August 12. Authorities have revealed little on what led them to arrest Kibby for kidnapping Abigail (right) in October . Hearing: Kibby pictured being escorted to his arraignment at Conway District Court on Tuesday . Controlled: Kibby kept his head down as he walked into court and found his seat on Tuesday . Many of Kibby's neighbors have . described him as 'scary' but still said there was no indication he was . hiding a teenage girl on his property. Neighbor Michelle Smith says she hopes the shipping container wasn't used to hold Abigail hostage. 'I would hope not,' she told WMUR. 'I would hope that she can't be that close and nobody knew it.' But those who lived close to Kibby were also wary. 'He's . been called crazy Nate. I don't know too much about him, he's pretty . much a loner. But I always told the girls stay away from that trailer,' neighbor Debbie Demers told NECN. 'He likes his guns and it was a little shooting range back there,' she added. Kibby . was arrested Monday afternoon at his home and charged with the felony . kidnapping of Abigail 'with purpose to commit an offense against her.' Strong: Assistant Attorney General Jane Young held a press conference after the arraignment Tuesday and said Abby has a 'level of strength that I'm not sure many of us have' Distance: Abigail Hernandez returned home to Conway, New Hampshire last week after going missing for nine months. Her alleged abductor was arrested at his home 30 miles north in Gorham . Tuesday's court appearance will be one of many Kibby has had in the past few months while Abigail has been missing. On . October 22, just 13 days after Abigail went missing walking home from . Kennett High School, Kibby was charged with marijuana possession in her . hometown of North Conway. He plead guilty to the charge in court in . December and settled it by paying $434.  It was also revealed that Kibby attended Kennett in the 90s and had a prior address in North Conway during those years. And just last week, three days after Abigail showed up at home, Kibby was found guilty of criminal trespass. The . sentence and fine in the trespassing case was suspended for one year, . as a judge ordered Kibby to stay away from his victims. 'When . I heard it on the news, I was beside myself,' Tammy Shackford, a victim . in the trespassing case, told WMUR. 'He is not a normal person. He is . not right.' Upset: Before the hearing, Abigail's mother Zenya (left) was incredibly animated and upset and even appeared to be arguing with a police officer. Above, she speaks with Assistant Attorney General Jane Young . Lost and found: A missing person poster of Abigail Hernandez displayed in a storefront window in North Conway, New Hampshire, shows Hernandez has been found . According to a letter Kibby wrote the Sheriff's office, the trespassing case was in connection to a fight he got into after a car accident with a man identified as Eric Ray. The argument allegedly turned violent when Kibby shoved Ray's wife Tammy, but he told authorities that Ray was exaggerating the incident. 'I considered informing (Eric Ray) I was armed with a carry pistol, but decided against it. I tried to sympathize with his anger and felt it was best to turn the cheek,' Kibby wrote. The charges during Abigail's disappearance are just a few in Kibby's lengthy criminal history, that is centered mostly on his teen years. When he was 17, Kibby was charged in five criminal trespassing cases, with two counts of receiving stolen property, providing false information to purchase a firearm and theft.

Hernandez family friend Paul Kirsch was with Abby and her mother Zenya when news broke of Kibby's arrest. He said he wasn't sure whether Abby knew Kibby, but is glad the family is finally getting some good news. 'The . family can kind of get some closure. They thought they could get it . when Abby came back. Then questions started. Now, they can get closure,' Kirsch said. 'The family is overwhelmed with support, and they are . exhausted and frankly breathing for the first time in nine months. … . This is one of the best days I can think of. Now they get to be the . Hernandez family again.' Abigail made headlines last October 9 - . just days before her 15th birthday -  when she unexpectedly disappeared . after last seen by her boyfriend walking home from school. Clues: Last week police released video of Abby on the day she . disappeared, left, and a sketch of a man they believe drove her away in a . blue pick-up . The . only contact she had with any friends or family was a letter believed . to have been sent by the schoolgirl to her divorced parents, Zenya and . Ruben Hernandez, in the weeks after her disappearance. Then on July 20, she suddenly reappeared. Kibby's . arrest came just hours after Hernandez's mother gave an interview on . Monday, to speak out against rumors surrounding her daughter's . disappearance. In an interview with the Today show, mother Zenya Hernandez shut down speculation that her daughter ran away because she was pregnant. 'She did not run away': Zenya Hernandez spoke with the Today show on Monday to dispell rumors her daughter ran away nine months ago because she was pregnant. Mrs Hernandez says she believes her daughter was abducted . 'The . majority of people somehow believe that she was pregnant. She was not. She did not run away. I firmly believe that,' Mrs Hernandez said, adding . that she does not believe her daughter knew her alleged abductor. On Saturday, police released a sketch of . the man believed to have abducted Abigail, according to the teen's . descriptions. Despite conducting a three-hour . interview with the teen, it is unclear whether they know where she was . or if she was taken by force. ‘Our biggest challenge is, we’re . dealing with incomplete information,’ Kieran Ramsey, assistant special . agent in charge of the Boston Division of the FBI told The Boston Globe. ‘The . victim in this case is a 15-year-old girl. It’s not as cut and dried as . people think that somebody can exactly recount what happened, when, and . where.’ They . have also appealed for witnesses who may have seen Abby return after . she was apparently dropped off on the same road that she was possibly . abducted from all those months ago. Sources . close to the investigation said the teenager has so far not been able . to tell officers many facts about her disappearance. But . they are convinced a crime has been committed - as they believe there . is no way the 15-year-old could have stayed hidden for nine months . without some kind of adult involvement.","Nathaniel Kibby, 34, made his first court appearance Tuesday after his MOnday arrest for kidnappying 15-year-old Abigail Hernandez in October .

"Brazen: Lisa Marie Grant, 34, has been jailed for mooning at a school bus full of children . A mother of a middle school student has been jailed for one month after mooning and flashing one of her breasts at the boy's bus driver, telling the employee to 'kiss my white butt'. Lisa Marie Grant, 34,  was sentenced to six months in jail with all but one month suspended and fined $250 for  disorderly conduct for the bizarre incident, which unfolded in Suffolk, Virginia last year. Her bold performance, which was also witnessed by a bus full of children, came after she went to the stop with her son and four-year-old daughter to speak with the driver, Melba Osborne, about how her son was being disciplined. Osborne had sent a letter home with a conduct notice after the boy had been hitting other students and switching seats during the journeys, WTKR reported. But when Grant arrived at the bus stop, Osborne did not allow her to board the bus and would only address her through a window, the arrest warrant said. 'I was just shocked. I didn't want her to get on the bus. She was acting wild,' Osborne told WTKR. Speaking out: The driver, Melba Osborne (left), refused to allow the women on the bus to speak about her son's discipline issues so Grant (right) pulled down her trousers. Grant denied that she showed skin . Grant 'became very irate and began . cursing' before blocking the path of the bus and spreading her arms, the warrant said. 'She turned around, pulled her pants down, her underclothes down, bent over and told me to kiss her behind,' Osborne said. Grant agreed with some of this account, telling the news channel: 'I told her to kiss my white butt. I never not once mooned. I never not once shower her any body part, apart from my dress.' The arrest warrant stated Grant exposed her buttocks and one breast. Inappropriate: The bus in Suffolk, Virginia was filled with around 45 children at the time of the incident . The woman's children, who were standing holding hands beside the bus, witnessed the incident. 'It was totally inappropriate,' Osborne said. 'What . parent would stand there and pull their pants and panties down with . their 14-year-old child standing beside them? It was ridiculous.' Grant's son no longer rides the bus and his mother drives him instead. A General District Court judge also found Grant not guilty of an indecent exposure charge on Tuesday.",Lisa Marie Grant told the driver 'to kiss my white butt'
"Luis Suarez chipped in with a cheeky assist as Barcelona beat Espanyol in the Catalan Super Cup thanks to a penalty shootout, but is still searching for his first goal in Spain. The former Liverpool striker started the game in the centre of the attack but buzzed around the front in his usual waspish fashion, setting up the opener for Gerard Pique. Barely 15 minutes had passed when the ball reached Suarez on the left-hand side of the box. He eyed up the target but instead of pulling the trigger, scooped the ball up to the back post where Pique had roamed forward, and the defender headed home. Luis Suarez twists and turns inside the area, before looking like he was about to shoot past the Espanyol goalkeeper . But instead the Uruguayan lofted a beautiful ball over the goalkeeper and defender Gerard Pique to run on to and score . Pique heads home easily from inside the six-yard box to give Barcelona the lead early on, but they couldn't hold it . Barcelona: Masip, Adriano (Grimaldo 73), Pique (Ie 46), Bartra, Alba (Alba 46), Samper (Halilovic 75), Sergi Roberto (Xavi 61), Rafinha (Rakitic 61), Munir, Suarez (Adama 46), Pedro (Sandro 46). Sub not used: Ter Stegen. Goal: Pique 16. Booked: Adama. Espanyol: Pau, Mattioni (Victor Sanchez 46), Raul Rodriguez, Victor Alvarez (Joan Jordan 46), Salva Sevilla (Abraham 46), Alex (Luque 46), Clerc (Duarte 46), Arbilla, Jairo, Bailly, Pol Llonch (Mamadou 46). Subs not used: German, Alvaro, Hector R. Goal: Arbilla 51. Booked: Raul Rodriguez. Att: 5,110. Penalty shoot-out: . Barcelona scored: Xavi, Halilovic, Grimaldo, Rakitic. Barcelona missed: Sandro. Espanyol scored: Victor Sanchez, Jordan. Espanyol missed: Arbilla, Abraham. Luis Enrique’s side, a blend of first-teamers and youth players, were largely in control but a brilliant Anaitz Arbilla free-kick pegged them back and in the end they had to rely on a spot-kick triumph. This was not the triumphant bounce-back rout they were hoping for after a humiliating defeat by Real Madrid in El Clasico last weekend. The Catalan Super Cup has a long history, but this is the first time it has been contested in this format. Usually there is a knock-out tournament including some of the smaller sides, but fixture congestion means that it has been converted into a one-off final between the two La Liga sides from Catalonia. In the eighth minute Suarez should have scored his first Barcelona goal when the ball was cleverly crossed in to him near the penalty spot by Sergi Roberto. The Uruguayan headed towards Pau Lopez’s net, but could not generate enough power to beat the young goalkeeper, who still had to make a smart save. Suarez turned his hand to creating instead, which he proved pretty good at on Saturday in the Santiago Bernabeu. The forward turned in the area and dinked the ball up for Pique to nod into an empty net after 16 minutes. Those two players turned in completely different performances during the 3-1 defeat by Real Madrid. Pique conceded a penalty, which was the nadir of a terrible display, while Suarez was lively and didn't look like he'd spent the previous four months frozen out of action. There were some concerns that adding another huge name to Barcelona's collection of attacking talent might not work, that Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar would be too selfish a front line. But Suarez set up Neymar's goal against Madrid and also put one on a plate for Messi, who astonishingly missed. He drove into the box after 22 minutes but was blocked off as he tried to move towards goal, and also fired a free-kick over the bar as he searched for his first goal in a Blaugrana first-team shirt. Suarez had previously notched two in a friendly for Barcelona B against Indonesia U19s. Adriano had a low drive well fielded by Pau, the Brazilian starting in place of his rested compatriot Dani Alves at right-back. Martin Montoya was on the bench and is clearly not in the good books of Asturian manager  Enrique. He didn't do much to help proceedings after being brought on at half-time and conceding a free-kick on the edge of the box. Arbilla - the player who Gareth Bale made cry last season while the defender played for Rayo Vallecano - stepped up and arrowed it into the top corner. Espanyol had created nothing at all prior to their goal, bar one chance on the 40 minute mark, when Victor Alvarez broke free of Marc Bartra and Gerard Pique. The defenders looked unsure of their positions but goalkeeper Jordi Masip acted with considerably more conviction, coming out of his goal to deny the striker. Pique (left) celebrates with Marc Barta as Suarez (right) comes to congratulate the Spanish defender in Girona . Suarez now has two assists in two games for Barcelona, after making his debut against Real Madrid on Saturday . Barcelona tried to get back in front and introduced Xavi  and Ivan Rakitic to patrol the midfield – and both ended up converting in the shootout. They nearly worked an opening for starlet Munir El Haddadi, but he fell short as he stretched to try and poke home from close range. The youngster started the season in sensational form but recently has fallen behind fellow youngster Sandro Ramirez, who looks a burlier and more physically adept presence as part of the forward line. The likelihood is now that both of them will be spending more time with the B team, as Suarez beds in up top with Neymar and Messi. Masip earned his corn towards the end, with an excellent one-handed stop to prevent Espanyol netting a late winner, while at the other end Rakitic hit a drive which was milimetres wide of the top left corner, almost preventing penalties. And of Suarez, who was taken off at half time? His attention has already turned away from this game at Girona’s minute Estadi Montilivi and to the Nou Camp, where this coming Saturday he hopes to finally open his Barcelona account against Celta Vigo.

"An animal lover has saved the life of his pet fish with emergency first aid after its tank was smashed by a burglar. Brian Craze, 52, discovered the rare tropical fish barely alive in less than an inch of water following the break-in at his home in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. He started to gently massage his beloved pet's body, before lowering it into another tank. Saved: Brian Craze saved the life of this tropical fish with first aid after its tank was smashed by a burglar . Alive: Mr Craze discovered the fish barely alive in less than an inch of water following the break-in at his home, and started to massage the animal's body before lowering it into another tank . Broken: Fifty other fish died when burglar Jason Hibberd, 34, smashed Mr Craze's £2,500 tank (pictured) The Clown Loach, worth £40, initially floated on the surface of the water, but a minute later, it suddenly flipped its tail and started to swim. Fifty other fish died when Mr Craze's £2,500 tank was smashed by burglar Jason Hibberd. Mr Craze, who has collected tropical fish for more than 30 years, said he was 'shocked' to find one of his precious pets still alive. “I thought they were all dead but I could see one of the fish was just barely breathing,' he said. Recovery: After Mr Craze's first aid attempt, the Clown Loach (pictured in a new tank) initially floated on the surface of the water, but after a minute, it suddenly flipped its tail and started to swim . Aftermath: The chaos and destruction caused by Hibberd during his wrecking spree . Chaos: During the break-in, 34-year-old Hibberd broke two television (right) and slashed items of furniture (left) 'I gently picked it up and gave it some first aid by massaging its body. 'I then put it in another tank and it started to sink to the bottom so I thought he’d had it like the rest of them. 'But after a few minutes, it started to get enough oxygen from the water and it came back to life.' During the break-in, Hibberd, 34, broke two televisions, smashed a window and slashed items of furniture. Mess: Hibberd, who has an extensive criminal record, admitted burglary after being caught on Mr Craze's CCTV . Boarded up: Mr Craze believes the burglary was a personal attack on him out of spite .

Speaking outside court, Mr Craze added: 'All I was left with was the clothes I stood up in and just one fish. I know who did this and I believe it was a personal attack on me.' Hibberd, who has an extensive criminal record, admitted burglary after being caught on Mr Craze's CCTV. Sentencing him to seven years in jail, Judge Patrick Curran QC told him: 'You destroyed a tropical fish tank purely out of a sense of spite and vandalism.

"A waitress-turned-journalist has revealed her hellish tale of 15 months being held hostage by Somali terrorists where captors gang-raped her and played Russian roulette with an assault rifle. Amanda Lindhout naively flew to the impoverished and volatile nation in 2007 at the age of 24 after convincing an ex-boyfriend to come along on the dangerous jaunt. Miss Lindhout and Nigel Brennan, a 36-year-old Australian photographer, were kidnapped on their third day in the country. Scroll down for video . Naive: Aspiring journalist Amanda Lindhout (left) and photographer Nigel Brennan (right) were taken hostage in Somalia in 2007 . Survival: Amanda Lindhout and Nigel Brennan smile in November 2009 after being freed following 15 months in captivity . A Somali journalist, Abdifatah Mohammed Elmi, who was working as their interpreter, was also kidnapped, but released after several months. The couple's ensuing 15 months in captivity are described in all their horrific detail in Lindhout's memoir, A House in the Sky, out next week, according to the New York Post. Brennan had no experience of war zones and Lindhout has spent little time in Iraq where she had been taken hostage once before. In Mogadishu, she horrified veteran journalists with her bravado and naivety with one Robert Draper emailing his girlfriend: 'She’s going to get herself or someone else killed.' Somalia, which has lacked an effective central government for 18 years, is a dangerous place for foreign aid workers and journalists as they risk being kidnapped and held by gunmen until a ransom is paid. The Western-backed administration of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud is battling al Shabaab and other rebel groups, and controls little more than a few blocks of the capital. Book deal: A House In The Sky by Amanda Lindhout & Sara Corbett is out this week . Lindhout and Brennan were taken hostage after terrorists stalked their hotel and the pair were set up by their fixer. They were kidnapped on August 23, 2008 as they went to visit a refugee camp outside the capital. They are told that $3million in ransom money is wanted for them both. The conditions quickly became brutal as they were beaten and starved and Lindhout repeatedly gang-raped. Fearing that they may be killed, the pair decide that their chance of survival will improve if they convert to Islam. They are immediately put in separate rooms where the torture continues. Mr Brennan is helpless as he hears Lindhout being raped through the thin walls of their prison. One captor puts his assault rifle to her head and plays Russian roulette, the Post reported. They are constantly moved to different houses that they give different names. The couple lived in constant fear . that they would be handed over to hardline rebels al Shabaab, which . Washington claims are al Qaeda's proxy in Somalia. Lindhout develops a fungal infection on her face, her hair and toenails fall out while Brennan suffers dysentery. After 100 nights, Lindhout is taken alone out into the desert. She is told to kneel and has her head snapped back with a yank of her hair, a knife pushed against her throat. She begs for her life and is given a cell phone to call her mother and plead for a million dollars or she would be killed. She writes, according to the Post: 'I sobbed in the dirt, sounding like an animal, like something wounded and incapable of speech.' To watch more go to Charlaton.ca . Volatile nation: Somali is deperately poor and ravaged by terrorists, leaving the country so dangerous that even seasoned journalists fear to tread . The desperate pair hatch an escape plan after Lindhout was driven to the desert alone one night and forced to beg for her life in the dirt. They break through a bathroom window and jump 12 feet to the ground and run screaming into a local mosque for help. The terrified locals are unable to save the pair from their captors who are close behind, the deadliest hostage-taker wielding an assault rifle. One man at the mosque attempts to arm Brennan with a gun but he cannot bring himself to fire. A woman hugs Lindhout close. The hostages are beaten before taking them to a house where the rooms are no more than pitch-black cells and ridden with rats. They were pistol-whipped and locked in chains after their escape attempt. Finally, they were freed in November 2009 after 460 days in captivity after their families scraped together thousands of dollars and begged for their lives. Shortly after her release, she said: 'I was beaten and I was tortured. It was an extremely, extremely difficult situation.' Brennan published a memoir the Price of a Life in 2011 while Lindhout's book is available this week. The former couple no longer speak. She has also set up a foundation the Global Enrichment Foundation which helps women in Kenya and Somalia.

"Carlo Ancelotti says Luis Suarez is a 'fantastic' player and refused to rule out a move for Liverpool's star striker this summer. Real Madrid have been linked with a big-money move for the Uruguay hitman and Ancelotti says that Madrid will wait until after the World Cup to do any prospective business. Karim Benzema impressed this season for Madrid but there is a clamour in Spain's capital for Real to improve by purchasing the 27-year-old Premier League Golden Boot winner. Admired: Luis Suarez has been described as a 'fantastic' player by Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti . Laid-back: Real Madrid boss Ancelotti admitted the club are in no rush to sign players this summer . 'It is difficult to improve what we have,' said Ancelotti. 'Luis Suarez is a fantastic player, but it is disrespectful to talk about a transfer now.' He added: 'We're in no rush and we don't need to bring in a lot of players. We have until August 31.' Suarez has been a long-term target for Real Madrid but the Champions League winners would have to dig deep to afford the Liverpool forward. A figure of around £72million has been touted for the 'galactico' whom Florentino Perez wants to bestow upon Ancelotti, to help Madrid improve on last season's third-place La Liga finish. Suarez agitated for a move last summer but eventually agreed to stay at Liverpool and helped them come close to the Premier League title. Star man: Suarez scored 31 Premier League goals for Liverpool as the Reds finished second last season . Meanwhile, the Italian, speaking at the presentation of his new website, gave Arsenal good and bad news about two of their summer transfer targets. Ancelotti says that goalkeeper Iker Casillas wants to stay at the club but striker Alvaro Morata will be allowed to leave. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger wants to add both Spaniards to Arsenal's squad. After Lukasz Fabianski signed for Swansea on a four-year deal, the only first-team goalkeeper left at the Emirates is Wojciech Szczesny. Wenger hoped to persuade Casillas, who was only selected in cup competitions for Madrid last season with Diego Lopez preferred in La Liga, to switch to north London. The good news or the bad news? Ancelotti revealed Arsenal target Iker Casillas wants to stay at Real while striker Alvaro Morata will be allowed to leave . But Ancelotti said: 'Casillas is very happy to stay here and we are very happy that he wants to stay.'When asked about who would be first choice next season Ancelotti said he had not made up his mind. 'We have not thought about this after the victory [in the Champions League final] because everybody went on holiday.' On Morata though, the signs are positive for Arsenal. Ancelotti explained: 'The player wants to look for an opportunity where he can play more and the club agrees with this. 'If he leaves it would be good that he would have the chance to play. If Morata goes we have to think about getting a young forward with the same characteristics.'","Real Madrid boss Ancelotti refuses to rule out move for Suarez .

"Suicide bombers have freed hundreds of terrorists during a full-frontal assault on Iraq's top-security Abu Ghraib prison. Gunmen attacked guards with mortar fire as well as rocket propelled grenades while terrorists drove cars packed with explosives at the fortified gates during an attack which left ten policemen dead. Some of al Qaeda's most senior members were among the 500 inmates thought to have escaped before authorities regained control of the infamous prison on the outskirts of Baghdad in the early hours of Monday morning. Maximum security: Abu Ghraib prison, pictured in 2009 following a renovation, was home to some of the world's most dangerous terrorists. (File photo) The deadly raid on the high-security jail happened as Sunni Muslim militants are re-gaining momentum in their insurgency against the Shi'ite-led government that came to power after the U.S. invasion to oust Saddam Hussein. The raid began on Sunday night when suicide bombers attacked the gates with trucks loads with bombs and blasted their way into the compound. Other militants took up positions near the main road, fighting off security reinforcements sent from Baghdad as several militants wearing suicide vests entered the prison on foot to help free the inmates. Attacked: As many as 500 inmates - including senior al Qaeda members - are thought to have escaped after terrorists launched a military assault on Abu Ghraib prison. (File photo) Ten policemen and four militants were killed in the ensuing clashes, which continued until Monday morning, when military helicopters arrived and brought the assault to an end. By that time, hundreds of inmates had succeeded in fleeing Abu Ghraib, the prison made notorious a decade ago by photographs showing abuse of prisoners by U.S. soldiers. 'The number of escaped inmates has reached 500, most of them were convicted senior members of al Qaeda and had received death sentences,' Hakim Al-Zamili, a senior member of the security and defence committee in parliament, told Reuters. Caged: Iraqi detainees wait to be released at Abu Ghraib prison, west of Baghdad in Iraq - which was the scene of a mass jailbreak by al Qaeda terrorists this morning. (File photo) 'The security forces arrested some of them, but the rest are still free.' One security official told Reuters on condition of anonymity: 'It's obviously a terrorist attack carried out by al Qaeda to free convicted terrorists with al Qaeda.' A simultaneous attack on another prison, in Taji, around 20 km (12 miles) north of Baghdad, followed a similar pattern, but guards managed to prevent any inmates escaping. Sixteen soldiers and six militants were killed. Sunni insurgents, including the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq, have been regaining strength in recent months and striking on an almost daily basis against Shi'ite Muslims and security forces amongst other targets. Infamous: An Iraqi prisoner reads the Quran before his release at Abu Ghraib prison, west of Baghdad, Iraq, which has become infamous after details of the torture of detainees at the hands of U.S. guards emerged. (File photo) Torture: Abu Ghraib was made notorious a decade ago by photographs showing abuse of prisoners by U.S. soldiers . The violence has raised fears of a return to full-blown conflict in a country where Kurds, Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims have yet to find a stable way of sharing power. In the northern city of Mosul, 390 km (240 miles) north of Baghdad, a suicide bomber detonated a vehicle packed with explosives behind a military convoy in the eastern Kokchali district, killing at least 22 soldiers and three passers-by, police said. Suicide bombings are the hallmark of al Qaeda, which has been regrouping in Mosul, Iraq's third-largest city and capital of the Sunni-dominated Nineveh province. A separate attack in western Mosul killed four policemen, police said. Relations between Islam's two main denominations have been put under further strain from the civil war in Syria, which has drawn in Shi'ite and Sunni fighters from Iraq and beyond to fight against each other. Recent attacks have targeted mosques, amateur football matches, shopping areas and cafes where people gather to socialise after breaking their daily fast for the holy Muslim month of Ramadan. Nearly 600 people have been killed in militant attacks across Iraq so far this month, according to violence monitoring group Iraq Body Count. That is still well below the height of bloodletting in 2006-07, when the monthly death toll sometimes exceeded 3,000.","Suicide bombers blast through high-security gates .

"It first appeared on the streets of Ireland as Pope John II navigated his way through crowds of thousands of adoring Catholics during the first ever papal visit to the country. But the Popemobile that was used to transport the leader of the Catholic Church during the historic visit is set to assume a slightly less spiritual existence - as a venue for stag parties and hen nights. The 15-seater converted Ford Transit will now be available for hire to the public at a cost of €300-per-hour (£242) plus VAT. Back on the road: The Popemobile, above, used to transport Pope John Paul II on his landmark visit to Ireland is now available for hire. Its owners, Dublin Wax Museum, said it can be used for stag parties and hen nights . The vehicle, which still contains the original 'Pope's chair', is owned by the Dublin Wax Museum, having sat idle for more than 30 years. Businessman Paddy Dunning acquired the vehicle when he took over the museum from politician Donnie Cassidy. A promotional pack for the vehicle's relaunch advertises 'hen and stag [nights]' and 'photo calls', as among its new uses. The vehicle, which maintains its yellow and white papal facade, will also be used for corporate events. Addressing the masses: The converted Ford Transit, above, was used by Pope John Paul II as he appeared before millions of people on his historic visit to Ireland in 1979 . It has been given a €60,000 makeover, including the addition of a Mercedes chassis. A platform built  at the front of the vehicle so that the pontiff could address onlooking crowds also remains. Despite the rowdier crowd who might be gearing up to use the vehicle, Mr Dunning said that the museum would be 'selective about who we rent it out to'. He also told the Irish Times that he wanted to rebrand the vehicle as a 'hopemobile'. He said: 'I’d like to get a sponsor on board and take it around the country as a ‘hopemobile’.' 'We’d . like to go around the 32 counties and build a collection of stories of . local heroes, either business people or local community achievers.' Pontiff: Pope John Paul II waving to the crowds at Galway Racecourse during the 1979 visit . The businessman revealed that the vehicle is still cherished by Catholics, saying that a group of nuns from Rome visited the Popemobile when it was being kept at his mother's house during renovation. The Popemobile was built by Ford in Cork before John Paul II's visit in 1979. During the visit the Polish Pope addressed around one million people in Dublin's Phoenix Park and called for an end to political violence in the country.

"Media personality Mia Freedman has apologised after coming under fire for comparing gay people to paedophiles on live television, saying she 'made the wrong call.' In a public statement on her MamaMia Blog, Freedman said she is devastated to have accidentally given 'ammunition to haters and bigots' by causing the words homosexuality and paedophilia to appear in the same headlines. 'Let me be absolutely clear: I unreservedly apologise to anyone I have upset, confused or outraged and to anyone who thought I would ever ever ever stand with bigotry or homophobia,' she said. Freedman was lashed on social media for the comments she made on Channel Ten's The Project on Thursday night when talking about the idea of a national paedophile register. 'We accept that gay people can't change who they love and they're sexually attracted to, so why do we think that people who are sexually attracted to children can be rehabilitated?' she said on air. In her statement today, Freedman said she should have known better. 'It’s dangerous to try and make a complex point about such an important topic in 10 seconds,' she said. 'You run a huge risk of your words being twisted, taken out of context and fed to the enemies of your cause.' Scroll down for video .

'I should have known better': Mia Freedman says she made the 'wrong call' after being criticised for her comments linking gays with paedophiles on Channel Ten's The Project this week. On Thursday night's program, Freedman had gone on to say she agreed with the introduction of a register. 'Name and shame them. I want know where they are,' she said. Freedman said today that she was trying to raise a point about society's capacity to rehabilitate sex offenders. 'I chose a bad example to try and do so,' she said. 'The point I was trying to make was this: . 'Sexual orientation is real; it cannot be ""cured"" or ""changed"". We reject the idea that gay people chose to be gay. We reject the idea that straight people choose to be straight. As a society we have come to accept the intractability of sexual orientation. 'So why do we assume that people who have sexual feelings towards children can be ‘cured’ or have those feelings changed with therapy?' Freedman said many people have asked why she did not use heterosexuality as a comparison instead of homosexuality. 'So why didn’t I? I could have – and in hindsight I really, really wish I had,' she said. Freedman, who is a regular guest on The Project, took to Twitter immediately to apologise for the 'lousy analogy.' 'Apologies if it came across wrong,' the journalist tweeted. 'Mortified that I may have caused offence to some in the gay community who misunderstood my clumsily worded point in chat on @theprojecttv.'

"Trouble: David Lea played extremely loud music at all hours of the day and night and has been evicted . A man who terrorised his neighbours and made life a misery for many in his street has been evicted by a city council. Since David Lea, 45, moved into his flat on Mary Carpenter Place, Bristol, in 2011, the council has received numerous complaints. Dubbing himself Dave 'Techno' Lea, he played extremely loud music at all hours of the day and night and on one occasion his tunes blared out for two whole days. Bristol City Council said Lea used to have 'hundreds' of visitors calling at all hours and had no regard for other residents’ peace and quiet. Bristol County Court heard Lea racially abused a woman neighbour and members of the multi-cultural community who live nearby and allowed his dog to run out of control around the small estate of about 70 flats. His next-door neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'Since he has gone, my life has changed and I am now very happy.' Another neighbour added: 'It was so loud all the time. We could all hear it. We’re glad it’s finished now.' Christopher Jones, the council’s anti-social behaviour case officer, said: 'Because of his appalling anti-social behaviour, we obtained an emergency injunction on April 13, 2012, to try and curb his behaviour, but within days of the injunction being granted, he breached it and was arrested.' The courts were so appalled that they banned Lea from going within 100 metres of his flat. But, on May 30, he breached that injunction by returning to the property, had a wild party and smashed up his flat and its contents. The council said he has since disappeared and when a local newspaper reporter visited his former home yesterday, the door had been barricaded by the council with a metal door. The county court notice attached said that Lea also owed the council £175 in costs. Address: Mr Lea's flat was on Mary Carpenter Place, Bristol, (pictured) Since he moved in in 2011, the council has received . numerous complaints about noise . Mr Jones said: 'Since he had totally refused to change his behaviour we applied for a possession order on his home and on July 10, 2012, District Judge Major granted the city council a seven-day outright possession order. 'This has now been executed and Mr Lea has been evicted. Residents of Mary Carpenter Place are now enjoying the peaceful surroundings and living without the fear of intimidation, loud music and abuse perpetrated by David Lea.' Another neighbour of Mr Lea, who did not want to be named, said: 'He was clearly not very well and excess alcohol was possibly a factor in his behaviour. 'Basically, the council got him that flat and they should have known what he was like before he came here.' The resident of more than a decade added: 'It’s a lot quieter neighbourhood now and he did upset the apple cart a bit, but he is obviously in need of help. He was a problem, but he is a great example of what the council move onto council estates.' The council declined to comment on the neighbour’s view of the case.","David Lea used to have 'hundreds' of visitors calling at all hours the council said .

"Diego Costa has flown to Belgrade to see 'miracle doctor' Marijana Kovacevic in a desperate attempt to be fit for the biggest match of his career. The Serb uses placenta to help players recover quickly from muscle injuries and on Saturday Costa wants to play for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid in the Champions League final. The striker has been diagnosed with a grade one hamstring tear, sustained against Barcelona last weekend in La Liga. VIDEO Scroll down for Simeone is hopeful that striker Diego Costa will play in final . SOS: Diego Costa in Belgrade, where he is to see the controversial 'placenta doctor' in a bid to recover . Down and out: Diego Costa has flown to see controversial doctor Marijana Kovacevic after tearing a hamstring . Limping off: Costa (centre) is a major doubt for the Champions League final against Real Madrid . That sort of injury usually keeps players out of action for around 15 days, which would rule him out of the showpiece event in Lisbon if the treatment does not work. Costa will rejoin the Atletico squad on Wednesday after flying back from Serbia. Kovacevic has treated several Premier League stars before, including then-Arsenal striker Robin van Persie and Chelsea's Frank Lampard. Yossi Benayoun, while at Liverpool, was privy to her treatment and gave the doctor a glowing endorsement. 'There were no animal parts used and no injections,' he said. 'The doctor has treated a lot of players and seems to be held in very high regard. Shout it out loud: Costa celebrates Atletico's first La Liga title in 18 years last weekend . 'She explained everything to me beforehand and told me she would be using fluid from a placenta that had come from a woman. 'Nothing went into the muscle itself. It was just a case of massaging the liquid on to the skin around the affected area. 'It meant I was able to play again within a fortnight and help the team at an important time.' His manager at the time, Rafa Benitez . said: 'She is a doctor with a degree in pharmacology and is really good . with muscle injuries. Explanation: QPR midfielder Yossi Benayoun spoke highly of the controversial treatment . 'If a . player is supposed to be out for four weeks and he is back available . within two or three days, and everything is clear, they are natural . products, then why not? It's curative. 'It's not trying to improve the performance of the player, it's trying to cure him. 'We had some players that were injured, and with natural products and treatments they are available, and that's surely a positive.' Chelsea, who are trying to buy Costa from Atletico, will be wary of whether he is played through injury in the Champions League and the subsequent World Cup. The gaffer: Diego Simeone is desperate for his star man to be able to take on Real Madrid . Both Andriy Shevchenko and Fernando Torres arrived at the club after being played while suffering from different complaints. Diego Simeone has played Costa even when not fully fit on a couple of occasions during Atletico's run to the Spanish league title. Both times he has been substituted early in the next match, with the gamble not paying off. Atletico midfielder Arda Turan is also racing against time to be fit for the final.

"Lionel Messi celebrated the 10th anniversary of his Barcelona debut with a brilliant goal, as Barcelona maintained their four point lead over rivals Real Madrid ahead of next week's Clasico. Messi inched closer to breaking Telmo Zarra's all-time La Liga scoring record, notching his 250th goal, leaving him one strike behind the Athletic Bilbao legend. He could now write history against Real Madrid next Saturday, quite probably aided by the return of Luis Suarez from suspension. Messi was instrumental in this win over Eibar, which saw Barcelona keep their eighth clean sheet in eight games, Claudio Bravo extending his own record to 720 minutes unbeaten—although Eibar deserved to be ahead at half-time. re .

Subs: Jaime, Lekic, Vila, Piovaccari, Raul Navas. Booked: Lillo, Javi Lara. Ref: Jose Antonio Teixeira Vitienes. Attendance: 75,546. On Thursday, a decade after he first appeared in a Barcelona shirt, he thanked everyone at the club and the supporters in an emotional message, and pledged to continue in the same vein. He did just that, here. Luis Enrique likes to his shuffle his pack at the best of times and with two huge games coming up, he made changes. Barcelona host Ajax on Tuesday, an important Champions League clash after their defeat by Paris Saint-Germain, before heading to the Santiago Bernabeu to play arch-rivals Real Madrid on Saturday. Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic, mainstays in midfield, were rested completely. It meant that Javier Mascherano could play in his favoured defensive midfield position, where he performed so stoically for Argentina during the World Cup, and youngster Sergi Roberto was also afforded his first start of the season. Completing the trio was veteran Xavi, another player who has had limited game-time under the Asturian coach. This match was a potential banana skin for Barcelona. Eibar, minnows from the Basque Country in La Liga for the first time, have started the season well, out-performing much bigger local rivals Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad. With important games ahead, perhaps Barcelona's eye could have slipped off the ball. It seemed like that was the case in the first half. The crowd were expecting a goal feast but none were forthcoming, with Eibar making the best two chances of the game. After 20 minutes Neymar cut in superbly from the left and fed Messi, who took the ball into the box. Four defenders swarmed around him and one eventually lurched in to slide the ball clear. The Argentine should have opened the scoring a minute later, receiving Dani Alves’ low pass but seeing his shot from close range turned behind by goalkeeper Xabi Irureta.

Pique smiles at Shakira before the La Liga clash as Barcelona opened up a four-point advantage at the top of the table over Real Madrid . Messi’s scooped cross towards Neymar evaded the Brazilian by inches and nearly crept in at the far post, before his own powerful header was straight down Irureta’s throat, with Barcelona pushing for the opener. But then Gerard Pique, in trouble during the week for his furious row with Barcelona police, decided to backheel the ball to Jeremy Mathieu inside the box. His flick was a little short and Eibar retrieved the ball, but couldn't work an opening for a shot on goal. Gaizka Garitano’s side sniffed blood and they created two chances which should have ended Claudio Bravo’s clean sheet streak. The first saw Capa flick the ball past the Chilean stopper but hit the side-netting with the goal gaping. The second required Bravo to make an excellent save, with Saul Berjon getting in behind the defence but failing to shoot sufficiently wide of the goalkeeper. At the other end Xavi had a low effort turned wide of the far post by Irureta, but it wasn’t enough to satisfy Barcelona fans who were hoping to see the side put away six goals, like they did in the previous home league game against Granada, and there were grumbles at half-time.

They didn’t have to wait too long for their team to open the scoring though. Although the focus was on Messi trying to score the three goals he needs to overtake Zarra, he was happy to turn provider. Messi’s played in a slightly more withdrawn role this season and it worked to good effect here, with Xavi feeding him and then darting into the box. Messi waited before slipping in the veteran midfielder, who clipped the ball home comfortably. And then it was two, with a Brazilian connection. Xavi played in Alves, whose cross was volleyed home into the bottom right corner, by Neymar. The forward has really come to life this season after a mixed start to his Barcelona career. He turned provider for the third, which was brilliantly taken by Messi. The man they call ‘La Pulga’, the flea, buzzed away from his marker in midfield, found Neymar and then fired the return ball into the far corner from a tight angle. It was typical of so many of the goals that he has put away in this grand arena. He should have scored again at the death to match Zarra’s record, heading straight at Irureta when chipped through by Andres Iniesta. But Messi now just needs two goals to become the greatest goalscorer in Spanish football history and, with his pedigree, you wouldn’t bet against both of them coming next Saturday at the Santiago Bernabeu. After all, he is the man for the big occasion, and has scored more goals against Real Madrid than any other side. Carlo Ancelotti, Cristiano Ronaldo, beware. Lionel Messi now has 250 goals in La Liga, in 285 games, two short of matching Athletic Bilbao legend Telmo Zarra's all-time record total of 251. Sportsmail kept an eye on him as he tried to break the historic milestone... 10m: Messi had received the ball a few times but Eibar were tight to him and dispossessed him on each occasion, sometimes fairly, sometimes unfairly. As has been a bigger feature of his game this season under Enrique, he's helped out with ball recovery, and today was no different. 20m: Took the ball into the box but with four defenders frantically swarming around him, one finally came in and cut him out. Immediately afterwards he should have scored when cut in from the right, but the keeper did well to put it behind for a corner. 30m: Messi was razor sharp to a mix up on the edge of the box and nipped in, but fired inches wide across the face of goal. Cheeky cross towards Nemyar, slightly too far but it nearly crept in at the far post. 45m: Messi header on target from a Pedro cross, leaving the crowd chanting his name before the break. 60m: Xavi played the ball into Messi who held it up and then slid it back to the midfielder, who fired home. This season he's really enjoyed playing in a slightly deeper role and creating chances for his team-mates. 75m: Messi got his goal, after some brilliant work in midfield and a one-two with Neymar, he drilled the ball across goal and into the far corner. 90m: Job done, but Messi could have matched Zarra's record when he headed straight at the goalkeeper from a couple of yards out after Iniesta picked him out.","Barcelona have won seven of their first eight La Liga games following 3-0 win over Eibar .

"Fugitive African warlord Joseph Kony has been accused of ordering elephants to be killed for their ivory . Members of a militia run by fugitive African warlord Joseph Kony are killing elephants across Central Africa and using the money to support his group, a watchdog has reported. Kony's Lord's Resistance Army is struggling and has turned to elephant poaching 'as a means to sustain itself', using money from the illegal trade of ivory to buy food and supplies. A report issued by a coalition of groups who want to enough defections from the LRA said Kony gave the order to butcher elephants for their ivory as far back as 2010. 'With prices at record-high levels, trading illegal ivory offers the LRA another way to sustain itself in addition to its habitual pillaging,' the report said. 'Former senior fighters who defected from the group report that the LRA trades ivory for arms, ammunition, and food.' It added information from former captives showed LRA groups in Central African Republic and Congo 'trade ivory with unidentified people who arrive in helicopters'. In February Ugandan troops operating in Central African Republic discovered six elephant tusks believed to have been hidden in the bush by the LRA. Ugandan army officials said at the time that they were acting on information given by an LRA defector who said Kony long ago instructed his fighters to find ivory and bring it to him. Experts have warned Africa's elephants are under increased threat from habitat loss and poachers motivated by rising demand for ivory in Asia. Much of the harvested ivory ends up as small trinkets. About 70 years ago, up to 5 million elephants are believed to have roamed sub-Saharan Africa. Today fewer than a million remain. The elephants of Central Africa, a region long plagued by armed conflict and lawlessness, are especially vulnerable. Scroll down for video . The warlord became a household name when a video raising awareness of his brutal movement went viral . The new report said Congo's expansive but poorly protected Garamba National Park, which once was used by LRA commanders as safe haven, is the source of some of the ivory that ends up before Kony. But Garamba's elephants also are being targeted by 'members of the armed forces of (Congo), South Sudan, Sudan, and Uganda,' the report said, citing the concerns of park rangers there. It said the LRA is part of 'the larger poaching crisis that puts wild African elephants at risk of local extinction.' Facing pressure from U.S.-backed African Union troops tasked with eliminating its leaders, the LRA - which used to have several thousand men - is now scattered in small numbers in Congo, South Sudan, and Central African Republic. Fewer than 500 LRA rebels are still active in the bush, according to the Ugandan military, where they conduct hit-and-run operations that terrorise villagers and move across the region's porous borders in small groups. Elephants are increasingly at risk due to high demand for ivory from Asia, experts have said (file photo) Kony himself is believed to be highly mobile, but the U.S.-based watchdog group Resolve said in a report in April that he recently directed killings from an enclave protected by the Sudanese military. Until early this year, Resolve's report said, Kony and some of his commanders were operating in Kafia Kingi, a disputed area along the Sudan-South Sudan border where African troops tasked with catching Kony don't have access. Sudan's government denies this charge. Kony, whose rebellion originated in Uganda before spreading to other parts of Central Africa, was indicted by the International Criminal Court in 2005 for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Last year he became the focus of international attention when a film made by the advocacy group Invisible Children highlighting LRA crimes and calling for Kony to be stopped from recruiting children went viral.","Report says illegal ivory trade funding Kony's Lord's Resistance Army .

"Scientists have pinpointed exactly why rechargeable batteries, such as those used in smartphones (pictured) degrade so quickly . Many of us have owned a smartphone that only has charge for a few hours, or a laptop that is no longer portable thanks to an almost ‘dead’ battery. But such frustration could become a thing of the past because scientists have pinpointed exactly why rechargeable batteries degrade so quickly, forcing consumers to replace them, or upgrade their devices. Experts say that laptops and smartphones could have much longer-lasting lithium ion batteries in the future and electric cars could even have batteries that last for more than 30 years with a full charge. In two separate studies published in Nature Communications, researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy have revealed why batteries lose the ability to hold their charge over time. Despite the battery being around in its basic form for around 200 years, until now, scientists have failed to understand why they lose their full charge over time and as a consequence, have not been able to do much to resolve the problem. But this has changed in the last decade thanks to cutting-edge technology such as new types of electron microscopes and synchrotron X-ray techniques, Smithsonian magazine reported . The physicists studied the charge and discharge process of lithium ion batteries, which are used in many devices and pointed the finger at microscopic vulnerabilities in the structure of the batteries and the accumulation of tiny crystals. The physicists discovered that . microscopic vulnerabilities steer lithium ions through the battery . haphazardly, eroding it in an irregular manner and reducing its . efficiency. Experts say that laptops, smartphones could have much longer-lasting lithium-ion batteries in the future and electric cars (pictured) could even have cells that last for over 30 years with a full charge . They also noticed that deposits of nano-scale crystals that are generated by chemical reactions cause the flow of ions to become more irregular each time a battery is recharged. Using batteries at higher voltages exacerbated such irregularities and reduced the life of the battery too. It is hoped that the findings will lead to the development of longer-lasting, smaller and more powerful batteries that could keep phones and laptops working for much longer at their full charge. Some experts believe that the answer lies in protecting the surface of the battery or the cathode, with an incredibly thin film. Huolin Xin, a materials scientist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, who co-authored both studies, believes that the price of batteries for electric cars will fall radically. As scientists understand more about battery efficiency, they could create electric car batteries that last for over three decades, he said. The physicists discovered that microscopic vulnerabilities steer lithium ions through the battery haphazardly, eroding it in an irregular manner and reducing its efficiency. The lithium ion battery of an electric car is pictured . Scientists have at last created pure lithium batteries, which in time could last four times longer than those currently powering smartphones and other gadgets. The ‘Holy Grail’ discovery, announced this week, could revolutionise technology from electric cars to consumer devices like MP3 players, which all demand power storage. Currently, owners of gadgets using the lithium ion batteries face the constant frustration of having to frequently recharge devices to make sure they do not run out of battery after a matter of hours. This is because while small, the batteries are power-hungry. But after years of research, engineers at Stanford University, California, believe they have worked out how to keep them the same size, while boosting their longevity. To do this, they have made the battery's anode out of lithium too. Scientists have been working for years to produce an anode of pure lithium, because it would be cheap, small and be a huge boost to battery efficiency. The engineers managed to create a lithium anode by inventing a film made from carbon nanospheres to protect the anode and stop it from cracking when it expands. The nanospheres create a surface resembling a honeycomb to make a flexible, uniform and non-reactive film that protects the unstable lithium. ‘Of all the materials that one might use in an anode, lithium has the greatest potential. Some might call it the Holy Grail,’ said Professor Yi Cui of the university. ‘It is very lightweight and it has the highest energy density. You get more power per volume and weight, leading to lighter, smaller batteries with more power.’ ‘In practical terms, if we can improve the capacity of batteries to, say, four times today's, that would be exciting.'","Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy found microscopic vulnerabilities in the structure of batteries are to blame for degradation .
The accumulation of tiny crystals also contributes to the problem .
Physicists studied the charge and discharge process of lithium ion batteries, which are found in many consumer devices such as phones and laptops .
By understanding why lithium ion batteries lose their full charge over time, longer lasting versions could be developed .
This could lead to electric car batteries enduring for over 30 years ."
"Senator Marco Rubio has branded Barack Obama's apology to an art history professor 'pathetic' after the President personally wrote a note saying he regretted denigrating the subject. The Republican senator for Florida took to Twitter to issue a condemnation of Mr Obama's climbdown, saying 'we do need more degrees that lead to #jobs'. It came after Mr Obama hand wrote an apology to University of Texas professor Ann Collins Johns for suggesting learning a trade would be a better career choice than studying for an art history degree. 'Pathetic': Marco Rubio, the Republican senator from Florida, has criticised Barack Obama for his apology to an art history professor after he glibly said that studying the subject was not as good as learning a trade . Senator Rubio's tweet: The high-flying Republican rarely misses an chance to cock a snook at the President . During a speech at a General Electric plant in Wisconsin, he said that 'folks can make a lot more potentially with skilled manufacturing or the trades than they might with an art history degree.' He was inundated with letters from art historians and journalists all furious at his remarks - but it was Professor Johns' comments that caught his eye. The University of Texas professor Ann Collins Johns sent a message to the president via the White House website, Politico reported. She argued that art history teaches students how to think, read and write critically, while also praising how inclusive the subject is. And in response, Obama wrote to clarify that he was making a point about the jobs market, rather than commenting on the value of the subject, according to the Huffington Post. He also wrote that art history had been invaluable in teaching him to appreciate works of art. But it appears that Mr Rubio, a . leading light in the Republican party who has been tipped as a possible . future presidential contender, vehemently disagreed. His . tweet, posted last night, read, 'Pathetic Obama apology to art history prof. We do need . more degrees that lead to #jobs,' before ending with a link to a news . story reporting on the President's note. This is the handwritten apology President Obama sent to the University of Texas professor . Ann Collins Johns argued that art history teaches students how to think, read and write critically, while also praising how inclusive the subject is . Professor Johns told blog Hyperallegic . that the content of her email: 'was not so much one of outrage at his . statement, but rather a ""look at what we do well"" statement. 'I . emphasized that we challenge students to think, read, and write . critically. I also stressed how inclusive our discipline is these days.' 'Ann, . 'Let me apologize for my off-the-cuff remarks. I was making a point about the jobs market, not the value of art history. 'As . it so happens, art history was one of my favorite subjects in high . school, and it has helped me take in a great deal of joy in my life that . I might otherwise have missed.' He . explained that he was merely trying to inspire students to consider a . path other than college, if it suit them better than struggling at . college. He wrote: 'So . please pass on my apology for the glib remark to the entire department, . and understand that I was trying to encourage young people who may not . be predisposed to a four year college experience to be open to technical . training that can lead them to an honorable career.' In a letter published on the blog Hyperallergic, Obama wrote: 'Ann, Let me apologize for my off-the-cuff remarks. I was making a point about the jobs market, not the value of art history.

'There's nothing wrong with art history, I love art history,' Obama immediately said after making the comment about art history degrees. 'So, I don't want to get a bunch of emails from everybody. 'I'm just saying, you can make a really good living and have a great career without getting a four-year college education, as long as you get the skills and training that you need.' Afterwards Johns wrote that she was a supporter of the President, and believed he had done a great job in extremely challenging circumstances. His comments came after his State of the Union speech. He outlined a series of actions he plans to take by himself to help America's employment conditions. They include a Government-wide review of job training programs, CEO roundtable, and 'mobilizing' businesses and community colleges to create apprenticeships. He also plans to stimulate the economy by introducing a new $10.10 minimum wage for federal contract workers, new 'starter' retirement savings accounts and effort to bring jobs to the U.S. from overseas.","Obama's apology came after he suggested learning a trade would be a better career choice than studying for an art history degree .

"NBC's Dr Nancy Snyderman will be released from mandatory quarantine this week after being exposed to Ebola - but the network may drop the chief medical editor, reports claim. Snyderman, a surgeon who spent 17 years reporting for ABC News before joining NBC in 2006, came under fire for allegedly violating her quarantine and then refusing to explain what happened. The confusion sparked a furious response from thousands of viewers writing to the station to say they no longer trust Snyderman. Scroll down for video . Questions:  Thousands of viewers have complained that Dr Nancy Snyderman was 'arrogant, dismissive, and untrustworthy' after she was allegedly violated her Ebola quarantine then merely gave a cryptic explanation . It has left NBC with a major PR and credibility problem and bosses will now have to decide whether the medical editor's credibility can survive the incident. The network would not comment. Snyderman was ordered into mandatory quarantine until Wednesday October 22 with the rest of her broadcast team after she allegedly violated their voluntary isolation. The team covered the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and worked briefly with Ashoka Mukpo, the cameraman who caught the virus and is now being treated in Nebraska. Upon returning to the United States, Snyderman and her crew agreed to quarantine themselves for 21 days, the longest known incubation period for the disease. They have shown no symptoms. Yet New Jersey health officials ruled that her quarantine should be mandatory after Snyderman and her crew were spotted getting takeout food from a New Jersey restaurant. NBC won't give details about who actually went into the restaurant, or even how many of its employees are being quarantined. Snyderman issued a statement saying 'members of our group' violated their pledge. Quarantined: Snyderman has been in mandatory quarantine after covering the Ebola outbreak in Liberia . Suffering: Cameraman Ashoka Mukpo contracted the disease while working with the team. He is being treated . More than 1,100 people have subsequently written on Snyderman's Facebook page, many expressing anger. There were suggestions she should be fired or lose her medical license, and some viewers said they wouldn't trust her again. Snyderman's failure to be more specific about the lapse or take greater responsibility was another flashpoint. Snyderman's 'arrogance and dismissiveness' create a huge PR and credibility problem for NBC, said Kelly McBride, an expert on ethics for the journalism think tank the Poynter Institute. 'People are so freaked out about Ebola that the problem NBC has now is that whenever they put her on the air, some news consumers are going to see the woman who put others at risk, rather than the reporter and professional with great experience,' McBride said. McBride suggested that Snyderman 'lay low' or take a leave of absence. Certainly she should not report on Ebola anymore for the network, she said. Future: Snyderman will have to discuss the future of her 25-year career in journalism when she is released . Susan Dentzer, a longtime health journalist and commentator for National Public Radio and the PBS 'NewsHour,' said people shouldn't forget that Snyderman put herself at risk to travel to Africa and cover the story. The public is reacting to a fear of Ebola instead of science, she said. 'She and her team clearly should have observed the terms of their quarantine, and she has said clearly that they made a mistake,' Dentzer said. 'But let's put it in a broader perspective.' Before Snyderman's trip for takeout, ABC News' medical expert arguably had bigger problems. ABC health editor Dr. Richard Besser was in Africa at the same time as Snyderman and did not quarantine himself upon his return. That led ABC News President James Goldston to send his staff a memo explaining that the network was following medical advice. Still, Besser was disinvited to a speaking engagement at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, he wrote last week in the Washington Post. Some colleagues have avoided him. 'I've been surprised by how many colleagues have waved from across the room and quickly made an exit,' Besser wrote. 'Others won't enter my office.' NBC could face a competitive disadvantage if Snyderman is taken off medical stories. Robert Bazell, the network's longtime health and science correspondent, left last year to teach at Yale. An important first step for Snyderman will be to explain to viewers exactly what happened, perhaps on a venue like the 'Today' show, said Bill Wheatley, a longtime NBC executive who now teaches journalism at Columbia University. 'If she and the network are more forthcoming about the whole matter, I believe that her credibility can be preserved,' Wheatley said.","Dr Nancy Snyderman sparked outrage after 'violating Ebola quarantine'

"A couple in Alabama raped an underage relative multiple times hoping that the girl, who was mentally incapacitated, would get pregnant and give them a baby, police said. Jeremy Swann, 29, and wife Amanda Swann, 28, were arrested last week at their home in Jones, where authorities say the sexual assaults took place over the past month. Jeremy's mother, 57-year-old Dianna Swann, was also arrested for knowing about the attacks but not telling cops. 'They propositioned her to have sex with . Jeremy so that she could get pregnant, and so she could have a baby for . them,' investigator Janet Cole, of the Dallas County Sheriff's Office, . told the Selma Times-Journal. BUSTED: Jeremy Swann, 29, and wife Amanda, 28, were arrested on charges of raping a young female relative so she would give them a baby . The girl, who never got pregnant, was a minor relative of Amanda's. An investigator said that Amanda watched as her husband repeatedly assaulted the girl, court records show. The girl screamed during the assaults, which occurred over the past month, and at least once Jeremy gagged her with a ball to keep her quiet, the investigator said. Amanda Swann, who assisted the girl to the bathroom after each assault, did nothing 'because she wanted (the victim) to have a baby for her,' court record  show. Dianna Swann, 57, was also arrested for knowing about the sexual assaults but not calling the police . Investigators first began looking into the case when the couple contacted local child protective services requesting that they be granted full custody of the girl, claiming she was being sexually assaulted by her mother. But while social workers checked into those claims, the girl told them that it was the Swann couple who was raping her. She said she was forced to have sex with Jeremy at least six times. The Swanns, who remain at Dallas County Jail in lieu of $500,000 bond each, are charged with first-degree rape. The man's mother, Dianna, is charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. She is being held on $6,000 bond. 'She was present when all the sexual acts were going on,' Cole told the Times-Journal. 'She was there. She heard the girl screaming, and she did nothing.' The couple may still be charged with enticing a child and incest, according to Cole. The three suspects were expected for a bond hearing on Monday.","Jeremy Swann, 29, and wife Amanda Swann, 28, are charged with first-degree rape of a female relative .

"A bead of sweat drips down the side of Luis Suarez's face. For 70 minutes of this clash he's had his ankles kicked and hacked at by Pepe. But now there's a gap he can run into. Lionel Messi spots his ghost-like movement and fires a low ball towards the space. With a dip of one shoulder Suarez leaves Sergio Ramos for dead and now he can see the whites of Diego Lopez's eyes. He pulls the trigger and the ball beats the goalkeeper, arrowing towards the far post. 99,000 people at the Nou Camp hold their breath. Millions more are frozen, transfixed, eyes glued to their TV sets. The biggest game in world football has just got bigger. When Real Madrid play Barcelona, the planet stands still. They are always superlative affairs, featuring the sport's finest players. Tests not only of physical and technical ability, but also tremendous mental strength. And amid the galaxy of stars that will be on display, one of football's brightest has been plucked from the Premier League and neatly placed into a vacant position on the right-hand side of Barcelona's attack. Legends: Barcelona versus Real Madrid is traditionally the biggest game in world football . Raising the stakes: Luis Suarez's arrival at Barcelona means that the Clasico will be even bigger next season . Trident: Suarez is likely to line up alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar in a fearsome three-pronged attack . Luis Suarez's move from Liverpool to Barcelona has long been in the pipeline, but only now it has been officially declared does the terrifying reality of what it means in footballing terms become clear. Suarez will fit in alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar in what could prove to be the finest front-line in football history. Except, in the Spanish capital, Suarez's acquisition is only viewed as the latest aggressive step in a never-ending arms race. Real Madrid are closing in on the signing of Radamel Falcao, Monaco's Colombian star. He has spent the last few months recovering from a knee-injury, but when fit he is arguably the most lethal striker in the game. Target: Real Madrid want to add Monaco striker Radamel Falcao to their attack in time for next season . The end: Falcao's arrival could force Karim Benzema to leave the Bernabeu in search of first-team football . Anything you can do: Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale make up two parts of Real Madrid's attacking options . While Karim Benzema's overall game has improved under Carlo Ancelotti, he doesn't offer the brutal and clinical edge that Falcao wields with such impunity. As well as Falcao, Madrid are close to adding German midfield diamond Toni Kroos to their armoury, which is already bursting at the seams. When Barcelona play Real Madrid for the first time in the coming season, you will be able to construct a side from the two benches that would be able to challenge for the title itself. Spanish league fixture scheduling is stacked. Clasicos rarely take place too early in the season, because La Liga want the game to have some significance with regards to the standings in the table. And, with Suarez banned for four months, we may be holding our breath for a Clasico until the end of October. As La Liga's star signing this summer, the idea that Barcelona will be allowed to play Real Madrid without him is almost ludicrous. So when the two teams meet, the players will have had time to get up to speed. These are the two sides that could be facing each other at the Nou Camp, or Santiago Bernabeu. Dynamo: Bayern Munich and Germany midfielder Toni Kroos is wanted by Real Madrid . Tough task: Luis Enrique is the man charged with returning Barca to the top . Instant success: Carlo Ancelotti won the Champions League in his first season at Real . Lynchpin: Javier Mascherano is likely to return to a midfield role for Barcelona next season . The match is a mouthwatering proposition. Luis Enrique has already suggested that Javier Mascherano will be moved from defence into midfield. Given his fantastic performances in Argentina there at this World Cup, it would be no surprise if he follows through with this plan. That would pit him up against Kroos, the man he will be trying shackle on Sunday night in the World Cup final. However, even if that battle could dictate the ebb and flow of the game, all eyes will be on the two diamond-encrusted attacks. Despite Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo being the sole Ballon d'Or victors for the past few years, it is Suarez who will be in the spotlight, the first time these two teams meet. Formidable: Sergio Aguero and Pepe are Real's defensive partnership . No nonsense: They bring a physical approach to defending . Bring it on: Suarez's battle with Ramos and Pepe is likely to be a full-blooded one with little room for shirking . Pepe and Sergio Ramos are provocative defenders, who love nothing more than getting stuck into their opponents. Just look at their treatment of Diego Costa last season. And as fiery as the now-Chelsea striker is, Suarez resides on a different level of snark. It would be no surprise if Barcelona insisted the Uruguayan undertake a psychology course before the game, to ensure the red mist that has plagued him doesn't descend again. In the heat of the action, Suarez has bitten three opponents. He has racially abused another. When he was 15 he was accused of headbutting a referee. Neither the referee, Giorgio Chiellini, Branislav Ivanovic or Ottman Bakkal have a patch on Pepe when it comes to getting under a rival's skin. Speaking in pure footballing terms, Suarez has the beating of Madrid's defence. But, as we know, Clasicos are rarely just about who is better with the ball at their feet. Neymar will be hungry to prove himself after his World Cup campaign was ended early by Juan Camilo Zuniga's brutal challenge. Cristiano Ronaldo too, after his summer barely even began because of injury. Ronaldo will turn 30 this season and it could be his last at the top of his game. He will make it count. Gareth Bale is eager to build on his last-gasp Copa del Rey winning wonder-goal against Barcelona. Last season Bale found it hard to make an impact in the biggest games, but ended up scoring that goal at the Mestalla, as well as crucially nodding home against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final. Bale will now be expected to do more in these matches, as well as continuing to produce decisive moments. We were given an incredible Clasico at the Bernabeu in March, with Messi scoring a hat-trick as Barcelona won 4-3. If the defences couldn't control the forwards back then, how can they cope with Suarez and Falcao thrown into the mix? When Barcelona and Madrid take to the field next season, we could well be watching the six best attacking players in the world go at it hammer and tongs. Injuries - and suspension - apart. And it's impossible to decide who will win - apart from anybody lucky enough to get a ticket. Making his mark: Bale scored 15 goals and assisted 12 in his first season in La Liga . The best: Last season Messi scored 28 goals in 29 La Liga games and set up a further 11 . Improvement needed: Neymar scored nine goals and assisted eight during his first season in La Liga . Prolific: Last season Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 31 La Liga games and set up a further nine for his team-mates .","Barcelona continue summer overhaul with signing of Luis Suarez .

Wenger hoped to persuade Casillas, who was only selected in cup competitions for Madrid last season with Diego Lopez preferred in La Liga, to switch to north London. But Ancelotti said: 'Casillas is very happy to stay here and we are very happy that he wants to stay.' When asked about who would be first choice next season Ancelotti said he had not made up his mind. 'We have not thought about this after the victory (in the Champions League final) because everybody went on holiday.' On Morata, though, the signs are positive for Arsenal. Ancelotti explained: 'The player wants to look for an opportunity where he can play more and the club agrees with this. 'If he leaves it would be good that he would have the chance to play. If Morata goes we have to think about getting a young forward with the same characteristics.' If Madrid sell Morata then they would look for a deal with a buy-back clause. The 21-year-old has not been given as many opportunities as he would hope at the Santiago Bernabeu, with fellow youth team graduate Jese ahead of him in the pecking order.

"Actress Sasha Grey has slammed the Russian propaganda machine after her photograph was used  in a fake story about a nurse 'murdered by Ukrainian soldiers'. A photo of the 26-year-old former pornstar appeared next to an obituary claiming to be of a Russian nurse captured, raped and killed by Ukrainian military forces, and quickly went viral on social media. Miss Grey, born Marina Ann Hantzis, retaliated on Twitter, saying that although she loved her Russian fans, the anti-Ukraine propaganda had been taken too far. Hitting back: Former porn star Sasha Grey, pictured while still an active adult actress, has slammed 'Russian propaganda' after he photograph was used to illustrate a fake 'anti-Kiev' post . Angry: The 26-year-old actress, pictured last year, vented on Twitter after the post, saying Russian propagande had gone 'too far' The fake story appeared on Russian social network VKontakte and received more than 3,500 likes in 24 hours. The 'obituary' claimed a nurse named Sasha Serova, 'serova' being the word for grey in Russian, had been taken captured on the battlefield and held hostage by Kiev forces. It claims the soldiers filmed themselves 'humiliating' the fictional nurse before murdering and dismembering her with an ax, the Moscow Times reports. Miss Grey, an American actress who left the adult entertainment industry in 2010, fired back in a series of posts on her Twitter account earlier today. 'I love my Russian fans, but this propaganda takes it too far. News that I was a NURSE killed in the Russian/Ukraine conflict. #f***propoganda [sic] . Fake: The trolling post which appeared on a Russian social network using Miss Grey's photograph to illustrate a fake obituary about a nurse said to have been murdered by Ukranian soldiers . New career: After leaving the adult entertainment industry, Miss Grey has successfully transitioned into mainstream acting, seen here in HBO's Entourage . 'People are dying. People are losing family members & BS outlets mock the deceased with Fappery like this.' The trolling of 'gullible' Russians by using Sasha Grey's picture and a fake obituary was a 'troll quote'. A 'troll quote' is an images which sees a popular film or TV quote attributed to the wrong character, designed simply to annoy and frustrate. A popular 'troll quote' sees a quote from Harry Potter's Professor Dumbledore next to an image of Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf from Lord of the Rings. She then added that she had been a victim of another fake propaganda story in 2014, when she had been labelled as a supporter of Kiev. 'Just an FYI some other conservative propaganda outlet labeled me & other Russian artists as friends of the Hunta just last summer/fall. 'So to make it clear FIRST I was the ENEMY & now I'm a FRIEND because this was supposedly the fault of Ukrainians.' In her final tweet about the scandal she added that she has 'love & respect for all of my Russian & Ukrainian fans, I wish there was more I could do. #peace' Grey's image and accompanying fake story appears to have been part of a trolling project by users of a Russian version of reddit called 2ch.hk, known as 'Dvach'. Accused: Miss Grey, seen on Entourage, claimed she had been accused of supporting Kiev in the Russia-Ukraine conflict just last year . Last week, users of the forum launched a project intended to test the 'gullability of Russians', by making up fake stories about 'fallen heroes' and posting them next to images of famous people, Global Voices reports. For those aware of Miss Grey's background in the adult entertainment industry, the trolling in the 'obituary' is obvious, as it contains several sexually suggestive double entendres, the website says. Sasha Grey, from North Highlands, California, graduated a year early from high school and waited tables until she had saved up for a move to Los Angeles. She began appearing in adult films shortly after turning 18 and quickly became one of the most popular female porn stars in the U.S. During her porn career she appeared in more than 300 films and spoke openly about her choice to embark on a career in adult entertainment at such a young age. She filmed her last porn film aged 21, but after fearing some fans might still believe her to be an active adult actress she officially announced her retirement shortly after turning 22, in April 2011. Miss Grey has since become a mainstream actress, appearing in several films and as a semi-fictionalized version of herself in HBO's Entourage.","Photo of Sasha Grey appear next to fake obituary of Russian nurse .

"Jamie Carragher has heaped praise on Liverpool's resilience after they produced a hard-fought away performance at Southampton to take all three points. Brendan Rodgers' side are now 10 games unbeaten in the Premier League since a defeat to Manchester United in December, and Carragher has been impressed with their desire to win.

'When you don't play well, you rely on your defenders, and I think that's five clean sheets now, away... the best since 1985,' Carragher continued. 'I can't believe they've broken a defensive record and I'm not involved in it! 30 years we're going back; that shows how good it is, and I'm not involved in it.' Jordon Ibe was chosen in Liverpool's starting line-up for the game at St Mary's; a bold decision from Liverpool boss Rodgers, but one that paid off. Former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry was alongside Carragher in the Sky studio, and he was impressed by the 19-year-old. Raheem Sterling wheels away in celebration after netting Liverpool's second goal 15 minutes from time . Lazar Markovic struggled to get into the game, and was in the shadow of Jordon Ibe, who impressed . 'One of his mistakes, he got caught ball-watching, but he did his work really well,' Henry told Sky Sports. 'Today he had an amazing performance. He wasn't [doing] step-overs and nutmegs, but he showed maturity in the game at an early age. 'He knew at one point that he needed to tuck in. It's the way he did it, to show that he could cover his back three. He never gave up, he always worked hard for his team-mates, and that's how you earn respect. Ibe is a young player that Carragher will have come into contact with at Liverpool in his final year as a professional. After joining from Wycombe Wanderers in 2012, the winger began his rise to the Liverpool first team, and Carragher was also impressed with his performance against Southampton. Carragher and Henry were impressed by the performance of Liverpool's 19-year-old winger (left) Ibe (left) takes the ball past Southampton's Matt Targett during the Premier League match at St Mary's . 'I'm not criticising Markovic, but he's a £20million signing and he had to come off because he was finding it difficult. This young lad's (Ibe's) understanding of the game... A young wide player is the one player in football that a manager will always mistrust. He'll always look at a big away game, and think ""I'll take the young wide player out"". 'Now, he's playing in the wing-back position. The fact that he's stayed on, and the other fella (Markovic) has had to come off. It's not about going forward today, he virtually played at right-back. His understanding is brilliant, and long may it continue.'","Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling scored as Liverpool beat Southampton 2-0 at St Mary's to move two points from fourth place .

"Luis Enrique changed his Barcelona line-up for the 28th time in a row, dropping Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, but this time nobody was complaining as they racked up a big victory to ease through to the Copa del Rey quarter-finals. The Asturian coach put out an entirely different side to the team that saw off Atletico Madrid last weekend and the reserves responded impressively, to offer Diego Simeone's side the chance of revenge in the next round. Two brilliant first half goals from Jeremy Mathieu and Sergi Roberto set Barcelona on their way, before Pedro and Adriano added two more, and their team did the footballing equivalent of putting their feet up and having a doze in front of the fire, gently stirred by the odd Elche effort whizzing over the crossbar. Jeremy Mathieu (second left) celebrates with team-mates after scoring  at the Martinez Valero stadium . Sergi Roberto points to the skies after scoring Barca's second goal during the Copa del Rey tie . Pedro Rodriguez, who was also on the scoresheet, vies with Elche's midfielder Peral during the easy win . Elche: Manu Herrera, Peral, Lomban, Pelegrin (Fajr 80), Albacar, Galvez (Roco 69), Pasalic (Adrian 63), Coro, Alvaro, Fragapane, Cristian Herrera. Subs not used: Pol Freixanet, Enzo Roco, Domingo Cisma, Aaron, Moha. Booked: Albacar, Peral.

Enrique had given his fearsome strike-force the night off, with only two regular starters in the squad - Gerard Pique and Ivan Rakitic on the bench. The likes of Javier Mascherano, Sergio Busquets, Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta were also saved from making the 330-mile trip down the coast to the small city of Elx. Barcelona were, of course, five goals up from the first leg, so if they had managed to get eliminated it wouldn't just have been Messi and a few worried fans wanting to see the back of the coach. One thing you can't accuse Enrique of is ignoring the youth, with Gerard Gumbau and Alen Halilovic making their debuts here, the latter the seventh youngster Enrique has bestowed the honour upon in his short time at the club. Instead of the stars, we got to see a few of the starlets, with Adama Traore dazzling in fits and starts on the wing, and midfielder Gerard Gumbau and forward Munir El Haddadi also starting. Although the latter had plenty of game-time earlier in the season, it's dried up of late as Barcelona's main strikers have started to click. Adriano should have opened the scoring after seven minutes, with right-back Martin Montoya heading the ball down to the left-back, just a few yards out, but he fluffed his lines. The Brazilian is more accustomed to scoring screamers from long-distance, so he probably wasn't used to being in such a position. That excuse was scuppered a few minutes later, when he launched a rocket from thirty yards, which lurched off into the stands. Mario Pasalic, on loan at Elche from Chelsea, showed he wasn't afraid to put his foot in, with an early foul on Rafinha Alcantara to break up Barcelona's play. He hasn't been a consistent starter for Elche this season, but he's put in some reasonable displays. Sergi Roberto was in fine form and showed why several clubs are keeping tabs on the Spaniard . Barca forward Adama Traore tussles with Elche's Argentinian forward Franco Fragapane . Luis Enrique has taken Barca to a point of leaders Real Madrid and into the last eight of the Copa del Rey . After 20 minutes Adama zipped down the right and the cumbersome Edu Albacar hacked him down. The veteran defender was lucky that he didn't see red, but Elche were punished, brutally, by Mathieu. The Frenchman hasn't picked up many accolades for his grace or accuracy on the field, but there was nothing wrong with his searing 30-yard free kick which fizzed into the top right corner. Elche weren't too pleased and decided to copy Atletico Madrid's tactics from last Sunday night, which saw Diego Simeone's side try to kick Barcelona to pieces. Just like in that game, it didn't work, and the Blaugrana scored another brilliant goal after 40 minutes. Martin Montoya laid the ball across to Sergi Roberto, around 25-yards out, and he shifted it onto his left foot and then swerved it magnificently into the top left corner, leaving poor Manu Herrera with no chance. And before long, it was three. The beleaguered Albacar knocked down Munir in the box and a penalty was awarded. Pedro, another victim of the Messi-Neymar-Suarez triumvirate, was given the captain's armband for the first time in his Barcelona career, and also the responsibility for converting the spot-kick. He did, stroking it into the bottom left corner, sending Herrera the wrong way. Adama continued to impress with his trickery on the wing in the second half, with an impressive blend of speed, power and skill. Albacar, meanwhile, started to make amends for his poor defensive work, whipping in a brilliant ball which was missed by Coro at the back post, with Ter Stegen's goal gaping. Rafinha  vies with Elche's midfielder Peral and Enzo Roco during the Copa del Rey victory . Elche's goalkeeper Manu Herrera vies with Barcelona's forward Pedro as he crosses into the box . Elche's forward Cristian Herrera Perez gets to grips with Mathieu . Adriano got his goal in the end, nodding home from a Douglas cross in stoppage time to make it 4-0 on the night and an astonishing 9-0 on aggregate. Including Barcelona's previous games against Huesca, they have scored 21 goals in the last two rounds of the competition. Pulling the strings for Barcelona throughout was Rafinha, who may be the eventual heir to Xavi's throne. There's the danger that he'll be seen as an Enrique man, but he's shown enough in the games so far this season to suggest he will eventually thrive at the top level. And in the years ahead, we'll be hearing more about Halilovic too. The young Croatian replaced Adama - wearing the No 30, the same Messi did when he made his debut - and hit the post with an almost carbon copy of Sergi Roberto's shot for the second goal. But however impressive the youth players were at the Estadio Martinez Valero, it will be all change when Barcelona head to the Riazor on Sunday night to face Deportivo la Coruna. Back will come Messi, Neymar and Suarez. And back will come the pressure, as they try to hound down Real Madrid at La Liga's summit.","Already 5-0 up from the first leg, Barca rested many of their first team .

"Lionel Messi wants Manchester City star and Argentina team-mate Sergio Aguero to join him at Barcelona as he negotiates a new contract at the club. Messi is close to striking a deal with the Catalan giants but has asked Barcelona to sign Aguero and offer goalkeeper Jose Manuel Pinto a contract renewal. He is set to earn around £16.5million a year with up to £3m in bonuses and the economic terms are nearly settled upon. VIDEO: Scroll down for Behind the Sceness on Messi, RVP and Aguero portraits . Cohorts: Lionel Messi wants his Argentine team-mate Sergio Aguero to join him at Barcelona . Wanted: Messi is hoping that signing Aguero will help his floundering form at club level . Well-connected Catalan television station TV3 are reporting Messi would like those two sporting conditions to be met too. Barcelona have endured a terrible season, being knocked out of the Champions League, losing the Copa del Rey final to Real Madrid and potentially their La Liga title too. Messi and his father Jorge want Barcelona to strengthen and regain their place among Europe’s elite and the club will have to take his suggestions seriously. Jorge met the club’s general director Antoni Rossich and economic vice-president Javier Faus on Tuesday, when it is believed the signing of Aguero was raised. It raises the question of how Messi and Aguero could play alongside Brazil star Neymar, who would also expect a first-team berth. Meanwhile, Messi also wants goalkeeper Pinto to extend his stay at the club. The pair are close friends and even though Pinto has already told team-mates he is expecting to leave at the end of the season, could now stay if the club sanction it. Victor Valdes, currently injured, is set to leave on a free transfer in the summer and Marc-Andre Ter Stegen is joining from Borussia Monchengladbach. On his way: Jose Pinto is expecting to leave Barcelona in the summer . Friends: Messi and Pinto together at a BBQ with Javier Mascherano, Sergio Busquets and Barca coach Pop Moix . Moving on: And Victor Valdes will also be leaving the club, after 11 years is number one . Messi’s current contract expires in 2018 but Barcelona constantly try to keep the four-time world player of the year happy. If he signs the new deal it will be his seventh contract improvement in nine years at Barcelona. Both Barcelona and Messi want to secure a new deal by the World Cup at the very latest and he could put pen to paper as soon as next week. Club president Josep Maria Bartomeu previously told Esport3: ‘We are being unfair to Leo. Our club members need to understand that we must take care of Messi. ‘He has made such an important contribution to this club and he will continue to do so. That’s why we have no doubt that he will lead the future of the club. ‘He is young, he is the best player in the world, and we believe in him.’ For Tito: Messi and his team-mates also suffered the loss of former manager Vilanova last month .","Lionel Messi is close to agreeing a new contract with Barcelona .

"A thumping victory over Elche was probably how Luis Suarez imagined his 28th birthday would go, except he probably pictured himself among the goalscorers. Or on the pitch, at the very least. It was painful for Suarez to watch Barcelona thrive in his absence, but there was one crumb of comfort. Lionel Messi scored two and created two for Neymar, while the Brazilian made one of Messi’s goals and also played in Pedro to round off an emphatic victory.

The connection between the two South Americans is Barcelona’s strongest link and Suarez will note how much that link has developed this season, whereas last season they were rarely on the same wavelength. As well as benching Suarez, Enrique also left Ivan Rakitic out of the squad to save him for the Copa del Rey clash with Atletico Madrid on Wednesday, a bold move considering the Croatian's form in recent weeks, . That said, in the two cup matches against Enrique's team earlier this month Elche shipped a total of nine goals. Added to the 3-0 win Barcelona recorded on the first day of the season, the hosts were a total of 12-0 down against the Catalan giants coming into this game, so it wasn't that risky a decision. Jordi Alba went close early on, volleying narrowly over the bar after a well-worked free kick on the right. Messi went close with a direct effort from a similar position, the ball whistling past the top right corner. At the other end, Claudio Bravo was called into action twice in quick succession, with Faycal Fajr denied by the Chilean after being played in by Jonathas, and again from a free kick.

Jonathas de Jesus of Elche tries to hold off the challenge of Marc Bartra during the La Liga clash on Saturday . But Barcelona began to turn up the pressure and Messi's brilliant cross found Neymar at the back post, but the Brazilian uncharacteristically fluffed his lines. Gerard Pique made no such error when a clever quick free-kick by Xavi found him on the left-hand side of the six-yard box. He chested the ball down and then lashed it past Przemyslaw Tyton. Pique's story of redemption has mirrored Barcelona's own upturn in form in recent weeks. This was the sixth game since David Moyes' Real Sociedad sunk the blaugrana at Anoeta, and the sixth victory. Messi, who scored twice at Elche, was back to top form for Barcelona as they cruised to a 6-0 win . Mario Pasalic (right) of Elche competes for the ball with Rafinha of Barcelona during the La Liga tie . The centre-back has played a key part in the winning streak, after a start to the season that was notable only for glaring errors both off and on the pitch. Pique has really started to focus though, and it's paying dividends for Barcelona. Elche have been playing better themselves in recent weeks, matches against Barcelona aside, beating Athletic Club and Levante. They never looked like changing their poor form against Barcelona at the Martinez Valero though, and Messi doubled his side's lead from the penalty spot after Neymar was fouled by Sergio Pelegrin. The Argentine missed a penalty against Atletico Madrid in midweek, the 14th time he has failed from the spot in his career, but made no mistake here. He waited for Tyton to waver and coolly slotted into the bottom left corner. Barcelona talisman Messi steps up to slot away his second-half penalty as the Catalan giants won 6-0 . The Barcelona squad swarm around Neymar (centre) who was in fine form, scoring twice at Elche . Messi carries out his trademark celebration, pointing to the sky, after his second in Barcelona's 6-0 win . When Fajr was sent off for a second yellow card midway through the second period, it was clear the game was up for Elche. In truth, it had never really begun. Messi continued his hot streak, playing in a more central role, with Pedro on the right and Suarez on the bench. Like at the start of the season, his focus in this position was to create for his team-mates instead of trying to score himself. That was evidenced by the two goals he set up for Neymar. He slid the Brazilian in for his first and then, three minutes later, played a gorgeous chip over the top for Neymar to bag the fourth for Barcelona. Neymar celebrates another Barcelona goal as the Brazilian linked up superbly with Messi in attack once again . The Barcelona attack celebrate once again during the 6-0 demolition of Elche on Saturday afternoon . There were other sublime contributions from Messi, one similar lofted through-ball for Alba headed back towards Neymar, but the forward couldn't beat Tyton to the ball. Messi eventually scored from open play towards the end, with Marc Bartra's perfectly weighted pass coming in to the No 10's lightning-quick feet. A quick shimmy by Messi and a low, stroked finish, and the ball was nestled in the helpless Tyton's bottom-right corner. Finishing the rout off in stoppage time, making it 18-0 to Barcelona over the season and probably rubbing salt in Suarez’s wounds, was Pedro, the man who took the Uruguayan’s place, tapping home at the back post after a brilliant solo dribble by Neymar. Suarez is set to return on Wednesday against Atletico, but the pressure on his shoulders will be greater than ever.

"A Libyan man who was held by British police on suspicion of terror offences and later released has been named as a foreign terrorist by the U.S. government. Abd al-Baset Azzouz was named as an 'al Qaeda operative and trainer skilled in bomb-making' by the U.S. State Department. The father of four came to the UK from Libya in 1994 and was arrested in a 3am raid at his home in Manchester in May 2006. He was detained for nine and a half months before being released on bail. Abd al-Baset Azzouz was named as an 'al Qaeda operative and trainer skilled in bomb-making' by the U.S. State Department. He was arrested by British police in 2006, but later released . The 48-year-old left Britain in 2009 and allegedly went to Pakistan to join Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda following the death of Osama Bin-Laden. He then returned to Libya to oversee the terrorist organisation's operations there, the Sunday Telegraph reports. It is believed he oversees hundreds of fighters at a training camp in eastern Libya. A Library Of Congress report on al-Qaeda in Libya stated that Azzouz been close to al-Zawahiri since the 1980s and first traveled to Afghanistan in the early 1990s to join mujahidin fighting the Soviet occupation. It adds that he later moved to the United Kingdom, where he began spreading al-Qaeda's ideology to younger Muslims. A video that reportedly shows Azzouz, believed to have trained hundreds of al-Qaeda militants . In an interview with Cage, a group campaigning against the War on Terror, in 2008, he said: 'This is not fair - if there have been problems with me, take me to the court and try me for a crime I have committed – but not like this, not in such a horrible way as they are doing now. 'All of our Libyan friends in the UK have run away from us. I would urge Muslims and non-Muslims to see us as humans who have done nothing wrong, yet the government is trying to use us to play a game to show that they are dealing with terrorists.' Azzouz was among the two dozen individuals and groups designated as foreign terrorists or terrorist facilitators on Wednesday, enabling the U.S. to freeze assets and block financial transactions as it stepped up its offensive against Islamist militants in Syria. The U.S. State Department labeled as foreign terrorist fighters two groups and 10 people, including Amru al-Absi, the Islamic State provincial leader for Homs, Syria, who has been in charge of kidnappings, and Salim Benghalem, a French Islamic State member based in Syria. The Treasury Department named 11 individuals and one entity as specially designated global terrorists, including Tarkhan Tayumurazovich Batirashvili, a Georgia national based in Syria who has held senior military positions in Islamic State. 'Today's ... designations will disrupt efforts by ISIL, al Nusrah Front, al-Qaeda and Jamaa Islamiya to raise, transport and access funds that facilitate foreign terrorist fighters,' said David Cohen, Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. The sanctions enable the government to freeze any assets the individuals or groups have under U.S. jurisdiction and to prevent U.S. citizens and companies from engaging in any financial transactions with them.

Attendees approved a resolution demanding all countries make it a serious criminal offense for citizens to travel abroad to fight with militant groups, or to recruit and fund others to do so. The State Department designated as global terrorist organisations Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar, a Chechen-led group of mostly foreign fighters based in Syria, and Harakat Sham al-Islam, a Moroccan-led group in Syria. The Treasury Department designated one group, Hilal Ahmar Society Indonesia, which it said is the humanitarian wing of Jemaah Islamiya, a U.N.- designated terrorist group with al Qaeda links based in Southeast Asia. It said the group has engaged in activities since 2013 that support the recruitment and travel of foreign fighters for Jemaah Islamiya to Syria for military training.","Abd al-Baset Azzouz was named as an 'al Qaeda operative' by U.S.

"Showdown: Owen Paterson berated David Cameron . Sacked Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told David Cameron that getting rid of him was a ‘smash in the teeth’ for rural voters. In a blunt exchange, the Right-winger launched a fierce defence of his record in a bid to keep his Cabinet post. He told the Prime Minister sacking him would play into the hands of Ukip and demanded: ‘Do you actually want to win the Election?’ The showdown between the two, who were not alone, took place in Mr Cameron’s Commons office – and could be heard in the busy corridor outside. Within hours, details of the confrontation were circulating in Westminster bars. Mr Paterson, 58, was one of the so-called ‘male, pale and stale’ Cabinet members fired to make way for younger, female ministers. Known for his pro-fox hunting, anti-gay marriage and anti-EU views, and his sceptism over climate change, he was replaced by ‘Cameron Cutie’ Liz Truss. The 38-year-old Leeds-born economist, whose parents were both Labour supporters, has no background in farming. A senior MP said: ‘Owen was shocked to be told he was losing his job. The PM said he had to make way for new faces.’ During the 20-minute meeting, Paterson challenged Mr Cameron: ‘If you sack me it is a smash in the teeth for the 12 million people who live in the countryside. I am one of the few Conservatives who really understand them.’ The North Shropshire MP said the move risked costing the Tories the support of rural voters – and would play into the hands of Ukip. ‘If you chuck me out you are rejecting everything I have stood for,’ he protested. ‘I can out-Ukip Ukip.’ According to a well-placed source, Mr Paterson launched a passionate defence of his record, saying: ‘I have been every bit as radical in environment as Michael Gove has been at education and Iain Duncan Smith with welfare. Former Cabinet Minister Liam Fox, right, turned down a Foreign Office job offer by David Cameron, saying: ‘You must be bloody joking. I assume the ambassadorship to the moon is taken?’ The post was third in line at the Foreign Office – responsible for Nepal, the Maldives, Haiti and the Pacific Ocean. Fox said he would have taken a ‘serious’ job. It was the chance of a comeback, three years after he had to resign as Defence Secretary over his dealings with best man and former associate, the lobbyist Adam Werritty. ‘I have not been afraid to take on the greens on everything, from fracking to GM foods, the badger cull, even bees!’ Mr Paterson resisted EU moves to ban pesticides blamed for hitting the bee population, claiming it could hit food production. He went on: ‘I have reversed a 25-year consensus on the environment when it was totally dominated by the politically-correct lobbies and urban groups who know nothing about the countryside and are opposed to any form of economic growth. ‘I have proved that improving the environment and economic growth are not mutually exclusive and that you can’t have one without the other. ‘Sack me and all the green groups, Greenpeace, animal rights, people who will never vote for us, will be celebrating. ‘They’ll never vote for us anyway – and our natural supporters will think we will have abandoned them.’ A government insider said Mr Paterson’s final words to Mr Cameron were: ‘You are making a big mistake.’ The sacking of popular Mr Paterson, a skilled horseman, caused outrage in the Tory grassroots. He was the darling of the Game Fair at Blenheim Palace on Friday as well- wishers queued up to meet him. In his post-resignation letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Paterson indicated he intends to carry on speaking out. He wrote: ‘At this critical moment in our nation’s history, I have clear ideas on the future of the UK and our place in the world. I intend to continue to serve my country and constituents from the backbenches.’ Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, right, asked David Cameron to tell him he had not been given the post to ‘keep the seat warm’ for George Osborne, it was claimed last night. A senior Government insider said he fears being forced to make way for the Chancellor if the Tories win the election next year. Mr Osborne is open in his ambition to move to the Foreign Office, seeing it as a platform to achieve his long term aim of succeeding Cameron in Number 10. It isn’t known if the PM gave Hammond the assurances he wanted. Allies of former Education Secretary Michael Gove reacted angrily last night after it emerged that his successor Nicky Morgan has issued orders to ‘stop Gove’s war on teachers’. Senior sources say Ms Morgan has told her department that the ‘aggressive and confrontational’ language used by her predecessor is to stop. And she has banned the use of one of Mr Gove’s favourite derogatory terms for the teaching establishment – ‘the Blob’. But Mr Gove’s supporters called the move ‘insensitive and naïve’, and said teachers’ unions would ‘see it as a sign of weakness’. One said: ‘Nicky Morgan’s appointment is a victory for the Blob.’","Right-winger launched a fierce defence in a bid to keep his place .

"People wearing Google Glass eyewear could be banned from strip clubs, cinemas and casinos because their owners don’t want them filming there. Bosses for establishments in the US said that due to privacy concerns they would be asking anyone wearing the glasses to remove them or they won’t be let in. Lap dance clubs said that they would treat Google Glass wearers the same as anyone caught filming a stripper - and would kick them out. Scroll down for video . Google co-founder Sergey Brin wearing Glass, the firm's wearable computer. Today it was revealed establishments such as cinemas, banks, parks and even strip clubs are planning to ban them amid privacy fears . Casinos said they could help cheaters to win unfairly and cinemas said that they could be used to illegally record films and sell pirate copies. Parks departments and banks across America are also waiting to see how the new technology is used before deciding whether or not to ban them, NBC reported. Google Glass has caused concern because it has a camera next to the wearer’s eye which can take photos or record video without a red light or a shutter sound to tell others that it is working. The glasses, which cost $1,500 a pair (£980), are currently on limited release but will be more widely available later this year. Peter Feinstein, managing partner of Sapphire Gentlemen's Club in Las Vegas, said that patrons will be asked to check the eyewear when they come in. He said: ‘We've been dealing with the cellphone videoing and the picture taking over the years and we are quick to make sure that that doesn't happen in the club. ‘As the sale of (Google Glass) spreads, there'll be more people using them and wanting to use them at places such as a gentlemen's club. ‘If we see those in the club, we would do the same thing that we do to people who bring cameras into the club. Google has released a series of images showing off the glasses being used to capture video . The glasses will also be able to take part in live video chats . ‘If they don't want to check it, we'd be happy to give them a limo ride back to their hotel’. A spokesman for MGM resorts, which owns the MGM Grand Casino in Las Vegas, said that picture-taking was ‘frowned upon’ inside its properties. He said: ‘Security officers on duty ask individuals not to take pictures for the privacy of others in the casino. ‘This new product is nothing new in terms of a challenge for us, because for so many years, the very tiniest of portable lipstick and pinpoint cameras have been around.’ The MGM Grand Hotel and Casino is one of the first to ban Google Glass . Regal Entertainment Group, one of the largest cinema chains in the US, added that no recording devices were permitted into its cinemas. People wearing Google Glass style specs have already been subjected to ‘cyber discrimination’ in France. University of Toronto computer engineering professor Steve Mann was at a McDonald’s restaurant in Paris when he claims an employee tried to physically remove a similar gadget he designed from his head. He wrote about it in a blog post which sparked calls from tech website TechCrunch to boycott the fast food chain.","Fears of piracy and privacy issues with Google's wearable computer .

Republican: Cahill, left, was jailed for life for killing a policeman and later helped form the modern Provisional IRA. His niece Mairia, right, claims she was abused by a different IRA member but leadership including Gerry Adams tried her by kangaroo court . Adams admitted the IRA's kangaroo courts for sex offenders meant they were 'ill-equipped' to deal with the issue. He wrote on his blog: 'This included very sensitive areas such as responding to demands to take action against rapists and child abusers. The IRA on occasion shot alleged sex offenders or expelled them,' he said. 'While this may have been expedient at the time it was not appropriate. 'Victims were left without the necessary social service support and abusers without supervision. It ultimately failed victims and the community alike. That is a matter of profound regret for me, and many other republicans'. Today the Daily Mirror claimed the IRA's former Chief of staff Joe Cahill was photographed by a covert unit in his car but never prosecuted -  instead he was convinced to share secrets about the IRA's leadership, it was claimed today. Cahill, who died in 2004 and whose coffin was carried by Gerry Adams and  Martin McGuinness, was considered one of Britain's 'prized assets' in Northern Ireland, it was alleged. As a member of the IRA's leadership Cahill would have had detailed knowledge about its bombing campaigns and would be involved in arming members and raising funding for terrorism. Today a security services source has claimed Joe Cahill was followed around Belfast by spies in the 1970s before he was caught abusing the 14-year-old child. Officers then turned him to spy for Britain during the Troubles. 'The pictures clearly identified both Cahill and his victim,' the source told the Daily Mirror. 'Her father would have killed him if he had found out. He was never prosecuted and instead the pictures were used to turn him. He was a prized asset.' Backer: Adams sits with Cahill at his book launch in Belfast in 2002, shortly before his death . Tribute: Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness  carry Joe Cahill's coffin after he died in 2004, aged 84 . Cahill was a founding commander of the modern Provisional IRA that killed nearly 1,800 people during a failed 1970-1997 campaign to force Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom. He himself was sentenced to death for killing a policeman in the 1940s, but this was changed to a life sentence after pressure from Britain by the Irish government and the Vatican. He served less than ten years before his release but jailed again during the IRA's Border Campaign of the 1950s. The new allegations about Cahill being a double agent means he may have been working for one of several secret services units working in Northern Ireland at the time. Members would spy on Republicans and female members were known to have sex with IRA members for information. Cahill's alleged role as a British agent was only known to a small number of people but an IRA source told the Mirror there were suspicions he was an informer. Last week Adams also faced new accusations that he concealed child-abuse crimes within his own secretive movement, this time allegedly committed by a Belfast officer of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Mairia Cahill, a member of one of Belfast's top IRA families, appeared alongside a former foreign minister outside Ireland's parliament to accuse Adams of conspiring to suppress her reports of being raped by an IRA commander from Adams' home district in 1997, when she was 16. Cahill is a grand-niece of Joe Cahill, but she was not his victim. She received legal anonymity when she went to police with her accusations. In 2012 the man she accused of raping her, Martin Morris, was charged with IRA membership and 13 counts of sexual assault. He always denied her claims and was acquitted of all charges. Four others were charged with IRA membership based on Cahill's accusation that they interrogated her several times in 1999 and 2000 about her accusations against Morris, when the IRA attempted to determine whether Cahill or Morris was telling the truth. She said at one point the IRA forced her to confront Morris face to face. Prosecutors withdrew the case without explanation earlier this year. Cahill waived her anonymity in a BBC documentary broadcast last Tuesday, during which she accused Adams of telling her she might have enjoyed the abuse. Adams acknowledged meeting Cahill around that time, but rejected her account and denied knowing of any IRA inquiry into her case. History: Joe Cahill (centre left) pictured as a wanted man at an IRA news conference in 1971. His press conference ended abruptly when guards posted on nearby street corners warned of approaching British Army patrols . Last year the paedophile brother of Gerry Adams was jailed for 16 years for raping his daughter. Liam Adams, 58, was found guilty  of a string of vile sexual assaults on his child Aine Dahlstrom when she was aged between four and nine in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The 40-year-old, who has waived her right to anonymity, wiped tears from her eyes as she watched him jailed.","Joe Cahill allegedly turned by secret agents after photos of child abuse .

"Pilots could be made to wear regulation sunglasses to combat high exposure to UV light . Pilots could be made to wear regulation sunglasses or visors after a new study found them to be at high risk of skin cancer - because of their frequent exposure to strong sunlight. The rate for skin cancer among pilots is double that for other people, and this new research shows this is probably because a lot of low-level ultraviolet light is able to get in through plane windscreens. While windscreens are designed to absorb most of the high-level ultraviolet light, the low-energy UV-A, also known as 'blue light', is still harmful, and can damage their eyes. The study, carried out by Public Health England, the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) and the Civil Aviation Authority, found that during a two-hour flight from Gatwick to Malaga, pilots were being exposed to 50 times more blue light than people on the ground. It also showed that two to 10 times more  got through the windshield than was recommended for an eight-hour trip. The results have prompted action from Balpa, who are now looking into options to help fix the problem quickly. General secretary Jim McAuslan told The Observer: 'These could be standard issue sunglasses with protection from UV-A light and, in the long-term, improvements to the design of cockpit windscreens. 'We will work with airlines and regulators to further investigate the potential dangers of increased exposure to sunlight in the cockpit and agree simple and practical measures to protect pilots.' The results were collected by experts on an Airbus A321 flight last March. While blue light has not been definitively proven to be the reason for pilots' high skin cancer rates, the study does show that this is very likely. Pilots are being exposed to 50 times more harmful ultraviolet light than people on the ground . Past research shows pilots to be twice as prone to both types of malignant melanoma, though their death rates from some other types of cancer and diseases are lower. While very few pilots die from smoking-related cancer, they are double as likely to suffer from cancer related to alcohol. Sarah Williams, senior health information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: 'Being able to take accurate measurements of pilots' exposure to UV light is key in highlighting whether international safe limits for exposure are being exceeded and understanding changes that could reduce excessive exposures, such as wearing sunglasses or other eye protection.'","Research showed pilots were exposed to 50 times more UV than others .

"James Mears, 25, has been charged with killing two women in Philadelphia, one of whom was dubbed 'Grandma' because of her willingness to help . A man charged with murder has claimed the 'kind-hearted' elderly woman he is accused of killing was a crack cocaine dealer. James Mears, 25, has been charged with killing two women in Philadelphia. He is accused of murdering 67-year-old Dollie Evans, who was dubbed 'Grandma' by her neighbors because of her willingness to help those in need, in her Philadelphia kitchen. He is also on trial for the alleged murder of her house-guest, Ruby Thomas, 57, which took place in August. Mears has claimed that Evans was a crack cocaine dealer who kept large stashes of cash in her house. A court was told how he colluded with another man to rob the elderly woman and steal her drugs. In a statement to homicide detectives, Mears, who had also been living in Evans' house for the previous two months, said that in August he got a phone call from an accomplice named 'Mann.' He and Mann agreed to set up a robbery in which Mears would leave the door to the house unlocked and Mann would enter and rob Evans at gunpoint and pretend to rob Mears, too. The accomplice entered the home with a silver handgun and allegedly shot Evans as she got her purse. He then went upstairs and shot her house-guest Ms Thomas, Mears told police. The two women were shot dead inside their home where Mr Mears had also been living for the past two months . Mr Mears told a court that Dollie Evans, 67, was a crack cocaine dealer who had wads of cash in her house . According to Mr Mears' statement to homicide detectives he plotted with another man to rob Evans . Mears said 'Mann' took between $700 to $800 in cash and about $500 worth of drugs. They were supposed to share the loot a week later, but Mears said he got locked up before then. Asked why he would help another man rob an elderly woman who was housing him, Mears replied in his statement: 'For the money. It was rough times.' The investigation into the case continues.","James Mears, 25, charged with killing two women in Philadelphia .

"A devout Muslim grandmother has been jailed for four years for kidnapping and drugging her own daughter after she refused to marry the man her family wanted her to. Mother-of-eight Shamim Akhtar, 59, was jailed with her son Shamrez Khan and her son-in-law Zahid Mahmood for abusing Naila Afsar, then 23, out of 'some misplaced sense of warped family honour'. Khan, 34, was given a five-year sentence and Mahmood, 37, was jailed for four years at Burnley Crown Court today. Jailed: Shamim Akhtar (left) arrives at Burnley Crown Court with her daughter Saima Mahmood today. She was received a four-year sentence for the kidnap and false imprisonment of another daughter, Naila Afsar . Sentencing Akhtar, Judge Simon Newell . told her: 'She's your youngest daughter and your role was to care for . her, support her and look after her best interests. 'Instead you chose to control, drug and abuse her in the interests of the family reputation.' Akhtar, . of Bradford, was found guilty of kidnap, false imprisonment and two . counts of administering a drug after a four-week trial at Preston Crown . Court earlier this year. Khan, . of Bradford, and Mahmood, of Accrington, Lancashire, both pleaded . guilty to the same offences part-way through the same trial. Mrs . Afsar's family had lined up a marriage for her with her cousin but, . after some time together, she decided she wanted to end that . relationship, the court heard. She . came under sustained pressure from her family in Bradford to the extent . that she fled to Newcastle, where she thought they would not find her. In Newcastle, she met postgraduate student Afsar Saddiq. They started a relationship and later married. Mrs Afsar's brother Shamrez Khan (left) and brother-in-law Zahid Mahmood (right) were jailed for four and five years respectively . Once . settled, Mrs Afsar tried to re-establish a relationship with her family . but they began to pressure her again to divorce and restart the . relationship with her cousin. Things . came to a head in January 2010 when Khan, his mother and others . travelled to Newcastle, broke into Mrs Afsar's flat and threatened her . and her husband. She was taken to Accrington where various attempts were made to change her mind. At one point her mother said to Mrs Afsar that she was 'worse than a prostitute, you should be killed', the court heard. Judge Newell said: 'She resisted these attempts and she stood up to you.' He said Khan, who was effectively the head of the family, pushed and slapped his sister. Khan thought his sister's actions had 'brought shame and disgrace on the family, had impugned their honour'. Eventually, . Mrs Afsar was made to drink a milky liquid which contained the drug . lorazepam - described in court today as a 'date rape drug'. Mugshots: Akhtar and her son Khan travelled to Newcastle, broke into Mrs Afsar's flat and threatened her and her husband . Also jailed: Akhtar's son-in-law Mahmood Zahid . She was bundled into a car in an attempt to force her to go from Accrington to Bradford, against her will. But the police were alerted and officers pulled the vehicle over. Judge . Newell praised Mrs Afsar, saying she was an 'intelligent, educated and . articulate young woman', adding that she was 'independent, determined . and resourceful'. He said: 'She epitomised a modern young Asian woman making her life as a citizen of this country.' Judge .

"Jeremy Mathieu has lifted the lid on the row between Lionel Messi and coach Luis Enrique at Barcelona. In a turbulent week in Catalonia, Messi seemed to agitate for a move away from the Spanish side, with the fuss he caused eventually resulting in president Josep Maria Bartomeu calling the club elections a year early. Following that controversy, Barcelona have been on a strong run of form, beating champions Atletico Madrid three times. Lionel Messi (left) in action for Barcelona in their Copa del Rey clash against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday . Messi (left) and Jose Enrique (right) clashed after the former threw a tantrum in a pre-season training session, according to Barcelona defender Jeremy Mathieu . The 31-year-old, in action for Barcelona against Elche, says the argument was resolved immediately after . After Wednesday night's 3-2 Copa del Rey quarter-final victory over Diego Simeone's side, Mathieu spoke to French radio station RMC and explained how the row started. He said: 'It happened when we returned from holidays. Suddenly, because of a foul that didn't get called [in training], Leo threw a tantrum. There was some friction, some things were said. 'Afterwards, the coach spoke to him in the dressing room and that was that. It happens at every club, but because this is Barcelona it's big news. And that's the problem.' While Mathieu claims the issue ends there, the Spanish press reported several other points of tension between Messi and the coach. Speculation fuelled that Messi could be on the move after he then followed Chelsea's Instagram account . Barcelona-based newspaper Sport reported that Messi was angered by Enrique on the day the Asturian coach arrived at the club, declaring that he was the team leader. He was also upset by the club firing kitman Txema Corbella, a great ally of the players, while two other companions, Cesc Fabregas and Jose Manuel Pinto had already left in the summer. After the row, which Mathieu claims was sparked by that incident in training, Messi was dropped by Enrique for the clash against David Moyes's Real Sociedad, which Barcelona lost 1-0. Messi skipped the club's open training session the day afterwards and all hell broke loose, with the Barcelona No 10 following Chelsea on Instagram to add to the confusion.","Jeremy Mathieu has revealed that Lionel Messi and Luis Enrique clashed during a pre-season training session .

"The family at the centre of a row over a note left to gay waitress on receipt for a meal have hit back claiming the whole episode is a hoax. Dayna Morales, a former marine, hit headlines last week when a picture of a receipt she allegedly received from a family at the Gallop Asian Bistro in Bridgewater, saying they didn't 'agree with her lifestyle' was posted online and went viral. On it she claimed the customer had written: 'Sorry, I cannot tip because I do not agree with your lifestyle and the way you live your life.' Scroll Down for Video . Proof? The controversial receipt (left) shows exactly the same price, time and date of the meal as the family's copy (right) - but does not have the $18 tip the family swear they left bringing the total to $111.55 . Hoax: The family at the center of the controversy of whether or not they tipped a gay waitress at a New Jersey restaurant have denied they are bigoted and more importantly can prove they did tip the waitress . Confirmation: This credit card statement the family possess allegedly proves that they paid a tip and their bill came to a total of $111.55 as shown on their receipt and that something has gone wrong at the New Jersey restaurant . Bemused: Morales denied any impropriety at all - claiming that someone had written that note and not provided her with a tip and that the handwriting was not hers - while the father of the family denies any inference of homophobia . Miss Morales said she felt offended and upset by the comment branding the couple 'ignorant' and received thousands of messages of support online. But now a New Jersey family have come forward claiming to be the customers involved and producing a receipt printed at the same time on the same date, for the same amount, except with an $18 tip. They . contacted NBCNewYork.com after seeing news reports of Miss Morales' story and claim the whole thing is hoax designed to provoke reaction. To . prove their point they also produced a Visa bill, which indicated . their card was charged for the $93.55 meal plus the tip, for a total of . $111.55. Upset: Dayna Morales, pictured left while a . marine and right, said she was offended and hurt by how the couple, with . two small children, treated her while she served them at Gallop Asian . Bistro in Breakwater Wednesday . The husband said far from being homophobic he actually refused to vote for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie because the governor opposes same-sex marriage. 'Never would a message like that come from us,' he protested. Morales announced last week she would donate thousands of dollars in gratuities from supporters to the Wounded Warrior Project. But the wife countered this gesture of apparent good will saying: ' I just felt like people have a right to know that - it's fine if people want to donate to her or to the Wounded Warriors but they're doing it under a false pretense. The restaurant reportedly could not produce the original receipt nor explain why the family was charged for the tip amount for the meal last Wednesday. Suspicious: A reporter from NBC New York went to confront the owners of the restaurant as to why their customer was billed - including their tip - but their gay waitress received an abusive message and no tip . It told the station it was aware of the couple's claims and that an internal investigation is ongoing. Morales claimed that she felt judged by the family began as soon as she introduced herself.

She sent the receipt for the meal to Have A Gay Day . and the LGBT Facebook Group posted it online, where it . garnered hundreds of supportive comments. In an email at the time . Morales said she was upset she'd served in the marines to protect such . ignorant Americans and was concerned about the example the couple were . setting for their children. Still working: Morales has not been fired while an investigation is underway. She was also given thousands of dollars by well-wishers which she said she'd give to the Wounded Warriors charity . 'Never in a million years did I think this would happen,' she told Have A Gay Day. 'I am THOROUGHLY offended, mad, p***ed off and hurt that THIS is what her kids will grow up learning and that I served in the Marines to keep ignorant people like them free. 'Sorry lady but I don't agree with YOUR lifestyle and the way you're raising your kids but you didn't see me throwing that in your face and giving you shitty service.' Morales' story was met with an outpouring of support online, with a heterosexual Facebook user commenting, 'as a member of the heterosexual community, I beg your forgiveness for these ignorant people' and another wrote 'I hope those parents get publicly humiliated enough to never leave their house again! I feel sorry for their kids.' Morales later responded that it took every fiber of her being not to spit in the couple's food, but her faith in humanity was now restored.

"A man wielding a knife was able to jump the White House fence just over a week ago. Now, the Secret Service has been accused of fumbling its response to another threat. Officers allegedly performed a string of security lapses after gunman Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez fired around eight bullets at the executive mansion in November 2011. 'Fumbled': The Secret Service allegedly performed a string of security lapses after Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez fired at the White House in 2011. Above, officers examine a broken window after the attack . Damage: Ortega-Hernandez parked his black Honda south of the White House, before pointing his gun at the home of President Barack Obama and firing off a series of bullets. One smashed this window (pictured) Jailed: Earlier this year, Ortega-Hernandez, from Idaho, was sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to firing an assault rifle at the White House . Ortega-Hernandez parked his black Honda south of the Washington building, before pointing his semi-automatic pistol out of the passenger window. He then aimed it directly at the home of President Barack Obama and fired off a series of bullets, one of which smashed a window on the second floor, just inches from the first family's living room. It was only stopped from going inside the White House by the bulletproof glass interior layer behind it . Another bullet got stuck in a window frame, while others smashed into the roof, causing nearly $100,000 worth of damage.

Although President Obama, his wife Michelle and their older daughter Malia were not at home at the time, their younger daughter Sasha and Mrs Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, were inside. In accordance with protocol, Secret Service officers rushed to respond, with one stationed under the second-floor terrace withdrawing her handgun and snipers on the roof preparing for action. However, they reportedly halted their response when they were wrongly informed, 'No shots have been fired... stand down', by their supervisor. The supervisor claimed the noise had instead stemmed from the backfire from a nearby construction vehicle, according to information obtained by the Washington Post. Executive mansion: It apparently took the Secret Service four days to conclude that gunshots had struck the White House (pictured) - with their findings mainly based on the discovery of broken glass by a housekeeper . It apparently took the Secret Service four days to conclude that gunshots had struck the White House - with their findings mainly based on the discovery of broken glass by a housekeeper. Supervisors had previously come up with a number of theories, including the possibility that two gangs had got into a gunfight near the mansion's front lawn, it is reported. The recent allegations were unearthed by the newspaper following interviews with agents, investigators and government officials, as well as the review of hundreds of documents. Earlier this year, Ortega-Hernandez, from Idaho, was sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to firing an assault rifle at the White House. Previous incident: Last week, Omar Gonzalez, 42, was arrested inside the Presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn (pictured), the Secret Service said . Ortega-Hernandez's lawyers had asked for a 10-year sentence, arguing he was suffering from extreme depression and was under the misguided belief that Armageddon was coming. Although prosecutors had initially charged Ortega-Hernandez with attempting to assassinate President Obama, they agreed to drop the charge as part of a plea deal last year. Meanwhile, last week, Omar Gonzalez, 42, was arrested inside the Presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn, the Secret Service said. President Obama and his family were not in the mansion at the time. White House pair: Gonzalez, a 42-year-old Iraq veteran (left) and Kevin Carr, a 19-year-old college student (right) were both arrested after trying to get into the White House within 24 hours of one another . And just one day later, Kevin Carr, 19, was taken in by officers after allegedly driving a car up to a screening point then refusing to leave when he was asked. The two attempts to gain entry to the White House prompted the Secret Service to increase security by stepping up patrols around the building. It has been suggested they could set up security checkpoints around the building for the public. Both Secret Service and White House spokesmen declined to comment to the newspaper.","Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez fired eight bullets at White House in 2011 .

"The door has been opened for Chelsea to sign Filipe Luis after Atletico Madrid had an offer close to £8million accepted for Guilherme Siqueira. The Blues are looking to sign a left back to replace the departing Ashley Cole. Luis was one of Diego Simeone's key players during Atletico's run to the Champions League final and their La Liga triumph. Is that the way to Madrid? Guilherme Siqueira will be playing for Atletico next season after Granada accepted a bid of nearly £8m . Top target: Filipe Luis (right) is Chelsea's prime candidate to replace Ashley Cole . Siqueira, on loan at Benfica last season from Granada, was also in fine form as the Portuguese giants reached the Europa League final. Benfica had an option to purchase the defender themselves but decided not to pay, so Atletico swooped in. Siqueria, 28, had been linked with a move to Real Madrid last summer. The Brazilian is currently in his home country on holiday but will fly to Madrid in the next few days to seal the deal. It means Chelsea can make their move for Luis, which could cost them up to £19.4m. Shoring up the flanks? Luis battles Cesar Azpilicueta in the Champions LEague semi-final . The end of an era: Ashley Cole will leave Stamford Bridge after eight sensational seasons . Luis, also 28, helped his side concede just 26 times in 38 matches as they won La Liga for the first time in almost two decades. Cole had been sidelined by Jose Mourinho for much of last season with Cesar Azpilicueta, a right-back, playing out of position in his place.

Virus: The Ebola virus epidemic has killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa . The virus continues to spread in the hardest-hit West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone . The smaller outbreaks in both countries started when . infected travelers crossed borders after the Ebola outbreak in . West Africa had begun to raise alarms among public health . experts. At least 3,091 people have died from Ebola since the . West African outbreak was first reported in the remote southeast . forest region of Guinea in March. The first case in Nigeria was a traveler exposed to Ebola in . Liberia, who flew by commercial airline to Lagos on July 20, . where he was immediately transported to a private hospital with . symptoms of fever, vomiting and diarrhea.

Outbreak: Officials warn tens of thousands may die from Ebola . China's first high-security biosafety laboratory will be ready for use by December, in a move hailed as a 'crucial' moment in the fight against pathogens such as the Ebola virus, officials said Tuesday. The facility, which has been under construction since July 2011, has been billed as the first in China that will be equipped to handle Class 4 pathogens - dangerous viruses that pose a high risk of airborne person-to-person transmission, which can include haemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola, and others. The laboratory in Wuhan, Hubei province, was built in cooperation with French bio-industrial firm Institut Merieux and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It joins just a handful of labs around the world cleared to handle the most highly pathogenic germs. The Wuhan P4 laboratory comes 'at a crucial moment', said Institut Merieux president Alain Merieux in Beijing. 'Now we are all working side by side on Ebola,' he added, referring to French and Chinese efforts to address the crisis in affected African countries. As of September 24, healthcare personnel identified a total . of 19 laboratory-confirmed Ebola cases and one probable case, as . well as 894 contacts with those patients. In addition, contact . tracers conducted 18,500 face-to-face visits checking for signs . of Ebola symptoms. No new cases have emerged. The first confirmed case in Senegal occurred in August in a . 21-year-old Guinean man who traveled from his home in Guinea to . Dakar to visit family. Medical personnel learned of the man's possible exposure . from Guinean health authorities after his mother and sister had . been admitted to an Ebola unit on August 26 and identified the . young man as a contact. All three were likely exposed when . preparing the body of the patient's brother - who died of Ebola . in Guinea on August 10 - for burial. Senegalese health workers identified a total of 67 contacts . of the patient. All were monitored for Ebola for 21 days with no . further Ebola cases. The patient recovered and was released on . September 19. It comes as Federal health officials on Tuesday confirmed the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the U.S., a male patient who recently traveled from Liberia to Dallas. The unidentified patient was critically ill and has been in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital since Sunday, officials said. Health authorities have begun tracking down family and friends who may have had close contact with the patient and could be at risk for becoming ill. But officials said there are no other suspected cases in Texas. The Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital patient traveled from Liberia on September 19 and arrived in the United States the next day, without showing symptoms of the deadly virus, CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters in a press conference filmed by NBC News. The patient, Frieden said, started to show signs of the virus September 24 and then 'sought care' on the 26th. Frieden said two days later the patient was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas and isolated. It has been reported that the patient would not be given the experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp - because there is none of it left.","In Nigeria no new cases of Ebola have occurred since August 31 .

"Thirteen members of the same family, including six children, have been killed by pro-government forces in Syria, a human rights group says. Some of the Fatouh family were burned alive at their home in Bayda, north-west Syria, some reports say, while others suggest they were shot first before the house was set on fire. Three men were shot dead before four women and six children were gathered in one room and killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Fatalities in Baniyas, Syria. Baniyas is a Sunni . Muslim pocket in the middle of a large Alawite enclave on Syria's . Mediterranean coast . Fighters from the Free Syrian Army targets one of the bastions of the regimes forces in Aleppo, Syria . Syrian rebels seized a strategic village on the edge of the northern city of Aleppo on Monday, activists said . The family was fasting at the time of the attack at their home near the coastal city of Baniyas, the scene of a previous massacre where more than 140 died in May. 'The three men, unarmed, were shot . dead outside their home. The militiamen then broke in, and killed the . women and the children,' the Observatory's director Rami Abdel Rahman . told AFP. Mr Abdel Rahman . said the family was killed by the National Defense Force and that his . organisation had heard conflicting reports as to how the women and . children died. Columns of smoke billowing as a result of heavy bombing, in the countryside outside of Aleppo Syria . Heavy bombing in Damascus has led to countless fatalities. Britain has sent help to the Free Syrian Army, including communications equipment, but has not taken a decision on sending weapons . The UK-based Observatory relies activists on the ground in Syria for news. Mr Abdel Rahman said the slaughter was a revenge attack for the deaths of four Alawite members of the NDF. Tensions . between members of the Alawite faith, who count President Bashar . Al-Assad among their number, and Sunni Muslims are long held. Baniyas is a Sunni Muslim pocket in the . middle of a large Alawite enclave on Syria's Mediterranean coast, and . activists in the area accuse militias loyal to Assad of ethnic . cleansing. 'The Baniyas . area is home to a mixture of Sunnis and Alawites. On Saturday, four . Alawite members of the National Defense Force were killed in fighting . there,' he told AFP. 'The pro-regime militiamen took revenge for their deaths by killing this family.' The . news of the massacre comes as the Prime Minister told the BBC that . opposition efforts to overthrow Assad, supported by Britain, were at a . 'stalemate'. Elsewhere, bodies of rebel fighters were pictured after an ambush yesterday by President Assad's forces in Adra, near Damascus. The picture was issued by the state-run news agency Sana . Thirteen members of the Fatouh family were killed at their house in Bayda, near the coastal city Baniyas, according to a human rights group . Britain has sent help to the Free Syrian . Army, including communications equipment, but has not taken a decision . on sending weapons amid growing fears over some of the rebels’ Al Qaeda . links. David Cameron told the Andrew Marr Show that Syria, which plunged into civil war more . than two years ago, was ‘on a depressing trajectory’ and President . Bashar Al Assad is ‘stronger than he was a few months ago’. Mr Cameron said it was right to . continue to support the opposition. ‘You do have problems with part of . the opposition which is extreme, that we should have nothing to do . with,’ he said. ‘But that is not a reason for pulling up the drawbridge, putting our head in the sand and doing nothing’. The slaughter of the family was said to be revenge for the deaths of four members of the National Defense Force, which supports President Bashar Al Assad . In May, about 140 people died over two days of sectarian massacres by pro-Assad militias in Bayda and Baniyas. Meanwhile, in and around Damascus, government troops killed at least 75 rebels over 24 hours, the Observatory said. It was one of the deadliest single-day tolls for opposition fighters in recent months. The death toll included 49 rebels killed in an ambush in Damascus' northeastern suburb of Adra early Sunday. An elite Republican Guard unit attacked the rebels as they were trying to push into the capital, and that the government commander leading the operation also died in the ensuing gunbattle, the Observatory said. The Syrian state news agency SANA also reported the ambush, without giving a casualty figure. Damascus and its suburbs have been a key battlefield for over a year, with rebels trying to push into its center from strongholds in the suburbs. Some of President Bashar Assad's most reliable units, including the Republican Guard and the 4th Division commanded by his younger brother Maher, are charged with its defense and have been trying to flush out rebels from the enclaves. The Observatory reported that another 17 rebels died in fighting Sunday in clashes in Damascus neighborhoods of Qaboun and Jobar, while another nine were killed in clashes that have raged in the suburbs of Daraya, Harasta and Douma. Syrian rebels seized a strategic village on the edge of the northern city of Aleppo today, the Observatory said, just hours after other opposition fighters sustained some of their heaviest losses in months. The capture of Khan al-Assal is a rare bright spot in recent months for Syria's rebels, who have been battered by government forces on several fronts since June. The Observatory says opposition fighters took full control of Khan al-Assal on the western outskirts of Aleppo today. Clashes . were ongoing near the village, including inside Aleppo, and several . rebel-held districts were hit by airstrikes, according to the . Observatory, an anti-regime activists group that relies on reports from . activists on the ground. Britain is supporting the Free Syrian Army, with one of the force's fighters seen inside a burned-out house in Deir al-Zor yesterday . Aleppo, Syria's largest city, has been a major front in the nation's 2-year-old conflict. Rebels seized control of much of the city, and swaths of the surrounding territory, during an offensive one year ago. Khan al-Assal has been a major front in the fight for the city. In March, chemical weapons were allegedly used in the village, killing more 31 people. The Syrian government and the rebels blame each other for the attack, and both have demanded an international investigation. More than 93,000 people have died in Syria's conflict, which started in largely peaceful protests against Assad but turned into a civil war. It has taken on an increasingly sectarian tone, pitting mostly Sunni Muslim rebels against a regime dominated by Alawites, an offshoot sect of Shiite Islam. Assad's troops have in recent weeks seized the momentum in the conflict, attacking rebels in Damascus and also in the north.","The Fatouh family were at their home in Bayda, on the coast, when attacked .

"More than 500 prisoners escaped when suicide bombers drove cars packed with explosives into two Baghdad jails, including the notorious Abu Ghraib, in a well planned military-style assault that left at least 10 police officers and four militants dead. The audacious breakout will underline concerns that experienced Al Qaeda commanders and fighters held in Iraq will now join terrorist groups fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad raising further questions about the decision by Britain and the U.S. to help opposition groups. Maximum security: Abu Ghraib prison, pictured in 2009 following a renovation, was home to some of the world's most dangerous terrorists. (File photo) Officials also warned that it could lead to an increase in the already mounting number of sectarian attacks across Iraq. A surge of violence across Iraq has killed more than 3,000 people since the start of April, and the assaults on the prisons laid bare the degree to which security has eroded in the country in recent months. The increase in bloodshed is intensifying fears of a return to the widespread sectarian killing that pushed the country to the brink of civil war after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Significantly, The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which was formed earlier this year through a merger between Al Qaeda’s affiliates in Syria and Iraq, said it had carried out the attacks on Abu Ghraib and Taji jails after months of preparation. Monday’s attack came exactly a year after the leader of al Qaeda’s Iraqi branch, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, launched a campaign dubbed 'Breaking the Walls' that made freeing its imprisoned members its top priority. The deadly raid on the high-security jails happened as Sunni Muslim militants are gaining momentum in their insurgency against the Shi’ite-led government that came to power after the U.S. invasion to oust Saddam Hussein. Attacked: As many as 500 inmates - including senior al Qaeda members - are thought to have escaped after terrorists launched a military assault on Abu Ghraib prison. (File photo) Suicide bombers drove cars packed with explosives to the gates of the prison on the outskirts of Baghdad and blasted their way into the compound, while gunmen attacked guards with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. Other militants took up positions near the main road, fighting off security reinforcements sent from Baghdad as several militants wearing suicide vests entered the prison on foot to help free the inmates. ‘This big security failure shows that the top security commanders have failed to sort out any solutions for the on-going security deterioration,’ said Shawan Mohammed Taha, one of the lawmakers who confirmed the escapes. ‘The terrorists, not the security forces, are now taking the initiative.’ Sunni insurgents, including the Al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq, have been regaining strength in recent months and striking on an almost daily basis against Shi’ite Muslims and security forces amongst other targets. Caged: Iraqi detainees wait to be released at Abu Ghraib prison, west of Baghdad in Iraq - which was the scene of a mass jailbreak by al Qaeda terrorists this morning. (File photo) The violence has raised fears of a return to full-blown conflict in a country where Kurds, Shi’ite and Sunni Muslims have yet to find a stable way of sharing power. Recent attacks have targeted mosques, amateur football matches, shopping areas and cafes where people gather to socialise after breaking their daily fast for the holy Muslim month of Ramadan. Relations between Islam’s two main denominations have been put under further strain from the civil war in Syria, which has drawn in Shi’ite and Sunni fighters from Iraq and beyond to fight against each other. In the city of Mosul, 240 miles north of Baghdad, a suicide bomber detonated a vehicle packed with explosives behind a military convoy in the eastern Kokchali district, killing at least 22 soldiers and three passers-by, police said. Following the attack, leaflets were found near mosques in Mosul signed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Four other policemen, were killed in a separate attack in western Mosul, Iraq’s third-largest city and capital of the Sunni-dominated Nineveh province. Nearly 600 people have been killed in militant attacks across Iraq so far this month, according to violence monitoring group Iraq Body Count. Infamous: An Iraqi prisoner reads the Quran before his release at Abu Ghraib prison, west of Baghdad, Iraq, which has become infamous after details of the torture of detainees at the hands of U.S. guards emerged. (File photo) Torture: Abu Ghraib was made notorious a decade ago by photographs showing abuse of prisoners by U.S. soldiers . The U.S. military previously operated the lock-ups in Taji and Abu Ghraib but handed control of both facilities back to Iraqi authorities before the last American troops departed in December 2011. Abuse of prisoners at the hands of American guards inside Abu Ghraib sparked outrage around the world and helped fuel anti-American sentiment in Iraq. Jailbreaks are relatively common in Iraq. A dozen prisoners, including al-Qaida-linked death row inmates, escaped from the Taji prison in January after seizing guards’ weapons. And in September, scores more inmates got away following clashes at a prison in Saddam Hussein’s hometown of Tikrit that left 12 people dead.","Fears raised that freed inmates may join terror groups in Syria .

"Former world boxing champion Hector 'Macho' Camacho has been declared brain dead today after being shot in his native Puerto Rico, with his family facing the agonizing decision of taking him off life support as his condition worsened. Doctors had earlier said Camacho would survive after he was shot in the face while sitting in a car on Tuesday night in his hometown of Bayamon. A stash of cocaine was found in the vehicle where Camacho and his friend were shot during a drive-by, police said. However his condition deteriorated overnight and his heart stopped at one point, said Dr Ernesto Torres, director of the Centro Medico trauma center in San Juan. Scroll down for video . Shot: Camacho was declared clinically brain dead on Thursday at Centro Medico, the trauma center in San Juan . Ambush: The body of a man who was in the car with the champion boxer, believed to be his driver, lies on the ground following the shooting as police look on . Bout: Hector Camacho, right, throws a punch at Troy Lowry in a 2001 fight . 'It would be a miracle for him to recuperate,' Dr Torres said on Wednesday. Specialists consulted with Camacho's mother Maria Matias, who arrived from the U.S. mainland, and had a nervous attack at the hospital. The family faced the agonizing choice of when he should be removed from life support, said Ismael Leandry, a longtime friend and former manager who was also at the hospital. The 50-year-old Camacho was outside a bar in a parked car with Adrian Mojica Moreno, a convicted criminal, when he was shot in the face. There were ten baggies of cocaine with them and one was open, according to TMZ. Moreno was killed at the scene. No arrests have been made and no . motive has been disclosed.

At . least one gunman opened fire on their vehicle in the . city of Bayamon. The bullet struck Camacho in the . jaw but exited his head and lodged in his right shoulder and fractured . two vertebrae, Torres said. Dr Torres had said the boxer, who was . trailed by drug and alcohol problems during a career that included some . high-profile bouts, could be paralyzed from the shooting. 'Camacho's condition is extremely delicate,' he told Telenoticias. 'His physical condition will help him but we will see.' Fallen champion: Hector Camacho was shot in the face while in a car outside a bar in Puerto Rico . Camacho's representative Steve Tannenbaum said he was told by friends at the hospital that the boxer would make it. 'This guy is a cat with nine lives. He's been through so much,' he said. 'If anybody can pull through it will be him.' The fighter's last title bout came against then-welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya in 1997, a loss by unanimous decision. Tannenbaum said he was going to fight two years ago in Denmark until his opponent pulled out and that they were looking at a possible bout in 2013. 'We were talking comeback even though he is 50,' he said. 'I felt he was capable of it.' Camacho was born in Bayamon, one of the cities that make up the San Juan metropolitan area. He won super lightweight, lightweight and junior welterweight world titles in the 1980s. Camacho has fought other high-profile bouts in his career against Felix Trinidad, Julio Cesar Chavez and Sugar Ray Leonard. Camacho knocked out Leonard in 1997, ending what was that former champ's final comeback attempt. VIDEO: Hector Camacho is rushed to the hospital after being shot .

Camacho has a career record of 79-5-3, with his most recent fight coming in 2009. Drug and alcohol problems have trailed Camacho since the prime of his boxing career. He was sentenced in 2007 to seven years in prison for the burglary of a computer store in Mississippi. During the arrest in January 2005, police found him in possession of ecstasy. A judge eventually suspended all but one year of the sentence and gave Camacho probation. He wound up serving two weeks in jail after violating his probation. He divorced from his wife several years ago after she filed multiple domestic abuse complaints against him. Camacho was born in Puerto Rico but raised in Spanish Harlem, New York.

"A cop has described the horrific moment three ferrets attacked a one-month-old baby girl, leaving her with no nose, no top lip and just one cheek. Skyy Isabelle Fraime was reportedly placed in a car seat and left on the floor of the dining room at the house in Darby Borough, Pennsylvania, on Thursday while her parents went upstairs. A short time later, the family's three ferrets escaped from their nearby cloth-like cage and ran over to the lone infant. They attacked her, sinking their teeth into 25 per cent of her face.

"Former Liverpool target Xherdan Shaqiri is free to leave Bayern Munich this January, according to club president Franz Beckenbauer. The talented Swiss midfielder has failed to hold down a regular starting berth at the German champions since moving from Basle in the summer of 2012. And now Beckenbauer has admitted Shaqiri, who has only managed 26 Bundesliga starts for Bayern, can leave the club when the transfer window opens this winter.

"A Florida pizza delivery girl who miraculously survived being shot in the face and disfigured on Halloween night by a masked mugger has left the hospital with message of hope. 'Stay positive and just be yourself and love yourself,' 20-year-old Lindsey Cooper told WPBF viewers last week. 'That’s how I am. And even with my face looking like this, I still love every bit of myself.' Cooper lost part of her jaw when the man in a skeleton mask fired at her in front of her West Palm Beach home and stole her purse. Scroll down for video . Shocking crime: Lindsey Cooper, 20, was shot in the face on Halloween night after her pizza delivery shift . Gruesome: The 20-year-old lost part of her jaw and many of her teeth after the man in a skeleton mask blasted off part of her face to steal just $40 . But, she says, 'I’m stronger than that person...[I'm] not angry, not mad, just disappointed. For somebody to just do that.' Cooper was returning home from her shift as a Papa John's delivery driver when a man in a skeleton mask allegedly shot her in the face and nabbed her purse with just $40 in tip money. 'I just don’t understand why somebody would do that to my daughter, over tip money, Lindsey's mother Dawn Cooper told WPTV in tears. 'I heard a pop. I was asleep in my room right there. It woke me up. It was just one pop and I thought it was a firework,' Dawn Cooper said. Lindsey's mother recalls her daughter frantically running into their Coconut Grove home clasping her chin.

Lindsey was treated at St. Mary’s Medical Center where she had reconstructive surgery and had her mouth wired shut. In recovery: Lindsey underwent reconstructive surgery and has had to have her mouth wired shut . Tragic: 20-year-old Lindsey was only a few feet from her front door on Coconut Road when she was shot in the face for her tip money she earned delivering pizza .

"High flyer: The Baroness Ashton of Upholland will be transported in style . EU chiefs were yesterday accused of living the ‘high life’ at taxpayers’ expense after signing a £10million deal for the use of private jets to fly them around the world. Baroness Ashton, the EU’s foreign policy chief, is among the eurocrats who will enjoy use of the jets for their globetrotting. From tomorrow, the Labour peer will be able to use a choice of aircraft – including the Falcon 7X jet and Boeing 737 – when she travels abroad for EU business. Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, and Herman van Rompuy, president of the European Council, are among other dignitaries who will benefit from the agreement with Belgian firm Abelag. The news of the deal – estimated to be worth as much as £10.3million over the next four years – comes after Britain reacted with fury to the EU’s demands to increase its budget by seven per cent. The Commission’s proposal would increase the Brussels budget by 6.8 per cent to nearly £114billion. Britain’s share, at around 12.5 per cent, would be £16.6billion – a rise of more than £1billion. Lady Ashton has demanded an extra £23million to run the EU’s foreign service – despite her promise that it would be ‘budget neutral’ when she was appointed as its foreign minister in 2009. Her 5.7 per cent increase takes the annual bill for EU diplomats and embassies to £422million, at a cost to British taxpayers of £52million in EU contributions. Speaking of the private-jet deal, Martin Callanan, a senior Tory MEP, said: ‘Coming just days after Commission leaders put forward a preposterous set of budget proposals, claiming they were doing all they could to save money, this confirms they really have no shame. No expense spared: The Falcon 7X private jet deal cost £10m . ‘They have lost their moral and financial compass and they are prepared to ensure they get to live the high life, whatever the expense and whatever other people’s hardship. ‘They seem to live in their own little bubble where they are perpetually pampered.’ The European Commission insisted the deal would, in the long term, save money. It argued that the £10.3million sum was essentially a retainer payment and was the maximum that would be spent during the next four years. A spokesman said: ‘The contract that comes into effect on Tuesday will run for up to four years. It sets a total ceiling of 12million euros over the four years. This is therefore the maximum possible expenditure for all EU institutions... We don’t pay anything when we do not use this service.’ Details of expenditure by European commissioners has revealed that £6.6million has already been spent on the hire of private jets in the four years to 2010. Last October, Lady Ashton, the vice-president of the European Union, came under fire after she headed off on a trip to a five-star hotel in Australia. As European leaders struggled to save the euro, she flew to Perth where she attended a three-day Commonwealth heads of government meeting. Critics said the entire trip was a waste of time and totally irrelevant to her job. She has previously been criticised for her slow reaction to international crises.",Baroness Ashton is one of the Eurocrats to benefit .
"A man has filmed himself drinking three live goldfish in the latest shocking twist in the 'NekNominate' drinking craze. The yob - believed to be from Derby - drank the fish from a pint glass containing a disgusting concoction of cider, raw eggs, engine oil and his own urine. The RSPCA has spoken out against the 'horrible craze' after receiving numerous reports of people drinking live fish and posting the footage online. Sick: A man has filmed himself drinking a pint of filthy liquids with three live goldfish in it . Preparations: The man poured a pint of cider mixed with raw eggs and engine oil . NekNominate is a new trend which sees web users filming themselves drinking large amounts of alcohol and performing other outlandish stunts. It came under fire this week after two young men died in Ireland while participating in the craze. In the video of the man downing the goldfish, he can be seen smiling at the camera dressed in just a satin thong and a bow tie. Viewers praised the stunt, egging on the man in his quest to be deliberately outrageous. One wrote: 'Smashed it, knew you would come good, the fishes are your secret weapon.' Foul: The man urinated into the glass before putting three live goldfish in too . Another said, 'That should go viral, hats off mate, that's class,' while a third added: 'That's by far the sickest I've seen. Gagged watching it.' The RSPCA is investigating more than a dozen reports of animal cruelty from people who have watched video footage of goldfish being drunk by NekNominate participants. 'We are extremely concerned about this shocking new trend,' said wildlife scientist Nicola White. 'We have had quite a few similar cases reported to us in a very short space of time - but this could be just the tip of the iceberg as there's probably many more we have not been told about. 'Eating a live animal and posting of a film of it on the internet is not some light-hearted joke - it is unacceptable. It sends out a clear message that animal cruelty is OK as long as it is in the guise of entertainment. 'We urge people not to take part in this horrible craze and to report to us anyone who is taking part.' Praise: Other web users spoke in support of the man's antics, with one saying 'hats off' The NekNominate craze is thought to have originated in Perth, Australia, but thanks to social media it has since gone global. The hashtag 'neknominate' started trending in the UK in January 2013 and has since been growing in popularity around the world. The . concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck . your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a d**k. The social drinking game for social media! #neknominate. Drink . Responsible'. The stunt is filmed then posted on the internet. One . popular video shows a bare-chested man emptying a bottle of beer down . the toilet before two friends lower him head-first into the porcelain . bowl to lap it up. Superintendent Gary Parkin of Derbyshire Police said: 'Drinking large amounts of alcohol in a short space of time can have very serious consequences. 'Social media is used for many different things, both good and bad, and clearly this is at the wrong end of the scale. Challenging each other to drink more and more, often different and stronger alcoholic drinks, will cause harm and damage. 'It is obvious from recent stories and incidents that people have lost control trying to better people they know either as friends or through social media and have ended up in A&E or, more tragically, have died. 'I would urge people to act with responsibility when drinking alcohol and avoid putting themselves in unnecessary danger.' Other NekNominate-related incidents to hit the headlines include a woman apparently riding into Tesco on a horse before downing a fizzy drink. However, some people have attempted to turn the trend on its head by using it to spread positive behaviour such as donating blood, rather than binge drinking.","Man dressed in thong and bow tie is filmed drinking sick concoction .

"He lets the seven tigers live in his house, swim in his pool and even give his baby granddaughter rides on their back. And now Brazilian tiger-lover Ary Borges wants to build an eco-park at his home in Maringa, near Sao Paulo, for the giant predators. The father-of-three refuses to accept being so close to the 35-stone animals is dangerous and insists if he gives them respect, they will respond. Scroll down for video . Dangerous: Ary Borges' granddaughter Rayara is allowed to ride on the back of the family's seven tigers, despite protests from her father that it is not safe . Family affair: Ary's (left) two-year-old granddaughter Rayara (right) is even allowed to play with the tigers under the supervision of mother Uyara (right) and aunts Daniella (second left) and Nayara (centre) Friends: Nayara says she swims with Tom the tiger three times a week to keep him in shape . Borges rescued two tigers from a circus eight years ago and built a sanctuary in his garden before launching a breeding programme. He was forced to call an end to it when the authorities realised he was breeding the big cats without a permit. Borges, 43, said: 'I was never worried about my daughters co-existing with these animals. 'You have to show the animals respect and love - that's how you get it back from them.' He and his daughters Nayara, 20, Uyara, 23, and Deusanira, 24, walk the tigers on leads and feed meat directly into their mouths. They even allow them into their kitchen during mealtime and let them lounge around the house. Incredibly, Uraya, who also works as a dog trainer, is happy for daughter Rayara to interact with the massive predators with minimal safety precautions. She said: 'Rayara loves playing with the tigers - she sees my dad interacting with them and she goes crazy. Bizarre: The family's pet chihuahua is perched on top of Tom the tiger inside their home . Unusual: Nayara holds onto the 35-stone tiger's back as it paddles through the water . Ary Borges plays with two of his seven pet tigers at his home in Maringa, Brazil . 'But it's safe. I would never expose her to a dangerous situation. 'Every day since they were born we have taken care of them and fed them so their instincts become dormant. 'They are part of the family. I can't imagine life without them.' Nayara regularly takes a dip with 35-stone tiger, Tom, clinging to his back as he paddles through the water. She said: 'I swim with Tom three times per week to help keep him in shape. 'He wouldn't get in the water with anyone else now - he associates the pool with me.' Despite having no training in animal handling, Borges began to breed tigers at his property to secure their survival. Bond: Borges said living with the tigers is not dangerous because by showing 'the animals respect and love - that's how you get it back from them' Pet: Like a dog or a cat, the tigers are allowed to live inside the family home and even in their bedrooms . Crazy: The predators sit in the kitchen while the family eat and are fed meat directly into their mouths . He hoped to boost their numbers to . counteract the worldwide decimation of the species, and one day release . captive tigers back into the wild. But he was later forced to discontinue a breeding program after officials told him he needed a permit. Now he plans to open a 40-acre ecopark in Maringa where his animals can roam free. But not everyone in the family is happy about being in such close proximity to the lethal carnivores. Uyara's husband, Rafael, worries that his daughter is being put in harm's way. He said: 'I think her interaction with the animals is dangerous, they can be lethal. Ambition: Borges, pictured with vet Livia Pereira Teixeira, 29, wants to open an eco-park for the animals . Not allowed: The tiger lover started a breeding programme but was forced to stop because he did not have a permit . 'I'm very afraid, I try to avoid any sort of contact as much as I can. I'd prefer her to be more distant from them too.' Borges hopes to get permission to build his park to educate people about the plight of endangered tigers in the wild. He said: 'Today tigers are worth more dead than alive. 'The claws are used to make lucky charms, the penis is used as an aphrodisiac and in China they use the bones to make wine. 'I want to own an eco park that focuses on always bettering the lives of these animals - I have a soft spot for tigers.'","Ary Borges rescued two tigers from circus and started breeding programme .

"A former senior courtier has claimed that bowing and curtsying for the Queen is 'not necessary' as Her Majesty is 'very relaxed' about it all. Dickie Arbiter, who spent 12 years at Buckingham Palace and Clarence House as press secretary, also said in a new memoir that people do not even have to wait for the Queen to speak first when they meet her. In the book, On Duty With the Queen, he said: 'What may have befitted the social mores of the 18th and 19th centuries wasn't necessarily right for modern times. 'Bowing or curtsying when in the presence of a member of the Royal family? Not necessary. Not unless one chooses to.' Vivien Leigh curtsies to the Queen as she arrived at Leicester Square Theatre for the Royal premiere of the film 'Richard III' starring Sir Laurence Olivier, in 1955 (left), but (right) Dickie Arbiter said it was 'not necessary' He went on to the tell the Daily Telegraph: 'There is this sort of myth that comes from the annals of time that says whenever a member of the Royal family went past you did a curtsy or bow. 'But there is no hard and fast rule, and if you can’t do it or don’t feel comfortable doing it or don’t want to do it that’s fine, it doesn’t mean you hold the Queen in any less respect and you won’t be sent to the Tower. 'The Queen is very relaxed about it, she doesn’t make rules, she understands that some people feel comfortable doing this sort of thing and others don’t. 'The whole thing about waiting for the Queen to speak first is also a myth.' In any event, it seems that the bow or curtsy could lose out in popularity to the selfie. The Queen posed for her first 'selfie' during a trip to Northern Ireland in the Summer - but has admitted she finds the phenomena of people filming her on their mobile phones rather strange. Lady Gaga performs an over-elaborate curtsy to the Queen during the 2009 Royal Variety Performance . Helen Bonham Carter (left) and (right) fellow actress Uma Thurman curtsy to the Queen . David Cameron bows his head during a meeting with the Queen in Balmoral  - this week he issued an apology to the Queen after saying she 'purred' down the line after hearing Scotland had voted against independence . On the official website of the British Monarchy it says there 'are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting the Queen' but that many people 'wish to observe tradition'. It explains that it is 'perfectly acceptable' to simply shake hands with Her Majesty, instead of bowing or curtsying. On presentation to the Queen, the correct formal address is 'Your Majesty' and subsequently 'Ma'am'. The then Australian Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, was criticised when she refused to curtsy to the Queen and not wearing a hat during a Royal tour of the country in October 2011 . During a G20 reception at Buckingham Palace in 2009, Michelle Obama put her hand around the Queen for about 10 seconds . In 1992 Paul Keating was given the nickname of 'Lizard of Oz' after he touched the Queen's lower back with his arm as he guided her through a crowd of people. This was viewed as a sign of disrespect as courtiers are apt to warn, 'Whatever you do, don't touch the Queen.' Paul Keating inappropriately touched the Queen's lower back with his arm as he guided her . Cherie Blair, an ardent republican, was widely criticised for refusing to bow to the Queen at Balmoral in 1997 - this reportedly left the late Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, 'mortified'. In 2000 another Australian premier, John Howard, denied touching the monarch as he introduced her to MPs at a VIP reception. During a G20 reception at Buckingham Palace in 2009, Michelle Obama put her hand around the Queen for about 10 seconds. Finding herself next to Mrs Obama, the Queen had remarked on their height difference. As she did so, her hand edged towards the small of Mrs Obama's back. Mrs Obama responded - and even rubbed the Queen's shoulder - before both women moved gently apart. In May 2011, during the Queen's first official visit to the Republic of Ireland, Irish president Mary McAleese greeted the Queen with a simple handshake. Six months later, the then prime minster of Australia, Julia Gillard, refused to curtsy to the Queen and also drew criticism for not wearing a hat during a ten-day Royal tour of the country. Only this week, David Cameron issued an apology to the Queen after he was overheard saying to the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg that she 'purred' down the line on hearing Scotland had voted against independence in last week’s referendum. The prime minister’s remark  was inadvertently picked up by Sky News. His lapse breached the convention that the prime minister never speaks about his conversations with the monarch and put in question her traditional neutrality. This week, actor Stephen Fry admitted he had snorted cocaine at Buckingham Palace in his new autobiography, More Fool Me, which is published on Thursday. But the TV presenter is not the only celebrity to have stepped out of line in the royal residence. Almost 50 years ago, John Lennon claimed the Beatles smoked cannabis in a royal toilet before going on to receive their MBEs from the Queen. Barney Keen, a 17-year-old who attended a 2003 garden party with the Queen, decided it was the time to streak and was promptly chased by a Yeoman of the Guard and eventually rugby tackled to the ground - only 100 yards from the Queen. Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood received her OBE from the Queen in 1992 - wearing no knickers. During a garden party in 2009, a sudden downpour forced the Queen to invite guests into her private tent. But when the staff cleared up, they realised guests had  made off with some of her prized possessions, including Georgian and Victorian forks and spoons, plates and tea cups bearing the Queen's cipher.","Dickie Arbiter says that bowing and curtsying for the Queen is unnecessary .

"A Vietnam veteran was awarded the Medal of Honor by the President, more than 40 years after his acts of bravery. Army Command Sergeant Major Bennie G. Adkins, now 80, fought enemy soldiers in close combat, dodging mortar rounds as he dragged wounded allies to safety and even refused to be evacuated, despite having wounds of his own. Adkins, a special forces soldier, had the medal fastened around his neck with a blue ribbon by President Obama in a ceremony at the White House today. Solemn: Army Command Sergeant Major Bennie Adkins stood tall today as he received his Medal of Honour from President Barack Obama . Salute: Adkins recognised his award at the White House ceremony - and later dedicated it to his allies . The President also awarded the medal to another Vietnam veteran, Specialist Donald P. Sloat, who died after clinging to a live grenade to protect his fellow soldiers. President Barack Obama praised the soldiers as patriots whose sacrifices had never been fully realized by a nation divided over the legacy of the Vietnam War. It took an act of Congress to allow each to receive the medal so many decades after the fact. Pride: Adkins - who joked with Obama earlier today about re-enlisting - survived terrifying attacks in Vietnam . Obama is also due to give a posthumous Medal of Honor to First Lieutenant Alonzo H. Cushing, who withstood a huge Confederate advance before being killed at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, which will take place in the coming weeks. 'Over the decades, our Vietnam veterans didn't always receive the thanks and respect they deserved. That's a fact' Obama said in the East Room. 'But as we have been reminded again today, our Vietnam vets were patriots and are patriots.' Commenting on the decades between the acts of bravery and the medal awards, Obama said: 'Sometimes even the most extraordinary stories can be lost in the fog of war or the passage of time. 'When new evidence comes to light, certain actions can be reconsidered for this honor, and it is entirely right and proper than we have done so and that is why we are here today. 'No matter how long it takes, no matter how many years go by we will continue to express our gratitude for your years of services. Bravery: Adkins is pictured above as he appeared during his several Vietnam tours of duty . 'The nation is grateful, and your commander-in-chief couldn't be prouder.' Sometimes even the most extraordinary stories can be lost in the fog of war or the passage of time. Obama's audience included families of the honored men, who campaigned for their recognition, and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel - himself a Vietnam veteran. Drafted into the Army at age 22 from his home in rural Oklahoma, Adkins was deployed three times to Vietnam with the Special Forces. He was already being recognized for actions during his second combat tour when, in 1966, a large North Vietnamese force attacked his camp. For 38 hours, Adkins fought in close combat against enemy forces, dodging exploding mortar rounds as he dragged wounded soldiers to safety. When the order was finally given to evacuate camp, Adkins refused to leave comrades behind. Sacrifice:  Donald Paul Sloat, a Specialist in the U.S. Army, died clinging to a live grenade to save his comrades . By the time he and his group made its way to the extraction point, the last evacuation helicopter had left. So Adkins led his fellow soldiers into the jungle, where they evaded enemy soldiers and even a tiger before being evacuated 48 hours later. Adkins, now a much older version of himself and walking with a cane, stood tall in his blue uniform and epaulettes, saluting fellow troops after Obama draped the medal around his neck. 'This Medal of Honor belongs to the other 16 Special Forces soldiers with me,' Adkins said after the ceremony. Sloat, of Coweta, Oklahoma, was killed in action on Jan. 17, 1970, at age 20. While on patrol, a soldier in his squad triggered a hand grenade trap that had been placed in their path by enemy forces. He picked up the live grenade, initially to throw it away. When he realized it was about to detonate, he shielded the blast with his own body in order to save the lives of his fellow soldiers. Sloat's brother, William, accepted the medal from the president Monday. The Medal of Honor is given to Armed Forces members who risk their lives in acts of great personal bravery. Union Army soldier Alonozo H. Cushing was also due to be honored with the medal today, but was not mentioned during the ceremony at the White House. Despite having been wounded in the stomach and shoulder, he ordered his 110 men and six cannon to hold fast against an advancing force of 13,000 Confederate soldiers in a movement known as Pickett's Charge. Hero: First Lieutenant Alonzo H Cushing will be awarded the Medal of Honor later today by Barack Obama . Struggle: Cushing fought and died in the three-day struggle between Unionist and Confederate forces . Cushing was born in Delafield, Wisconsin, raised in Fredonia, New York, and buried at his alma mater, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, after his death at age 22. He commanded about 110 men and six cannons, defending the Union position on Cemetery Ridge against Pickett's Charge, a major Confederate thrust that was repelled by Union forces. Wounds: Cushing ordered his men to hold fast, despite being seriously hurt himself . On the third day of battle, Cushing's small force stood its ground under severe artillery bombardment and an assault by nearly 13,000 advancing Confederate infantrymen. Already wounded in the stomach and the right shoulder, Cushing insisted on ordering his guns to the front lines. He eventually was shot and killed. A White House statement said: 'His actions made it possible for the Union Army to successfully repulse the Confederate assault.' The Medal of Honor has been bestowed on more than 1,500 soldiers who fought in the Civil War, with another soldier given his medal in 2001.","Command Sergeant Major Bennie G.

"Andrew Auwkit, 25, stabbed his girlfriend with a knife and fork, puncturing her lung, at a family meal on the day he was released from jail . A man who stabbed his girlfriend with a knife and fork because she turned down his mother's cooking has been jailed for six years. Andrew Auwkit lost his temper with his girlfriend during a family meal on May 9 - the day he was released from jail. A court heard the 25-year-old, from Coventry, was at his parent's dinner table when the woman - who has an eating disorder - said she did not want to eat the food his mother had prepared. He launched at his girlfriend in a frenzy calling her a 'fussy eater' and plunged his cutlery repeatedly into her chest. His terrified victim, who has not been named, was left bleeding heavily at the table and suffered multiple injuries, including a collapsed lung. Auwkit dialled 999 after attacking her - but once he was arrested he sent her a series of threatening letters from custody trying to get her to drop her complaint. She ignored them, and he was jailed for six years yesterday at Warwick Crown Court after he admitted . wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and perverting the course of justice. Judge Richard Griffith-Jones told him: 'When she was not receptive to . eating your mother’s cooking with the appreciation you had hoped, you . completely lost your temper. 'You . used weapons which were at hand, and in a bad-tempered and persistent . attack you caused more than one wound and injured her in a distressing . way because one of the blows caused her lung to collapse. 'At the same time I have to deal with you for a serious case of doing acts intended to pervert the course of justice.' Auwkit was sentenced at Warwick Crown Court, which heard he threatened his girlfriend not to press charges . The court heard the vicious attack happened on the same day Auwkit was released from prison. He was previously jailed for 16 weeks at Coventry Magistrates Court in April this year for breaching a sexual offences prevention order and for riding a motorbike while disqualified.

"A woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by four footballers, including the son of Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, admitted telling a ‘pack of lies’ to police today. The alleged victim said she had given false information to police but expected them to piece the case together ‘like CSI’. The 21-year-old also denied getting into a hotel bed voluntarily with two footballers and refuted a defence suggestion that she tried to kiss and cuddle George Barker and Anton Rodgers who were dressed in their boxer shorts. Accused: Anton Rodgers, left, and George Barker, right, (both pictured today) were among the group who allegedly assaulted a drunken woman in a hotel room as they celebrated a victory for their club . Denial: The footballers, including Steve Cook, left, and Lewis Dunk, right, (both pictured today) deny sexual assault . Brighton and Hove Albion players Rodgers, 19, Barker, 21, Lewis Dunk, 21, and former team-mate Steve Cook, 21, who now plays for Bournemouth, have been accused of photographing themselves while sexually assaulting the woman while she was passed out in a hotel room. Rodgers, Barker and Dunk, from Brighton, . and Cook, from St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, deny sexual assault. All four men also deny voyeurism. The woman, who was 19 at the time, . said she had been drinking in clubs but denied she had 15 shots of . alcohol before passing out. After missing work the next day, she told her bosses she had been attacked in the street because she feared being sacked. She . said after they insisted on calling the police, she told more lies but . dropped 'hints' she picked up from watching CSI on television. She changed her story six months later after being repeatedly taunted by another footballer. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (left) has been at the hearing where his son Anton Rodgers (right) was among those accused of sexually assaulting the young woman . Giving . evidence for a second day, she admitted giving false information to the . police, saying: ‘I thought it would be like CSI, where they find out . the evidence and come back to me. ‘I was trying to give a hint at the truth.’ Judge Charles Wide QC said: ‘She has admitted she told a pack of lies.’ Police threatened to drop the investigation after two months because the alleged victim was not cooperating, the court heard. The prosecution at the Old Bailey alleges the players took mobile phone photographs showing lewd scenes. Liverpool FC manager Brendan Rodgers arrives at the court where his son Anton Rodgers is among a group of footballers accused of sexually assaulting a young woman . She is said to have discovered the pictures on Rodgers’ phone after waking up the next morning to find herself lying half naked on a hotel bed. The woman has admitted telling lies to police but maintains she is telling the truth about having no recollection of what went on in the room. Mark Cotter, defending Barker, said: 'I suggest to you that Mr Rodgers and Mr Barker were in the double bed in their boxer shorts and you got into bed between them. 'I suggest you initiated an attempt to kiss and cuddle Mr Rodgers and then did the same with Mr Barker.' The woman replied: 'I definitely did not.' Mr Cotter suggested she was 'a prolific liar' who had lied about photographs she had seen on a mobile phone. Asked if she had 'seriously exaggerated' the contents of pictures, she answered: 'It was humiliating and they should not have done it. They have to live with it.' The offence is alleged to have taken place in July 2011 at the Jurys Inn hotel in Brighton after the club's victory in a cup match. When shown a picture in court of Barker posing by his initials in foam on the woman's thigh, she said it was not the picture she saw, which had shown her underwear pulled up. During the hearing Mark Cotter, for Barker, told her: ‘One of the things you told the police in your interview, which you didn’t mention yesterday, was trying to send photographs to yourself. ‘You say you were thinking clearly enough to do that.’ The woman replied: ‘I was thinking I need to have evidence to prove what happened.’ The barrister continued: ‘You have got the phone in your hand.’ She said: ‘I don’t know why I didn’t take it and ran out of the room. I would have had much more evidence.' Mr . Cotter asked: ‘Is the reality that you didn’t delete these photographs . and didn’t pick up your shoes and bag and run down the corridor with . Anton Rodgers’ phone because the photographs that were on the phone were . nowhere near as graphic or containing the content you have described?’ Location: The Jury's Inn Hotel, in Brighton, where the offences were said to have happened . ‘They were,’ said the alleged victim. ‘I wish I had that phone. It would prove it to you.’ Earlier, she claimed she had drunk just four shots and a few beers and had not been hungover but ‘dazed’ when she came around. But Mr Cotter accused her of having a ‘tendency to exaggerate the truth’, adding: ‘Some times you say things that are downright lies.’ ‘No, I don’t,’ she replied. The trial continues.

"The new creature named Panthera blytheae is a relative of the snow leopard. Here the big cat is illustrated based on details from the skull discovered . The world's oldest big cat has been unearthed in Tibet. Its skull was discovered in the Himalayas and could date back almost six million years. The new creature, named Panthera blytheae, is a relative of the elusive snow leopard and sheds new light on the evolution of lions, jaguars and tigers, U.S. scientists said. Using magnetostratigraphy - the technique of dating fossils based on the distinctive patterns of reversals in the Earth's magnetic field that are recorded in layers of rock - the skull is estimated to be 4.1 to 5.95 million years old. It points to central Asia as the place of origin for big cats and the Tibetan plateau as a critical region for understanding their diversification. Dr Jack Tseng, of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, said: 'This find suggests big cats have a deeper evolutionary origin than previously suspected.' DNA evidence suggests big cats - known collectively as Pantherinae, which include lions, jaguars, tigers, leopards, snow leopards and clouded leopards - diverged from their nearest evolutionary cousins Felinae, typified by cougars, lynxes and domestic cats about 6.37 million years ago. However, the oldest fossils of big cats, which were found in the 1970s, are tooth fragments uncovered at in Tanzania alongside early humans and are 3.6 million years old. The latest species described in Proceedings of the Royal Society B challenges previous suppositions about the evolution of big cats and helps place them in geographical context. Using magnetostratigraphy - dating fossils based on the distinctive patterns of reversals in the Earth's magnetic field which are recorded in layers of rock - the skull is estimated to be 4.1 to 5.95 million years old . The discovery was made in a region that includes the majority of current big cat habitats and suggests the group evolved in central Asia and spread outwards. The skull was discovered in the Himalayas and could date back almost six million years . The new creature, named Panthera blytheae, is a relative of the elusive snow leopard and sheds new light on the evolution of lions, jaguars and tigers. It points to central Asia as the place of origin for big cats some six million years ago and the Tibetan plateau as a critical region for understanding their diversification . Dr Jack Tseng, of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, said: 'This find suggests big cats have a deeper evolutionary origin than previously suspected.' Recent estimates have suggested that lions, tigers, jaguars, leopards and snow leopards did not split from clouded leopards until 3.72 million years ago, which the find also disproves. Dr Tseng, his wife Dr Juan Liu of Alberta University in Canada and Dr Gary Takeuchi, of the Natural History Museum, discovered the skull in 2010 while scouting in the remote border region between Pakistan and China - an area that takes a bumpy seven-day car ride to reach from Beijing. Dr Liu found over one hundred antelope limbs and jaws likely deposited by a river and below these was the crushed, but largely complete, remains of the skull. Dr Tseng, a student at Southern California University when he led the expedition, said: 'It was just lodged in the middle of all that mess.' The new creature, named Panthera blytheae is a relative of the snow leopard (pictured) and throws new light on the evolution of lions, jaguars and tigers . For the past three years the researchers have used both anatomical and DNA data to confirm the skull does represent a new species. They plan to return to the site next summer to search for more specimens. Professor Xiaoming Wang, curator of vertebrate palaeontology at the Natural History Museum, said: 'We are in the business of discovery. We go out into the world in search of new fossils to illuminate the past.' The cat has taken its name from Blythe; the snow-leopard-loving daughter of Paul and Heather Haaga who are avid supporters of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.","New creature named Panthera blytheae .

"The suicide note left by a former Senate chief of staff who killed himself after being charged with child porn posession has been revealed and makes allegations about his own history of sexual abuse. Jesse Ryan Loskarn's body was found on Thursday in his family's Maryland home where he was ordered to stay while out on bail before his trial for the child pornography charges. His mother typed up the note and posted it on a dedicated website in its entirety on Monday night. Loskarn, 35, wrote of 'my deepest, darkest secret' and told how he was abused between the ages of five and nine years old. He went on to explain that because of said abuse, he 'saw' himself in the pictures of the children being sexually abused in the pornography. Beginning of the end: Ryan Loskarn was arrested on December 11 (pictured) and later ordered to live with his parents until his trial. He was found dead by suicide in their home on January 23 . 'It’s painful and humiliating to admit to myself, let alone the whole world, but I pictured myself as a child in the image or video. The more an image mirrored some element of my memories and took me back, the more I felt a connection,' he wrote in the note. 'The first time I saw child pornography was during a search for music on a peer-to-peer network. I wasn’t seeking it but I didn’t turn away when I saw it. Until that moment, the only place I’d seen these sorts of images was in my mind.' The note, which was found by Politico, goes on to explain how he fought against his mental troubles for years and told only three people throughout his life of the abuse he allegedly suffered. 'As a child I didn’t understand what had happened at the time of the abuse.... In my mind I instigated and enjoyed the abuse – even as a five and nine year old – no matter the age difference.  Discussing what had happened would have meant shame and blame,' he wrote. 'As an adult I thought I was a tougher man because of the experience; that I was mentally stronger and less emotional than most. I told myself that I was superior to other people because I had dealt with this thing on my own.' He went on to apologize to groups of people- from his relatives and former colleagues to the children in the videos that he watched. 'I perpetrated your abuse, and that will be a burden on my soul for the rest of my life,' he wrote. His mother, Gay Loskarn, reportedly posted the letter online, and she including a few sentences where she did not defend his actions but placed the blame that he felt over his arrest on the publicity that came with it. New allegations: Loskarn wrote that he was sexually abused as a child and that is what drew him to child porn . 'Our society is quick to judge . especially when the topic surrounding his death is so difficult. This . letter written by Jesse Ryan Loskarn was found after he took his own . life on January 23, 2014. If his words can help just one person who is . suffering in silence it will be his greatest accomplishment,' she wrote. Police . discovered child pornography on Loskarn's hard drive after raiding his . home as part of an investigation of a Canadian filmmaker. Rising star: Loskarn had worked as the chief of staff to Republican Senator Lamar Alexander for two years (seen together in January) Loskarn was on conditional release at . the Sykesville home of his parents Chuck and Gay Loskarn, provided he . wear a GPS monitoring bracelet and have no access to the internet. The death was ruled a suicide Friday by the State Medical Examiner's Office. 'The . cause of death was hanging and it was by suicide,' medical examiner's . office spokesperson Bruce Goldfarb confirmed to MailOnline. 'For everyone involved, this is a sad and tragic story from beginning to end,' his former boss Senator Alexander said in a Friday morning statement. Loskarn had served as chief of staff for the Republican senator for two years up until his arrest. Loskarn's lawyers had successfully argued for his conditional release by saying the 35-year-old had no prior convictions or arrests and 'deep ties' to the community. Loskarn was arrested last month and faced up to 10 years on possession charges and a minimum of five and maximum of 20 years on distribution charges. According to a filing with the U.S. District Court earlier this month, police used a ram to enter Loskarn's home the day it was searched, and noticed that he put something on the ledge outside a window. Stunned and saddened: U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), pictured right, called Ryan Loskarn's (left) troubles 'a sad and tragic story from beginning to end' in a Friday statement . It turned out to a portable hard drive with videos depicting child pornography, according to the filing. The . filing states that, in 2010, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and . Toronto Police Service were investigating a movie production company . whose films feature young nude boys, and discovered the former political . operative made several purchases from the company in 2010 and 2011. Loskarn . was a rising star who had spent the past decade working his way up to . increasingly important posts in the House and then the Senate. Republican Senator Alexander said in a news release the day of the arrest that he was 'stunned, . surprised and disappointed' by the allegations against his newly . departed staffer. It’s painful and humiliating to admit to myself, let alone the whole world, but I pictured myself as a child in the image or video. The more an image mirrored some element of my memories and took me back, the more I felt a connection. This is my deepest, darkest secret. As a child I didn’t understand what had happened at the time of the abuse. I did know that I must not tell anyone, ever. Later the memories took on new and more troubling meaning when I became a teenager. They started to appear more often and made me feel increasingly apart from everyone else. In my mind I instigated and enjoyed the abuse – even as a five and nine year old – no matter the age difference.  Discussing what had happened would have meant shame and blame. In my life, I had only ever mentioned the abuse to three friends, and then fleetingly so. I never spoke to a mental health professional about this or any other matter until I was in the D.C. jail. I talked with a counselor there about my crime and the horrible hurt I had caused so many people.  I didn’t talk to him about my past. I didn’t think it mattered because I intended to kill myself as soon as possible.In some ways I feel disgusting sharing this truth with you because in my heart I still struggle to see my five-year-old self as a victim. But I’m sharing this with you because it is the truth, not an excuse. And I believe it played a role in my story.To my family, friends and Capitol Hill colleagues:  I’ve had individual conversations with each of you in my mind. I’ve pictured your face as I admitted to my failure and heard the shock and disappointment in your voice. I lay awake at night reviewing these conversations over and over again. They are among the most excruciatingly painful aspects of this terrible, terrible nightmare.And last, to the children in the images: I should have known better. I perpetuated your abuse and that will be a burden on my soul for the rest of my life.

"The outspoken juror from George Zimmerman's murder trial who tried to get a book deal out of her experience says she wants her 'normal life' back. 'No other family should be forced to endure what the Martin family has endured,' the juror, known only as Juror B37, said in a statement to CNN. 'My prayers are with Travon's parents for . their loss, as they have always been. I now wish for me and my family to . recover from being selected for this jury and return to a normal life.' Public outrage ensued as news emerged this week that Juror B37 was considering a book deal based on her trial experience. An interview that she gave to Anderson Cooper also caused a stir. She addressed the deal in her statement, saying, 'As for the alleged ""book deal,"" there is not one at this time. Inside the courtroom: The unidentified juror said that she felt Zimmerman was justified in killing Trayvon Martin because he felt threatened, even though she admits Zimmerman may have 'enhanced' the story . 'There was an agreement with a . literary agent to explore the concept of a book which discussed the . impact of sequestration on my perceptions of this serious case, while . being compared to the perceptions of an attorney who was closely . following the trial from outside the ""bubble,""' she added. 'The . relationship with the agent ceased the moment I realized what had been . occurring in the world during the weeks of my sequestration.' Juror B37 made the statements after four other jurors released a statement distancing themselves from her. 'The . opinions of Juror B37, expressed on the Anderson Cooper show were her . own, and not in any way representative of the jurors listed below,' they . said in the statement released Tuesday night. In . an effort to maintain their privacy, the four women identified . themselves only as B51, B76, E6 and E40. One juror - B29- did not sign . the document. 'Serving on this jury has been a highly emotional and physically draining experience for each of us,' the statement read. THE ONE WHO SPOKE OUTB-37 is a white woman who is married to an attorney and has two adult children. She said she and her husband used to have concealed weapons permits.THE ONES WHO STEPPED AWAYB-51 is retired, unmarried and doesn’t have kids. She has lived in Seminole County for nine years working in real estate. B-76 is a white woman who has lived in central Florida for 18 years. She manages rental properties with her husband of 30 years. During jury selection, she said she had been the victim of a nonviolent crime. 'Everyone deserves a fair trial,' she said.E-6 is a white woman who is married and has two children. She has worked in financial services and has lived in Seminole County for two years. During jury selection, she said she didn’t know the facts of the case well.E-40 is a white woman who works as a safety officer and recently moved to Seminole County from Iowa. During jury selection, she said she had been the victim of a nonviolent crime.THE ONE REMAININGB-29 recently moved to central Florida from Chicago. She enjoys watching the 'Real Housewives' on television and hadn’t paid much attention to the shooting. A prosecutor described her as 'black or Hispanic' during jury selection. 'The death of a teenager weighed heavily on our hearts but in the end we did what the law required us to do.' Even though they backed away from juror B37's claims, all six of the women had to agree on the not guilty verdict before it was announced on Saturday night. One of her most controversial claims in the Anderson Cooper interview was that Martin 'played a huge role in his death'. 'When George confronted him he could have walked away and gone home,' the woman, identified only as Juror B37, said in the second portion of her post-trial interview. While she was apologetic to the teenager's family, she seemed more sympathetic to Zimmerman's position in the midst of the fight, as opposed to Martin's own self defense. 'I have no doubt that George feared for his life,' she said to CNN's Anderson Cooper. 'I'm 101% that he should have done . what he did except for the things that he did before,' she said, . referencing Zimmerman's decision to follow the teenager in his car and, . fatefully, get out of the car and confront him. 'When the end came to the end, he was justified in shooting Trayvon Martin. 'He . started the ball rolling, he could have avoided the whole situation by . staying in the car, but he wanted to do good- he had good in his heart, . he just went overboard.' While . Zimmerman himself never took the stand in his own defense, video . recordings of him explaining the situation to police after the fatal . shooting were submitted, effectively giving him the chance to tell his . side without leaving himself open to a cross examination. Cleared: The juror said that she felt that Zimmerman went above the bounds of what he should have done but 'his heart was in the right place' Their side: Gladys and Robert Zimmerman spoke out for the first time in an interview taped on Monday, saying that they fear for their son's life . That was no matter for the juror: I'm . sure there were some fabrications, enhancements, but I think pretty much . it happened how he said it happened.' Initially . this unidentified female juror was planning on writing a book about her . experience on the trial- and even had a literary agent lined up early . Monday afternoon- but after the first portion of her interview was aired . that evening she and the agent decided not to follow up. The second portion of B37's interview was . aired on Tuesday, and she went into more detail about how two specific . tact used by the prosecution may have influenced the outcome. Breaking out in riots: Protests throughout the country, including in Los Angeles (pictured Monday) Mayhem: A group of protestors try to tear down a fence in Los Angeles where the demonstrations turned violent on Monday night and many were arrested . Throughout her interview with Cooper, . the woman regularly referred to the neighborhood watchman as George, and . though she did call the 17-year-old Trayvon, she admitted that she felt . more personally connected to Zimmerman as opposed to Martin. 'Trayvon wasn’t as well known to us because there wasn't as much said about him,' she said. Cooper . brought up the fact that the two legal teams took very different visual . approaches when making their closing arguments, with the defense . holding up a concrete block like a portion of the sidewalk to show what . they contend Martin used to attack. On the opposite end, the prosecution . held up the Arizona Iced Tea bottle and a bag of Skittles, saying that . was the only thing he was armed with. 'The Skittles and the Arizona can were ridiculous to even compare it to,' she said. Martin's materials: Assistant state attorney Bernie de la Rionda held up the Skittles and Iced Tea that Trayvon had on him at the time of his death, saying that was all he was armed with . Hard hitting: By contrast, defense attorney Mark O'Mara held up a piece of the concrete sidewalk that he argued Martin used to bash Zimmerman's head . 'I believe he hit his head on the concrete, I believe he was trying to slam it...it was definitely enough to make you fear . 'I hope (Zimmerman's) family can live a normal life after a while. I don't know how he's ever going to do that.' Yesterday . it was revealed that the first vote that the six-woman jury took behind . closed doors came as a draw, with three wanting to acquit, one ready to . charge him with second degree murder and two for manslaughter. In . today's segment, she made it clear that after hours of discussing the . case and the evidence, the group had shifted to be five in favor of . acquittal with one hold out. 'I wanted to find him guilty of not using his senses...you can't charge him with anything because he didn't do anything unlawful,' she said. Juror B37 went on to sob while saying that she wanted to apologize to the Martin family for the tragedy that they had to go through, but she also had a message for George Zimmerman and his family- after it was revealed yesterday that his parents have been in hiding as well as the former neighborhood watchman and his wife. 'I hope his family can live a normal life after a while. I don't know how hes ever going to do that. He'll never forget but I hope he can,' she said.

"A pupil at a £24,000-a-year boarding school has been jailed after stabbing another student twice in a row over soy sauce. Minheng He, a boarder at Langley School in Loddon, Norfolk, attacked the boy last October, inflicting serious wounds to his elbow and shoulder which caused him to lose two pints of blood. He, 17 at the time but now 18, was locked up at Norwich Crown Court yesterday after admitting wounding with intent. Violent: Minheng He, 18, has been jailed for four years in a young offenders; institute after stabbing a fellow pupil at Langley School in Loddon, Norfolk, after a row about a bottle of soy sauce . Judge Nicholas Coleman gave the Chinese thug four years in a young offenders' institute. The judge said He had carried out a 'serious pre-meditated' attack on an 'innocent unarmed victim' whose injuries were 'appalling'. Judge Coleman said: 'You armed yourself with a knife. 'This was a revenge attack - it was planned out of revenge.' Andrew Shaw, prosecuting, said the victim, who was not named, was preparing a meal with a fellow student at the school at about 7.30pm last October 7 before going to the boarding quarters to eat it. Mr Shaw said He went in and 'wanted to borrow some Soy sauce which was refused'. The row flared when the pupil refused to lend He a bottle of soy sauce . The victim then asked He how much he was going to pay for it. The boy meant it as a joke but the Chinese student was not amused and the two boys exchanged angry words. Shocked eye-witnesses heard He tell his victim to 'wait where he was' before he ran off upstairs. But nothing happened until He stormed into the boy's room at about 10.30pm that night as he did his homework. The victim asked him to leave three times. Mr Shaw said: 'The next thing He advanced quickly towards him with something in his hand.' The victim then 'backed himself in towards the corner of the room where the defendant stabbed him'. Mr Shaw said the terrified teenager 'turned his back and raised his arm to try and defend himself' and managed to push He away. But he had already been knifed in his left arm and shoulder. He was later seen nearby 'shouting and screaming'. The agitated yob was breathing heavily and holding a knife with blood on the handle. He, of Hendon, north London, was also heard to say 'I don't care any more'. Mr Shaw said the fact the stabbing happened three hours after the soy sauce bust-up was crucial as it 'shows an element of pre-meditation'. Staff dashed to the scene and He told one teacher he had acted because his target had insulted his mum. The knifeman, who injured his own hand in the attack, was driven to hospital by a teacher to get treatment. The victim was also taken to hospital and received emergency treatment for two stab wounds that went all the way to the bone in his left shoulder and left elbow. He lost two pints of blood in the savage assault. Jonathan Goodman, defending, said He should be given credit for his guilty plea and was of 'hitherto good character'. Scene of the crime: Langley School in Loddon, Norfolk, which charges £24,300 a year for boarders . Mr Goodman said the 'gifted mathematician' had gone to Norfolk to learn English. He said he had no family support network and was one of only two Chinese students who spoke Mandarin - the rest speaking Cantonese - until the other then moved on. Mr Goodman said this meant that He, who found out his mother had ovarian cancer when he returned to China for his holidays, was left 'isolated, alone and vulnerable'. He said he was 'extraordinarily remorseful' and is 'simply stunned by his own actions and what he did'. Judge Coleman told He he must serve half his sentence before being released on licence. Speaking after the case, Dominic Findlay, headteacher of Langley School, said: 'We're glad that the whole incident and ordeal is over. 'For us the fact the victim and staff were not needed for the case because of a guilty plea meant the right decision was reached.' Langley is a co-educational day and boarding school. The highly-rated school charges £8,100-a-term and £3,985 day fees. It has 729 pupils, 429 boys and 300 girls made up of 648 day students and 81 boarders.","Langley School in Loddon, Norfolk, rocked by violent episode .

Michael Obi, who runs a transport company, had not been seen or heard from since he failed to return home from work in Jos, the capital of Plateau State in central Nigeria, on August 12. But Nigerian police said detectives traced the kidnappers to Kano, a sprawling city in northern Nigeria around 180 miles away from where he was snatched, and arrested the people responsible. Safe: Michael Obi, the kidnapped father of Chelsea footballer John Obi Mikel, has been rescued by police in Nigeria after being missing for 10 days . Captors: The alleged kidnappers were paraded by Kano state police shortly after they were arrested in a police raid on the house where they held him . In the pictures released by Nigerian police Michael looks disheveled, tired and drawn, with his pink shirt torn at the lapel, but he is now safe. He took part in a hastily-arranged news conference on Monday night at a police station in Kano, where six of his suspected kidnappers were paraded. 'I was taken right deep into the bush, in an isolated area in Jos,' said Michael in a brief statement to journalists. 'I started begging them, yet they beat me mercilessly, kicking me with their boot. They are five of them and they were dressed in military uniforms. 'They pushed me into a vehicle painted in military (colors) and began to drive very fast. I never knew a vehicle can fly like that.' Police said they had launched an investigation to see if the accused were soldiers, though authorities believe the kidnappers used military-style camouflage fatigues to abduct Michael and remain unchallenged in a country still wary of the military after a string of dictatorships. Chelsea star: Mikel, front right, continued to play for his club throughout the ordeal and was on duty against West Bromwich Albionon Saturday . 'They beat me mercilessly': Michael Obi said his captors mistreated him during the kidnap, in which they wore military uniforms . Kano state police commissioner Ibrahim Idris identified the kidnappers as five men, including a former police officer, and a woman. The accused did not immediately have a lawyer and remained largely silent as police showed them to journalists. London-based Sport Entertainment and Media Group, the management company for John Obi Mikel, welcomed his father's release. Mikel's management company SEM released a statement this evening confirming that the Nigerian international's father had been released. 'Earlier today Michael Obi called his family to advise them that he had been released by his abductors,' the statement read. '(We) have waited until now to release this information, to ensure that Michael was safe. Success: A Nigerian police officer stands guard over Michael Obi, while his son John Obi Mikel has continued to perform for Chelsea despite the family ordeal . 'John Obi Mikel would like to thank everyone in Nigeria, his family & friends, Chelsea FC & their fans & his agents for their total support during this terrible time.' The statement does not reveal whether a ransom was paid. Michael Obi is reported to have told the BBC shortly after his release: 'I am very stressed.' Mikel continued to play for Chelsea during his father's disappearance, appearing in the Blues' Barclays Premier League opener at Stoke before their home 2-1 win over West Brom on Saturday. Chelsea released a statement tonight offering their support for Mikel's family. 'All at Chelsea Football Club are delighted that John Mikel Obi's father, Michael, has been found safe in Nigeria,' the statement read. Violence: Jos, which is in the Plateau state, has seen thousands die in recent years in religious and ethnic violence rooted largely on political and economic issues . Relief: Left, Chelsea star John Mikel Obi, who played on throughout the ordeal, with his agent John Shittu . 'Mikel has shown outstanding commitment and professionalism during this most difficult of times, and the club will continue to offer its full support to him and his family.' Michael Obi was kidnapped on August 12 while on his way home from work in the central Nigerian city of Jos. Nigeria, an oil-rich country of 150 million people, is almost evenly split between Muslims in the north and the predominantly Christian south. Businessman: Michael Obi runs a transport firm in Nigeria and he was grabbed on his way home from work . Plateau state, in Nigeria's fertile central belt, has seen thousands die in recent years in religious and ethnic violence rooted largely in political and economic issues. Mikel's family, from the Igbo tribe, is in the minority in the Plateau State. However, the footballer said the kidnapping shocked him because his family never had any problems there before. Kidnappings in Plateau state are a rarity when compared to Nigeria's oil-producing southern delta, where militants and criminal gangs often kidnap foreigners for ransom. Middle class Nigerian families also increasingly find themselves targeted in the country's East as well. It isn't the first time a football player's family has been targeted in Nigeria. In 2008, gunmen abducted the younger brother of Everton defender Joseph Yobo as he left a nightclub in Port Harcourt, the delta's largest city. The brother was released unharmed about two weeks later, though it was unclear if a ransom had been paid. Most kidnap victims find themselves released only after their loved ones pay ransom. A Forbes magazine survey in June listed Mikel as the seventh highest-paid African player in Europe. The magazine listed Mikel's salary as around £3.5million a year.","Michael Obi found 180miles away from snatch site .

"It's an image that has never gone away since it was first circulated in 2010 - a huge pouring of synthetic pink soft serve-like matter falling into a cardboard box that was purportedly the filling on McDonald's Chicken McNuggets. And, despite announcements time and time again the ubiquitous image of pink goop had nothing to do with McDonald's, the fast food giant continues to try to dispel the myth. This week the world's largest restaurant chain released a video that was filmed inside one of their nugget factories in Cargill, Canada. It purports to detail the start-to-finish process of how McDonald's manufactures their best-selling snacks. Scroll down for video . The image that sparked an outrage: This photo, first circulated in 2010, purported to show the filling of McDonald's Chicken McNuggets. The fast food giant continues to try and dispel the myth . Step one: Workers start to de-bone the raw chickens . According to McDonald's the chicken meat is separated because only the breast is used in their nuggets . The breast meat is then collected and prepared for shredding . The breast meat is mixed with seasoning and chicken skin and put through a shredder, as seen here . The resultant mixture is then further blended . The process starts with the chickens being de-boned and the breast meat separated. McDonald's maintains that only breast meat is used in their nuggets. The meat is then shredded before being mixed in with seasoning and chicken skin. McDonalds' Canada chain supply manager Nicoletta Stefou shows a picture of the infamous 'pink goop' photo on an iPad at one point to show how it differs from the 'real' mixture. The meat is then cut into the four nugget shapes - the bell, the ball, the boot and the bow tie. They are twice battered and partially fried. The nuggets will be properly cooked at the restaurant outlets in deep fryers. Finally, they are bagged, boxed, frozen and shipped. As of 2012, there are more than 33,000 restaurants around the world, in 118 countries. More 14,000 of those restaurants are in the United States.

"Dutch cyclist Maarten de Jonge is one very lucky man, having cheated death twice in the past four months. De Jonge was scheduled to fly aboard Flight MH370, which vanished without a trace in March, and he also had a ticket for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, which was downed by a missile this week over the Ukraine - but he changed his travel arrangements at the last minute in both cases. On Friday, the 29-year-old professional athlete issued a statement on his official site confirming that he was supposed to take the doomed MH17 flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur Thursday, but he pushed back his departure by several days. Scroll down for video . 'World's luckiest man': Dutch cyclist Maarten de Jonge cheated death twice in the past six months by deciding not to fly aboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and MH17 . Sixth sense: De Jonge, 29, was supposed to be aboard MH17, but at the last minute he changed his travel arrangements and decided to fly out of Amsterdam on Sunday instead of Thursday . 'What has happened is terrible, so many victims, that's a horrible thing,' de Jonge wrote in a statement translated from Dutch. De Jonge told the Netherlands station RTV Oost that despite his second brush with death, he plans to take another Malaysia Airlines plane this week and has no concerns for his safety. ‘I have been lucky twice, that's the third time as well,’ de Jonge reportedly said. De Jonge, who is part of the Terengganu Cycling Team based in Malaysia, had booked a seat on Flight MH17, planning to return to Kuala Lumpur after taking part in national championships in his native Holland earlier this month, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. But the athlete ultimately decided to take another, cheaper flight with a layover in Frankfurt, Germany, on Sunday. Calamity: A picture taken on July 18 shows the wreckage of the Malaysia Airlines jet carrying 298 people from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur a day after it crashed, near the town of Shaktarsk, in rebel-held east Ukraine . Undeterred: De Jonge said he is still planning to take a Malaysia Airlines flight to Kuala Lumpur on Sunday . Back in March, de Jonge boarded a different Malaysia Airlines jet instead of Flight MH370, which disappeared somewhere over the Indian Ocean with 239 people on board. ‘I could have taken that one just as easily,’ de Jonge said in the RTV Oost interview. ‘It's inconceivable. I am very sorry for the passengers and their families, yet I am very pleased I'm unharmed.’ In his written statement Friday, de Jonge downplayed his two very close calls, saying that his story is meaningless compared to those of the victims and their families. He declined to comment further out of respect for the 298 passengers and crew of Flight MH17, at least 189 of them Dutch citizens, who perished in the tragedy. It is widely believed that a surface-to-air missile shot the Boeing 777 out of the sky over rebel territory on the border between Russia and the Ukraine, but it is not clear who fired it. On Friday, Malaysia Airlines offered to waive fees for any passengers wishing to delay or cancel their travel plans in the wake of Thursday's disaster.

"After more than 40 years in the air, the DC10 passenger airliner bowed out in style this week, being given the water arch salute as it landed into the UK for the last time. Flying from Dhaka, Bangladesh, via Kuwait, the plane landed its last commercial flight at Birmingham Airport at 5.55pm last Thursday, February 20. Sadly, after plane enthusiasts were treated to scenic flights this week from Birmingham, the craft has now flown back to Bangladesh for it to be dismantled and its parts sold. This is the moment the DC10 aircraft landed a passenger flight for the last time. It flew from Dhaka, Bangladesh, via Kuwait, to Birmingham, landing on February 20 . This is the view of the cockpit on the last passenger flight of the DC10 aircraft, which was flown by Biman Bangladesh Airlines . After landing in England, thousands of people got the opportunity to go on scenic flights north towards Scotland before looping back to Birmingham . The last commercial flight, which was operated by Biman Bangladesh Airlines and landed at 5.55pm on Thursday, February 20, took 14 hours - including the stopover in Kuwait. It had 35 passengers, who had travelled to Dhaka especially for the flight. The Birmingham Airport fire service provided the water arch salute to mark the occasion as the aircraft landed. And it left Birmingham Airport to return to Bangladesh - with no passengers - on Monday. On the days between, more than a thousand passengers were treated to one-hour scenic flights on the craft, travelling towards Scotland before looping back towards England's second city. Biman Bangladesh Airlines was the last airline to use the craft. It said it would now be retired and replaced with newer models. The model, which first took to the air in 1971, will still be used in the military - for the U.S. Air Force for refuelling purposes, for instance - and freight services. Biman Bangladesh Airlines was the last airline to fly the DC10, which it has now retired so it can begin using more modern aircraft . This was the scene on the very last scenic flight of the aircraft, which took off from Birmingham Airport at 3pm on Monday, February 24 . One of the 35 passengers on-board the final flight into the UK was Gordon Stretch, who had travelled to Bangladesh from Solihull a few days before to be a part of the journey. 'The reason I did this is because I'm an aircraft enthusiast,' he said. 'When the opportunity came and I heard that the last DC10 flight was coming to Birmingham, I thought ""wow"". 'I decided to go out to Bangladesh and fly back on the plane.' One of the 35 passengers on-board the final flight was Gordon Stretch, who had travelled to Bangladesh from Solihull a few days before to be a part of the journey . 'When the opportunity came and I heard that the last DC10 flight was coming to Birmingham, I thought ""wow"". I decided to go out to Bangladesh and fly back on the plane' He said Bangladesh is not a country he'd choose to visit ordinarily, but he was happy to spend two and a half days there - after flying from Heathrow - in order to be on the flight. If a 14-hour journey doesn't sound difficult enough, Biman Bangladesh Airlines is a non-alcohol airline. Mr Stretch said: 'It was completely dry. We were only on the Diet Cokes, as they say.' But he flatly refused to say he regretted the decision to go on the flight. 'It was definitely worth it,' he said. The flight even gave passengers - all aircraft enthusiasts - the opportunity to venture into the plane's cockpit and speak to the pilots. Mr Stretch spent 14 hours on the flight, had to travel to Bangladesh to board the flight and was not allowed to drink alcohol on the plane, but said: 'It was definitely worth it' The final DC10 was initially supposed to be flown from Birmingham to New York to go to a museum in Seattle, before the airline was told there was no room for it . Then, until a week before it landed in Birmingham, the plane to scheduled to be housed at the Bruntingthorpe Aviation Museum in Leicestershire . The aircraft's final flight - which did not carry any passengers - took off from Birmingham and flew back to Dhaka for its parts to be sold. It . was originally intended that the plane be flown to New York from . Birmingham, to be positioned in a museum. But, when the Seattle museum said it could not accommodate for it, plans were changed so it would be exhibited at the Bruntingthorpe Aviation Museum, Leicestershire, instead. Then, with days to go before its landing at Birmingham, the airline announced it had found a buyer for the craft's three jet engines, and it would be taken back to Bangladesh to be taken apart. The last flight took off from Birmingham at 3pm on February 24. Prided on its comfort, reliability and efficiency, the DC10 was designed and built by the Douglas Aircraft Company in Long Beach, California. With six models designed – the first running from 1971 – the crafts accommodate for between 250 and 380 passengers. The first time a DC10 is believed to have visited Birmingham - the destination of its final commercial passenger flight - was on November 30 1972, when Laker Airways operated a demonstration flight. This photograph shows a Laker Airways DC10 aircraft, which was first operated in 1971, taking off from Gatwick Airport in 1979 . This photograph shows the inside of a DC10 in 1980, showing passengers on a flight from London Gatwick to New York . The aircraft was first used by American Airlines, with its first commercial flight operated on August 5 1971 for a round-trip between Los Angeles and Chicago. United Airlines began using the airliner in the same month. It had 222 seats to American Airlines’ 206. This photograph shows Sir Freddie Laker, standing in the engine of the DC10. The first time a DC10 is believed to have visited Birmingham was on November 30 1972, when Laker Airways operated a demonstration flight . At the time, the first class area of the cabin had six seats across, while in standard class there were eight seats across. The 446th and final DC10 was delivered to Nigeria Airways in 1989. A number of airlines used the DC10 model in its history, including British Caledonian, Northwest Airlines, Japan Airlines and Iberia. Biman Bangladesh Airlines was the last, but the planes will continue to be used for military purposes – by the U.S. Air Force for in-flight refuelling purposes, for instance – and for freight services.","The DC10 was given the water arch salute as it landed a passenger flight for the last time in Birmingham .

"It may be cold outside but these red pandas made the most of their fur coats and enjoyed a play fight in the snow. The creatures were snapped rolling around in the grounds of a Vienna zoo as they showed off their strength and speed in the friendly tussle. In scenes similar to the martial arts DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda, the male and female red pandas dodged and pounced as they each tried to outwit their opponent. The panda pair were pictured rolling around in the snow at the Tiergarten Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna . On the attack: one panda prepares to pounce . Paws up, but the fight isn't over yet for these two . The red pandas grappled in a play fight for quite some time, aided by the occasional break for a bamboo snack . The sparring partners were spotted by Austrian photographer, Josef Gelernter. The 31-year-old watched as the fight unfolded at the Tiergarten Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna - the world's oldest zoo, having been open in the grounds of the summer palace for 251 years. Mr Gelernter said he could have watched the red pandas for hours. The father-of-two said: 'It was as though the snow had stimulated their urge to play, just like children really. 'They were very lively and even had to take breaks in between to regain their strength. 'They took some time out to eat carrots and bamboo and then starting fighting all over again.' Like Master Shifu, the kung fu warrior in the Dreamworks film, the male and female red pandas showed off their speed and strength as they wrestled in the snow. 'They were moving really quickly so it was quite difficult to capture but I think I managed to get some nice shots,' said Mr Gelernter. The snow covering the Tiergarten Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna seemed to bring out the pandas' playful side, said photographer Josef Gelernter . After about five or six tussles, the pandas, one male and one female, needed a nap to recover . The red pandas showed off the strength and speed of their breed, rather like Master Shifu in the film Kung Fu Panda . But even the most ferocious fighter has to give in to tiredness at some point. 'The pandas repeated this about five or six times before exhausting themselves and falling asleep,' said Mr Gelernter. 'The male panda wanted to carry on playing but the female was clearly very tired so he gave up in the end. 'It was such a joy watching them play, the snow seemed to really bring out the life in them. 'It was simply amazing, I could have watched them for hours. They looked so cute.' Unlike their distant cousins, giant pandas, red pandas are not much bigger than a domestic cat. They are usually quite shy, but these two were snapped during mating season - usually January to March - when the creatures are more willing to socialise.","Two red pandas took each other on in a show of speed and strength .

"It has hit the headlines following the  murders of David Miller and Hannah Witheridge. But as anyone who has travelled to the paradise island of Koh Tao will testify, given the idyllic and tranquil setting, it couldn't have come as more of a shock - to locals and the hoards of backpackers recuperating on its golden sands. Koh Tao, or Turtle Island, is known as the less-developed, laidback sibling of its more raucous neighbours: Koh Samui and Koh Pha Ngan, home to the Gap Year holy grail, the Full Moon party. Blissful paradise? Boats and snorkelers in stunning Mango Bay on Thailand's Koh Tao island . Tragic: British backpackers Hannah Witheridge and David Miller who were murdered on Koh Tao on Monday . It's a diver's dream, with most visitors coming to make the most of the easy currents and shallow waters, and the chance to see pretty corals, bull sharks and whale sharks. Home to around 2,000 people, the island, which measures just eight square miles survives on its laid-back brand of tourism, with other attractions including hiking, rock-climbing or simply flopping on its bow-shaped beaches. Averaging at around 500,000 visitors last year, the island recently started to gain popularity, and was voted Asia's number one island on Trip Advisor for two years in a row. But despite an influx in backpackers and travellers desperate to taste its brand of bliss, it hadn't lost its charm. Former Dive Master on Koh Tao, Richard Woolgar, from Upminster, Essex, said: 'It hasn't been taken over by monstrous development like other places in Thailand. Sunset at Sairee beach in Koh Tao, close to where the brutal murder of two British backpackers took place . Thailand's seemingly idyllic island resorts can spell danger to tourists, as the brutal murder of two British travellers illustrates only too clearly. Glowing travel brochure descriptions of tranquil, turquoise waters, sandy beaches and jungle walks hide the fact that crime is a constant factor in this part of south east Asia. According to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), as many as 11 Britons have been murdered in Thailand since 2009. Laid back: Hat Sairee on Koh Tao island, which has grown in popularity in recent years . In a 2012/13 New Year's Eve party Londoner Stephen Ashton, 22, was killed in a bar on Haad Rin beach on the Thai island of Koh Pha Ngan - a resort where the FCO warns British travellers to beware 'vicious, unprovoked attacks by gangs'. The FCO says such attacks are particularly common around the time of Full Moon parties and generally occur late at night near bars in Haad Rin, the home of Kho Pha Ngan's infamous Full Moon party, an all-night, extravaganza of alcohol and dance music that has become hugely popular among tourists travelling through the country. British visitors are also warned that violent assaults and robberies have been reported in the resort town of Chaweng in Koh Samui. Attacks have also occurred in other tourist districts in Thailand including Chiang Mai, Pattaya and Krabi. In July last year an American was stabbed to death, and his son seriously injured in an attack in a bar in Krabi. On crime generally, the FCO warns Britons to beware scams, pickpockets, bag-snatchers and credit card fraud. Just a few weeks ago, the FCO published comprehensive, country-by-country lists of places where Britons needed consular assistance in the 12 months ending March 2014.The list also showed where Britons have been victims of crime. Taking into account the number of visits made by Britons to a country as well as the number of Britons living in that country, Thailand was second only to the Philippines in being the destination where Britons needed the most consular assistance. In 2013/14, Britons made more than 906,000 visits to Thailand - a country where around 50,000 Britons live. There were 1,164 incidents of consular assistance, including 11 cases of rape, six of assault and 267 instances of Britons being taken to hospital. There were also 362 deaths of Britons in Thailand in 2013/14. Although this figure included those who died of natural causes, the total was more than in any other country except Spain, which received around 12 times the number of Britons than Thailand. The latest murder is a further setback for Thailand's tourism industry which is still recovering from the military coup which took place in May this year. 'The locals have made a conscious effort to maintain the beauty of the island whilst encouraging the life blood that is tourism. 'Backpackers also use it as a safe haven to recuperate from the Full Moon Parties on Koh Phangan. It's one of the most relaxing places that I visited on my travels. 'Time slows to a crawl and the laid back vibe is very infectious. It's the sort of place you'll plan to visit for a week and end up staying a month. 'It's also, in my opinion, one of the safest places I visited. With it being such a small island, it's very easy to see that there's a family mentality among both the locals and the tourists.' Backpacker haven: Accommodation ranges from basic to five-star - and can be as cheap as £4 per night . 'Time slows to a crawl and the laid back vibe is very infectious': No wonder backpackers flock to Koh Tao . But the increase in young travellers wanting to party, is unnerving to some. Ben Ruji, Marketing Director at Koh Tao Bamboo Huts, not far from where Ocean View Bungalows, on Sairee beach where the couple were staying before they were killed, says the island has had a lot more teenage visitors in the last several years. Ruji, 39, told Mail Online Travel: 'There are noticeably more teenagers and young people are heading to Sai Ree for drinking or even binge-drinking. 'As the island is getting more ""developed"" we can see a lot of businesses taking short-cuts. People are different. Although the ambiance of the island remains laid back, we can see changes in the crowd. Bungalows pictured on Sairee beach Beach, where before this week major crime was uncommon . Diver's dream: Visitors come to make the most of the easy currents and shallow waters like at Leam Thien Bay . 'Sometimes, we found the Britons and Aussies to be more of trouble-makers because they usually travel in groups. Most of the Europeans are travelling in couples or families. 'I think there is a number of factors at play here: Younger crowds, more people - which means more problems, and no real limitation or age check on drinking age on the island. 'There's also just a small number of police. I think they have only seven on the island. 'This crime has shaken the island terribly.There were some petty thefts and bar fighting before, but mostly it happened to the local people. Never tourists. Quiet isle: Home to around 2,000 people, the island, survives on its laid-back brand of tourism . The village of Hat Sai Ri, where the bodies of the British couple were found, is one of the island's busiest resorts, comprising mid-range hotels, restaurants, bars, and a multitude of dive centres. There is a huge variety of accommodation for every budget in Koh Tao. The most developed and popular areas are Sairee, Mae Haad & Chalok Baan Kao. Room qualities range from basic huts, boutique hotels and beach resorts to luxury villas with all western amenities, with basic bungalows with showers and toilets starting from 400 Baht daily (around £7) but can be as low as £4. Some of the more remote bungalows use their own generators, which may be shut off at certain times. GETTING AROUND . Aside from one major concrete road which connects Sairee with Chalok Baan Kao, and a small amount of concrete roads leading to other beaches, Koh Tao is made up of dirt tracks - to challenge even the most skilled driver. Steep trails, sharp curves, sand and grit, potholes, washed out tracks and the occasional dropping coconut demand mindful driving and fast reactions. Modes of transport included pick-up and motorbike taxis, boat taxis and mountain bikes for rent. The colourful, traditional Long Tail Boats take you conveniently and quickly to stunning remote beaches and secluded bays. 'Crime rates are very low because most local people know that they cannot get at with it because it is a small island where most of the people know each other. So they wouldn't risk doing anything that will destroy their reputation. 'We are very sorry about this too. It is very sad.' More than 70 police officers have been deployed to Koh Tao to investigate, as the country's leaders called for a swift investigation into the brutal killings that were a new blow to Thailand's tourism industry. Backpackers use Koh Tao as a safe haven to recuperate from the Full Moon Parties on Koh Phangan, pictured . The island has got something to suit every budget, from cheap beach huts  to  luxury five-star resorts . The country's Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha said: 'This should not have happened in Thailand. It will affect our image in the eyes of international countries', urging the media to warn tourists about travel safety in Thailand. 'In their countries, (foreigners) can travel wherever they want, so they thought it is safe, but in our country, there are still problems. There are different types of people, so they have to be careful. 'Those related must warn them and this incident has to be investigated because Thai people won't tolerate this.'

"Gerard Deulofeu appeared to be mocking one of Cristiano Ronaldo's goal celebrations as he was filmed on Thursday. The Barcelona forward, on loan at Everton last season, was joking around at the club's training centre with young goalkeeper Jordi Masip.

"A banned nerve gas has been used to wipe out masses of people 'several times' during the Syrian civil war, the French government confirmed today. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the presence of Sarin was detected by researchers in Paris. France, which is pushing to arm rebels fighting President Bashar Al-Assad's army, said the use of the gas was in breach of all international protocols. Photographs have already been produced of victims including young children dying from the chemicals. Worrying: The aftermath of an air strike in Qusair after the announcement about chemical weapons . Sarin is odourless, and so hard to detect, of ten leaving people with no idea that they were have been exposed to the gas. Within a few minutes, victims experience runny nose, tightness in the chest, and pupil constriction. Then they have difficulty breathing, . get sick, and start to drool before they lose control of all their . bodily functions, begin twitching and ultimately suffocate in a series . of convulsive spasms. 'It is a horrendous death, and one . that the international community cannot allow,' said a foreign ministry . source in the French capital. Both Assad and the Syrian rebels have . accused each other of using chemical weapons, but this is the first . solid evidence  of 'localised use' said Mr Fabius. March as the bloodiest month of the . conflict so far, with more than 6,000 people killed, including more than . 500 women and children. Some 70,000 people are thought to have . died since the uprising began in March 2011 as part of the Arab Spring . revolution across the Middle East and North Africa. Hundreds of . thousands more have been wounded, imprisoned and made homeless. Sarin was first developed in Nazi Germany in 1938 by two scientists who were trying to create a stronger pesticide. Allegations: This image shows forces loyal to Assad during an operation; they are accused of using sarin . When its potential for chemical . warfare was realised during the Second World War, the Germans started . mass-producing it, but it was never used. NATO listed Sarin as a standard . chemical weapon in the 1950s, but it was not used properly until 1988 . when Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein used it to wipe out some 5000 people . in the Kurdish city of Haljaba, in northern Iraq. They all died over the course of two days when some 20 aircraft dropped the chemicals on the town. Sarin gas was also said to have been . used during the Gulf War in 2004, with the west using it as evidence of . the banned weapons of mass destruction the American and British . governments claimed Iraq possessed. Mr Fabius said: 'These tests show the . presence of sarin in various samples in our possession. France is . certain that sarin gas was used several times in Syria in limited . areas.' Mr Fabius said that the test results . had been handed to the United Nations because chemical weapons are . banned by international law. Concerns: The report to the Human Rights Council on violations in Syria's conflict accused both sides of committing war crimes during the conflict . It came as a UN report stated that . there were 'reasonable grounds' to suggest that chemical weapons were . being used in Syria. Mr Fabius would not state whether the Sarin had . been used by the Syrian Army, or by the rebels. The disclose comes after a U.N. report said today that there . are 'reasonable grounds' to believe that toxic chemicals have been used . as weapons in at least four attacks in Syria's civil war. The U.N. Commission of Inquiry said more evidence is needed to determine the precise chemical agents used or who used them and called on Damascus to allow a team of experts into the country. The report said there are allegations of . government forces using chemical weapons in four instances, but also . did not rule out rebels using them. The commission's report to the Human . Rights Council on violations in Syria's conflict also accused both sides of . committing war crimes. In an apparent message to European . countries considering arming Syrian rebels, the report warned that the . transfer of arms would heighten the risk of violations, leading to more . civilian deaths and injuries. 'War crimes and crimes against . humanity have become a daily reality in Syria where the harrowing . accounts of victims have seared themselves on our conscience,' the . report said. 'There is a human cost to the increased availability of . weapons,' it added. U.N.-Secretary . General Ban Ki-moon has appointed a U.N. team to investigate alleged . chemical weapons attacks in Syria after the Syrian government asked him . to investigate a purported attack by rebels on March 19 on Khan al-Assal . village in the northern city of Aleppo. But the Syrian government . insists that a probe be limited to that incident. Syrian soldiers were reportedly killed . and injured in the incident, which the rebels blame on Syrian forces. Opposition activists have claimed more than six instances when regime . forces used chemical weapons. Ban is insisting on a broader . investigation, including a December incident in Homs. He appointed . Swedish chemical weapons expert Ake Sellstrom to lead a U.N. investigation. Syria has refused to allow his team into the country. The confirmed use of chemical weapons . could escalate the international response to the more than two-year-old . conflict, which has killed more than 70,000 people, according to the . United Nations. President Barack Obama has said their use would be a . 'red line,' but the administration says it still looking for solid . evidence. 'There are . reasonable grounds to believe that chemical agents have been used as . weapons,' the report said. 'It has not been possible, on the evidence . available, to determine the precise chemical agents used, their delivery . systems or the perpetrator.' 'It is possible that anti-government armed groups may access and use chemical weapons.... though there is no compelling evidence that these groups possess such weapons or their requisite delivery systems,' the report said. 'Conclusive findings - particularly in the absence of a large-scale attack - may be reached only after testing samples taken directly from victims or the site of the alleged attack,' it said. The report, covering the period from mid-January to mid-May, accused both sides of committing war crimes. On the government side, the report accused government forces and affiliated militia of committing torture, rape, forcible displacement and enforced disappearance. On the rebel side, the report accused armed groups of carrying out sentencing and execution without due process, as well as committing torture, taking hostages and pillaging. But it said violations and abuses by the rebels 'did not, however, reach the intensity and scale of those committed by government forces and affiliated militia.' 'A dangerous state of fragmentation and disintegration of authority prevails in areas under anti-government armed groups control, despite attempts to fill the vacuum left by the withdrawal of the state through creating local councils,' it said.","Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the presence of Sarin was detected .

"David Cameron last night spoke of his anguish when he feared his wife Samantha might have been killed in the 9/11 attacks on New York. In an interview to mark the 10th anniversary of the attacks, the Prime Minister warned that Britain had ‘lost some of our moral authority’ in the way it responded – with controversy still raging over the war in Iraq and allegations of complicity in torture. But he also recalled his own personal torment on the day al-Qaeda struck, when he spent hours trying to contact Samantha, who had flown to Manhattan on a business trip the previous day. Concerns: David Cameron with wife Samantha. He has told how he feared she had been killed in the 9/11 attacks . Mr Cameron was at the family home in Oxfordshire on the day of the attacks while Samantha, who was two months pregnant with their first son Ivan, was in New York opening a new branch of the upmarket stationers Smythson, where she still works as a consultant. The way they were: David and Samantha Cameron pictured in 2000 . Although she was in the shop a few miles from the World Trade Center, she was unable to tell her husband she was safe for five hours because the phone and mobile networks went into meltdown in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. In an interview with the Arabic satellite broadcaster Al Jazeera, Mr Cameron said: ‘Samantha was actually in New York that day, in Manhattan, and I’ll never forget the hours of ringing her mobile over and over again and not being able to get through because the mobile phone system was down. ‘I remember exactly where I was when I finally did get through and how pleased I was to hear her voice. ‘And it made a huge impression on her because of what happened in New York that day and what people felt about it. 'Obviously . it’s been one of the defining events of this century. And I think we’re . still coming to terms with it and trying to get our response to it . right.’ Mr Cameron defended his decision to . vote for the Iraq War, but said ‘mistakes’ were made in the way the West . responded to the threat from al Qaeda. He . said: ‘We can certainly see with hindsight, and in some ways at the . time, mistakes were made in that we lost some of our moral authority, . which is vital to keep when you’re trying to make your case in the . world.’ Samantha Cameron had flown to Manhattan on a business trip the day before the twin towers were hit . The Prime Minister said the insistence on a UN resolution on Libya, the establishment of an inquiry into allegations of torture and the controversial decision to pay tens of millions of pounds in compensation to 16 Guantanamo Bay terror suspects with British links, were all evidence that the Coalition was working to restore Britain’s moral standing. Cameon claims Britain 'had lost some of our moral authority' in the way it responded top 9/11 . He said the decision to settle the Guantanamo Bay cases out of court was designed to ‘remove the stain from Britain and to make sure that our security services could get on with their work’. Mr Cameron said he would stick to the deadline to withdraw all British combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014, just before the planned date of the next General Election. And he said the West had to focus on preventing al Qaeda  establishing a stronger foothold in ‘badly fractured’ states like Yemen and Somalia. But he insisted the events of the Arab springe were a ‘hugely optimistic and hopeful moment for our world’. Meanwhile, Tony Blair yesterday backed ‘regime change’ in Iran and Syria – as he warned the West still faced a major threat from terrorism 10 years after the 9/11 attacks. The former Prime Minister said the threat posed by Islamist extremists would take a ‘generation of effort’ to defeat. Mr Blair, who remains unrepentant about the bloody aftermath of the Iraq War, conceded that the West had underestimated the scale of the threat it faced from Islamist extremists. He said that although only a tiny number of people were directly involved in terrorist attacks, the number sympathetic to al-Qaeda’s message was ‘worryingly large’. He added: ‘The majority, as the Arab Spring shows, want what we want. But the minority are well organised and very determined and they are not confined to the ranks of suicide bombers.’ But Labour’s former Foreign Secretary David Miliband took a swipe at the ‘war on terror’ waged by Mr Blair in alliance with George W Bush in the wake of the 9/11 attacks – saying the words should . And he suggested the Iraq War had done more harm than good, adding: ‘I have to recognise that list of positives including Saddam gone, Kurds safe - but outweighed by the longer list of negatives.’","Wife flew to Manhattan the day before the attacks .

"La Liga champions Atletico Madrid were stunned by a vibrant Valencia side who scored three goals in the first 13 minutes. Los Che came flying out of the blocks at the Mestalla and made Diego Simeone's Atletico, which had been so disciplined in their defeat of Juventus in midweek, look like lambs to the slaughter. Perhaps that crunching battle against the Italian giants had drained them, for they were all at sea here. VIDEO Scroll down to see Simeone's intense training methods . Valencia's delighted players celebrate a goal against champions Atletico Madrid . Atletico Madrid's stunned players react after going 3-0 at the Mestalla . A missed penalty and a disallowed goal could have earned Atletico a point but it would have been far more than they deserved. Simeone, who has only recently returned to the touchline from his suspension, was helpless to do anything as his usually well-organised back-line crumbled to pieces. Joao Miranda was the chief culprit, with the Brazilian centre-back heading the ball past his goalkeeper from about 12 yards out. Shkodran Mustafi had pinged a long ball into the box and Miguel Angel Moya, once of Valencia himself, rushed out to catch it. But Miranda was not paying attention and, despite being under no pressure, reached it first and nodded the ball out of Moya's reach and into the net. There was no quarter given as Atletico's Alessio Cerci is tackled by Valencia's Jose Gaya . Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves is brought into action on a brilliant afternoon for his side . Valencia boss Nuno Santo celebrates with his players after an excellent victory over Atletico Madrid . Just one minute later, the lead had been doubled. Perhaps Miranda was shell-shocked, but he did nothing to prevent Andre Gomes slicing through the defence and drilling the ball inside the near post. Despite his lack of pressure it was still a brilliant goal by Valencia, with Paco Alcacer's cute flick allowing Gomes to use his momentum and burst into the box. So far, so bad for Atletico. As they fought to regain their stability, the conceded again and this time from a set piece. Valencia: Diego Alves; Barragan, Mustafi, Otamendi, Gaya; Javi Fuego, Parejo, Andre Gomes (Augusto 71); Rodrigo, Alcacer (Feghouli 75), Piatti (Orban 63) Goals: Miranda (o.g.6), Gomes (7), Otamendi (13) Booked: Gomes, Parejo, Fuego, Gaya . Atletico Madrid: Moya; Gamez, Miranda, Godín, Siqueira; Tiago (Raul Garcia), Gabi; Koke, Arda Turan (Jimenez 69), Griezmann (Cerci 66); Mandzukic . Goal: Mandzukic (29) Booked: Cerci . Sent off: Cerci . Referee: Fernando Teixeira Vitienes . This in itself is a rarity; Atletico are exceptionally good from dead ball situations, both in attack and defence. They have scored 10 of their 17 goals this season from set-pieces, while they rarely ship goals in those situations. Yet after 13 minutes Pablo Piatti whipped in a corner and Nicolas Otamendi snuck in and headed it home. Late last season Atletico made the trip to Valencia when they were trying to seal the title and fight off the challenge of Real Madrid and Barcelona. They earned a 1-0 win, thanks to a Raul Garcia header, with a traditionally steely peformance. The forward was not selected for this game, after his exploits against Juventus in the Champions League. Simeone would have wanted more of the same this time around, particularly considering Nuno Espirito Santo's Valencia side have been in fine fettle this season. It is far too early to pin them as potential title contenders, but this triumph was a statement of intent. Atletico, lacking the likes of Thibaut Courtois and Diego Costa, who both featured here last season, look a weaker side. They have bought well, with Mario Mandzukic doing a passable job up front, but the team doesn't yet have the energy of last year's outfit. Guilherme Siqueira, the left-back bought to replace Filipe Luis, now of Chelsea, was at fault for this defeat too, missing a penalty. Mandzukic had dragged his side back into the game after Valencia keeper Diego Alves had palmed away Tiago's stinging drive, straight into the path of the Croatian. He headed home from close range to give his side a lifeline, which they could have turned into a full-blown comeback had Siqueira taken more care. Defender Nicolas Otamendi is mobbed by his players after making it 3-0 to Valencia . Diego Simeone cut a typically animated figure on the touchline as Atletico Madrid struggled at Valencia . Atletico were denied a penalty when the ball struck Antonio Barragan's hand, but Fernando Teixeira Vitienes pointed to the spot when Jose Luis Gaya committed the same crime minutes later. Alves had an excellent penalty saving record and he dived to his right to gather Siqueira's effort. With this stop, Alves joined Santiago Canizares as a record holder, having stopped 13 penalties and seen two others missed out of the 31 he has faced. Atletico worked hard in the second-half, but to no avail. Subsitute Alessio Cerci had a goal ruled out in stoppage time, as he handled it before firing past Alves. To add insult to injury, it earned him a second yellow card and the Italian was given his marching orders. At full-time Valencia were sitting top of the La Liga table, at least before Barcelona took on Rayo Vallecano. Atletico were a shock to the system for the Catalan giants and Real Madrid last season. Santo will be hoping his Valencia side - still with new signing Alvaro Negredo to make his comeback from injury - can be this year's.","Valencia found themselves 3-0 up inside 13 minutes as hosts go top of La Liga .

"This was not how it was meant to be. The Luis Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi attacking trident has started twice and Barcelona have been beaten on both occasions. Although this defeat in the Nou Camp by Celta Vigo could never be as painful as their collapse against Real Madrid last weekend, it was more humiliating. Barcelona supporters have been waiting patiently to see Suarez unleashed at the Camp Nou, because of his biting suspension, and his availability was heralded as the start of a new era. But an almost supernatural performance by goalkeeper Sergio Alvarez, the woodwork and simply profligacy, meant that Luis Enrique was humbled by the side he managed last season. Messi is one goal away from equaling all-time top scorer in La Liga Telmo Zarra's record but it seems to be weighing heavy on his shoulders. He could not strike at the Santiago Bernabeu last week, missing a sitter, and nothing could beat Sergio here.

Barcelona's defence had been ripped to pieces in El Clasico, with Carlo Ancelotti's side inflicting a first league defeat on the Catalans. Having thrashed Granada earlier in the day, Madrid had leapfrogged Barcelona at the top of the Liga table, along with city rivals Atletico, who had seen off Cordoba. Barcelona manager Luis Enrique did an impressive job with Celta Vigo last season and Eduardo Berizzo has continued his work, playing a similar style of pressing, aggressive football. The Barca coach knew this wasn’t going to be an easy game and went for power in midfield, with Ivan Rakitic and Rafinha ahead of Sergio Busquets, with Xavi on the bench. Jeremy Mathieu was restored to centre-back after his hapless performance on the left against Madrid, while Gerard Pique, seen looking at his phone and clowning around during the Catalan Supercup on Wednesday, was not even included in the squad. Rakitic powered down the left early on, whipping the ball in for Neymar, who should have done better than head straight into the arms of Sergio. Just a couple of minutes later he made amends, with a dipping long range strike which swirled over the goalkeeper but hit the top of the crossbar. But Celta weren't planning on rolling over and having their bellies tickled. The Suarez-Messi-Neymar frontline were having teething difficulties. They looked more a collection of expensive parts than a functioning motor. This was exemplified when Suarez, on the right, cut the ball back to the edge of the box, but nobody was waiting there. Celta began to cause problems of their own, with Nolito, a former Barcelona player, firing over from a free kick. Pedro Hernandez headed at Claudio Bravo from a corner too, when he should have tested the keeper. Suarez sums up Barcelona's night as he kneels dejected on the Nou Camp turf, covering his face with his hands . Suarez beats Nolito down the right-hand side during Barcelona's La Liga match with Celta Vigo . Suarez cuts a figure of frustration as he spreads his arms wide to berate a team-mate . Those two chances acted as smelling salt for Barcelona, who took the game by the scruff of the neck. Neymar's cutback for Messi saw the Argentine's flash shot tipped over by Sergio. Just after half-an-hour Messi nearly struck, with his goal-bound shot hacked off the line, via the post, by Celta defender Jonny. Messi missed a third good chance with a free header from a Suarez cross, looping it over the bar, while the provider was harshly penalised in a 50-50 wrestling match with Jonny. The Uruguayan had a good chance to open his Barcelona account as half-time approached, but dragged his low strike from the left and Sergio fielded it easily. An almost identical chance for Neymar followed and he hit it low and hard, but his angled drive was tipped away by the Celta stopper. There may as well not have been a half-time break because Barcelona were back at it from the off. Messi’s through-ball fed Jordi Alba down the left and he cut it back for Neymar, who hit the crossbar for the second time in the match. Neymar had scored 11 in 11 before the match, but could not get on the scoresheet . Lionel Messi needs just two goals to beat the La Liga goalscoring record, but not even he could beat Alvarez Conde . Suarez (left) takes on Jonathan Castro Otto of Celta Vigo . But then Celta struck, 10 minutes into the second half. A long goal kick by Sergio saw Hernandez out-jump Javier Mascherano, with Nolito and Joaquin Larrivey running onto it. Nolito outmuscled Dani Alves and backheeled the ball cutely into Larrivey’s path. The forward had shaken off Sergio Busquets and rolled the ball past Claudio Bravo. It was the first goal Barcelona had conceded at the Nou Camp since the Diego Godin header which saw Atletico Madrid snatch the title out of their hands on the final day of last season. Enrique acted, throwing on Xavi for Busquets, Pedro for Rafinha and moving to three at the back with Mascherano in midfield. It almost paid dividends immediately, with Pedro receiving the ball on the right and looking to find a team-mate in the box. When faced with Suarez, Messi and Neymar all screaming for it, who do you pick? He opted for Suarez and the striker should have scored, heading into the grateful Sergio’s hands. Messi beats Celta Vigo's Sergi Gomez during a solo run, but he could not find the back of the net . Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique looks dejected as he watches on from the sidelines . The Barcelona wall jumps as Nolito's free-kick flies towards Bravo's goal . Suarez took a tumble on the edge of the box and Messi fired the free kick into the gods. Perhaps this was just going to be one of those days. It certainly looked like it when he had another from the same position and pinged it off the crossbar – the third time Barcelona had hit the woodwork. At the other end Celta continued attacking on the counter and should have put the game beyond Barcelona’s reach. Bravo saved a Nolito volley and substitute Charles headed the rebound over the bar with the goal gaping. Charles was foiled by Bravo too, his flicked effort palmed over the bar. Celta keeper Sergio, the clear man of the match, produced another brilliant stop to deny Suarez with five minutes left on the clock. The striker teed himself up on the edge of the box, but his sweet strike was palmed behind. In time, Suarez, Messi and Neymar will work. It has to. But the day after Halloween it turned out all the shocks hadn’t been used up. Barcelona's strikers will be having nightmares about Sergio for weeks.

"Mario Mandzukic missed two golden chances as La Liga champions Atletico Madrid started the defence of their campaign with a whimper against Rayo Vallecano. Missing suspended manager Diego Simeone, Atletico Madrid looked toothless without Diego Costa, even against the leakiest defence in last season’s competition, and the Croatian could not step up to fill the gap. At a rowdy, intimate Vallecas, the favourites looked tired after their Super Cup exertions on Friday against Real Madrid and lacked incision, showing why they have been linked with playmakers like Santi Cazorla, Marco Reus and Shinji Kagawa this summer. SCROLL down to watch Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone sent off in Super Cup . Failed to fire: Summer signing Mario Mandzukic missed two golden opportunities to score for Atletico Madrid . Banished: Atletico manager Diego Simeone has been banned from the touchline for eight matches .

Booked: Baena, Abdoulaye. Atletico Madrid: Moya, Juanfran, Godin, Miranda, Ansaldi; Koke, Gabi, Mario Suarez, Griezmann (Cebolla 84), Raul Jimenez (Saul 61), Mandzukic (Hector 74). Subs Not Used: Oblak, Gamez, Gimenez, Tiago. Booked: Mario Suarez, Juanfran . Referee: Clos Gomez . Att: 11,070 . Despite winning the title, Atletico Madrid still contrived to end last season—an incredible, unforgettable one for Rojiblanco supporters—in disappointment. The Champions League final defeat by arch-rivals Real Madrid was so ‘Atletico’ in its nature it was almost fitting—so, so close, but yet so far. A constant theme throughout the club’s history. Asked whether the club would be giving up their game-by-game stance to the season, which Simeone insisted the club were adhering to last year, the response was negative. He still sees his team as the underdogs to the league’s giants, Barcelona and Real Madrid, and wants them to take each task as it comes, forgetting about arcing grand-plans of lifting titles or competing in Europe. Simeone was banned for this match, having been given five managerial yellow cards last season. Deadlock: Rayo Vallecano deserved their point as the reigning La Liga champions started their season slowly . We won’t be seeing him on the touchline for a while longer, after he was hit with an additional eight-game punishment for his unruly behaviour against Real Madrid in the Super Cup last week. But the team have been well drilled by the Argentine and stuck to their roles under the watchful eye of the hulking Mono Burgos. If officials thought they had got out of the frying pan, they are firmly in the fire now, because the assistant coach has a capacity to go berserk that is even easier to trigger than Simeone’s. Atletico have been somewhat deconstructed over the summer, with Chelsea recalling Thibaut Courtois and signing Filipe Luis and Costa. David Villa was another who left, leaving the club working hard to plug the holes. On paper, the likes of Antoine Griezmann and Mandzukic should be able to make a decent fist of the challenge, but they struggled against Rayo Vallecano. Having seen Barcelona and Real win their opening matches, the task for Atletico against Madrid rivals Rayo was clear. Last season Simeone’s side won the title with 90 points. Given the millions the ‘big two’ have spent on reinforcements, the total could be closer to 100 this time around. The spirit and resilience from last season was still evident, with captain Gabi taking an almost ludicrously high boot from Alberto Bueno to his face in the opening few minutes and Miranda and Diego Godin taking no nonsense at the back. Tough night: Atletico Madrid were far from the form that saw them beat Real Madrid to the Spanish Super Cup . Chances were at a premium at the start of the match, with Griezmann being denied by Cristian Alvarez when the goalkeeper was quick off his line to intercept a through-ball. At the other end Chelsea’s on-loan youngster Gael Kakuta was finding getting the better of right-back Juanfran to be hard work, just like his parent side did last season in the Champions League. In the 25th minute Atletico put together a brilliant move, with Griezmann flicking the ball into the path of Cristian Ansaldi, galloping up the field from left-back. His low ball was met at the far post by Mandzukic, but the former Bayern Munich man could only find the side-netting. He had another brilliant opportunity moments later when Rayo centre-back Abdoulaye Ba needlessly gave the ball away on the edge of his own box. Raul Jimenez played it into the path of Mandzukic but the forward’s low strike was well saved by Cristian Alvarez. On the occasions Rayo got forward, Atletico defended in numbers to keep them at bay, with Courtois’ replacement Miguel Angel Moya being well shielded by his backline, leaving him without a save to make in the first half. Toothless: Without manager Diego Simeone on the touchline, Atletico lacked their usual spirit and desire . With Atletico struggling to win the midfield battle they took off Raul Jimenez and brought on youngster Saul Niguez, who spent last season on loan maturing under Paco Jemez at Rayo. It did nothing to help, with Rayo beginning to dominate the game. Kakuta began to have more of an influence and former Manchester United forward Manucho forced a good save from Moya with a firm header after the electric Javier Aquino whipped it in from the right. Although the striker was an abject failure at Old Trafford, he caused Atletico more than a few problems after entering the fray as a substitute. By the end of the game it was the home side that looked far likelier to break the deadlock and Atletico will consider themselves lucky to have escaped with a point. With Simeone unable to conduct affairs from the sidelines and instead stuck up near the press box, the players would not have been looking forward to their intense manager finally getting to let off some steam on the short coach-ride home.","Manager Diego Simeone started his eight-match touchline ban .

"Jane Fonda has opened up about reading the medical records of her mother and discovering that she had nine abortions before Jane was even born. In a speech at a fundraising event for a rape victims' charity, the 76-year-old Hollywood icon told the audience that her tragic mother Frances was sexually abused from the age of eight, an experience that Jane believes led to her promiscuous and self-destructive behavior. 'The minute that I read that, everything fell into place,' she said. 'I knew [the reason for] the promiscuity, the endless plastic surgery, the guilt, the inability to love or be intimate, and I was able to forgive her and forgive myself.' Scroll down for video . Heartbreaking revelation: Jane Fonda has opened up about reading the medical records of her mother Frances and discovering that she had nine abortions before Jane was even born . Frances, who was 29 when she gave birth to Jane, killed herself on her 42nd birthday, which friends say was the single most formative event in Jane's multi-faceted life. Jane told audience members that she suspects her mother was sexually abused by a piano tuner as a young girl, which left her traumatized for the rest of her life. Shortly after Jane's younger brother Peter was born, Frances was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Discovering that her husband was cheating on her with other women, Frances went to desperate lengths to regain his attention. She would walk around naked in front of him and even crawl on her hands and knees to him, begging him to talk to her. It didn't work. In 1950, on her 42nd birthday Frances committed suicide by slicing her throat with a razor during a stay at Craig House, a sanitarium in Beacon, New York. Jane was 12. Tragic: Frances killed herself on her 42nd birthday, when Jane was 12. Jane believes her suicide was linked the the fact that she was sexually abused from the age of eight .

Jane's father Henry was cold and a bully, not to mention a shameless womanizer, but - too young to understand mental illness - his daughter always blamed the alarming behavior of her manic depressive mother for the break-up of her parents' marriage - until she learned of Frances' abuse. The fitness queen, who is a longtime pro-choice activist, believes she has been drawn to helping sexually abused girls because she somehow knew what had befallen her mother. She said at the event that sexual violence is 'epidemic', vowing: 'I will support the Rape Treatment Center for the rest of my life.' Jane has written on her blog that she forgave her mother for their fractious relationship after discovering she was sexually abused, realizing that her behavior was not her fault. 'Twenty years later she could have found the help she needed in the specific form of therapy that arose out of The Women’s Liberation Movement in the 1970s,' she wrote last October. 'I sometimes cry when I think of how my mother could have been saved.'","The Hollywood icon, 76, made the heartbreaking revelation while reading her mother's medical records .

"Kim Watson, 32, has been charged with stealing and selling on goods worth $3.7million from Sears . A Sears clerk has been charged with stealing goods worth $3.7million from one of the department store's warehouses. Kim Watson, 32, allegedly sold on the high-end merchandise after taking it from the Sears Distribution Center in Logan Township, New Jersey. Watson, from Clementon, was arrested on Friday after a long-term investigation led detectives to believe the inventory clerk had been taking cash payments for the goods. The investigation, by Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office, found that everything from bedding to kitchen appliances had gone missing. Police believe that the merchandise was sold to a network of people around the New York tri-state area, NJ.com reported. The haul totaled roughly $3.7million at retail prices, meaning Sears had lost around $2.6million. Watson was charged with second degree theft and was held at Salem County Jail in default of a $50,000 bail. Captain Robert Leash, from Logan police, said the investigation was ongoing. He said: 'We are still looking into this. We know she had a network. She didn't do this alone, and these people knew they were receiving stolen goods.'

"The mother of the model police say was beaten and stabbed to death by former Hi-Five singer Russell Neal says the killing 'took her heart.' Catherine Martinez, 24, was found brutally murdered in the apartment she shared with Neal, 40, after he walked into a Texas police station and said his wife was dead. This is the first time her family has spoken since the grisly discovery. 'If you seeing this, just remember you took a part of my life, part of my heart,' a devastated Catherine Figueroa, Martinez's mother, told KTRK between tears. 'My bonita': Catherine Figueroa cried while saying her beautiful daughter's death took away a piece of her life . 'She was my sister': Glenda Lewis cried after saying her sister may have been dead for days before she was found . The grieving woman called her dead daughter 'my bonita,' which is Spanish for beautiful, and claimed Neal was violent towards her. 'He was abusive the whole time and I keep telling my daughter leave it alone, let it go,' Figueroa insisted. Sister Glenda Lewis could not stop crying. 'They just keep saying she might have been lifeless for days, that was my sister,' she shouted while wiping away tears. The former member of chart-topping 1990s boy band was arrested Wednesday after bursting into a Texas police station and telling police his wife was dead and he needed a lawyer.

According to KHOU, Neal told police he'd gotten into an argument with Martinez before he asked for an attorney and then clammed up. A witness described the exceptionally docile scene to KTRK. 'He wasn't resisting arrest or fighting with them, or saying anything. When they brought him out in handcuffs, he was just as calm as can be and they just put him in a police car,' said Mary Alice Valencia, who works at a nearby bond office and is accustomed to seeing arrests. Facebook user Wayne Head was in the police station when Neal entered and took photos of the former singer. Head appears to claim in his error-filled post that Neal went so far as to admit he killed Martinez. '[Neal] walk n an say he just killed his wife she at home deveased,' wrote Head.

"A legal battle over profits from the only two known photographs of legendary Delta bluesman Robert Johnson - who is said to have sold his soul to the devil for prowess on the guitar - now rests with the Mississippi Supreme Court. Johnson, whose songs have influenced a host of famous musicians, was destitute when he died in Mississippi in 1938 at age 27. His estate is valuable, partly because of a collection of his recordings that won a Grammy in 1990. Three justices heard arguments on Monday in the dispute about the photos, one of which is a studio portrait taken of the Mississippi bluesman by Hooks Brothers Studios in Memphis, Tenn. One of just two known photos of Robert Johnson was used as the cover for the 1990 album of his recordings which won a Grammy for 'Best Historical Album' The other photo, known as 'the dime store portrait' or 'the photo booth self-portrait,' was taken by Johnson himself. Presiding Justice Jess H. Dickinson said he and his colleagues will take time to consider the case. He didn't say when they will rule. On one side are descendants of Johnson's late half-sister, Carrie Harris Thompson. Their attorney, Stephen E. Nevas, argued the photos were Thompson's personal property but others profited from them. On the other side are Sony Music Entertainment Inc.; Johnson's only heir, his son Claud Johnson; and Stephen C. LaVere, a promoter whose Delta Haze Corp. had a 1974 contract with Thompson. Anita Modak-Truran, a Jackson attorney representing Sony Music Entertainment, said Monday that court battles over Johnson's estate have dragged out nearly a quarter century - almost as long as the blues legend lived. 'This case plays like a broken record and the needle is stuck on 'Crossroads Blues,'"" Modak-Truran said. The second photo, used here on the cover of a documentary, is known as 'the dime store portrait' or 'the photo booth self-portrait,' and was taken by Johnson himself . On Nov. 20, 1974, Thompson signed a contract with LaVere to assign all her rights to Johnson's work, photographs and any other material concerning Johnson that she might have. In return, LaVere was to pay Thompson 50 percent of all royalties he collected in his efforts to capitalize off Johnson. LaVere signed a deal with CBS Records to release a collection of Robert Johnson's 29 recorded songs. CBS, later acquired by Sony, released a boxed set of Johnson's recordings. It sold more than a million copies and won the 1990 Grammy for Best Historical Album. Nevas argued that without the photographs of Robert Johnson, the collection of his recordings would not have been issued and nobody on the other side of the dispute 'would have collected the millions they have reaped.' Eric Clapton, who covered Robert Johnson songs on his 2004 album 'Me and Mr. Johnson' also called him 'the most important blues singer that ever lived' Thompson died in 1983 and her heirs, . Annye C. Anderson and Robert M. Harris, argue that they are entitled to . royalties. Anderson is Thompson's half-sister, but is not related to . Robert Johnson. Harris is Thompson's grandson. Claud Johnson, whose parents were not . married, found out about his father's estate in the early 1990s, after . Thompson's death, and went to court. In 2000, Claud Johnson was declared . the musician's sole heir. Leflore . County Circuit Judge Ashley Hines ruled in 2001 that when Claud Johnson . was declared the musician's sole heir, the royalties specified in the . 1974 contract were to go to him. The . Supreme Court found in 2004 that the question of whether the photos . were the personal property of Carrie Thompson was never litigated. It . directed Hines to rule on the issue. Hines, . without a trial, found in 2012 there was no triable issue of fact on . the plaintiffs' arguments for royalties and breach of contract. Nevas on Monday asked the Supreme Court to send the case back to the lower court to let jurors decide the issue. Johnson is ranked fifth in . Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time, while Eric Clapton once called him 'the most . important blues singer that ever lived.'","Legend has it that the Delta bluesman sold his soul to the devil in return for his virtuoso guitar skills .

"Real Madrid's 22-game winning streak was ended by an inspired Valencia in one of the most thrilling games of the season so far, despite Cristiano Ronaldo putting his side into the lead from the spot. Antonio Barragan got Los Che back on level terms before another defender, Nicolas Otamendi headed his side in front to stun Carlo Ancelotti's side. It handed Barcelona the chance to get back in the La Liga driving seat, but they spurned it against David Moyes' Real Sociedad and it means Madrid are top of the table by a point, with an extra game still to make up.

Valencia played with amazing intensity, continuing their revival this season under Nuno Espirito Santo and showed they are good value to get back into the Champions League. This was the scene of one of Gareth Bale's greatest triumphs, the ground where he scored that brilliant solo goal against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey, but along with Karim Benzema he was substituted as Madrid desperately searched for an equaliser. January is usually a gruelling month in Spain because that tournament begins for La Liga sides, and this year is no different. Real face local rivals Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night in the cup, but Ancelotti picked his strongest available side. The last time these teams met, it took a quite brilliant Ronaldo strike to earn Real Madrid a point, the Portugal star's acrobatic backheel one of the goals of the season. Luka Modric was missing that day and injury again prevented the Croatian from playing—he is expected back in February—while Marcelo and Sergio Ramos, both injury doubts, started. There is a good feeling around Valencia this season, especially now Peter Lim is in control of the club's affairs. New €25million signing Enzo Perez was incorporated into the midfield straight away, replacing the suspended Javi Fuego. Seven thousand Valencia fans were there to greet the team bus when it arrived, and created a huge tifo reading 'Yes we can', while Lim himself visited the dressing room. The supporters weren't particularly keen on their team giving Real Madrid a guard of honour at the start of the game, to recognise their Club World Cup success, and made their feelings known. The only time Valencia have fallen at home this season was against Barcelona and even that was a barely deserved, last-minute win thanks to Sergio Busquets ramming home after a scramble in the box. Going to the Mestalla is no easy task, and Valencia made sure of it from the off, with a string of challenges that toed a fine line between hard-but-fair and brutal. Nuno's side accumulated an astonishing five bookings in the first half, including one for new boy Perez.

Ronaldo holds his hands to his lips after coming close to scoring his second goal of the evening . Valencia's strong starts have been notable this season, particularly when they raced into a 3-0 lead over Champions Atletico Madrid, whom they trail by a point after this game. But despite coming out all guns blazing, it was Madrid that took the lead. Alvaro Negredo handled the ball in the box after a Toni Kroos free kick had not been dealt with, and Ronaldo sent penalty expert Diego Alves the wrong way from the spot. Historically Los Che have a strong record against Real Madrid, having beaten them 42 times, more than any other side in Spanish football history. Recent years have proved more disappointing though, with the club unable to attain victory in any of the previous 10 clashes with Los Blancos. Against Barcelona, Valencia had not been able to maintain their intensity, but here they did, coming out in the second half swinging, and they got their reward. Barragan, the right-back who is out of contract in the summer, was having a marvellous game and on one of his runs forward earned some space for a shot, just outside the box. His strike deflected off Pepe and past the helpless Casillas, setting the stadium alight. And then, the unthinkable. Daniel Parejo swung the ball in from a corner kick and Nicolas Otamendi rose highest, thanks to a superhuman, hanging leap, and planted the ball far beyond Casillas to send the Valencia supporters wild. The rampaging Barragan had another chance shortly after Valencia took the lead but fired inches wide of Casillas' far post after some stunning build-up play and Andre Gomes' through-ball. Madrid hooked Bale, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez, with Sami Khedira, Jese and Javier Hernandez thrown on in their places. They came extremely close through Isco but goalkeeper Diego Alves made an outstanding save from his header, before goalscorer Otamendi acrobatically smashed the ball off the line to prevent Ronaldo following up. He had another chance towards the end but span a header wide of the near post when he should have hit the target. The front cover of Barcelona-based newspaper Sport had read 'Liga caliente', signifying that the title race was hotting up. It was more in hope than expectation, but Valencia at a riotous Mestalla, came through. Valencia's defender Barragan (centre) celebrates after bringing the home side level in the second half .

"New Chelsea signing Cesc Fabregas has been involved in a training ground row with Spain coach Vicente del Bosque.

"Luis Enrique's new era at Barcelona is underway and Gerard . Deulofeu showed why he may have a big part to play in it. The 20-year-old is likely to get some opportunities to play . alongside Lionel Messi at the start of the season, unless Luis Suarez's . four-month ban is revoked. In that time he will be aiming to impress enough to be a . real alternative for Enrique and his quest began on Saturday night when he . helped Barcelona win the Trofeo Colombino.

It was Deulofeu's low strike which was parried by Dani . Sotres to the waiting Joan Roman, who gleefully turned it home from close-range . to net the first goal of Enrique's reign. Deulofeu had beaten two men with a quick dribble before . making some space for his shot, showing he has the attributes to unlock the . defences that so readily retreat into their own box against Barcelona. With two minutes to go he could have scored himself, lashing . the ball past Sotres from a tight angle, but seeing it come crashing back off . the crossbar. There was a modicum of pressure to perform on his shoulders, . after he was spotted earlier in the week mocking a Cristiano Ronaldo goal . celebration. Elements of his game are similar to the Real Madrid star's, . with the forward, on loan at Everton last season, offering plenty of . stepovers. He also lured Dimas Delgado into an ungainly lunge, hacking . down Deulofeu and ending up in the referee's notebook.

Back from injury: Ibrahim Afellay vies for possession with Recreativo midfielder Dimas . In the 50th edition of the Trofeo Colombino, a tournament . set up by Recreativo Huelva to commemorate their position as Spain's oldest . club, Barcelona were worthy winners. This game marked Huelva's 125th anniversary, but they could . not do themselves justice with Enrique's side firmly in control in the . Andalusian heat. Although the game featured plenty of youth players there . were a few hints of what was to follow from Enrique. The team played a more fluid style than last season, with . less of the diagonal, longer balls that Tata Martino favoured. In the first half Croatian starlet Alen Halilovic was the . best player on show. Barcelona fought off interest from Real Madrid, Arsenal and . Tottenham to secure their man and we saw why, with his fantastic technique . obvious from the start. Deep in thought: Luis Enrique looks on during Barcelona's friendly win over Recreativo . Likes a change: Enrique walks out for the second half after making eleven changes at the break . There are shades of Luka Modric about Halilovic, but he . plays with a more aggressive attacking style. One superbly hit half-volley from the edge of the box forced . Sotres into a smart save at his near post, and another clever nutmeg had the . crowd purring. With Halilovic pulling the strings in midfield and Adama . Traore's direct running worrying the Huelva defence, Barcelona looked in fine . fettle. Goalkeeper Jordi Masip had a couple of shaky moments early . on with some poor kicks, which he will not be pleased with, given Enrique's . words about giving him a chance. The manager said that even though Marc-Andre ter Stegen and . Claudio Bravo had been signed, all three goalkeepers would start the season on . an even footing.

"The scary thing is that Lionel Messi still has years to go. At just 27 years old, he became the all-time top scorer in Spanish football history, scoring a brilliant hat-trick to cement his place in the record books above Telmo Zarra. Messi began the game on 250 goals, one behind the former Athletic Bilbao striker. He ended it on 253, putting paid to the last few weeks of wondering just how and when he would eventually become, inarguably, the greatest goalscorer La Liga has ever known. Of course, Messi is so much more than a goalscorer. Sevilla found that out the hard way on Saturday night, with the Argentine the heartbeat of a Barcelona side which didn’t trip up in a potentially tricky clash against Unai Emery’s high-flying Andalusians, moving back to second place, two points behind Real Madrid. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Barcelona 5-1 Sevilla . Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi (top) created history as he became La Liga's all-time top goalscorer on Saturday .

Messi (centre) slid home his second - and Barcelona's fourth of the night against Sevilla - to score his 252nd goal in La Liga . Barcelona: Bravo, Alves, Pique, Mathieu, Alba (Adriano 80), Busquets, Rakitic, Xavi (Rafinha 77), L Suarez (Pedro 74), Messi, Neymar. Subs not used: Ter Stegen, Bartra, Sergi Roberto, Munir.

Booked: Coke. Goal: Alba OG 47. Referee: Juan Martinez Munuera. Attendance: 78,283 . The Nou Camp chanted his name, his team-mates threw him up into the air, giving him the bumps. Messi walked towards the tunnel, clutching the match ball. Before he was allowed to leave, the Barcelona team stood by his side, watching a video of his goals and clips of his former team-mates and coaches hailing him. Messi looked taken aback, almost sheepish as some of his greatest moments were played out to the 78,000 spectators. But he also looked happy. Despite his comments earlier this week, suggesting his future may lie elsewhere, it’s almost impossible to see him leaving his home here. The other Barcelona players gave him a guard of honour as he left the field. By contrast, Luis Suarez is still searching for his first Barcelona goal and was denied by Sevilla goalkeeper Beto when he raced on to a clipped through ball. The striker switched positions with Messi after 15 minutes, taking the centre-forward role while the Argentine moved to the right. Messi's position is never easy to describe, as he drifts inside when he fancies, and on one such excursion he was knocked to the ground by Ever Banega on the edge of the box. It was a cheap free-kick to give away and Messi made Sevilla pay a hefty price. He arrowed the ball into the top left corner, leaving Beto clutching at thin air. The scoreboard lit up with a message to congratulate Messi on reaching Zarra's all-time record and the relief on the Barcelona legend's face was clear for the world to see. Relief for having matched the record, relief even for having scored for the first time in La Liga for over a month. Neither obstacle was likely to last long in the face of this footballing giant. The last few weeks have not been a happy time for Barcelona. A couple of defeats, combined with a poor performance away at Almeria have led to a lot of questions being asked about the coach’s tactics and methods. There were questions being asked just a minute into the second half. Vitolo got down the left and fired the ball across. Barcelona’s on loan midfielder Denis Suarez battled with Claudio Bravo for the loose ball, which cannoned off the unfortunate Jordi Alba and into the net. Messi celebrates giving Barcelona the lead with a sumptuous free-kick against Sevilla in the first half . The 27-year-old celebrated his strike in his trademark manner by pointing to the heavens .

The 22-year-old (right) engaged in some samba-style dancing with his club and international team-mate Dani Alves after his goal . But before the stadium had a chance to whistle its displeasure in the usual fashion, Barcelona were back in front. Xavi curled in a free-kick from the left and Neymar rose highest to nod home his 11th league goal of the season. While Messi is the superstar and Suarez is the star signing, Neymar’s own star has been rising higher this season. The Brazilian has become far more effective in front of goal this term, spurred on by his impressive World Cup campaign. Gerard Pique's exile from the Barcelona side was ended by Enrique for this match. His last appearance was in the Clasico defeat at the Bernabeu, where he gave away a penalty. Whether he was missing because of some weak performances or a string of disciplinary offences has never been clarified by the Asturian coach, but regardless, the punishment now appears to be over. Pique won't get away scot free with his role in the Sevilla goal, with both the Spaniard and Dani Alves culpable of switching off, far more to blame than the actual player who put through his own net. Barcelona had dominated the first half, with only poor finishing and a couple of agricultural Sevilla challenges preventing them from further increasing their lead. A brilliant Beto save from Neymar on the stroke of half-time was the closest they came to doing so, while Suarez was denied after Messi had played a sublime ball to Alba, who sought out the Uruguayan. Ivan Rakitic (left) extended Barcelona's lead with a header just after the hour mark at the Camp Nou . Rakitic celebrates in a subdued manner after scoring against his former side on Saturday night . Messi is congratulated by Barcelona team-mates Neymar and Luis Suarez after scoring his third goal of the night . While Suarez has had trouble finding the net, the first few weeks of his Barcelona career - after his lengthy suspension for biting ended - have been fruitful. He has created several opportunities for his team-mates, setting up both Barca goals in a man-of-the-match second half substitute appearance against Almeria. And he made another one here, eking out the perfect cross for Ivan Rakitic to head home from close range. The Croatian diligently finished off the chance but looked mortified at having scored against his former side. He was the star performer in Sevilla’s run to the Europe League final and eventual triumph last season, although his start to life at Barcelona has been mixed. But whatever problems there are at Barcelona will have to be analysed another day. Messi made sure of that. He surged in to meet Neymar’s cross at full-length and poke home from a yard, to become the all-time top goalscorer in La Liga history. If he hadn’t reached it, Suarez would have had an easy tap in. But Messi does reach things that he shouldn’t. No player will overtake him for many, many years. And at only 27, he’s got plenty more goals to add to his tally. He began the task immediately. Messi’s third goal was the best of the night, a sprawling dribble, cutting from right to left, a quick-fire one two with Neymar, a light touch to take it out of his feet, and then one of those low, placed drives from distance that he makes look so fantastically easy. That's what Messi does. He makes things look fantastically easy - even the impossible. Messi applauds the 78,000 fans who witnessed his record-breaking feat at the Nou Camp on Saturday at full-time .

"New life, new job, new man! Despite going through a very public - and very messy - divorce, former The View co-host Sherri Shepherd has quietly started dating R&B singer Johnny Gill, MailOnline has learned exclusively. A friend of Sherri's tells Mail Online that the couple met on June 25 when Johnny performed with his band New Edition on The View and they've been seeing each other ever since. 'Sherri is a big New Edition fan and was excited to have them at the show. But she and Johnny really connected and exchanged personal contact information,' a source at the show reveals. Music to her ears: Sherri Shepherd and Johnny Gill met when New Edition appeared on The View last June . The two began speaking long distance, using FaceTime on their iPhones. Then Johnny flew Sherri out to see him where New Edition 'All Six' tour, featuring the whole group, was playing. 'She flew out to see him in Houston, Virginia Beach and Los Angeles. She enjoyed being out on the road and enjoyed getting to know him,' according to the friend.

"British firms are forced to hire foreign staff because workers here are too lazy, Eastern Europeans claimed yesterday. They are not prepared to stand in a factory for eight to 12 hours and find it easier to live on benefits, recruiters said. Sandwich maker Greencore Group – which supplies Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Asda – is seeking staff from Eastern Europe because it cannot find locals willing to do the work. Scroll down for video . Greencore staff hard at work in one of their factories - but bosses are seeking staff from Eastern Europe because they cannot find locals willing to do the work . Yesterday the Hungarian company it has hired to recruit workers suggested Britons are less likely to put up with low-paid manual labour. Tanay Marcell, of Euwork employment agency in Budapest, said about 100 Hungarians – many of them graduates – had already applied to make and package sandwiches for Greencore in Northampton. Even those with a degree can earn three times what they would at home. Mr Marcell said working at the factory would involve ‘standing eight and 12 hours long’, which was ‘not an easy thing’. While Hungarians were happy to do this, many Britons would not do so because they were used to different conditions. ‘These Hungarian people will do the same badly paid jobs in Hungary. To them it is worth it because of the good salary,’ he said. Tanay Marcell, of Euwork employment agency in Budapest, said about 100 Hungarians had applied . Greencore employs 1,100 staff at its current Northampton base but is looking for another 250 workers for a new £35million factory due to open in early 2016. Yesterday’s Daily Mail story, in which the firm said it had struggled to recruit because it was ‘not always the kind of work’ locals wanted, sparked fierce debate over whether Britons are too reluctant to take low-paid jobs that are eagerly snapped up by Eastern Europeans. Sir Michael Rake, president of the Confederation of British Industry, told the BBC: ‘That is a story I have heard many, many times from companies right across the country who are unable to find the people who are skilled enough or are willing to do the work. That is the issue – even to make sandwiches.’ He said many businesses had no choice but to recruit staff from Eastern Europe and claimed capping EU migration would leave UK firms with a ‘huge’ staff shortage because many Britons do not have ‘the same skills and willingness to work’. He added that the lack of vocational training and even basic literacy and numeracy skills in the UK brought shame on our schools and workplaces. David Cameron vowed to ensure the welfare system ‘rewards work’ and is not so generous that it encourages Britons to choose a life on benefits over full-time work. The Prime Minister also said Britain must ensure its young people had the necessary skills to compete with EU migrants in the workplace. There were still too many who lacked these skills, he added. He told the CBI conference: ‘We need to have proper immigration control. But the flipside of the coin on immigration is a welfare system that rewards work and an education system that turns out people with the skills necessary to do the jobs that we are creating in our country today.’ Mr Cameron has vowed to limit net migration to Britain from Europe and reform freedom of movement rules if he wins the next election. Critics questioned yesterday why Greencore could not find staff in Northampton, where 8,000 are unemployed. Hungarian employment agency EUWork, which recruits Hungarian workers for British jobs. In Hungary, the average wage is little more than £7,000. Earning the minimum wage in Britain would mean a salary of £13,520 . David Mackintosh, leader of the borough council, told Channel 4 news: ‘It’s great to have the jobs in the town but actually I don’t think they can have looked hard enough if they are having to go to Eastern Europe to find them but I don’t think actually recruiting in Hungary helps to address the problem and could potentially create future problems for our town. ‘We already have an infrastructure that struggles to cope, we’re a growing town, and as people struggle to get access to our public services we need to bear that in mind before we encourage more people to come here.’ Greencore said it sponsored a Northampton jobs fair in September which yielded ‘decent’ interest and held a recent recruitment event in Corby, from which 50 staff out of 500 who had been made redundant from a local sandwich-making factory were hired. But it still cannot find enough workers locally. A spokesman said: ‘We have already started a range of recruitment initiatives locally and have been pleased with the response. ‘However, we will also be considering applicants from further afield, including Hungary, and will be conducting interviews with suitable candidates in due course. We are extremely proud of the diversity of our workforce and, as always, will be hiring on a strict equal opportunities basis.’ In Budapest yesterday, Rita Kovago, 32, was interviewed for a job at the Northampton factory and told she would earn the minimum wage of £6.50, plus extra for night shifts. Miss Kovago, a sales manager for a heavy industrial goods company, said: ‘It is not a lot of money for you but it is a lot of money for us.’ In a message to British workers who might lose out, she said: ‘It’s their problem. If they don’t want to do the job, they shouldn’t be against foreign workers coming.’ In Hungary, the average wage is little more than £7,000. Earning the minimum wage in Britain would mean a salary of £13,520 – which can be topped up by generous tax credits and other benefits. George Robert, 47, who owns a sandwich shop in central Budapest, said his sister, a university historian, worked in a factory for years after moving to Britain. ‘It took her 18 years to get a job like the one she had at a university in Hungary,’ he said. ‘It is the dirty jobs that the English people don’t want and for us the same jobs are fantastic. It is sad.’","Sandwich maker Greencore Group  is seeking staff from Eastern Europe .

"A cheating wife has been sentenced to life in prison after recruiting two men she met in a bar to murder her wealthy husband to get his £1million fortune. Charlotte Collinge, 45, took two men back to the £400,000 house she shared with her husband Clifford Collinge, 17 years her senior, with the promise of sex. As they approached the detached property, she told the pair - Stephen Shreeves, 40, and 27-year-old Kelvin Dale - that she 'hated' her husband, and asked if they knew anyone that could kill him. Caroline Collinge, left, took two men back to her house on the promise of sex, so they could kill her husband of 14 years Clifford, pictured right. Once they got to the house she told both men she wanted her husband dead . Once there, the men launched a savage attack on the 61-year-old retired newsagent which left him with 46 separate injuries. Collinge, who was out of the house at . the time buying cocaine, returned to the house in Mansfield, . Nottinghamshire, to find her husband lying in a pool of blood - but . stepped over his body instead of calling an ambulance. Help was only summoned half-an-hour later by a worried friend of 44-year-old Collinge who she had spoken to on the phone. Prosecutors said that if there had not been a delay in dialling 999, Mr Collinge may have survived. Following a four-week trial, a jury of . five women and seven men found Collinge, Shreeves and Dale guilty of Mr . Collinge’s murder. Collinge was today jailed for a . minimum of 23 years, while Stephen Shreeves, 40, and Kelvin Dale, 27, . were each jailed for 18 years. Kelvin Dale (left) and Stephen Shreeves (right) were both found guilty of the murder of Clifford Collinge at Nottingham Crown Court . Sentencing the trio at Nottingham . Crown Court, the judge, His Honour Mr Justice Colman Treacy, said: 'The . killing of Clifford Collinge in his own home was a truly shocking . offence. 'On the evidence I have heard, I’m . satisfied he was a man who offered no harm to any of you and who indeed . had, over a number of years, tolerated the wilful and manipulative . behaviour of an unfaithful wife.' Judge Mr Justice Treacy told Collinge . she was the 'instigator' of the attack, which took place in the village . of Warsop last October. He added: 'You caused the killing for your own selfish reasons. 'There is evidence to show that for a . period of time prior to his death, you wanted the prompt termination of . the life of your husband. I am sure a factor in motivation was gain for . yourself.' During the trial, prosecutor Peter . Joyce QC told the court that the couple, who had been together for 17 . years in total, had a rocky relationship peppered with break-ups and . reconciliations, and divorce had been discussed. The trial heard that on the day of the . killing Collinge, who had a string of lovers, told a close friend: ""I . can't take any more of him. 'I've had enough of Cliff. The only way to get him out of my life is to kill him.' Hours later she started flirting with strangers Shreeves and Dale in a wine bar and persuaded them to return home with her. When police arrived at the scene after the attack, Collinge was heard to say: 'Oh God, I think I have killed him.' Nottinghamshire Police has issued a picture of a clamp that was used in Clifford Collinge's murder . But she quickly claimed she had no . idea Mr Collinge was going to be attacked, and had returned to find him . lying injured. She told jurors she failed to call an ambulance because . she was 'in shock'. In the weeks leading up to the killing, Collinge had moved out of the marital home to live with a 21-year-old 'toy boy'. Jurors were told that despite her . unfaithfulness, Mr Collinge continued to send his wife money and allowed . her to return home after she claimed her younger lover had beaten her . up. But just a week before his death, . Collinge had talked of killing her husband with sleeping pills and . making his death look like an accident. Peter Joyce QC, prosecuting, told the . jury: 'The deceased was a man of some wealth. Friends of the couple . thought that Charlotte Collinge was using the deceased. 'She would speak openly about gaining . access to his home and money, stating: 'I'll have that house. I will use . any means whatsoever to get it'.' The court heard that in the event of . Mr Collinge passing away, his estate would be split between his wife and . two children, Julie Bowles, 34, by his first marriage, and Cristal, 16, . who was his daughter with Collinge. Collinge would have got the £400,000 . marital home, a cash payment of £250,000, all of his belongings and half . of future rents from other properties he owned. The total would have . been around £1million. Jailed: Collinge was jailed at Nottingham Crown Court for a minimum of 23 years while Shreeves and Dale were both sentenced to 18 years . In a statement read to the court after . the verdicts, Cristal, who now lives with her boyfriend's family, said . her father was 'generous and caring'. She added: 'My dad meant everything to me. We went everywhere together. 'He was the best kind of father anyone . could have. If I had problems he would always be there for me. He . called me 'Princess'. He was my hero.' Following the sentencing today, Mr Collinge's daughter, Julie Bowles, said outside court: 'We are truly devastated that we will never again see our dear old dad smile, and that he will miss out on watching his beloved grandchildren grow up.To have a child ask why their grandad had to die and not know the answer myself is beyond words. 'Forty-six injuries in his own home. We are in complete shock and disbelief that this has happened to our dad. 'The knowledge that our father was forced to suffer in the way he did, as arranged by someone whom, against all the advice from his friends, he supported for so long, is an unspeakable burden of knowledge to now have to carry through our lives.'I believe Shreeves and Dale were caught up in the premeditated actions of Charlotte. But they, along with her, must now face the consequences.' Steve Gad, a friend of Mr Collinge's, . said: 'Cliff loved her right until the very end. He loved her to pieces. It was his undoing. 'She took the life of a loving father. Quite callously and absolutely, deliberately, with no thought for . anyone else except herself. 'Her only motive was financial gain. She obviously didn't love him - because she was telling everyone she didn't love him.' Speaking outside the court, Temporary Superintendent Kate Meynell, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: 'I think the sentences today would reflect the severity of the attack on Clifford Collinge. 'It was a horrible attack, it was planned by his wife and she recruited two men earlier in the evening to carry out the attack and they've received the justice that they deserved. 'Charlotte Collinge has come across as an extremely cold and calculating woman. She obviously took Clifford Collinge for all she could get. He was besotted with her and she took advantage of that and carried on doing that until she killed him. 'It's our belief and the prosecution case that she did this to try and get money. She wanted a divorce, she wanted access to his house, he didn't want to sell the house and she thought this was the only way to get what she wanted.'","Charlotte Collinge, 45, told friends she would get her husband Clifford's house and money by 'any means whatsoever'
