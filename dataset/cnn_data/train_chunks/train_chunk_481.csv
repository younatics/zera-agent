Murdered: April Kauffman had been shot numerous times in the bedroom of her home in Linwood, about 12 miles from Atlantic City . The day before her death, she . co-hosted 'The King Arthur Show' on radio station WIBG, a show she had . appeared on weekly for at least several months. But the prosecutor said . the killing apparently had nothing to do with her work on the radio. Atlantic County Prosecutor Theodore . Housel suggested Friday that an arrest was likely, though he didn't say . how soon or provide any information about a possible suspect. 'We have sufficient information to conduct an ongoing investigation that we believe will ultimately be successful,' he said. Kauffman’s friends and associates said . she owned a catering business and a hair salon but was best known in . the area for her support of veterans, including on-air. Her husband, James Kauffman, is a practicing endocrinologist in Linwood, The Press of Atlantic City reported. Well-known: Kauffman hosted a weekly talk radio program on WOND, where she advocated for veterans causes and other issues . Neighbours told CBS that they . witnessed Kauffman's distressed husband arriving at . the murder scene yesterday, saying his wife was asleep with a pillow over her face when he went to . work early that morning. Neighbour Lou Tate told ABC that the endocrinologist spoke briefly to his wife and kept asking, 'Why now?' 'I . think he's getting ready to retire,' Tate told the station. 'They . bought a home in Arizona, and I think they wanted to relocate possibly.' Kauffman, a grandmother, hosted a weekly talk radio program on WOND, where she advocated for veterans causes and other issues. 'She just had an incredible . personality. She could never say no to any charity or anything. The kind . of person who would give you the shirt off her back,' her radio show . co-host, Arthur Gropper, said. Gropper said Kauffman was in a jovial . mood Wednesday, with no indication anything was troubling her. He said . they were celebrating progress on veterans issues and she was talking . about wanting to work with homeless veterans. Until February, she had also hosted a weekly talk show on radio station WOND. Donna Clementoni, a friend and fellow . veterans advocate from Egg Harbor Township, told The Press that Kauffman . sent her an email around 1:50 a.m. Thursday about an event the two were . planning. She said she tried to reach Kauffman about 9 a.m. but . couldn't. 'I have no idea why anyone would do . this. She's like a local legend. She's outspoken. She's like a bombshell . and all she ever wanted to do was help people,' Clementoni said. Husband: Neighbours said they witnessed Kauffman's distressed husband, Dr. James Kauffman, arriving at the murder scene yesterday, saying his wife was asleep with a pillow over her face when he left for work early that morning . Location: The scene outside the 47-year-old's house after a worker discovered her bullet-riddled body . Tribute: Harry Hurley, who did several radio broadcasts with Kauffman, said the 47-year-old 'Did the work of 100 people' Harry Hurley, who did several radio broadcasts with Kauffman, told The Press of Atlantic City that she ‘did the work of 100 people.’ He was shocked that somebody who did so much to help other people could be murdered so viciously. 'I can't think of anybody that would . want to do harm to April because all she ever did was help people and . she didn't do it in a way that she could have garnered any enemies,' Hurley told CBS. US Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) added to the network: 'Quite simply, . April was a patriot in every sense of the word and her tireless work on . behalf of those who served made a real difference in the lives of . many.' The tireless activist had recently been . awarded the New Jersey Governor's Jefferson Award for her outstanding . contribution to the community, according to the Press of Atlantic City. Police tape remained cordoned around the couple's home on Friday as detectives continued to scour the area for clues. A neighbour who did not want to be identified told the South Jersey News that the Kauffmans kept an arsenal of weapons in a vault in their basement.

In four billion years, the Andromeda galaxy will come hurtling into the Milky Way - tearing planets and suns into new orbits in a fearsome and turbulent battle. But Andromeda - flying towards us at more than 250,000 miles an hour - is already a bit of a galactic warrior, having already bumped up against the Triangulum Galaxy (otherwise known as M33). Recent studies with the National . Science Foundation's Green Bank Telescope (GBT)  seem to confirm a disputed 2004 discovery of hydrogen gas streaming . between Andromeda and the . Triangulum. Fast: Andromeda (pictured) is plowing toward Earth's galaxy at roughly 250,000 miles per hour, which is the equivalent of traveling from Earth to the moon in 60 minutes . Bruised victim: The Triangulum galaxy (pictured), which is 2.3 million light years away, had a near miss with Andromeda . Jay Lockman, of . the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, said: 'The properties of this gas indicate that these two galaxies may . have passed close together in the distant past. 'Studying what may be a . gaseous link between the two can give us a new key to understanding the . evolution of both galaxies.' The two galaxies, about 2.6 and 3 million light-years, respectively, . from Earth, are members of the Local Group of galaxies that includes . our own Milky Way and about 30 others. The hydrogen 'bridge' between the galaxies was discovered in 2004 by . astronomers using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope in the . Netherlands, but other scientists questioned the discovery on technical . grounds. Detailed studies with the highly-sensitive GBT confirmed the . existence of the bridge, and showed six dense clumps of gas in the . stream. Observations of these clumps showed that they share roughly the same . relative velocity with respect to Earth as the two galaxies, . strengthening the argument that they are part of a bridge between the . two. Starting off as a tiny speck in the distance, the galaxy known as Andromeda (left of the picture) looks harmless at first . Previously just a small dot, earthlings of the future would be forgiven for panicking as Andromeda moves closer to our galaxy . The formerly tiny galaxy now dominates the foreground of the computer generated image as it swallows up the Milky Way . When galaxies pass close to each other, one result is 'tidal tails' of gas pulled into intergalactic space from the galaxies as lengthy . streams. 'We think it's very likely that the hydrogen gas we see between . M31 and M33 is the remnant of a tidal tail that originated during a . close encounter, probably billions of years ago,' said Spencer Wolfe, of . West Virginia University. He added: 'The encounter had to be long ago, because . neither galaxy shows evidence of disruption today.' Lockman said: 'The gas we studied is very tenuous and its radio emission is . extremely faint - so faint that it is beyond the reach of most radio . telescopes. 'We plan to use the advanced capabilities of . the GBT to continue this work and learn more about both the gas and, . hopefully, the orbital histories of the two galaxies.' The Aftermath: Following the collision of the two galaxies, a countless number of stars will be sent spinning into space as Andromeda and the Milky Way lose their previous forms . Colossal: This NASA illustration shows the Milky Way (left) and the Andromeda galaxy, which are expected to collide in four billion years from now . On . to our own deadly encounter with Andromeda: The head-on encounter is . expected to happen four billion years from now - catapulting our sun to . another area of the galaxy, with stars tossed on to different orbits, . astronomers at the Space Telescope Science Institute revealed last . month. Although Earth and its solar system won't be destroyed, it will be pushed away from the galactic core more than it is now. 'After . nearly a century of speculation about the future destiny of Andromeda . and our Milky Way, we at last have a clear picture of how events will . unfold over the coming billions of years,' said Sangmo Tony Sohn, . Baltimore, Maryland-based institute. After . the Andromeda galaxy finally strikes the Milky Way, it will be another . two billion years before the two totally come together and form a single . elliptical galaxy. Impact: Earth won't be destroyed when Andromeda smashes into the Milky Way (pictured), but stars will likely be tossed into different orbits and it will take an additional two billion years for the two galaxies to totally merge .","Andromeda has already bumped past the 'Triangulum Galaxy'

The Buddhist monk was served several dishes but refused to judge any of them, saying it was against his principles. However he revealed that he was a big fan of cheese, he liked bread, tofu, mushrooms and desserts, and . 'especially' coriander. Spice of life: The Dalai Lama tastes one of the offerings on the Australian version of Masterchef. He enjoyed a Sri Lankan curry with roti bread . In a special episode of the programme, the 76-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader was presented with several sweet and savoury vegetarian dishes from the contestants as he took time out from his official duties on a visit to the country. He enjoyed roti bread with a Sri Lankan curry but gnocchi was his least favourite. His most critical comment about the gnocchi was that the contestant 'tried their best'. Non-judgmental: But he revealed his favourite foods included cheese, bread and especially coriander . Blessing: The Dalai Lama said that as a Buddhist 'whatever I get I accept' Speaking about fine dining, the Dalai Lama told the contestants: 'My knowledge of these things is very limited; whatever I get I accept. 'As a Buddhist monk it is not right to prefer this food or that food.' He said of the dishes he was offered: 'They all had a special taste and beauty.' The Dalai Lama was today on the final stage of a visit to the U.S. and spoke to crowds in Chicago about the importance of overcoming religious intolerance. Earlier, he defended a meeting with President Barack Obama, saying he was gratified 'to show an old friend's face'. Handshake for the contestants: The Dalai Lama stressed that all the dishes had a 'special taste and beauty' The Chinese government criticised the President for the meeting on Saturday, saying it would damage Chinese-American relations. China considers the Dalai Lama a . separatist, intent on ending Chinese rule over Tibet. The Dalai Lama . fled Tibet in 1959 after the . Chinese invasion and has led a government in . exile in India since then. However President Obama emphasised in . his meeting with the Dalai Lama that the United States does not . support Tibetan independence. In an interview on NBC's Today show, the Dalai Lama said he . considered it his duty to meet the President 'to show my respect. We really have a feeling of reunion'.

In the interview, the Dalai Lama said he believes 'a lot of resentment' is building within China toward the government. And he said he doesn't think China can buck the trend toward democracy around the world, saying the 'whole world is turning in one direction'. 'China cannot go against that trend,' he said, adding he believes the 'voice of openness' is sweeping over China.

But while most of us can shrug them off with little thought, Lucy Pratt fears the worst. The 25-year-old is battling a rare and progressive condition that is turning her into a human statue. 'I try not to think about the future': Lucy Pratt is battling a rare and progressive condition which is turning her muscle into bone, slowly transforming her into a human statue . It causes her muscles to turn to bone and even the slightest knock can accelerate this extra growth and freeze her into place. Her neck is already locked into position and she can't move her head. She has restricted movement in her jaw and is unable to raise her arms above her head. Large, painful ribbons of bone have also formed across her back. Now, she faces a race against time to find a cure before she becomes locked in her own skeleton. Lucy, who is originally from Stourbridge, West Midlands, but now lives in London, said: 'It's a progressive condition so it's only going to get worse. 'I try not to think about the future. There's no point in thinking like that. My biggest fear though is it going into my legs. I don't want to be in a wheelchair. I really like having my independence.' Came on suddenly: Lucy aged three. Most sufferers with her condition are diagnosed when toddlers, but she did not show any symptoms until her teens . The condition, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), makes even the simplest of everyday tasks difficult. Lucy is unable to drive, struggles to get dressed and even brush her hair. It is so rare, only about 45 people in the UK have been diagnosed with it. Sufferers are usually diagnosed as toddlers, but amazingly, Lucy didn't show any symptoms until she was 15. She said: 'I had been absolutely fine but one day I fell over. A huge lump appeared on my back. It was right across my shoulder blade. 'The swelling was the size of my palm and very red. It was hot and extremely painful. I couldn't lie on it or put any pressure on it.' Extremely rare: Lucy aged 14, a year before she first noticed symptoms when she fell over one day and a huge lump appeared on her back . When it didn't go down after a few days, her worried mum took her to the hospital. Doctors feared she had cancer and took a biopsy but it came back clear. They put her on a course of steroids to help reduce the swelling and she was kept in hospital. However, lumps developed at the back of Lucy's neck and the other side of her back. She was then diagnosed with necrotising proliferative myositis, a rare disease where muscle fibers and skin become inflamed and damaged. Medics were just about to give her treatment when a consultant stopped them. Lucy said: 'He asked me to take off my socks. I thought it was a really strange question. 'He looked at my toes and said I had fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.' The consultant noticed Lucy's big toe was shorter than her second toe, which is a classic sign of FOP. X-rays and further tests confirmed the diagnosis. Lucy said: 'It's so rare, hardly any of the doctors had heard of it. I was just lucky he had come across it before. 'He told me the one thing I should never do is look it up on the internet but when someone tells you not to do something, you do it. 'I was terrified when I read what might happen to me, but then I thought I had to get on with it. 'I could feel the lumps growing. We didn't know what to do. I would nearly pass out because the pain was so bad.' Her parents Nick and Sheryll sought out a specialist who warned them Lucy should avoid most things children her age enjoy, like sports. But brave Lucy was determined her condition was not going to hold her back and she sat her GCSEs in hospital, achieving six A*s and two As. She went on to complete her A Levels before securing a place at Oxford University to study Physiological Sciences. 'Incredibly determined': Lucy with her mother, Sheryll Hadley, who is the chairman of the charity FOP Action UK. She says she is proud of her daughter's positive attitude to the condition . Despite facing a daily struggle, Lucy has a full-time job with a bio-medical science publishing company. She said: 'There are a lot of things I can't do but I don't like to see it like that. 'I'd like children in the future but doctors have said there's a 50/50 chance the child will have FOP. I hope by the time I have children there might a be a cure.' Lucy's mum, Sheryll Hadley, 54, who is the chairman of the charity FOP Action UK, says she is proud of her daughter's positive attitude. 'She looks at what she can do and what she's achieved. She is just incredibly determined. She's always been that way.' Six years ago, researchers discovered the gene that causes FOP and the compound that halts bone growth. At present, there is no Government funding available so FOP Action UK needs to raise £120,000 by the end of the year to allow this research to continue. Professor Paul Wordsworth, an expert in FOP from Oxford University, said: 'FOP is one of the most debilitating conditions I have to deal with. 'Essentially, sufferers become covered in an external shell of bone. They can become like statues. 'Isolating the gene was a fantastic breakthrough and we are now at the stage where we are looking to hold clinical trials. 'If we can find something that works and switches the bone formation off then it is possible that we have a drug that could stop the disease spreading any further for Lucy and other patients.'

A tasteless tweet rejoicing at the news of a fatal plane which cost the lives of up to 45 people has cost a Russian flight attendant her job. Officials for Russia’s biggest airline Aeroflot wasted no time in firing Ekaterina Solovyeva after she cruelly tweeted ‘hahaha’ after a Sukhoi Superjet 100 went down south of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on Wednesday. The stewardess wrote on her Twitter page: ‘Huh? Did a Superjet crash? Hahaha! This aircraft sucks, it's a pity it wasn't in Aeroflot, that would be one less.’ Crash scene: Flight attendant Ekaterina Solovyeva tweeted 'hahaha' on Twitter after a Russian-made plane crashed in Indonesia on Wednesday. Pictured some of the wreckage of the Sukhoi Superjet-100 . Ms Slovyeva swiftly removed the insensitive jibe, but not before other users had taken a screenshot and complained to the airline. About 45 people, reportedly including one American, were aboard the Sukhoi Superjet 100 when it vanished from radar screens during what was meant to be a brief demonstration flight. So far 12 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage, but officials believe that everyone on board died. The passengers were mostly Indonesian aviation representatives, but there were also eight Russians -- four of them crewmembers and four Sukhoi employees -- as well as an American and a French citizen, officials said. Salvage crews have located the flight recorder, which may offer clues to the cause of the crash, after the same 90-seat Russian-built jet had performed flawlessly on earlier flights piloted by an expert crew. Carnage: About 45 people, reportedly including one American, were aboard the jet when it vanished from radar screens south of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on the edge of Mount Salak . Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly believes there’s a 'good chance' the crash wasn’t related to the design of the plane. It is believed to be the worst demonstration accident in decades and the outcome of the investigation into its cause will be hugely significant for Russia’s attempt to make an impact on the global aviation scene. The SuperJet was designed in conjunction with Western partners and equipped with cutting-edge systems, as Russia seeks to win a slice of the regional jet market. Upset: Distraught relatives of passengers aboard the plane are inconsolable after hearing news that Indonesian Rescuers had spotted the air crash debris . The plane was on a promotional tour of Asian nations and had already carried potential buyers and reporters on flights in Myanmar, Pakistan and Kazakhstan. It was scheduled to move on to Laos and Vietnam. Russia has spent about $1.4 billion developing the twin-engine aircraft with an Italian partner, Rome-based Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)’s Alenia Aeronautica SpA. It has a range of 4,600 kilometres (2,800 miles) and costs $35 million, according to the manufacturer. Flawed design or technical malfunction would be potentially be a big blow for a plane brought into commercial service a year ago.","'It's a pity it wasn't aeroflot' plane wrote attendant .

Could face jail: Liam Stacey, 21, admitted making racially offensive remarks about Fabrice Muamba on Twitter after the Bolton Wanderers footballer collapsed on the pitch during an FA Cup match . This is the university student facing jail for writing shocking racist internet messages after footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed with heart failure. Liam Stacey admitted posting the comments on Twitter, which were forwarded to police by disgusted fellow users. The 21-year-old undergraduate could be thrown off his biology degree course after his fellow students launched a campaign to have him kicked out. Today Swansea University bosses confirmed they were investigating whether he should be disciplined. After pleading guilty to inciting racial hatred yesterday Stacey was released on bail on condition he stays off Twitter and other social networking sites. And he was warned by magistrates that all options would be considered when he is sentenced next week. His messages – which started with ‘LOL [laugh out loud]. **** Muamba. He’s dead!!!’ – provoked widespread revulsion and a furious reaction from several Premier League stars. Bolton player Muamba has been in intensive care since collapsing during Saturday’s FA Cup tie between his side and Tottenham. As the 23-year-old’s family monitor his condition, a wave of insensitive tweets have caused outrage. Yesterday Stacey appeared close to tears in court as the details of his comments were relayed to magistrates. Prosecutor Lisa Jones told a court: ‘Fabrice Muamba collapsed on the pitch and was believed to have died. Shortly after, Stacey posted on Twitter: “LOL [laugh out loud], **** Muamba. He’s dead.” ‘A number of persons on the site took issue with the posting and he responded to them furthering his message.’ She went on to describe Stacey’s racist comments directed at other Twitter users – some of who were black men – and which are too offensive to print. Former England footballer Stan Collymore, who was one of many who passed on Stacey’s messages to police, yesterday told his Twitter followers that officers were investigating other offensive material posted online. One user, registered as Chet Walken, from Houston, Texas, wrote a series of racist messages which provoked several footballers to call for his profile to be removed. QPR defender Anton Ferdinand and Sunderland defender Titus Bramble both appealed for their followers to petition Twitter to ban him from the site. Upsetting: Fabrice Muamba is treated by medical staff on Saturday after collapsing. A court heard that Liam Stacey, 21, posted mocking tweets as the midfielder was treated on the pitch . Shock: . Bolton manager Owen Coyle (left) walks alongside the stretcher as . medical staff take Fabrice Muamba off the pitch before he was transferred to hospital . Walken then responded bizarrely: ‘Why . am I getting all this hate mail? Makes me wish the USA would have just . let Hitler have his way with you ungrateful heathens.’ Former Liverpool striker Ryan Babel . accused Twitter itself of being racist if it didn’t suspend Walken’s . account within seven days. Another user, going by the name of . SuperAlex707, left a message saying ‘lets [sic] all lol at muamba [...] . hahahahahahah’. His profile had yesterday apparently been withdrawn from . the site. Stacey told police he had written his . own vile messages after drinking while celebrating the Welsh rugby . team’s Grand Slam victory on Saturday. He was arrested in the early . hours of the following morning at his home in Swansea. Magistrates heard how the student attempted to ‘distance himself’ from the comments by saying his account had been hacked into. And he sent a text message to a friend . saying: ‘I said something about Muamba that I shouldn’t have and . tweeted back to some people who abused me. ‘Getting police on me now which isn’t good at all.’ He later tried to delete his Twitter page. Swansea University said it . strongly disassociated itself from any racist tweets and had begun its . own formal disciplinary process into the matter. A spokesman said: 'We are an equal opportunities university and strongly disassociate ourselves from any racist tweets. 'We will of course co-operate fully with the police investigation. We have also begun our own formal disciplinary process.' A petition calling for him to be chucked out of the University now has more than 200 signatures. Twitter user Elliot Pawley said: 'Hopefully Liam Stacey will get kicked out of Swansea uni, people need to realise that what they can’t say/do anything on the internet!' The student union also distanced themselves from Stacey and his racist remarks. Student President Luke James said: 'We have a strong record of campaigning against racism.

An internet troll sent a vile and threatening message to Tory MP Louise Mensch, ordering her to choose which of her children should die. Frank Zimmerman, 60, used his computer to attack the mother of three, verbally abusing her and threatening her. In an email, he told Mrs Mensch that her computer and telephones had been hacked and that images of her family would be posted on the internet. Louise Mensch MP said the threats made her feel 'powerless and scared' He then told the 40-year-old Corby MP: 'You now have a Sophie's choice. Which kid is to go? Who will you choose?' The question is a reference to the harrowing film Sophie's Choice in which a mother, played by Meryl Streep, is forced to choose which one of her two children will be sent to a gas chamber during the Second World War. The full text of the email contained numerous expletives and foul-mouthed insults, ordering Mrs Mensch to stop using Twitter, where the MP has almost 50,000 followers. Too offensive to print in full, an extract of Zimmerman's message read: 'YOU have been HACKED. 'We are inside your computer all your phones, everywhere and inside your homes! So get off twitter.' Zimmerman claimed to be part of hacking group Anonymous, which has gained notoriety for defacing high-profile websites to spread political messages .

The firm of administrators brought in to run the businesses after it was unable to repay loans totalling £35million announced the decision this  afternoon. As well as 200 Clinton Cards outlets, 150 stores from the sister chain ‘Birthdays’ will also close. Closures: 200 Clinton Cards stores and 150 Birthdays stores will close . The stores are across the UK and employ some 2,800 people who will soon be looking for work. The closure programme, which will leave the group with 438 outlets, will begin next week and continue through into June. The company has made losses of £130 million since 2004. Its takings are insufficient to cover the cost of staff, rent and rates. Joint Administrator and Partner at Zolfo Cooper, Peter Saville, said the closures are necessary under a plan to try and sell a slimmed down version of the greetings card business as a going concern. Gloomy predictions: The company announced in March that it had slumped to a first half loss and warned that its prospects for the second half were worse than originally anticipated . Clintons's announcement follows a turbulent period for Britain's high street. Last month Mothercare axed 100 job when it closed 100 stores. Another of the U.K's iconic stores Woolworth's, folded in 2008 under huge debt. It was the first in a wave of closures that rocked the country's high streets. News of Woolworth's demise came on the same day as furniture chain MFI said it would be closing its doors. Store closures have become familiar news for the retail sector while a number of shops have announced plans to slim back their operations. Chocolate retailer Thorntons recently announced it is to close 180 of 579 stores over the next three years. The alcohol market has also been hit with off-licence group First Quench, which owns Threshers and Wine Rack, announcing it will close more than 750 stores in 2009 with the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs. Plus-sized womenswear chain Peacocks collapsed into administration in January, which will lead to 1,400 jobs across its stores. He said: ‘Given the sheer size of the Clinton Cards retail estate and the overall performance, we were left with no alternative to today’s difficult decision. ‘I am hopeful that the action we have taken will allow us to preserve value in the core underlying business, thereby allowing us and potential buyers to focus on a profitable and viable retail estate going forward.’ Clinton has suffered dire trading in recent months as it comes up against stiff competition from supermarkets and online retailers such as Funky Pigeon and Moonpig. It recorded a pre-tax loss of £3.7 million in the 26 weeks to January 29, compared with a profit of £11.7 million in the previous year, and warned that the second half of the year would be below expectations. Its shares had lost more than 80 per cent of their value since the start of 2010. Last week, it revealed more poor trading for the 14 weeks since January 29, with same-store sales down 3.5 per cent. Chief executive Darcy Willson-Rymer carried out a strategic review over the past six months, which is understood to have included a fruitless search for a buyer for all of the business or its Birthdays chain. The group was the UK's largest specialist retailer of greetings cards and was founded by current chairman Don Lewin in Epping, Essex, in 1968. Its collapse is another blow to the high street after recent high-profile casualties, including video games retailer Game Group, fashion chain Peacocks and outdoor specialist Blacks Leisure.

Controversial: Green Party member Mark Haworth-Booth, has boasted about his prowess with a gun alongside images of squirrels, rabbits and birds on his blog . A Green Party member who supports the RSPB has been branded a hypocrite after he went on a killing spree which included a bird, rabbits and squirrels. Mark Haworth-Booth, who stood to be a councillor in North Devon, has been displaying the bodies of animals he shot in his garden on his personal blog. Proudly, on the same page, he also says he supports the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Birds, despite admitting shooting dead a Jackdaw. His blog entries shows on the same day in May 2011 he also shot a squirrel, and a month later killed two more. He also killed, skinned and ate several rabbits. And wildlife lovers say it’s not something they expect from a green campaigner. Former North Devon Councillor Joanne Bell condemned Mr Haworth-Booth. She said: 'Not only does Mark clearly enjoy taking his gun into his garden to shoot squirrels and birds but he actually takes pictures and posts them on his blog. 'He goes on to describe the dead animals in very poetic and flowery terms. He’s clearly proud of his prowess with the gun.' Mr Haworth-Booth a former curator at . the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1970 to 2004 and now an Honorary . Research Fellow there, has defended his position. He said: 'In deference to the sensitivities of some lovers of wildlife, I have removed my blog from the Internet,' he said. Dead: Mr Haworth-Boooth put up this picture showing a rabbit he had skinned . 'I think I’m right in saying Jackdaws considered a pest and grey squirrels are widely considered a menace to forestry. 'The Exmoor Society, of which I’m a member, sees the grey squirrel as public enemy number one.' Mr Haworth-Booth didn’t think his actions were at odds with his image as an environmentalist. 'I think anyone who’s seriously interested in the countryside would share my view of the grey squirrel,' he said. Questionable: A rabbit is left hanging by the legs in his garage after it was shot and killed . However, Mr Haworth-Booth did confess to feeling ashamed after shooting a jackdaw. He said: 'I looked at it and it was a beautiful creature, but I had checked with the RSPB to see if it’s classified as a pest.' Mr Haworth-Booth also dismissed Mrs Bell’s claims that he was proud of his marksmanship. 'That’s complete nonsense,' he said. 'If you’re going to kill a rabbit you want to be as good a shot as you can be. 'You don’t want the rabbit to crawl away wounded and in pain.' He went on: 'As regards rabbits, I shot a small number for the table and one because it was dying a horrible death from myxomatosis. Although our household is mostly vegetarian, we do eat meat occasionally. 'A number of people feel that if you are prepared to eat meat you should be prepared to face up to the consequences. 'Thus I skinned and butchered the rabbits myself.  After shooting and eating six or eight rabbits over a two year period, myxomatosis returned and decimated the rabbit population. Now their numbers are building up again I’m glad to say, because I like seeing them in the garden. I have not shot any since the disease returned.' Victims: A squirrel and a jackdaw lay dead on the grass in another photo from the blog . The Green Party has today distanced itself from the case saying it 'does not support or condone the actions taken by Mark. 'There are non-lethal ways of removing so called pests and Mark fully intends to use these measures in future.  We understand that the rabbits were for the table bar one which was put out of its misery from myxomatosis,' a spokesman said. Diana Lewis, founder of the North Devon Animal Ambulance, said as far as her organisation was concerned all creatures should be entitled to freedom and treated with compassion. She said: 'Unfortunately if he’s doing it with the correct calibre rifle and no suffering is caused then he’s not doing anything illegal but personally I find it very sad.' An RSPCA spokesman added: 'Wherever possible the RSPCA would always prefer alternative solutions and only if there is a serious problem and alternative means are ineffective or impractical should killing be contemplated. 'In this case control should be carried out legally, precisely targeted and carried out by the most humane method available in the circumstances.'","Mark Haworth-Booth, who stood to be a councillor in North Devon, put graphic kill-pictures on his blog .

Vicky Pryce yesterday publicly accused her ex-husband Chris Huhne of effectively forcing her to take his speeding points because she was his wife. Pryce, 59, will use a rarely employed piece of legislation to claim she was the victim of 'marital coercion' when the former Cabinet minister was allegedly caught by a motorway speed camera. The pair are at war over a driving penalty which Liberal Democrat  Huhne, 57, allegedly dodged after he was caught speeding in 2003. Serious business: Chris Huhne and Vicky Pryce arrived at Southwark Crown Court to face charges that he persuaded her when they were married to lie about a speeding offence . Yesterday they appeared at Southwark . Crown Court in London for a preliminary hearing. They are jointly . charged with perverting the course of justice by covering up the . offence. Pryce's defence will allege that Huhne 'coerced' her into taking the penalty points. Her lawyers will use an antiquated . piece of legislation dating back to 1925 in which a wife can argue that . she acted under duress due to the influence of her spouse. The Criminal Justice Act of 1925 . states: 'On a charge against a wife for any offence other than treason . or murder it shall be a good defence to prove that the offence was . committed in the presence of, and under the coercion of, the husband.' In a separate development, Huhne's . lawyer announced that he would be seeking to dismiss the charge on the . basis that there is no case for him  to answer. The former Energy and Climate Change . Secretary has hired barrister John Kelsey Fry, QC, who successfully . defended Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp against tax evasion . charges earlier this year. He hopes to be exonerated within weeks. Happier times: Chris Huhne allegedly persuaded his former partner Vicky Pryce, left, to take his penalty points for a speeding offence almost a decade ago . The disputed events date back to March . 2003, when Huhne's car was caught by a speed camera on the motorway . between Stansted airport in Essex and London. It is alleged that Huhne, who at the . time was a Member of the European Parliament, asked Pryce to take three . speeding points so he could avoid a driving ban, meaning the pair . subsequently lied to police about who was driving the car. It was only after Huhne left his wife . in June 2010 for his press agent Carina Trimingham, that newspaper . stories alleged he had forced her to take penalty points on his behalf. The explosive allegations led to the . resignation of Huhne from the Cabinet earlier this year following an . exhaustive eight-month police investigation which resulted in charges. Allegations: The events which led to the charges date back to March 2003, when Huhne's car was allegedly caught by a speed camera on the motorway between Stansted Airport in Essex and London . The indictment against them states . that between March 12 and May 21, 2003, Huhne and Pryce 'with intent to . pervert the course of public justice did an act which had a tendency to . pervert the course of justice'. Yesterday Huhne stared straight ahead . at the judge, ignoring his ex-wife, who seemed tense, leaning forward in . her seat throughout the hearing. Even though they were forced to share . the dock, such is the bitter acrimony between the man and woman who were . married for 26 years that they could barely stand to look at each . other. Huhne, who was dressed in a dark suit . and maroon tie, took his seat at the opposite end of the dock to Pryce . as their barristers outlined how they planned to fight the charges. Pryce, who was dressed in a beige . linen jacket and a brown knee-length skirt, entered a plea of not guilty . to the single charge of perverting the course of justice yesterday.

Jailed: Spartakas Grachauskas admitted trying to steal a plaque off the 1993 Warrington bombing memorial to sell for scrap metal . A thief who was caught trying to steal a metal plaque commemorating two children killed in an IRA bomb attack was jailed today. Lithuanian Spartakas Grachauskas, 25, turned up armed with a set of tools ready to steal the plaque off the River of Life memorial in Warrington but was caught in the act by CCTV. Police arrived and caught the would-be thief red handed as he attempted to prise the plaque from the ground. He was jailed for 18-weeks at Manchester City Magistrates Court for trying to steal the metal plaque that forms part of the River of Life - a memorial to the victims of the Warrington bombing in 1993. The incident happened just weeks before another attempt when thieves successfully stole an A3-size plaque from the memorial honouring Tim Parry, 12, and Johnathan Ball, 3,  that could have been sold for scrap for as little as £30. Tim's heartbroken mother Wendy . Parry said: 'Whether . he knew what it was for or not, there’s no reason to take a plaque to . make money - any kind of plaque whether it be one on a grave or a . memorial, it’s stealing. I hope people will think twice about what they . are doing. 'It might just be . a piece of metal but to us it has an impact, because somebody’s life . has been taken and people need to think about why it is there. 'It is terrible for the families, people may just walk past it but to the families it is important.' The death of the two boys touched the heart of the nation and Tim's father Colin Parry, 65, received an OBE for his peace campaigning after the atrocity. But despite its emotional significance the memorial to the young victims of the 1993 bombings has been repeatedly targeted by thieves in recent months attempting to exploit the soaring value of scrap metal. After the first memorial was stolen - sometime between April 20 and May 5 - Mr Parry condemned the thieves. He said: ‘It beggars belief that people can be so heartless and I don’t expect that they have any conscience. ‘It is remarkable the lengths that some people will go to make some cash and it is one of those crimes that is so off the scale that it is disgusting.’ The theft comes as war memorials, lead from church roofs and cables from railway lines have been targeted across the UK. Each year, at least 15,000 tons of the 13 million tons of metal sent for scrap is believed to be stolen, worth an estimated of £800million a year. Memorial: This River of Life runs down Bridge Street, Warrington, in honour of the two boys killed in the 1993 IRA bomb blast . Bombing victims: Johnathan Ball, aged three, and Tim Parry, 12, who were killed in the blast in Warrington in 1993 . The court was told how Grachauskas had hoped to steal the plaque in Warrington town centre with the aid of another man and sell it on to a scrap metal merchant. But he was caught on CCTV approaching the River of Life water feature preparing to steal the plaque and police were dispatched to the scene. Jenny Baines, prosecuting, said: 'It was clearly a very motivated offence. CCTV shows that he employed several techniques to try and remove the plaque through brute force. The CCTV sees him prise the plaque while the co-accused keeps a look out. Wendy and Colin Parry, parents of Tim Parry who was killed in I.R.A. bombing at Warrington, welcomed the sentencing of Lithuanian Spartakas Grachauskas . 'However, the lookout has not been able to give him sufficient warning, and the police officers find them to be in possession of a number of tools the significant of which links to pre-meditation. 'There was a screwdriver, an eight inch silver wrench and another 3inch screw driver. The officers noted that the plaque has been loosened by the time they had arrived.' The defendant was taken into custody where he made a full admission in interview. The co-accused was given a warning and let off. The court heard how Grachauskas had already received a 10 month custodial sentence in May for a burglary offence in December. Miss . Baines added: 'Grachauskas has a majority of offences of dishonesty . including the house burglary for which he is now serving. 'The . majority of offences have resulted in custodial sentences. The . co-accused was a man of previous good character and for that reason was . given a caution.' Manchester . magistrate chairman Paul Welsh said: 'We have had to take quite a bit . of time to think about the right way to deal with this case. Although on . paper it is a relatively straight forward theft of a piece of metal - . it is more than that to the people who are affected by it. 'Our . view is that this was a theft where there was quite a degree of . planning, so our point of view makes it more at the serious end of . thefts. 'Metal thefts are . becoming more common and because of the nature of this theft and the . impact on the community it makes it more serious. 'We accept that it is likely that you do not understand the significance of what you were trying to steal at the time but you went deliberately to steal.' Blast: The scene is cordoned off after two litter bins exploded outside a Boots store and a McDonalds . Campaigner: Colin Parry, father of Warrington bomb victim Tim Parry, with former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Dr John Reid. He is pictured at a peace centre in Warrington he set-up after his son's death . After Grachauskas’ sentencing, Mrs Parry - mother of Tim Parry - said: 'I think . he got what he deserved and I’m pleased that he has got the sentence . that he got. Maybe other people thinking about doing something like this . will think twice. 'I always . find these sorts of things quite sad because the person who is stealing . it is desperate, but the fact that he did it just to make money makes . him a greedy person' Father's anguish: Colin Parry and his son on holiday, a year before Tim was killed at the age of 12. The plaque (right) put up in memory of Tim and the other victim Johnathan Ball, 3, that was stolen by scrap metal thieves . Stolen: This is where the bronze memorial plaque which paid tribute to the two boys killed in the IRA blast was placed. Police are today hunting for the people who took it . Referring . to the plaque that was successfully stolen, she said: 'The community . has been very upset by it and we have been amazed by the amount of . people who have rang us and offered to pay or a new one. We could have . replaced it 100 times over, so we have asked people to make a donation . to the charity instead.' Police added that metal thefts are increasing across the UK and are not a 'victimless' crime. Chief Superintendent Richard Strachan, of Cheshire Police, said: 'Metal theft comes in many forms and affects everyone. 'It . is not a victimless crime - in this case the repercussions are far . reaching as the plaque, which the offender tried to steal, forms part of . a memorial to the victims of the Warrington bombing. 'This is an important memorial for the community in Warrington and is part of the town's heritage. 'Metal . theft is a national issue and we will continue to work with local . partners, the community, businesses and other police forces to target . those responsible.' The Warrington bombings consisted of two separate attacks – the first in . February 1993 at a gas storage facility and the second the following . month in the centre of the Cheshire town. In the second attack, The Samaritans received a coded message wrongly stating a bomb would be detonated in Liverpool. In the event, there were two blasts, in litter bins outside Boots and . Argos, within a minute of each other causing carnage and confusion. Johnathan Ball was killed almost instantly and Tim Parry was so badly . injured his parents later had to take the agonising decision to turn off . his life support machine. More than 50 other victims were injured, with many suffering serious shrapnel wounds and cuts and lacerations from flying glass. The stolen bronze plaque was put up in 1996 alongside a water feature in part designed by local schoolchildren.","Spartakas Grachauskas was caught red-handed trying to steal a metal plaque off the 1993 Warrington bombing memorial .

Emergency treatment: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has drafted in a crisis team to deal with problems at South London NHS Trust . A hospital trust that has run up debts of £1million a week today becomes the first to be put into special measures. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley will send in a crisis team of doctors, administrators and accountants to take control of South London Healthcare NHS Trust. It has gone £150million into the red over the past three years, largely because of crippling Private Finance Initiative deals agreed by the last Labour government. Its three hospitals will cost £2.5billion under the long-term construction and management scheme. The financial chaos has already hit patient care at the hospitals – Queen Mary’s in Sidcup, Queen Elizabeth in Woolwich and the Princess Royal University Hospital in Bromley. While services have improved in recent months, patients still face some of the longest waits for operations in the country. One in six patients waited longer than the 18-week Government target – the worst figure for any NHS trust in London. It also performs poorly on casualty unit waiting times, ranking 20th out of 23 trusts in the capital. Some departments and wards face closure. The Trust took on a large debt when it was formed - mainly from the PFI that had been used for building at the Princess Royal and Queen Elizabeth hospitals. Mr Lansley has activated an ‘unsustainable providers regime’, putting the trust under the control of a special administrator with powers to demand rapid changes. The Health Secretary stepped in after draft financial plans showed the trust would have a deficit of £30-£75million a year for the next five years. Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup: The trust has gone £150million into the red over the past three years, largely because of crippling Private Finance Initiative deals agreed by the last Labour government . In his letter to the trust, he wrote: ‘South London Healthcare NHS Trust faces deep and longstanding challenges, some of which are not of its own making. 'Nonetheless, there must be a point when these problems, however they have arisen, are tackled . 'I appreciate that any decision to use these powers will be unsettling for staff, but I want to stress that the powers are being considered now so that patients in South East London have hospital services that have a sustainable future.  This will benefit patients and bring more certainty to staff, the public and other local stakeholders. 'I am determined to improve healthcare services for patients in South East London and will take whatever difficult steps are necessary to achieve this.' A Department of Health source said Mr Lansley was not prepared to run the risk of a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire scandal in which poor quality care and mismanagement led to the needless deaths of hundreds of patients. Stephen Powell, chairman of the Health Select Committee, told Radio 4's Today programme that there was clearly a need for change in the face of such enormous losses. Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich: South London Healthcare NHS Trust's three hospitals will cost £2.5billion under the long-term construction and management scheme . He said there was an 'over-dependence on hospitals' and that one focus of the restructuring may be improving 'care in the community'. The move means that, unlike loss-making companies in the private sector, the Trust will not have to pay back the money it has lost. Mr Powell added: 'Politicians are responsible but the Secretary of State can't make all the decisions. There is a need for change.' An administrator could now be brought in and the Trust could go bust, leading to it being dissolved and some services closed. The Department of Health said in a statement: 'The hospitals in this Trust have faced multiple problems for many years, which the previous Labour Government made worse by a merger, and the approval of two huge PFI deals that have further destabilised the Trust. The trust lost over £1 million a week last year, enough to pay for 1000 cataract operations per week, 200 hip replacements per week, or pay the salaries of 1200 nurses. 'The unsustainable providers regime was created by Labour’s Andy Burnham when he was Health Secretary. However, Labour never made use of them, preferring instead to sweep the  problems facing some parts of the NHS under the carpet. Princess Royal University Hospital, Bromley: One in six patients waited longer than the 18-week Government target - the worst figure for any NHS trust in London . 'South London Healthcare NHS Trust is an exceptional case, showing most of the problems which are characteristic of “challenged” NHS Trusts. There are about two dozen sucg Trusts where the Government inherited serious longstanding problems. 'Andrew Lansley’s decision will send a strong signal to unsustainable NHS organisations that they cannot continue to provide poor services or rely on bailouts from other parts of the NHS. 'All the hospitals deemed to be unsustainable have signed agreements with the Department of Health to turn their performance around, and it is possible that the Government will consider putting some of them or others who cannot deliver sustainable services into special measures if their leadership does not make progress fast enough. 'South London Healthcare NHS Trust has . previously owned up to multiple challenges including not being efficient . enough, delivering low quality services, having poor contracting . arrangements and having a weak board. Like the many other hospitals yet . to become part of the elite NHS Foundation Trusts, the Trust faces . problems which – according to the National Audit Office - ""have lain . unresolved for a number of years"".' Chris Ham, chief executive of health . think tank the Kings Fund, warned on Radio 4's Today programme . that not only other . NHS Trusts, but potentially even Foundation Trusts at the very top, could go . through the same thing. He . said it was important to face up to the problems, and that administrators would be able to restructure.","South London Healthcare NHS trust has gone £150million in the red over the past three years .

Police are 37 times more likely to stop and search a black person than a white person, latest research has shown. Human rights group, The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), investigated what are known as section 60 stops, where officers detain people without suspecting them of being involved in any particular crime. The researchers discovered that while overall use of the power had fallen, excessive use against ethnic minorities had continued or in some instances increased. Racial profiling: Black people are 37 times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people (file picture) Three quarters of all Section 60 stops were carried out by the Metropolitan police, a total of 258,000 between 2008 and 2011. The next highest was Merseyside Police where officers conducted 40,940 Section 60s in the same time period. Some forces barely used the power at all. (File picture) Between 2008 and 2009 Metropolitan Police officers stopped 68 of every 1,000 black people in their area . According to the EHRC, between 2008 and 2009, Met officers stopped 68 of every 1,000 black people in their area. Although this fell by more than half between 2010 and 2011 to 32.8 per 1,000, in the rest of England the figure was just 1.2 per 1,000. However the highest rates of racial disproportionality were outside London with an officer in the West Midlands 28 times more likely to search a black person than a white person. Overall black people were found to be 37 times more likely to be stopped under Section 60 that white people. Asian people were 10 times more likely to be stopped. The effectiveness of the searches has also been called in to question as it was revealed that between 2008 and 2009 only 2.8 per cent of Section 60 searches resulted in an arrest falling to just 2.4 per cent between 2010 and 2011. In most cases police officers are required to have what is referred to as 'reasonable suspicion' that someone is involved in a crime before conducting a search. However the Section 60 power, which is part of the 1994 Public Order Act introduced as a response to the rise in illegal raves, gives an officer the power to stop and search a person simply because they might fear violence or disorder. Response: A spokesman for the Met defended its use of Section 60 searches saying: 'These powers are critical in our efforts to tackle knife, gun and gang crimes' A spokesman for EHRC told the Guardian newspaper: 'Black youths are still being disproportionally targetted and without a clear explanation as to why, many in the community will see this as racial profiling. 'Moreover, police data itself questions the effectiveness of this practise. Some forces are using 200 or 300 stops before arresting an individual over a weapon.' A spokesman for the Met defended its use of Section 60 searches saying: 'These powers are critical in our efforts to tackle knife, gun and gang crimes.'","Between 2008 and 2009 Met officers stopped 68 of every 1,000 black people in their area .

An astonishing public response has helped ensure more than 100 veterans and widows will be able to attend the royal unveiling of a national Bomber Command memorial after all. Men who risked their lives flying in bombers during World War Two were disgusted to discover they had missed out on an invitation to the long-awaited ceremony because all tickets were taken. But after the Daily Mail highlighted the case of 91-year-old Freddie Johnson, who was missing out despite flying 92 missions during five years of service, the response was overwhelming. Freddie Johnson, 91, a rear bomb gunner in the second World War has now been given a ticket to the unveiling of the £6.5 million bomber command memorial in London . Mr Johnson and his wife Jean pictured today, left, and in London during WW2, right, when they married . Relatives and other members of the public deservedly due to attend next Thursday’s unveiling in Green Park, London, returned their tickets so that the veterans who saw action could be there. Others cancelled because they were physically unable to travel and had been made aware of the demand for seats. The small group of organisers running the event – without any government help – made every effort to find a place for veterans who put their names on a waiting list. Jim Dooley, head of fundraising for the RAF Bomber Command Memorial Fund, said there was ‘enough returns now to accommodate veterans and, more importantly, widows of those killed’.

Organisers have stressed that no more tickets will be available to late applicants not previously on the waiting list. Despite the success in finding places for dozens of veterans, many more who would have liked to have received an invitation will still miss out. Many families knew nothing about the need to apply for tickets until publicity highlighted the issue, or had been unable to make contact with organisers and gave up trying. Eight senior members of the royal family – including the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall – are due to attend the unveiling, along with around 6,500 ticket holders. They will be there to remember the 55,573 airmen who lost their lives but were never given the formal recognition their efforts deserved.

A railway worker has found a way to ensure commuters leave for work on a high note each morning - by serenading them on the platform with songs made famous by his lookalike, the late opera singer Luciano Pavarotti. Colin Miller, 61, can often be heard singing impromptu choruses of Nessun Dorma while passengers wait for their train to arrive. The Virgin Trains station guard admits he cannot hold a tune like the famous singer, who performed to sell-out audiences across the globe. Scroll down for video . In full voice: Colin Miller can often be heard singing in the style of his lookalike, Luciano Pavarotti, while passengers wait for their train . But he boasts an impressive beard in the style of Pavarotti's, and passengers queue up to have their picture taken with him. Some even hop off their train to be photographed with him before jumping back on before it leaves. The former greengrocer started impersonating Pavarotti after the 1990 football World Cup, when the opera star's recording of Nessun Dorma was used as the theme song for the BBC's coverage of the tournament. He travelled the world for a decade as a lookalike, earning up to £300 a time for appearances in locations as far afield as Sydney, Tokyo and Bangkok. Dead ringer: Colin Miller, left, looks just like the late singer, right, and passengers queue to have their pictures taken with him . But the work dried up after the singer died in 2007, and Mr Miller was forced to get a new job at Lichfield Trent Valley station in Staffordshire. Mr Miller, who is known as 'Pav' by colleagues and commuters, said: 'It’s a talking point for sure. 'They know I’m great with people and I’m not frightened to be in the public eye. 'I’ve had trains come in slowing down and I’ve had people get off to take my picture before jumping back on the train. 'We have impromptu little songs. I ask them if they know Nessun Dorma, they hum it and I sing it. 'I can’t sing like Pavarotti - but I give it a good go. All the punters love it.

'They know the railways don’t always run on time but people know I will be out there to keep them smiling.' Commuter Polly Thompson, 26, who catches a train from the station to work each day, said: 'I see Colin most days and he really makes my morning. 'He just bursts into song and everybody gives him a little clap. 'It’s a good way to start your day - especially on a Monday morning when you don’t really want to go to work.'

Debbie Marchese and Chloe Paul had gastric bypass surgery when they each weighed 28 stone. The pair knew they had to do something about their weight when carrying out simple tasks became an effort and Chloe, then a size 28, snapped two chairs under her weight. Half her size: Debbie is a now a size 14, having shed 14 stone... ... meanwhile daughter Debbie is a size 16 and weighs 18 stone. Both had weighed 28 stone . Since having the op which shrinks the size of the stomach, Debbie is a now a size 14, having shed 14 stone, while daughter Chloe is a size 16 and weighs 18st, after losing 10 stone. Married mother-of-two Debbie, 53, said: 'We joke that we got two-for-one, mother-daughter gastric bypasses.' Before they changed their lifestyles, . Debbie and Chloe, 25, used to eat more than 4,000 calories a day in sugar and . carb-heavy food. For breakfast Debbie would munch on buttery . toast, while Chloe would go without eating. Lunch would be four cheese . sandwiches with crisps for Debbie, while Chloe would eat cheese . sandwiches with a Pot Noodle. Junk food binges: The pair would often gorge on unhealthy snacks . Operation successful: The pair have never felt better since having gastric bypasses . For . dinner, Debbie used to eat a large portion of spaghetti Bolognese and . Chloe would eat an extra-large portion of curry with rice, bread and . butter and six chapatis. Both . women snacked throughout the day on biscuits, cheese and Chloe could . scoff six Mars ice-cream bars, eight bags of crisps and four cans of . Coca-Cola in one day. In 2010, they decided enough was enough fearing they could die young because of their unhealthy eating. They sought help and Debbie was told she would be able to have a gastric bypass operation on the NHS because she was diabetic. Food swap: On the left, some of the foods they would eat daily including chocolate, cakes and crisps, and right,  some of the healthy foods they eat now . Meanwhile, Chloe had to pay for the op herself using £10,000 she borrowed through a loan. Although their operations were nine months apart and took place at different hospitals in Kent, the pair had the same surgeon - Dr Shamsi El-Hasani. Since having the ops, Debbie and Chloe have swapped cheese and biscuits for fresh fruit and yoghurt, and enjoy smaller portions of healthy meals. As a result, Debbie has lost half her body weight, shrinking to a size 14. A month after her bypass surgery, Chloe, already a mum, found she was expecting twins with husband Amit. Since giving birth, she is now a size 16. As they were: Chloe, left, would struggle doing daily activities with her children, while Debbie would also feel the strain when on grandmother duty . Transformed: Now the pair, pictured with Chloe's husband Amit along with their children, have much more energy . She said: 'I think having the twins stopped me losing as much as I wanted to but I have completely changed my lifestyle for the better. I can play and walk with the kids more than ever.' Chloe said she is delighted with her and her mother's weightloss and they have no regrets about the surgery. 'We're the dream team! We both feel like our lives have improved so much. Now when we walk into a clothes shop we can try on whatever we want - it's an incredible feeling.' She added: 'Before, we'd sit in the car park . after a going to the supermarket and eat an entire salami each, plus . polish off a whole block of cheese. Now, we eat much less and much better. I'm so proud of my mum, I think she looks amazing. We both look a lot better.' She also thinks going through the weightloss journey has made them closer.

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 06:14 EST, 8 October 2011 . An author of legal thrillers and a fantasy trilogy was accused Thursday of bilking women out of millions of dollars after meeting them through an online Jewish dating service. Mitchell Gross, whose books include the suspense story 'Circle of Lies,' duped at least two women into investing about $4.4million in a sham company he set up, using some of the money to buy expensive artwork, a luxury car and a golf club membership, federal prosecutors said. The wire fraud and money laundering charges he faces could carry a prison sentence of decades behind bars, according to authorities. Thriller writer Mitchell Gross, here in a publicity photo and his mugshot, allegedly convinced girlfriends he met online to invest millions in a sham company that led directly to his bank account and callously stopped calling them  once he had their money . Gross, a 61-year-old author who writes under the pen names Mitchell Graham and Douglas Alan, pleaded not guilty. He has turned out at least a half dozen books, but told a judge he only had limited funds. At a brief court appearance Thursday, Gross said he couldn't afford an attorney because he only had $2,000 in cash and no money in any other accounts. His court-appointed attorney Judy Fleming declined to comment on the case. Authorities said Gross began a romantic relationship with a woman identified in court documents as 'R.J.' Gross also falsely claimed to the girlfriends that Steven Spielberg had optioned his books to make films . They met on a site around June 2006 and told her he made a lot of money by investing with a broker named 'Michael Johnson' who was employed by 'The Merrill Company,' the records show. 'R.J.' called the broker to talk over the investments, but it was actually Gross speaking in a disguised voice on the other line, prosecutors said. 'R.J.' wired close to $3million to an account she believed belong to the company but actually did not exist, prosecutors said. Gross concealed the scheme by sending her phony tax forms and account statements, they added. Then investigators said they discovered he was using the woman's funds to repay an ex-girlfriend, identified as 'J.S.' She was duped into investing $1.4million with the phony firm, prosecutors said. Federal prosecutors didn't identify the names of the victims in the indictment, but some details of the allegations have emerged in civil court documents. Robbie Johnson of Florida filed a lawsuit against Gross in March 2008 claiming she met him on a Jewish Internet dating site. Soon, she said, he was falsely telling her that famed director Steven Spielberg had optioned his books for films that would feature Pierce Brosnan and Kirsten Dunst. He also told her he fell in love with her, and that he was eager to move to Florida to live with her, the lawsuit said. They took vacations together to Japan, Panama and Brazil, and Johnson hosted a 'Meet Mitch' party to introduce him to her friends. She even turned her son's bedroom into an office so he could move in, the complaint said. News to them! Gross bragged that film versions of his books would star Kirsten Dunst and Pierce Brosnan . But after he got the money - about $2.95million - he started making excuses to avoid spending time with her, and delayed moving in together, the lawsuit said. The relationship ended in March 2008, when she discovered the account she was pumping money into was set up under Gross' name. The court issued a settlement order in June 2008 that ordered Gross to pay Johnson more than $3.2 million - a sum that is now about $4 million with interest, said her lawyers, who applauded the criminal investigation. 'I'm not surprised to see the federal charges,' said the woman's attorney, Clay O'Daniel. 'I figured it was a matter of time.' Her other counsel, Richard Garbarini, said his client is 'ecstatic that justice is being done.' Prosecutors, meanwhile, said anyone else who believes they were victimized should contact authorities. U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates warned that the Internet makes it simpler 'for those bent on defrauding others to find their next victim.' Gross, who lives in metro Atlanta, has written six books under the Mitchell Graham pen name, including a three-part science fiction series and a legal thriller called 'Dead Docket.'

Concern: Fire crews in London rescued 620 animals last year which is a 60 per cent increase over six years . If you have a cat stuck up a tree, or a chimp up a chimney, the fire brigade should not be the first people you call, fire chiefs said today. London Fire Brigade is concerned that it is having to deal with a rising number of animal rescues, with crews called out on average every 14 hours to deal with a creature in trouble last year. Fire crews in the capital had to rescue 620 animals last year, a 60 per cent increase over six years, and have already had to deal with more calls in the first half of this year than the same period in 2011. Unusual rescues in recent years . include a chimp in a chimney, a parrot trapped in its cage, an iguana . stuck on a roof and a hamster trapped in a disabled lift. Fire crews have also had to capture a snake at a retirement home and rescue a kitten with its head stuck in a bongo drum. The . fire brigade is highlighting some of its more bizarre animal call-outs . as part of a campaign to encourage people to keep an eye on their pets, . and warn the public that they should not necessarily call 999 to help . animals. Fire chiefs want to dispel the stereotype of firefighters rescuing cats from trees, saying that if an animal is stuck somewhere the public should always call the RSPCA first. Busy: London Fire Brigade (crew pictured) says it was called to rescue an animal every 14 hours last year and said owners need to keep an eye on their pets . Currently more than half the animal rescues fire crews are called to in London involve cats and around a quarter are to help dogs in distress. In the past five years London Fire Brigade has been called to rescue: . An iguana from a roof in Tower Hamlets in May 2007 . A parrot trapped in its cage in Waltham Forest in January 2008 . A dog stuck in a wheelchair in a flat in Richmond in May 2008 . A puppy with its head stuck in an exercise machine in a house in Hillingdon in April 2008 . A kitten with its head stuck in a bongo drum in Newham in October 2009 . Capture a snake at a retirement home in Hounslow in July 2009 . Two dogs in a toilet in Bromley in July 2009 . A chimp in a chimney in Tower Hamlets in January 2010 . An adult hamster trapped in a disabled lift in Greenwich in April 2010 . A kitten trapped in a reclining chair in Croydon in May 2012 . London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said: 'It is time to dispel the old stereotype about firefighters rescuing cats from trees, our crews are highly trained emergency service personnel. 'If there is a cat up a tree, or an animal stuck anywhere, the first port of call should always be the RSPCA, not the emergency services.' And he said: 'Pet owners need to keep a close eye on their animals in a bid to avoid some of these situations happening. What's worrying is that when firefighters are out rescuing animals, they're not available to attend real emergencies. 'Each animal rescue costs money and in these tough financial times, many people question why their taxes are being spent on some of the animal rescues we've highlighted today.' Klare Kennett, of the RSPCA, said the animal welfare charity advised people to call them first and if they needed help they called the fire brigade. She added: 'If you see a cat up a tree, we'd advise you to leave it for 24 hours before calling the RSPCA as they usually manage to get themselves down. After all, when was the last time you saw a cat's skeleton up a tree?'","London Fire Brigade called out every 14 hours to deal with animal in trouble last year .

An internet troll who sent a threatening email to Conservative MP Louise Mensch failed to turn up at court to be sentenced today. Frank Zimmerman had targeted the MP for . Corby, Northamptonshire, last year telling her to stop using the social . networking site Twitter or face the consequences. After failing to turn up at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court in Gloucestershire for sentencing this afternoon, a warrant was issued for his arrest. Wanted: Internet troll Frank Zimmerman was due to be sentenced at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court in Gloucestershire this afternoon but failed to turn up . The agoraphobic, who lives in a run-down . house in Barnwood, Gloucester, told Mrs Mensch that she faced a . 'Sophie's Choice' - a reference to a novel in which heroine Sophie has . to choose between the life of her son or daughter at a Nazi . concentration camp. Zimmerman was charged with an offence of sending by public communication network an offensive, indecent, obscene, menacing message or matter. At a hearing at Gloucester Magistrates' Court in April, he was found guilty in his absence, having failed to attend on that occasion, blaming his agoraphobia and depression. He attended court last month for sentencing but a district judge adjourned the case until today so that a pre-sentence report could be completed. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said of this . afternoon's scheduled hearing: 'Zimmerman did not appear, and a warrant . for failing to surrender to bail was issued by the court, for him to be . arrested and brought before the court at the earliest opportunity. Concerns: Following a threatening email from Zimmerman, 40-year-old MP Louise Mensch immediately called in the police and arranged security for her family . 'The court declined to pass sentence in his absence.' Zimmerman's email, dated August 22 last year, read: 'Subject: You have been HACKED :D. 'Louise Mensch, nee Bagshawe, the slut of Twitter.

'We are inside your computer and all your phones, everywhere... and inside your homes. 'So get off Twitter. We see you are still on Twitter.

The offensive email was later traced to the IP address of Zimmerman's home computer. Zimmerman denied sending it, saying his computer had been hacked.

A British man who slaughtered a girl who turned down his advances has been jailed for at least 35 years after he repeatedly stabbed her and also stabbed her parents to death in their home. Prosecutors said he left the bodies in their 'blood soaked' home after stabbing his victims at least 112 times. Jason Alexander Downie, originally from Kilmarnock, Scotland, emigrated to Australia with his mother in 2006, pleaded guilty to stabbing 16-year-old Chantelle Rowe and her parents Andrew and Rose in the South Australian town of Kapunda in November 2010. Jason Downie stabbed Chantelle Rowe more than 50 times after raping her and also killing her parents . Downie slaughtered Andrew and Rose Rowe before attacking their daughter Chantelle, who had declined his advances . Supreme Court Justice John Sulan sitting in Adelaide today said Downie, who was 18 when he committed the murders, had been sexually obsessed with Chantelle and jealous of his friend who was dating her. He broke into the Rowe family home, killed Chantelle's father Andrew, then her mother Rose and then raped Chantelle before stabbing her to death. She was stabbed more than 33 times, Andrew at least 29 times and Rose more than 50 times. Downie's lawyer, Mr Greg Mead, said his client did not remember everything that had happened but he told the court that he had not intended to kill anyone. His intention, said Mr Mead, was to confront Chantelle's boyfriend in the mistaken belief that he was staying there. Outside court, Christopher, brother to Chantelle, was too distraught to speak. His cousin, Kylie Duffield, read a statement on his behalf . Prosecutors said Chantelle had put up with Downie's unwanted attitude because he was friends with her boyfriend, whose baby she was expecting. Officials stressed that at no time was the teenage woman in a relationship with Downie. Prosecutors said it 'would not be an exaggeration' to call the scene of the murder as blood-soaked. Downie, pictured as a 10-year-old schoolboy in Scotland, emigrated to Australia with his mum in 2006 . During his court appearances, Downie had shown little reaction, even when victim impact statements were read from the Rowe family's relatives and friends. At an earlier hearing he glared at Andrew Rowe's sister when she confronted him across the courtroom and demanded to know what right he had to 'take away three angels'. The court heard that five days after the murders, a TV crew shot footage of Downie visiting a memorial for the Rowe family. Regarded as a an outsider in Kapunda - where a number of British ex-patriates live - Downie, now aged 20, has made it clear on social media that he hated the place. Even so, he claimed he was popular. His postings have listed him as being 'in a relationship' and said he 'enjoyed partying and hanging out with my friends.' He added: 'I love my sport, I am very active on and off the basketball court if you know what I mean.' He wrote that he loved basketball and the Saw horror movies. He was devoted to his mother, he said, despite their occasional clashes. Downie wrote a letter apologising for his crimes. He will serve at least 35 years in jail . Chantelle was listed in his postings as a friend. Leaving school, he said, was the best thing to happen to him and his worst fear was 'not seeing my family.' He added: 'Love my family in Scotland, haven't seen them for six years. 'I grew up without a dad since I was two months old, so I have been raised up by my mum all my life...I respect and love her to death, even though we have our bad moments.'

Hard-liner: Martine Aubry, 60, who opened the Sangatte refugee camp is set to be named the new French Prime Minister . France's leading female socialist who wants to make it easier for refugees to get into Britain is the frontrunner to become the country's next prime minister. Martine Aubry - also the woman who opened the controversial Sangatte hostel 12 years ago - is expected to be handed France's top government post by new president Francois Hollande within days. The hard-line left-winger is the daughter of notorious former EU Commission chief Jacques Delors. She who pushed to introduce France's compulsory 35-hour working week which was relaxed under Nicolas Sarkozy's right-wing UMP party. Aubry, 60, caused anger in Britain two years ago when she said that if the socialists took power in 2012, they would scrap a French law which makes it a crime to offer 'food, shelter and assistance' to illegal immigrants. Ditching the rules would make it . easier for the estimated 1,000 refugees massed in Calais to remain there . - and create an incentive for many more to arrive. The law is used by police in Calais to prosecute people who house or feed British-bound refugees living rough in the northern French port. Those convicted face up to five years in prison and a £25,000 fine. The law was thrust into the media spotlight two years ago by a film called Welcome, about a Calais swimming instructor who was prosecuted for teaching a refugee to swim across the Channel to Britain. The film's director Phipppe Loiret likened the law to 'having a Jew hidden in your cellar' during Nazi Germany. Refugee camp: The Sangatte site which acted as a stepping stone for 60,000 migrants to flood into Britain . But Aubry, also the mayor of the . northern socialist stronghold of Lille, said in 2010: 'This law punishes . kindness and makes people live in fear. 'We . have drafted legislation aimed at removing the rules so people can . offer basic free aid to illegal immigrants whose lives could be in . danger without it. 'This law will be overturned when our party takes power.' Aubry . has also always strongly defended the controversial decision she made . as social affairs minister in 1997 to open the Sangatte refugee camp. Dormitory: Refugees at the controversial camp which was eventually closed after a British outcry . The camp acted as a stepping stone for 60,000 migrants to flood into Britain before it was bulldozed in 2002. Aubry said last year: 'I opened Sangatte as a humanitarian gesture because people were suffering, and it is a decision I stand by without regret.' Incoming President Hollande is expected to name his new cabinet later this week, with long-term ally Ms Aubry known to be one of the staunchest supporters of his anti-austerity programme of higher spending and tax hikes for the rich.","Martine Aubry, 60, 'to be named PM' by new president Francois Hollande .

A jilted cruise ship singer who raped his wife in a knifepoint attack which proved fatal was jailed for 16 years today. Bob Marley impersonator Melvyn Edwards, 59, had been told wife Juliet was leaving him, and also claimed to have been unhappy about wife Juliet slimming down from a size 18 to a size ten after embarking on a fitness regime, and would repeatedly question her about the name of a . man she befriended. He subsequently crept into her bedroom in the middle of the night, forced her to have sex with him at knifepoint and then, as she turned from him, her neck caught on the blade - just hours after she confirmed she was leaving him for good. Afterwards he rang 999 and falsely claimed to have found Juliet fatally injured on the bedroom floor and was heard to say 'easy baby, stay still, stay still’ as she lay dying. Happy times: But cruise ship singer Melvyn Edwards' rape of wife Juliet ended with her death . Mistaken: The couple's 21-year marriage had crumbled after Edwards discovered Juliet, 48, was two timing him . Entertaining: Edwards was a Bob Marley impersonator and worked on cruises in the Caribbean, singing and playing steel drums . The mother-of-three, a medical practice manageress, died a short time later in hospital from her wounds. The couple’s 21-year marriage had . crumbled after Edwards discovered Juliet, 48, was two timing him at home . in Manchester whilst he was 4,000 miles away, entertaining holidaymakers . on board cruise liners in the Caribbean. Sentencing Judge Andrew Gilbart QC, told Edwards: 'When you were away working abroad, you discovered that all was not well with the relationship. 'As can happen, she was keen on having some independence. She sought friendship elsewhere, including in an affair with another man. You were understandably upset. 'But let us be clear about this. Many men and women have to endure the discovery that their husband, wife or partner is no longer content with the relationship they have. 'Many are jealous or unhappy. But what the law cannot and will not permit is the use of violence, which is what you used. Convicted: Edwards claimed the killing had been carried out by a stranger and his wife was his 'soulmate' and 'the love of his life' 'You went back to her house in the . early hours of the morning, let yourself in, armed yourself with a . knife, and went upstairs to insist that you had sex with her. 'In my judgement she died because . that blade entered her neck as she sought to turn away from your sexual . advances. In other words she died as the result of a rape at knifepoint . by you in her own bedroom. 'You then left her to bleed to death . before returning and eventually trying too late to put right what you . had done by summoning help. Had you sought help earlier, one cannot . know, but she might well have lived.' During an earlier row he had also raped her, but she was too frightened to report it to police. It . emerged in the hours before the killing itself Mrs Edwards had been . recorded on her husband’s mobile phone saying: 'At this moment in time I . don’t feel we are going to get back together. 'It’s probably more what I want than what you want. I think it’s better that you take your things.' At Manchester Crown Court, Edwards was . convicted of rape and manslaughter following a week long trial but was . cleared of murder. He claimed the killing had been carried out by a . stranger and his wife was his 'soulmate' and 'the love of his life'. The jury was told the couple’s marriage started to fail after Edwards returned from a stint working on a Caribbean cruise ship in April last year. He claimed to be unhappy about his wife slimming down, and eventually became suspicious about why his wife’s phone bill was ‘so high’. He then beat her up and swung a baseball bat until it broke on the bed. Violence: Edwards, right, claimed to be unhappy about his wife slimming down from a size 18 to a size ten. During one row Edwards had raped her, but she was too frightened to report it to police . Following . a later argument after a night out at a concert, Mr Edwards is said to . have bitten his wife on the cheek and raped her. Despite . the violence the couple continued sharing their home in South . Manchester and planned to go to the Caribbean island of St Kitts in June . of last year. But she . decided not to go because she feared for her safety at the hands of her . husband. Edwards went to the Caribbean alone but returned to the UK two . days before his wife was killed. When he arrived home, she refused to let him stay saying she no longer trusted him and that the marriage was over. The . following day Mrs Edwards called a meeting with her husband in which . she told him 'there was no prospect of reconciliation' in a 'final . confirmation' of the end of the relationship. Hours later, at 4.10am on July 23, Edwards let himself into the house while his wife was asleep and fatally attacked her. Scene: Police outside the house in Manchester where 48-year-old Juliet Edwards met her death . In his 999 call which was played to the jury he said: 'I was at a party with some friends and I just came home, well I came to my wife’s house, she’s on the floor and there’s blood all over the place. 'I think she’s probably been cut or stabbed or something, I don’t know. I can’t tell for sure but it seems like there must be a wound somewhere because she’s in a lot of blood. I don’t know who the attacker was.' Mr Andrew Thomas QC prosecuting said: 'The defendant had let himself into the house in the middle of the night, forced his wife to have intercourse with him, and then stabbed her. 'It was perhaps an act of punishment, coming as it did a few hours after she told him it was over.' Mrs Edwards’ blood was found on a kitchen knife recovered from a drawer in the property. Outside court her family said 'No sentence in the world could ever give us back our mother. The sentence of 16 years passed today is of no comfort to us and we are simply left numb. 'It does however provide some form of closure for us, her children, and the rest of the family in so far as everyone now knows the truth of what Melvyn Edwards did to our mother. We can now finally allow our mum to rest in peace.' Det Chief Insp Joanne Rawlinson of Greater Manchester said: 'This is a very sad and tragic case that has understandably left a family truly devastated. 'During their relationship, Juliet was raped and suffered a number of domestic violence incidents. 'She found the strength to leave her abusive relationship and end her marriage, making it clear that there was no chance of reconciliation. 'This unfortunately led to a further rape and her unnecessary death and reflects the kind of controlling and violent person Melvyn Edwards is. 'I hope this sentencing can go some way to helping Mrs Edwards' loved ones get their lives back on track and feeling that some kind of justice has been served.'","Melvyn Edwards rang 999 and falsely claimed to have .

A choirboy may have accidentally strangled himself during an experiment to improve his singing by restricting his breath, an inquest heard yesterday. Judge’s son Edward Morgan-Gooch, 12, was concerned he wouldn’t be able to hit high notes when his voice broke. His mother, Julia, 43, had tucked him up in bed but found him lifeless on the floor when returned to switch off his bedside light. Her husband Christopher Morgan, 48, a barrister who sits as a Recorder at Norwich Crown Court, tried to resuscitate him. Grief: Recorder Christopher Morgan, whose son Edward Morgan-Gooch , accidentally strangled himself to death, arrives today at the inquest held in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk . The inquest heard that Edward was a ‘well-motivated’ boy who was active and happy at school and had shown no intent to harm himself. Instead he was said to be focussed on trying to do his best as a chorister at 16th century St Edmundsbury Cathedral in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. An investigation by consultant paediatrician Dr Peter Powell, of the Suffolk safeguarding children team, concluded that he might have put the belt around his neck to improve his singing. Suffolk coroner Dr Peter Dean said: . ‘He was a chorister and he had raised concerns about being able to sing . high notes once his voice had broken. ‘It . is possible that he might have been trying to assist his breathing in . some way. There was nothing about his behaviour that gave any concern . that anything was troubling Edward. ‘His . family quickly concluded that his intention was not to harm himself, . but rather an experimental or exploratory act. It may have been . something that was difficult for Edward to explain, but children can . carry out acts which are out of character. Judge: A professional picture of Recorder Morgan . ‘All who knew Edward knew he was focussed on trying to perform his best for the choir. ‘Dr Powell stated that he may have in some way been seeking to improve his breath-holding skills or his voice and it is something that tragically went wrong. ‘He was enthusiastic and striving for excellence without any suggestion of being unhappy. There is no suggestion that he had any unhappiness or interest in harming himself in any way.’ Dr Dean described Edward as ‘an active and enthusiastic member’ of the Cathedral choir. He had attended choir practice on the morning of November 2 last year before his classes at St James Middle School, a Church of England Voluntary Aided School in Bury St Edmunds. After school, he attended an All Souls Service at the cathedral in the evening before returning to his family home at Wickhambrook near Bury St Edmunds. Dr Dean said: ‘He seemed excited about a new piece of music and packed his school bag before he went to bed. There was no clues of anything untoward. ‘Immediately before going to bed, he was preparing for future musical events . The inquest in Bury St Edmunds heard that Edward’s mother Julia Gooch had ‘tucked him up in bed as normal’ and left him to read or listen to an audio book. Around 40 minutes later at 9.30pm, she went to turn off his light and found him unresponsive and sitting sideways on the floor beside his bed with the belt around his neck. Mrs Gooch, 42, a legal executive for a firm of solicitors in Newmarket, called for help and her husband managed to untie the belt and attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Paramedics who were alerted by a 999 call carried on trying to revive him and took him to the West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds where attempts continued, but he was declared dead. Dr Dean said that a police . investigation headed by Det Sgt Carl Dye of Suffolk Police found there . were no suspicious circumstances. He said: ‘This was not believed in any circumstances to be a suspicious death. It was clearly an unexplained tragedy. ‘All the reports indicate that Edward had been his normal self and had had earlier been at school and the choir. ‘He was found seated on the floor. It would be wrong to describe this as hanging.’ Mrs Gooch wept throughout the hearing as she sat with her husband listening to Dr Dean recount the evidence. Imposing: St Edmundsbury Cathedral where12 year old Edward Morgan-Gooch sang as a chorister . A post mortem by paediatric pathologist Dr Flora Jessop at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, concluded that his death was caused by ligature compression to his neck. Dr Dean said that a safeguarding children investigation found no suggestion that Edward intended to harm himself and concluded that he had a happy and supportive life at home and school . He added: ‘It is clear from the evidence that he didn’t intend to harm himself and he was a happy, highly motivated and active child, fully committed to his work as a chorister. ‘He used his computer for social messaging, but nothing on there showed an intent to harm himself. On the contrary, he was enjoying his choral and scholastic life and looking forward to the future.’ Dr Dean said Edward’s death should serve as a warning of the ‘extreme danger’ of doing anything which involved neck compression. He said: ‘The danger of sudden death is ever present. There is no suggestion that Edward as anything but a much loved, very happy and enthusiastic young lad who was clearly highly motivated and very much enjoyed his time as a chorister and was thinking actively of the future. ‘It does seem from all the evidence that this was a tragic act that went wrong, an act conducted with no intent to harm himself. I wish to emphasise the extreme dangers of any sort of experimentation involving pressure on the neck.’ Dr Dean recorded a verdict of accidental death. Mr Morgan, 47, was called to the Bar as a barrister in 1987 and was made a Recorder in 2009. He has presided in recent months over several cases at Norwich Crown Court. The Very Rev Dr Frances Ward, the Dean of St Edmundsbury, described Edward at the time of his death as ‘a lovely, happy 12-year-old’ and said his death was ‘a tragic accident’. She added in a statement: ‘Edward enjoyed life immensely. We will all miss his enthusiasm and passion for singing, his cheerfulness and his lively and inquisitive personality.’ Edward joined the Cathedral as a probationer in February 2009 and became a full chorister the following September. He was baptised in 2010 and had his Confirmation last year in the Cathedral. He was among a group of choristers who met Prince Charles on his official visit to the Cathedral in March last year. Paul Elstone, the headteacher of the 487-pupil St James Middle School, said: ‘The school was saddened by the shocking news of Edward’s death. ‘He was a lively and cheerful pupil who had contributed much, especially to the musical life of the school. He will be sadly missed.’ Mr Morgan’s entry on his Chambers website describes him as being ‘experienced in all areas of criminal law’. It adds: ‘He is regularly instructed to prosecute and defend in serious cases of violence (murder/ manslaughter); sexual offences (with emphasis on child sex abuse cases); fraud; and large -scale drug conspiracies. ‘He has particular experience prosecuting/ defending in covert surveillance cases, and is regularly asked to advise on matters concerning disclosure of sensitive material and present public interest immunity applications.’ The coroner gave a verdict of accidental death.","Mother of Edward Morgan-Gooch, 12, found him sitting lifeless on his bedroom floor with a belt tightened around his neck .

The state of Maryland are keen to rid the Pomtomac of the fish because it is a voracious top-level predator, meaning that it has no natural enemies, and could decimate populations of native fish. About 90 per cent of it's diet consists of other fish and it is even known to swallow sea bass whole.

Grinning Juan said: 'I think they are really cool looking, I like the way they look. They fight hard and they are really aggressive but you can catch them on any bass fishing lures.' He told how you shouldn't touch the fish while it was still alive because its fangs would 'tear your thumb off' and how he thought the fish's pattern looked like a 'diamond-back rattlesnake'. It's been eight years since a snakehead fish was discovered in the Potomac. But biologists would rather see them gone and the state have offered to give the angler with the biggest catch a $200 gift certificate.

A scarf or other item of clothing was covering his face. But a defiant Mr Ali has vowed not to let the robber stop him running his business, and opened the store as normal the next day. 'You just have to get on with things,' he said. 'I've had a shop in Fauldhouse for years and nothing like this has happened to me before.

'We are now keen to speak with anyone in the area at 5.45pm [on Sunday] and who remembers seeing anything or anyone suspicious.' The robbery is just one of a series of incidents in which shop keepers have been threatened with a knife.

"By . Tom Gardner and Tom Goodenough . PUBLISHED: . 10:44 EST, 11 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:35 EST, 11 May 2012 . A former altar boy has been convicted of bludgeoning to death his gay lover who he suspected to be a paedophile as part of a campaign to rid the world of sex offenders. Christopher Hunnisett, 28, beat Peter Bick, 57, over the head with a hammer then walked into a nearby police station to confess to the killing. The cold blooded killer - who claimed to have been the victim of sexual abuse in the past - had added Mr Bick to a hit-list after meeting him on the internet – despite there ‘not being a shred of evidence’ that he was a paedophile. Hit-list: Christopher Hunnisett, 28, left, put Peter Bick, 57, right, at the top of a list of men he planned to kill because he suspected they were paedophiles, the court heard . Brutal: This was the contents of a green rucksack - including a knife, passport and road atlas - that killer Christopher Hunnisett had with him while travelling in Peter Bick's Fiesta car . After being found guilty of murder, Hunnisett leapt over the dock in an attempt to escape before being restrained by eight security guards. He subsequently wept as the verdict was handed down to him. Hunnisett, from Hastings, Sussex, had previously denied one count of murder at Lewes Crown Court, saying in April, last year, ‘It is not wrong to try and stand up to evil in this world’. Police found the supermarket worker dead in his flat, in Bexhill, where he lived alone on January 11, 2011. Facing life: Hunnisett, pictured handcuffed to security guards during his trial while held on remand, tried to leap from the dock to escape when he was found guilt of murder. Hunnisett, who who has a bizarre tattoo covering his back, will be sentenced later . The court heard that Hunnisett . hatched his 'brutal plan' after meeting Mr Bick on the internet and . embarking on a sexual relationship with him. After the horrific murder, Hunnisett stole his victim's car and was captured on camera driving around the neighbourhood. When he was arrested, police found a in his green backpack the provisions he needed for a killing spree - including a knife, road atlas and passport. Prosecutor . Philip Katz QC said: ‘Peter Bick was living on his own in a studio . flat, there is not a shred of evidence that he was a paedophile. ‘There is an abundance of evidence that he enjoyed consensual sex with adult men, including this defendant. ‘Hunnisett has strived in every devious way he could to make it look like the man he killed was a paedophile. Caught: Hunnisett was pictured driving murder victim Peter Bick's Fiesta car immediately after the killing . The court was also told this was the third time the defendant had been tried for murder. In 2002, Hunnisett was convicted and jailed but later acquitted of killing alleged paedophile Rev Ronald Glazebrook at his home in St Leonards on Sea. Mr Katz QC added: ‘We will hear from a young woman who had a relationship with him after he got out of prison. She will tell you about his various and coloured sexual preferences. He talked to her about his plan to kill paedophiles. ‘He is confused about his own sexuality but that does not make it right to kill people then make himself look like a hero. He had planned to kill more men who he had been in contact with on the internet, he compiled a hit list and Peter Bick was at the top of that list. ‘On some of these internet chat rooms Hunnisett was pretending to be a woman. None of the men he arranged to meet was a paedophile. This is a cold blooded and dangerous killer.’ Claims: Hunnisett, left, alleged that he was abused by Rev Ronald Glazebrook, right. Hunnisett served eight years of a life sentence for the clergyman's killing, but was later acquitted of his murder . The court heard that Hunnisett had previously served eight years of a life sentence for the murder of an 81-year-old retired priest called Reverend Ronald Glazebrook. Hit list: This chilling piece of paper entitled 'Tango priorities' has the names and addressed of people Hunnisett was intent on killing . Following his conviction, material came to light which discredited Mr Glazebrook’s character and showed he had sexually assaulted a young boy, the court was told. His body had been dismembered and was found in two different locations in Sussex. The jury was told that Hunnisett had met Glazebrook through the church when he was young boy and later became his lodger before being convicted of his murder in 2002. Throughout the trial Hunnisett denied . knowing how Reverend Glazebrook died, claiming he found the dead body in . the bath ‘panicked’ and recruited a friend to help him dispose of it. The jury convicted him of murder and he was sentenced to life. However, . in September 2010 he was acquitted of the murder at a retrial by the . Appeal Court - where Hunnisett alleged that the clergyman sexually . abused him throughout his teens. Hunnisett . then admitted punching the vicar for trying to grope him in the . bathroom - and claimed he then fell in the bath and died. It . was just four months after this conviction was quashed that he walked . into a police station confessing to the killing of Mr Bick. Mr Katz said: ‘That history is of central importance. ‘I . also want to mention that before and after both his trial and retrial . and before the trial today Hunnisett has been seen by different . psychiatrists and not one of them think that he is mentally ill and not . one thinks he has a personality disorder.’ Mr Katz added Hunnisett had already admitted killing Mr Bick but the jury must decide whether he can mount a partial defence of diminished responsibility. He said: ‘This was a brutal and carefully planned murder, responsibility for which he is trying to escape in any way he can.’ Mr Justice Saunders adjourned the case for sentencing at Woolwich Crown Court, London, on May 22.","Christopher Hunnisett, 28, murdered gay supermarket worker he believed to be a sex offender .

"Work and Pensions . Secretary Iain Duncan Smith says  losing a limb should not entitle people to a payout . By . Graham Smith . PUBLISHED: . 02:41 EST, 14 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:54 EST, 14 May 2012 . Benefits chiefs have ruled that a former forklift driver who had a leg amputated following a workplace accident and is recovering from an operation on his other leg is fit to work. Darren Gilligan, 35, has been told that he failed to meet the criteria to receive Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) because he did not score enough points on a medical assessment form. The decision marks the second time that the single . father-of-two has had his ESA benefits rejected - the first was shortly . before he had his leg amputated last August. It comes as Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions . Secretary, today said that losing a limb should not automatically entitle people to a payout. Appeal: Amputee Darren Gilligan, pictured with his daughter Amy, has been told that he failed to meet the criteria to receive Employment and Support Allowance . He . pledged to push ahead with controversial reforms that will see two . million disability claimants reassessed over the next four years under . plans to save the taxpayer billions of pounds. He . said: ‘It is a gauge of your capability. In other words, do you need . care? Do you need support to get around? Those are the two things that . are measured. Not “You have lost a limb”.' Mr Duncan Smith was referring to a new, more stringent benefit called Personal Independence Payment which will replace the Disability Living Allowance (DLA). Last August's decision against Mr Gilligan receiving ESA was eventually overturned when he appealed and he continued to receive £188 every fortnight. Mr Gilligan said: 'It's ludicrous. When they did a U-turn last time I still had both my legs but now I've actually had the amputation I'm worse off than before and there are other health complications. 'But they are saying I'm fit to work - I'm clearly not.' Fightback: Mr Gilligan now plans to appeal with the help of letters from his GP, consultants and physiotherapists . Mr Gilligan, of Baildon, West Yorkshire, had been getting used to his false leg when he fell and tore ligaments in his other knee, for which he underwent an operation on Thursday. He said: 'I'm wheelchair-bound because I can't bear any weight and I get chronic backache. I want to work when I'm well enough and have learned to walk on my new leg but that's not possible now. Clampdown: Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, today said that losing a limb should not automatically entitle people to a payout . 'I'm not a scrounger. I want to go back to work, I'm a proud man. I'm not trying to pull a fast one. 'All I want is to be left to get better, this is no life and it is so frustrating because there is nothing you can do.' Mr Gilligan, who lives with his daughters Charlotte and Amy, both 12, said he had been for an assessment about two months ago, before finding out the decision last week. He now plans to appeal with the help of letters from his GP, consultants and physiotherapists - all of who, he said, agree he cannot return to work. He said: 'I will appeal and with all the specialists behind me I should get the extra points I need. 'I was told I only had 12 points towards getting my ESA - six for having one leg, another six for being depressed and I need another three apparently. 'Everyone I speak to is flabbergasted. If you can breathe and blink they want you back to work.' Mr Gilligan added: 'As soon as I can wear my leg all day - not even all day - I could do part-time between the leg and wheelchair. As soon as the other leg gets stable enough so I can put on the false leg I want to work. 'I'm sure I could do some type of manual labour. If it wasn't for my injured leg I would be up and about ready to work. I would even do voluntary work. I just want to help myself.' Should amputees be forced to work? Paul Anderson, of Bradford & District Disabled People's Forum, said 42 per cent of people in Bradford were winning their appeals against ESA judgements, which showed how 'ridiculous' the entitlement process was. He said: 'It's causing a lot of stress and unnecessary worry because of the way the assessment and scoring process is so unfair and so unrealistic. 'Disabled people want to be given the opportunity to work but some people need more support and also jobs they can do are not always available.' A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: 'We shouldn't automatically write off a person's ability to work, solely on the basis of a health condition or disability. 'That's why the Work Capability Assessment doesn't focus on a particular diagnosis, but on the actual abilities of an individual, and whether that person - with the right support - could undertake suitable work. 'People who are too sick or disabled will continue to receive our unconditional support, but those who are able to work will get specialist help through the Work Programme.'","Darren Gilligan lost a limb in a workplace accident and is recovering from an operation on his other leg .

"By . Louise Boyle . PUBLISHED: . 20:25 EST, 29 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:25 EST, 29 May 2012 . Abortion clinics have been accused of offering pregnant women the option to terminate based on the sex of their baby, according to pro-life campaigners. The organization Live Action sent a pregnant woman into a Planned Parenthood clinic with a hidden camera. During her appointment, she made it clear to the counselor that she will only have a termination if the child is female but would keep a baby boy. The health adviser supports her decision and even explains how to access Medicare in order to have an ultrasound to determine the sex of the baby before scheduling an abortion around five months into the pregnancy. Planned Parenthood has condemned Live Action's investigation as a 'hoax' and said the counselor no longer works at the center in south Austin, Texas. Scroll down for video . Dubious: A counselor, identified only as Rebecca, helped a pregnant woman schedule her abortion based on the sex of her baby at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Austin, Texas . The pro-life group claimed that the practice was being carried out across the U.S. and that they have a series of tapes showing sex-selective abortions being supported. In the video, the pregnant woman enters the clinic for an appointment to schedule her abortion. The woman tells the counselor 'Rebecca' that she is in her first trimester and therefore cannot be certain of her baby's gender. Reading medical notes, Rebecca said: 'I see that you’re saying that you want to terminate if it’s a girl, so are you just wanting to continue the pregnancy in the meantime? 'The abortion covers you up until 23 weeks and usually at 5 months is when they detect, you know, whether or not it’s a boy or a girl.' The Planned Parenthood counselor then advises the woman, sitting off-camera, that she could get on Medicaid in order to pay for an . ultrasound to determine the gender of her baby and use the knowledge for an elective abortion. Choices: Planned Parenthood in south Austin, Texas was where pro-life organization Live Action staged their undercover sting . Conflicting: Lila Rose (pictured left) set up the pro-life group Live Action when she was 15. Her undercover sting of a Planned Parenthood clinic was condemned as a hoax by VP of the non-profit Leslie Kantor (right) She finally suggests the woman 'just continue and try again' for a boy if she has to abort a girl and shows her to the door with the words: 'Good luck, and I hope that you do get your boy.' Founder and president of Live Action Lila Rose said in a statement to MailOnline: 'The . search-and-destroy targeting of baby girls through prenatal testing and . abortion is a pandemic that is spreading across the globe. 'Research proves that sex-selective . abortion has now come to America. The abortion industry, led by Planned . Parenthood, is a willing participant.' Live . Action is youth-based movement that was started in 2003 by Ms Rose, . then 15 years old. It is a pro-life organization and describes abortion . as the 'greatest human rights injustice of our time'. Decision time: The counselor helps the pregnant woman prepare Medicaid paperwork to have an ultrasound to determine the sex of her baby before she decides whether or not to have a termination . Its undercover investigation was used as a tactic for revealing practices at abortion clinics. Congress is set to debate the Prenatal Non-Discrimination Act (PRENDA) tomorrow which would ban sex-selective abortions across the U.S. At present, only Illinois, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma and Arizona prohibit the practice. The bill would ban abortions performed because of a baby's gender. If it became law, it would mean that medical staff who suspect a woman is seeking an abortion based on the sex of her baby would have to report her to authorities. It would also leave doctors who performed the abortions at risk of being sent to prison or lawsuits. Several health directors have raised concerns that such a law would put minority women at risk, in particular Asian-American women. The issue of sex selection in Asian countries was highlighted in a report by the World Health Organization last year. Miriam Yeung, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, said: 'No woman should ever be scrutinized or interrogated by her doctor, but this is exactly what would happen if this bill becomes law.' Planned Parenthood is a non-profit which . has lobbied for pro-choice for more than 90 years. In its mission . statement, its aim 'to empower individuals to . make independent, informed decisions about their sexual and reproductive . lives'. Following what Planned Parenthood described as a 'hoax' campaign, vice president of education Leslie Kantor released a statement. She said: 'Six weeks ago a former staff member serving in an entry-level position did not follow our protocol for providing information and guidance when presented with a highly unusual patient scenario. 'Within three days of this patient interaction, the staff member’s employment was ended and all staff members at this affiliate were immediately scheduled for retraining in managing unusual patient encounters. Ms Kantor continued: 'Today opponents of Planned Parenthood are promoting an edited video of that hoax patient encounter. 'Gender bias is contrary to everything our organization works for daily in communities across the country. 'The world’s leading women’s health and rights organizations, including the World Health Organization, do not believe that curtailing access to abortion services is a legitimate means of addressing sex selection, and have made clear that gender bias can only be resolved by addressing the underlying conditions that lead to it.' The risk of death is higher the later a woman decides to have an abortion. There is one fatality per 6,000 . abortions at 21 weeks and more. In a press release, Live Action also said that six studies since 2008 have revealed that there are . thousands of 'missing girls' in the U.S. after sex-selective abortion. The World Health Organization reported that the biologically normal sex ratio at birth rangesfrom 102 to 106 males per 100 females. There has been cause for concern in some countries - including India and China - where this ratio has climbed to 130. Many Asian societies place the family's economic security and future lineage on the heads of sons rather than daughters. It has resulted in pressure, blatant or subtle, on women to produce sons. There have been numerous initiatives by governments to try to address the issue. Several countries have passed laws against sex-selective abortions and the issue is due to be debated in the U.S. tomorrow as Congress addresses the Prenatal Non-Discrimination Act. WHO reported last year that some countries have introduced direct measures such as scholarship programs for girls or pensions for families which only have girls in an effort to redress the gender bias.","Live Action sent pregnant actor to Planned Parenthood clinic in Texas .

A mother embezzled more than $10million from the car dealership where she worked and spent it over six years on luxury trips, extravagant presents and once-in-a-lifetime experiences. Patricia Smith splashed millions of dollars on VIP tickets to see the Pope, a costume fitting and cameo performance in The Phantom of The Opera and a gourmet lunch cooked and hosted by celebrity chef Ina 'The Barefoot Contessa' Garten at her Hamptons home. The 58-year-old, who worked at the Pittsburg Baierl Acura car dealership in Pennsylvania, was jailed for six-and-a-half years on Wednesday. The elaborate theft drew similarities with the Coen brothers' film Fargo -  where a car dealership employee fakes a kidnapping in an attempt to extort millions - except Smith's crimes were solely white collar. Convicted: Patricia Smith, 58, stole $10million over the course of six years, and now she faces that same amount of time behind bars after being found guilty of wire fraud . Smith worked as a controller at the Acura dealership and fudged business records and made illegal bank transfers that amounted to over $10million extra dollars in her bank account. When broken down over time, AOL Autos reports that equates to her pocketing $4,000 every day during her six-year-crime spree. In court, Smith was extremely apologetic and sobbed to the judge after being charged with wire fraud. The district attorney reported that Smith made over 800 deposits from the company's accounts into her own accounts since 2004. Local station WTAE said that she cited an incurable need for approval by her family and friends as the reason for embezzling. Smith said that she felt like a 'horrible daughter, wife, mother and friend' and used the gifts and trips to 'earn their love'. Her lawyer put it another way, saying that she had an abusive childhood that lead to a gambling addiction and propensity to overspend. For the love: Smith said that she spent the millions on gifts for her family to 'earn their love', like she did when she got four luxury tickets to the 2011 Super Bowl . A holy visit: She bought private tours of The Vatican (left) and Sistine Chapel, along with VIP seats at a Mass attended by the Pope (like the one on the right) She 'wanted to see what happiness looked like' and she appeared to have a varied interpretation of the good life. She spent $1.8million on private jets to seven different European countries and four Caribbean islands along with hour homes in Cranberry, Pennsylvania, the beach town of Avalon, and a residence in Columbus, Georgia. When she wasn't busy traveling abroad or resting in her homes, Smith treated herself and her friends to unique experiences. She spent $44,500 on four well-placed tickets to the Super Bowl in 2011 and $32,500 for a six-person lunch cooked by Food Network star Ina Garten in the home where she hosts her television show. Serious spending: Smith bought a first-edition Harry Potter book (like the one on the left) and paid $32,500 for TV chef Ina Garten (right) to cook a luncheon for she and five friends at Garten's East Hampton home . Perhaps feeling as if she needed to repent for some of her illegal activity, Smith paid $5,000 for 'The Vatican Package' which featured plane tickets for four to Rome, a private tour of the Vatican and Sistine Chapel as well as seats to a Mass in the Papal audience. Another bizarre purchase was the $2,500 she spent to have a costume and wig fitting at The Phantom of The Opera play along with the chance to make an appearance on stage during the Hannibal Opera sequence while four of her friends watched on in the audience. Smith wasn’t above accumulating physical possessions either, buying a first-edition Harry Potter book, a baby grand piano, flat screen televisions, SUVs and a Mustang convertible. Left in the lurch: The Baierl Acura car dealership will only receive about $1million back from the $10million that she stole during her tenure as their controller . The district attorney said that Smith was apologetic and thanked them for the compassion that both they and the Marshall's office showed during the investigation. Along with the next six years that Smith will spend behind bars, the dealership also lost out because of the embezzlement: they will only be reimbursed for about $1million of the $10million that she took. 'We're glad that justice has been served and this matter is now behind us,' the management team said in a statement. 'Our business is doing well and we have adopted stronger measures to prevent such a crime from ever happening again.'","Patricia Smith, 58, to spend six-and-a-half years in jail for stealing $10m .

Tory backbenchers are preparing the . biggest revolt of David Cameron's leadership over the issue when it . comes to the Commons on Tuesday. Today senior Right-winger David Davis . describes plans to create an upper house where 80 per cent of members . are elected by proportional representation as 'an attempt by Lib Dems to . boost their presence in the upper chamber by rigging the electoral . system in their favour'. Threat: Liberal Democrats will block parliamentary boundary changes if rebel Tory MPs kill off plans to reform the House of Lords, it was claimed today . Writing in the Daily Mail, the former . Shadow Home Secretary argues the reforms will give the Lib Dems 'a . pivotal position in all future elections'. Fellow Tories reacted with fury . yesterday after Mr Clegg's closest aide said the Deputy Prime Minister . would block changes to parliamentary boundaries, which will benefit the . Tories, if Tories vote down plans for Lords reform. Under the plans to be debated next . week, elections to the upper house would be held alongside general . elections to the Commons, with the first in 2015. Members would be . elected in tranches of 120 at each of the next three elections, with the . process completed by 2025.

Richard Reeves, who is stepping down . as director of strategy, said the Lib Dems would block plans to cut the . number of MPs from 650 to 600 – a measure which some experts believe . could give the Tories an additional 20 seats at the next general . election.

"By . Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 16:50 EST, 21 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:16 EST, 22 June 2012 . Plans to end years of dumbing down in schools by replacing GCSEs with rigorous new O-levels rocked the Coalition yesterday. Nick Clegg erupted with fury and vowed to block Michael Gove’s proposals – revealed exclusively in yesterday’s Daily Mail – to toughen up exams taken at 16, saying they would ‘turn back the clock’ and should not be allowed to ‘cater to the few at the top’. The Deputy Prime Minister accused the Education Secretary of seeking to send schools back to the 1950s and throw children on ‘the scrap heap’ by proposing a new simple CSE exam for less able pupils alongside the tough new O-levels. Determined: Education Secretary Michael Gove said he will publish a consultation document in mid-July setting out plans to scrap GCSEs and replace them with 'world class exams' Criticism: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said . the school system 'must be for the many not the few' while Labour . schools minister Kevin Brennan said Mr Gove's plans would create a . two-tier system for pupils . Mr Clegg said the reform was ‘not Government policy’, and added: ‘Any exam system, any school system, must be for the many not the few.’ Labour accused Mr Gove of wanting to bring back a ‘two-tier system’, and teaching unions called the plans ‘a hugely backwards step which will harm social mobility’. David Cameron threw his weight behind the main thrust of the plans, with his aides revealing that the Prime Minister is ‘100 per cent behind Michael’. But the Prime Minister was also incandescent at the way the story was leaked to the Mail before Mr Gove had even discussed it with the Lib Dems. A source said: ‘Of course David likes this idea. He’s totally behind Michael on these ideas. 'But he’s furious with the way it’s come out because it makes getting the policy through more difficult because it has allowed the Lib Dems to publicly entrench themselves.’ A defiant Mr Gove made it clear that despite Lib Dem objections he will publish a consultation document in mid-July setting out plans to scrap GCSEs and replace them with ‘world class exams’. It will also outline plans to scrap the National Curriculum and end the requirement that pupils obtain five good GCSEs graded A* to C, which would allow schools to ditch the discredited exams. British pupils have slipped down international league tables in key subjects over the past decade. The most authoritative comparison is the Programme for International Student Assessment carried out by the OECD. It is based on tests given to 15-year-olds in up to 65 countries. When first carried out in 2000, the UK was ranked fourth in science, seventh in literacy and eighth in maths. The science ranking fell to 12th in 2003, 14th in 2006 and 16th in 2009.In literacy the country sank to 11th in 2003, 17th in 2006 and 25th in 2009. The most dramatic slump is in maths, where the ranking was 18th in 2003, 24th in 2006 and 28th in 2009. Critics point out that the sample in the survey has grown across the years, from 43 countries in 2000 to 65 in the last study in 2009. But, even when this is taken into account, the UK has still slipped proportionately down the tables. Under Michael Gove’s plans for a revival, pupils will be able to sit the new O-levels at 16 or 17 and the best pupils will be allowed to bypass the exams and go straight to A-levels. Schools will be given the freedom to enter pupils for the exams when they are ready, rather than forcing everyone to sit them at 16. Modular study will be abolished, with emphasis put on in-depth work and end of year exams rather than coursework that can be redone until it passes muster. Pupils studying English literature will be banned from taking the text of plays into exams and maths pupils will be expected to learn complex subjects such as calculus in order to obtain an A grade. Mr Gove believes the exams need to be tougher to prepare pupils for A-levels, which are also being made more rigorous. Meanwhile, businesses will be asked to draw up a new CSE-style qualification for less able pupils – around one quarter of pupils struggle even to get D or E grades at GCSE. Mr Gove thinks it is pointless to make those children sit the same O-level as those who are preparing to read a rigorous academic subject at Oxford or Cambridge. Mr Gove can push that change through with a stroke of the pen and without legislation – limiting the Lib Dems’ leverage unless they are prepared to walk out of the Coalition. The consultation paper will also outline plans to end the scandal of ‘competitive dumbing down’ where exam boards advertise their papers as the easiest to pass. Instead, contracts will be awarded  to just one exam board for each subject. The reforms would see pupils starting to study for new O-levels in English, maths and science in September 2014, crucially before the next general election. But Lib Dems made clear that the package of reforms and timetable envisaged by Mr Gove are untenable. Mr Gove may have to settle for including it in the next Tory election manifesto. A volcanic row erupted when the plans leaked because Mr Gove had not even discussed his ideas with Sarah Teather, the Lib Dem minister in his own department, let alone Mr Clegg. After a tense transatlantic call with the Deputy Prime Minister – who is in Rio for a climate change summit – Mr Clegg’s aides accused the Education Secretary of trying to ‘bounce’ them into the reforms. Mr Clegg himself said: ‘This was self-evidently not policy that has either been discussed or agreed within the Coalition government. ‘I’m not in favour of anything that would lead to a two-tier system where children at quite a young age are somehow cast on a scrapheap. What you want is an exam system which is fit for the future, doesn’t turn the clock back to the past and works for the many and not just for the few.’ Lib Dem president Tim Farron called the plans ‘madness’ and said: ‘Let’s kill off immediately any talk of returning to the divisive two-tier system that Mrs Thatcher wisely ended in the late 80s.’ Lib Dem Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander said: ‘This was not an idea I’d heard about until I saw it on the front page of a newspaper. This might not be an ideal way to form policy.’ But Tories accused Mr Clegg of ‘jumping in’ before he had bothered to examine the details. They pointed out that Mr Gove’s plan would see 75 per cent of pupils taking O-levels. ‘Three quarters is “the many”,’ one source said, referring to Mr Clegg’s ‘many, not the few’ comment. In the Commons, Mr Gove made a robust case for new rigour in secondary education. He said schools already operate a two-tier system because 42 per cent of pupils currently fail to get the five good GCSEs which employers demand. He added: ‘Some of our most impressive schools have already left the GCSE behind and opted for the IGCSE or other more rigorous examinations. 'The sad truth is that at least 40 per cent of children have been left behind under the current system. There is no excuse not to act.’ Labour’s schools spokesman Kevin Brennan said: ‘They want to bring back a two-tier exam system designed in the 1950s which will separate children and close off opportunity.’ Dr Mary Bousted, leader of the . Association of Teachers and Lecturers, described Mr Gove’s plans as . ‘ludicrous’, adding: ‘Where is the evidence that this will be an . improvement?’ Christine Blower, general secretary . of the National Union of Teachers, said: ‘Michael Gove’s continual . criticism of GCSEs as a “dumbed down” examination is not only incorrect . but also very offensive to those pupils and teachers who achieve great . results every year. ‘Getting . rid of GCSEs and replacing them with the old O-level and CSE . qualifications could easily lower aspirations and exacerbate . inequalities in society.’ Chris . Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: ‘There is no evidence . that the current system is broken, that examinations are getting easier . or that our qualifications are trailing behind the best in the world. Michael Gove’s arrogance is breathtaking.’","Education secretary recommends simple CSE exam for less able pupils .

They were then shown an enormous number of pictures of the organs - concluding with a test where they had to judge between two women, only seeing their breasts and behinds. The volunteers' eyes were tracked as they 'judged' the women. We found that the first and last fixations were systematically directed towards the self-reported preferred trait,' said the researchers. 'We found that that Argentinean males tended to define themselves as favoring breasts or buttocks but rarely thinking that these traits contributed equally to their choice - but the distribution was biased towards buttocks,' said the researchers.

An earlier - and very thorough study - by UCL academics concluded that the volunteers (114 British students) preferred small breasts. ‘The stimuli consisted of nine nude female silhouettes, prepared … in such a manner that the size of breasts and buttocks could be varied systematically,’ say the researchers. ‘The participants in this study showed a preference for small breast size, although buttocks size did not appear to alter ratings of attractiveness.

The daily pill, that could soon be approved by the FDA for preventing HIV in high-risk patients . A pill to prevent HIV could soon be available to the public after a panel of US federal advisers voted to endorse its approval yesterday. An approval would be a major breakthrough in the 30-year campaign against the AIDS epidemic. Truvada is currently used to treat the virus, but tests have shown it to be safe and effective in healthy people for preventing it. The Food and Drug Administration concluded that taking the pill daily could spare patients 'infection with a serious and life-threatening illness that requires lifelong treatment'. Yesterday a panel of FDA advisers voted to recommend that Truvada, which was created by Gilead Sciences, should be approved as a preventative treatment for people who are at high risk of contracting HIV through sexual intercourse. The FDA is not required to follow the advice of its panels, but it usually does. An estimated 1.2 million Americans have HIV, which attacks the immune system and, unless treated with antiviral drugs, develops into AIDS, a fatal condition in which the body cannot fight off infections. If Truvada is approved, it would be a key breakthrough in the 30-year fight against AIDS. There have been no other drugs proven to prevent HIV and a vaccine is believed to be decades away. However, while the panel of FDA advisers backed the pill, concerns were raised during yesterday's meeting over whether the wide availability of the drug would . discourage safe sex and would, in fact, increase the incidence of HIV. The panel also questioned Truvada's effectiveness in women. Studies have shown that when used by women the rates of protection were lower. Gilead Sciences Inc, based in California, has marketed Truvada since 2004 as a treatment for people who are infected with the virus. The medication is a combination of two older HIV drugs, Emtriva and Viread. Doctors usually prescribe the medications as part of a drug cocktail that makes it harder for the virus to reproduce. Patients with low viral levels have reduced symptoms and are far less likely to develop AIDS. Researchers first reported that Truvada could prevent people from contracting HIV in 2010. A three-year study found that daily . doses cut the risk of infection in healthy gay and bisexual men by 44 . percent, when accompanied by condoms and counseling. The drug can help prevent a person becoming infected with HIV . A separate study found that Truvada reduced infection by 75 percent in heterosexual couples in which one partner was infected with HIV and the other was not. Because Truvada is already on the market to manage HIV, some doctors already prescribe it as a preventive measure. But FDA approval would allow the drugmaker Gilead Sciences to formally market its drug for that use. FDA reviewers on Tuesday said that patients must be diligent about taking the pill every day if using it as a preventative measure. Adherence to the medication was less than perfect in clinical trials, and reviewers said that patients in the real world may forget to take their medication even more than those in clinical studies. Some patient advocacy groups say the drug is an important new option to prevent HIV, alongside condoms, counseling and other measures. Last month, advocacy group AIDS United and more than a dozen other groups sent a letter to the FDA, urging approval of Truvada. 'If we're going to reduce the more than 50,000 new HIV infections in this country each year, we need to increase the available options for people,' said Ronald Johnson, AIDS United's vice president. But support for FDA approval is not unanimous. Although the FDA is legally barred from considering cost when reviewing drugs, health care providers have raised concerns about Truvada's price tag: $900 a month, or just under $11,000 per year. Medicare and Medicaid, the nation's largest health insurance plans, generally cover drugs approved by the FDA, and analysts expect most large health insurers to follow suit. Additionally, some researchers say the prevention pill is not the chemical equivalent of condoms, which they say remain the best weapon against AIDS. They also worry about Truvada's mixed success rate in preventing infection among women. Last year, a study in women was stopped early after researchers found that women taking the drug were more likely to become infected than those taking placebo. Researchers speculated that women may require a higher dose of the drug to prevent infection. They also said the disappointing results may have resulted from women not taking the pills consistently. 'We know that if the person doesn't take the medication every day they will not be protected,' said Dr. Rodney Wright, director of HIV programs at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. 'So the concern is that there may not be adequate adherence to provide protection in the general population.'","Food and Drugs Administration panel voted to endorse the drug yesterday .

Google is backing a new social network that aims to combat terrorism and gang culture worldwide, it emerged last night. The Internet giant has confirmed it is funding the Against Violent Extremism (AVE) network for at least two years via its own think-tank, Google Ideas. The AVE project will link up former violent extremists with victims of terrorism, including Jo Berry, the daughter of Tory MP Anthony Berry who was killed when the IRA bombed a Brighton hotel in 1984. It will also tackle the problem of criminal gangs. Social network: The Against Violent Extremism project aims to combat terrorism and gang culture and is backed by Google. This map shows the location of network members around the world . The network was launched in New York yesterday at a presentation hosted by a consortium including Google Ideas and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. Sasha Havlicek, chief executive Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said: 'The goal is to create a global movement against extremism.' Swede Robert Orell, a former white supremacist who now works as director of anti-Nazi group Exit Sweden, said: 'It's important to network with people from all of the world.' He added: 'If you are trying to counter extremism but you are too close to the Government you are too close to what many extremist groups see as the enemy. 'Large corporations can be seen as the enemy too, but not to the same extent.' Google has previously come in for criticism from politicians in Britain and the U.S. for hosting extremist videos on its YouTube channel. This led to a clean-up operation last year in which Google claimed to have removed 135 videos following government request citing 'national security'. Ambitious: The AVE project will link up former violent extremists with victims of terrorism, including Jo Berry, the daughter of Tory MP Anthony Berry who was killed when the IRA bombed Brighton's Grand Hotel in 1984. She is pictured here with Patrick Magee, the IRA bomber responsible for her father's death, in 2004 . The Institute for Strategic Dialogue, whose chief executive Sasha Havlicek is pictured, and Google Ideas launched the network in New York yesterday . The driving force behind AVE is 'the belief that there are lessons to be learned between groups combating different forms of extremism, from Islamism to the white power movement', according to its website. AVE was set-up by Google Ideas following the Summit Against Violent Extremism in Dublin last year. Google Ideas was founded in order to 'explore the role that technology can play in tackling some of the toughest human challenges'. It is hoped that the AVE organisation will attract 1,000 members in the next two years. By this morning, it already counted 416 connections, including 49 'formers' and 18 survivors. A guide on how to run a charitable group, build a marketing campaign, use social networks, host a virtual meeting and build a website can be found on its website. Like other social networks, users can upload footage on AVE's YouTube channel to start discussions. A map shows where each member is located geographically, while there are privacy settings to control what information can be accessed by others. By late Wednesday, AVE already counted over 400 connections, including 44 ""formers"" and 18 survivors.","Internet giant confirms it is .

The parents of a child suffering from a deadly heart condition who were told not to worry have slammed medical staff who failed to properly diagnose their son. Angry Peter Green, 52, and Hayley Clarke, 33, said they repeatedly raised concerns over little Harry after their new-born baby continued to lose weight but were told by health visitors and a GP not to worry. In fact, the baby was suffering from a rare heart defect which had caused a narrowing of his aorta. Peter Green, 52, and Hayley Clarke, 33, said they repeatedly raised concerns over little Harry but were told by health visitors and a GP not to worry . And it was only when the child was two months old that doctors realised how serious his condition was, after he was referred to Ipswich Hospital in Suffolk. Harry was subsequently diagnosed with coarctation, which had caused his heart function to deteriorate rapidly since birth. The condition had also affected his liver and lungs and led to swelling in the left side of his heart. And in the most severe cases, such as Harry's, babies can develop serious complications as a result of coarctation, because not enough blood can get through to the rest of the body. Harry was diagnosed with coarctation and underwent a three-and-a-half hour procedure at London's Evelina Hospital . Medical staff who operated on baby Harry, pictured, told his parents their son was lucky to be alive . Within just 24 hours, Harry had a three-and-a-half hour heart operation at London's Evelina Hospital, during which specialists managed to reverse the defect. His parents, from Stowmarket, have said they believe their son would not have survived if it were not for this late intervention by health staff. Miss Clarke said: 'I am so angry. If they had done their jobs properly, we would not have gone through all this. 'Luckily, Harry is doing really well now. 'If it weren't for the doctors at Ipswich Hospital, I don't think he would be here with us today: they were fantastic.' Mr Green came forward after reading about the plight of 22-month-old Harry Robb. The infant was also rushed to Evelina Hospital after blundering medics had diagnosed his life-threatening condition as tonsillitis. Harry's father has said the couple have now made formal complaints to Suffolk County Council and Stowhealth, the GP practice where Harry was first assessed. Stowhealth medical practice, in Stowmarket, Suffolk (pictured left), where Harry's parents first sought treatment for their son's mystery illness after he was unable to put on any weight . The anxious couple noticed their little boy was struggling to feed and was not putting on weight soon after he was born on November 13 last year. At weekly weigh-ins with health visitors, Peter and Hayley repeated their worries - but they say they were told their son was completely fine. Miss Clarke, who also has a daughter, Hollie, seven, said: 'I am Harry's mum, I felt there was something wrong but no one would listen to me. 'Whenever we queried anything we got the same response from the health visitors: 'Don't worry, he will put on weight' - but he never did.' Harry still only weighed 7lbs 9oz at seven weeks old - still shy of his birth weight of 7lbs 12oz. It was only following a regular weigh-in at two months old that health visitor Kate Dewsbury urged Peter and Hayley to take Harry to their GP immediately. Evelina Children's Hospital in London, where Harry subsequently underwent a procedure which saved his life . Mr Green said: 'He (the GP) said he could refer Harry to the hospital if we liked for peace of mind (and) for general assessment. 'So we left reassured and just waited to see when we could get an appointment. Days later, however, health worker Ms Dewsbury visited Harry at home. 'She immediately asked me if I could drive and said Harry needed to be taken to the hospital straight away,' said Miss Clarke. 'It was such a shock - all of a sudden it seemed there was something really wrong.' After attending the hospital appointment on January 5, the couple were told their son had a serious heart condition. Doctors arranged for Harry to be transferred to Evelina Hospital, where he was operated on the following day. Harry underwent a three-and-a-half hour procedure, during which he was put on an emergency heart bypass. 'When the specialist team from the Evelina came to intensive care to collect Harry they told us they were amazed he was still alive,' said his father, Mr Green, a mortgage broker . 'They said we were lucky he hadn't collapsed by that stage.' After two weeks at the hospital, in intensive care and on the cardiac ward, Harry was transferred back to Ipswich Hospital before being allowed home. 'Those weeks were the worst of our lives, worrying and waiting,' said Mr Green. Dr Baber Yusaf, senior partner at GP practice StowHealth said: 'We sympathise with the family at this difficult time. 'The whole team at StowHealth always strive to do the best we can.'","Peter Green, 52, and Hayley Clarke, 33, raised repeated concerns after their son Harry weighed less at seven weeks old than when he was born .

Crews battled to contain a massive New Mexico wildfire on Friday that has torched a dozen homes, the largest of several blazes that have consumed more than 200 square miles (520 square km) of rugged land in half-a-dozen U.S. states in recent days. Wildfires in sparsely-populated stretches of Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico and California have forced the evacuation of several small towns and torched miles of forest, brush and grass since mid-month. The fires have taken hold in tinder-dry late-spring conditions in mostly remote tracts of the United States, and have been fanned by gusting winds of up to 50 mph. Smoke rises into the air from a large forest fire which has consumed a total of 82,252 acres as seen in this U.S. Forest Service handout photo taken in Gila National Forest, New Mexico . The fire in New Mexico burned early Saturday through remote and rugged terrain around the Gila Wilderness and has grown to 85,000 acres (34,400 hectares) or more than 130 square miles (338 square kilometers). The heavy smoke apparently disoriented six hikers Friday, prompting the New Mexico National Guard to carry out a rescue. Col. Michael Montoya said one of the hikers had an injured knee and had to be taken to safety by ambulance. The others were able to walk to a secure area. More than 500 firefighters are battling the blaze that resulted from the merger earlier this week of two lightning-sparked fires.

Crews battled to contain a massive New Mexico wildfire on Friday that torched a dozen homes, the largest of several blazes that have consumed more than 200 square miles of rugged land in half-a-dozen U.S. states in recent days . Fire officials say nearly all of the growth has come in recent days due to relentless winds. The blaze has destroyed 12 cabins and seven small outbuildings, and the privately owned ghost town of Mogollon was placed under a voluntary evacuation order. The strong winds pushed ash from the blaze 35 to 40 miles (56 to 64 kilometers) away, while smoke from the giant fire spread across the state and into Arizona.

The haze blocked views of the Sandia Mountains in Albuquerque, and a smell of smoke permeated the air throughout northern New Mexico. And in Arizona, nearly 1,000 firefighters using aircraft and hand tools made strides toward containing the Grand Canyon state's largest and most dangerous blaze, the so-called Gladiator Fire. That fire, which has torched more than 25 square miles (65 square km) of ponderosa pine and brush about 40 miles north of Phoenix, reached 35-percent containment on Friday.

Across the country in Michigan, two wildfires sparked by lightning strikes burned in forests and marshes of the sparsely populated Northern Peninsula, which is stuck in an extended dry spell, authorities said. The larger of the two, the Duck Lake Fire has burned about 21,000 acres to the Lake Superior coastline.

There was no containment, as gusty winds had shifted to westerly breezes, threatening the Pike Lake area where there is a resort. Health officials as far away as Albuquerque and Santa Fe issued alerts for the Memorial Day holiday weekend, advising people to limit outdoor activities and keep windows closed.

Two female college students who disappeared 900 miles and 12 months apart may have been abducted by the same man, police feared. Investigators in Bloomington, Indiana said they had contacted authorities in Lafayette, Louisiana after they noticed similar traits in the young women's disappearances. Michaela 'Mickey' Shunick, 22, who studies at the University of Louisiana was last seen in the early hours of May 19, when she left a friend's house in Lafayette to cycle home. Lauren Spierer, 20, who is a student at Indiana State has been missing since June 3, 2011, after a night out with friends in downtown Bloomington. Connection? Police departments in two states were working together to see if the disappearance of Mickey Shunick (left) in Louisiana and Lauren Spierer in Indiana were related . Both women are blonde and petite, and security footage from around the time of both women's disappearance showed white pick-up trucks in the area. Investigators later said that the Indiana truck wasn't linked to the disappearance of Miss Spierer, originally from Greenburgh, New York. The bicycle of Miss Shunick was discovered under a bridge on Sunday more than a week after she disappeared. Fishermen found the 22-year-old's bike at Whiskey Bay on the Atchafalaya River, Louisiana. Her family were brought to the scene by police and confirmed it was her black and gold Schwinn. The bike's condition was not released and authorities began searching the river by boat and with divers. States apart: Police departments in Louisiana and Indiana have come together to work on the similar cases of the missing girls . Her mother Nancy Rowe said she believed a vehicle may have hit her daughter while she was cycling home. Mrs Rowe told USA Today: 'We really think that somebody had an accident. What they need to do is go to some truck stop, a public place... Drop her and run. Don't hurt her. A mistake is a mistake.' Two days prior to her bike being found, police revealed surveillance footage of the student riding her bike. Two videos show the University of Louisiana student on St John Street and St Landry Street in Lafayette. In both videos a white four-door, pick-up truck is seen to pass by after Miss Schunick from 1.47am and 1.48am. Visible in the top right of the video grab is missing student Micahela 'Mickey' Shunick riding her bike home after the last reported time she was seen by friends on Saturday May 19 . The white pick up van appears in one of the surveillance cameras footage driving by where Michaela 'Mickey' Shunick had just passed . Lauren Spierer, a sophomore who is studying fashion merchandising, was last seen walking home barefoot with a male friend from a sports bar and party on June 3 last year. Surveillance camera footage from an alley between the two students' apartment buildings showed them walking toward the male student's building about 3am. Spierer's keys were later found in the alley, but the petite blonde has not been seen since. No arrests have been made in the case. However, police have spoken with several persons of interest - including the male friends she was out with. Last seen: Video surveillance shows Lauren Spierer leaving her dorm last June - the last time she was seen . Last month, police were given a possible lead in what happened to the young woman. The Bloomington Police Department in Indiana believed that a man charged in the deaths of a 75-year-old family friend and a 44-year-old hairdresser could also be connected to Spierer’s disappearance. Lead? William Gibson has been charged in the murders of two women. Police are looking into a possible link between him and Lauren Spierer . The remains of a 35-year-old woman were also discovered in William ‘Clyde’ Gibson’s backyard. While Bloomington police said there was no concrete connection between Miss Spierer and Gibson, 54, they added that they are looking into the matter. Last month, Miss Spierer's mother has spoken about her fears as the one-year anniversary of her daughter's disappearance approaches. When asked if she thought that her daughter was alive, Mrs Spierer said: 'We always hope that there's a possibility... but I just don't know.' Her husband Robert added: 'We try to be realistic... We know that if she had the chance to reach out to us, she would have done it.' In the case of Miss Shunick, investigators had found no cell phone or purse of the missing woman after she left her friend Brettly Wilson's house. And as investigators expanded their search to include a $25,000 reward for information, some people in the area began to wonder whether she had been abducted.","Mickey Shunick, 22, was last seen cycling home in early hours of May 19 .

"By . Arthur Martin . UPDATED: . 02:53 EST, 27 February 2012 . Addicted to pregnancy: Surrogate mother Jill Hawkins is expecting twins, her ninth and tenth babies, three weeks before she turns 48 . After serious complications while expecting her eighth child, Jill Hawkins vowed to stop being a  surrogate mother. But her addiction to pregnancy proved too strong to resist. Miss Hawkins is due to give birth to twins – her ninth and tenth surrogate babies – three weeks before her 48th birthday. And she is not planning to stop there. Ignoring the potentially life-threatening health risks, the legal secretary is determined to squeeze in two more pregnancies before she reaches 50. During her previous pregnancy  in 2010 Miss Hawkins, who is single and has no children of  her own, spent most of the year on sick leave, confined to bed  for days at a time with nausea and headaches. After the baby, a boy, was induced, Miss Hawkins promised her worried family that she would call time on her career as a surrogate mother. But yesterday she spoke of her pride at the prospect of taking her total of babies into double figures. At the two-bedroom flat in Brighton which she shares with two cats, she said: ‘My parents were concerned  during the last pregnancy because it could have been life-threatening. ‘But I have forgotten about the terrible bits. ‘I just decided to go for it again. I find being pregnant very fulfilling. ‘I’m a naturally giving person and to be able to give babies away is what I do. ‘I was absolutely ecstatic when I found out I was pregnant with twins. It was like being pregnant for the first time again.’ Miss Hawkins’s first seven babies were conceived using her own eggs and the fathers’ sperm via artificial insemination. However, she is no longer able to become pregnant naturally and uses IVF. She is 14 weeks pregnant with twins from frozen embryos produced by a 42-year-old teacher and his 40-year-old wife from the Home Counties. The couple have a nine-year-old daughter who was born naturally, but have been unable to have any more children because the woman’s body has rejected all subsequent embryos which have been conceived. Miss Hawkins said she picked the couple because they were attractive and the husband looked like Kevin Costner. She went to hospital for a 13-week scan which showed both embryos were healthy. Number one and two: Lucy (left), who was born in August 1992, and Bertie (right), born two years later . Number three and four: Jamie (left), came into this world in February 1998, and David (right) in October 2001 . However, she is already suffering from the same symptoms which blighted her previous pregnancy. ‘I get tired very quickly,’ she said. ‘I have to do everything in short bursts and this time the headaches started at seven weeks. ‘I have a permanent pain in my head. I could take painkillers, but I don’t bother in case it puts the twins at risk.’ Miss Hawkins will find out the sex of the babies in April. They are due in mid-August. When she had her first baby for a couple, she lied to her bosses about the pregnancy. She invented a boyfriend and then claimed the baby had  died, causing her colleagues to send her sympathy cards and flowers. Number five and six: November 2002 saw the arrival of Sam (left), while Alexandra (right) came in August 2004 . Number seven and eight: Isabella (left) was born in November 2006 and Oliver (right) in August 2010 . And a year after she became a surrogate mother for the third time, Miss Hawkins was diagnosed with depression. At one point in 2004, she felt so miserable that she attempted suicide by overdosing on anti-depressants. But she insists that her depression was caused by events during her childhood and her battle to lose weight rather than the mental strain of carrying babies that are given away. Miss Hawkins, who is paid around £12,000 in ‘expenses’ for each pregnancy, says she has never been in love. Next in line: This scan shows one of the twins from frozen embryos produced by a 42-year-old teacher and his 40-year-old wife . After her seventh surrogacy she planned to join a dating agency, but then she agreed  to be a surrogate mother  again instead. She added: ‘I don’t just decide to get pregnant on a whim. I think long and hard about it. ‘I never want to keep them. I am not maternal and very selfish. Not many woman can give babies away. It’s very emotional giving birth. ‘The one thing you are screaming to do is to hold that baby. ‘It is an overwhelming feeling and you have to be strong to counter that. ‘People think I’m mad, but  my friends are not surprised  any more.’ Miss Hawkins is the most  prolific surrogate mother living in Britain. Carole Horlock, from Stevenage in Hertfordshire, who has given birth to 12 surrogate babies, moved to France four years ago.",But Jill Hawkins isn't stopping there... she wants two more pregnancies before turning 50 .

A four-week old baby girl has become the youngest Briton to receive a life-saving cardiac operation, after her heart swelled to twice its normal size within days of her birth. Phoebe Whittle was born with a congenital defect which gave her tiny heart only a third of the oxygen it needed to work. As a result, Phoebe’s heart ballooned to twice its size - swelling from the size of a walnut to the size of an orange. But Phoebe, who was dubbed . ‘Braveheart’ by her parents Charlotte, 27 and Carl, 32, made an amazing recovery following . groundbreaking surgery at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital. Recovery: Phoebe a week after her life-saving surgery (left) and now with her mother Charlotte (right) Mrs Whittle said: 'It’s horrible to think the pain she was going through. She looked healthy on the outside for those first few weeks but inside she was so poorly. 'But she’s meant to be here and it’s incredible the recovery she’s made. She was home within ten days and it can take babies up to four weeks to be ready to come home. 'She’s tiny for her age but we’re all just so glad she’s here.' She overcame a bout of pneumonia when she was just a week old but her family from Aspull, Lancashire, were left fearing for her health once again on Mother’s Day this year. Scans at Royal Bolton Hospital raised concerns over her heart and she was rushed to Alder Hey, in Liverpool, in a critical condition on March 19. She was diagnosed ALCAPA, . Anomalous Left Coronary Artery from the Pulmonary Artery, that meant the . artery to her heart muscle was connected incorrectly, starving it of . oxygen. Within hours doctors confirmed a high risk life-saving five hour operation, called a Coroary Artery Bypass Graft, was needed to save Phoebe’s life. Left untreated, a massive 90 per cent of children born with the ALCAPA defect do not live to see their first birthdays. Phoebe two days after surgery at Alder Hey hospital. Doctors were amazed at how quickly she recovered . Charlotte said: 'I felt . like I was a bit of a fraud taking her back to hospital after her . pneumonia but one of the nurses noticed she was starting to go blue. 'At . the time I don’t think I understood the enormity of the nurse taking . that blood test. It was her quick thinking that saved her life and got . her to Alder Hey. 'We were told her condition was life threatening and that surgery would be needed to save her life. 'If they hadn’t checked the blood we could have taken her home and just found her dead one morning. 'I . can’t look at photos of Phoebe in those first few weeks, its just too . upsetting. She just couldn’t breathe and there was no way she could tell . us.' The condition affects around one in 20,000 newborns and is often not detected until weeks or months after birth. Doctors took Phoebe straight into theatre for heart surgery and prepared her parents for a long and difficult recovery. After spending three days in intensive care and a week in the cardiac ward, Phoebe was able to go home with her parents and 19-month-old brother Louis. Relief: Phoebe is held by her mother Charlotte a week after the operation to fix her heart defect . The timely surgery should now see Phoebe live a normal life with regular check-ups and medication to help regulate her heartbeat. Charlotte praised staff at the Bolton hospital for the checks on her heart that ultimately saved her and said she now looks back on the days of Phoebe’s surgery as a bad dream. She said: 'It’s amazing to look at her now, I thought we had lost her. They prepared us for the worst and said it would be horrific for months afterwards but then she recovered so quickly. 'It’s so emotional to look back on now. At the time I held it together but I’ve been worse since, constantly checking her breathing and that she’s okay. 'It’s scary to think what could have happened because she did nearly die. Even though she made such a good recovery, she has still has a way to go to be the size she should be for her age. 'We’ve still got a long road to go but we know what we’re dealing with now.'Dr Rob Johnson Consultant Paediatric Cardiologist at Alder Hey Hospital explained how the condition can often be diagnosed as just a cold. He said: 'She is the youngest we’ve operated on and was lucky in some ways because she was diagnosed at half the age some children are. 'Often, like Phoebe’s case of pneumonia, the condition is often diagnosed as just a heavy cold so ALCAPA can take several heart scans to detect. 'It’s quite a subtle condition to pick up even when you’re dealing with a specialist centre like you are here, it can be difficult to pin down. 'The ultrasound tests we did at Alder Hey meant we were able to identify the abnormality. 'The blood vessels that supply blood to the heart are not connected so the heart beats at a lower pressure and is not fully saturated with oxygen. 'As a result the heart swells and enlarges and Phoebe’s heart was double the size it should have been. 'As in Phoebe’s case, it gets worse after birth but it is hard to detect as babies’ heartbeats are often fast. This means they can mask defects such as ALCAPA. Alder Hey hospital prepare Phoebe for the life-saving surgery. She spent three days in intensive care afterwards . 'The operation is still a fairly high risk procedure. The heart muscle is already sick at the start of the procedure and whilst the operation is usually a success, there is a period afterwards where the heart cannot cope on its own. 'That meant we had to provide mechanical assistance to help the heart still pump blood all round the body. 'Phoebe’s recovery time was remarkable, it’s usually three or four weeks before babies of this age are ready to go home. 'There’s only seven centres that do this procedure nationally and we were really pleased we could help. 'Phoebe hit the sweet spot of the NHS. The team in Bolton did a great job spotting it and we have great surgeons here who provided an excellent outcome for Phoebe and her family.' Charlotte and Carl organised a sponsored spinathon in July for the Ronald McDonald House at Alder Hey, a purpose built facility that allows parents to stay on site whilst children undergo operations. Charlotte said: 'Had this facility not been available we would have been sleeping on chairs at Phoebe’s bedside. 'The house allows families to be two minutes away from their sick child giving a little peace of mind at such a horrendous time. 'It also means that your other children have somewhere to stay and play so you don’t have the added feelings of being torn between your sick andhealthy children.'

Raymond and Thomas Highers, now 46, were found guilty of killing elderly marijuana dealer Robert Karey, 65, at his Detroit home in 1987. They are now awaiting a new trial, after a chance Facebook encounter uncovered new testimony. Last night they were released on bond and were greeted by a cheering crowd as they walked out the William Dickerson Detention Facility in Detroit. Scroll down for video . Freed on bond: Raymond Highers and his brother Thomas walk out of Wayne County Dickerson facility . Celebrating: Michael and Scott Highers hug their brother Thomas after the release . 'It's kind of overwhelming, but it's a great day,' said Raymond Highers, reported Detroit Free Press. 'Thank God for this day.' They are not completely free as they are now awaiting the possibility of a second trial in a killing that happened in 1987. Two weeks ago Wayne County Circuit Judge Lawrence Talon threw out the convictions and ordered a new trial after a 2009 Facebook post prompted new witnesses to come forward. Conditions: Each were granted a $10,000 bond but required to post only 10 percent to be released . A new trial was granted after a Facebook post by a former resident of the neighborhood where the brothers had lived led to the discovery of new witnesses which cast doubt on their guilt. Among the findings, one new witness said they saw Mr Karey being shot by two black men, but the brothers, who are 11 months apart, are white. Prosecutors argued that the new evidence was not credible and suggested there was a conspiracy to free the brothers, who have always maintained they were not guilty in the killing. Awaiting decision: Raymond Highers , left, and brother Thomas Highers appear before at Wayne County Circuit Court in Detroit yesterday .

Two witnesses, a psychologist and their former warden all said they did not think the brothers posed a threat to the community . Prosecutors argued against the low bond, but Wayne County Circuit Judge Lawrence Talon said he didn't believe the brothers were a threat to the community. Judge Talon requested a recommendation from prison officials on their behaviour behind bars, before making his decision.

Both brothers stood before the judge and . spoke passionately in brief statements, assuring Talon they know the . risks that face them and how hard they will work to reintegrate with . society. 'The question is, are they the same people they were 25 years ago or not? And the court doesn't believe that they are,' Talon said according to the newspaper. 'So, I am going to grant a bond.' Rules of their bond, include prohibitions on drugs and alcohol, addiction-recovery counseling and random urinalysis tests. Outside court the brothers aunt said they would enjoy 'spaghetti and meatballs, two beautiful beds ... and family' on their first evening free.

The school photograph is meant to be a cherished memento which lets families remember their child's formative years. But when this class of second grade elementary school students in Florida look at their class picture, they are unlikely to enjoy the memories quite so much. Their group picture became an 'offensive and degrading' photograph when one of the pupil's heads was bizarrely replaced with a brown cartoon face. Badly taken: The second grade class photo from Sawgrass Elementary (other pupils obscured) shows a boy on the front row whose identity is covered by a bizarre brown smiley face . The unidentified pupil at Sawgrass Elementary School in Broward County, Florida, was subjected to the 'humiliating' Photoshop treatment instead of being removed from the picture. Photographer David Claussen's company Broward County Pictures were commissioned to take the school picture, but were told shortly after by the local PTA that two children had to be removed from the image as their parents had not signed a consent form. Mr Claussen told Florida's Local 10 News that he was able to remove one child completely from the picture, but could not do so with the other student as he was sat on the front row. The Parent Teacher's Association instead amazingly advised him to obscure the child's identity by placing a brown 'smiley face' over his head. Officials at Sawgrass Elementary's PTA would not confirm who was to blame for the photographic blunder . The resulting image has been branded 'offensive' and 'degrading', with one parent at the school telling Local 10 the boy would have felt 'humiliated' by the picture. School officials would not confirm whether the pupil still attended Sawgrass Elementary. A . district spokeswoman in Broward County told Local 10 the picture was an . 'oversight', but would not confirm who was to blame for the image. Claussen . and school officials said incidents do occasionally occur when children . have to be removed from pictures after they are taken when it . transpires their parents have not signed consent forms. Mr . Claussen, who has taken school pictures for 37 years, said despite the . bizarre alteration to the image, he received 14 orders for the photo.

PTA for Sawgrass Elementary said in a statement: 'The PTA notified . photographer after finding out that a child didn't have a signed media . release form from the parent.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 15:44 EST, 27 October 2011 . Hero: Douglas Bader hoists one of his artificial legs into the cockpit before another flight . It was a disaster that changed his life and might have crushed the spirit of a lesser man. When Douglas Bader crashed his plane while performing aerobatic stunts, he suffered horrendous injuries that cost him his legs. But despite the devastating impact it would have on his flying and his passion for rugby and boxing, there was not a trace of self-pity in the entry Bader made in his logbook for the events of that fateful day near Reading on December 14, 1931. With stoic understatement the 21-year-old pilot simply wrote: ‘X country – Reading. Crashed slow-rolling near ground. Bad show.’ Bader . never let the consequences of his ‘bad show’ get the better of him and . went on to become a Second World War flying hero despite his artificial . legs. The log containing his assessment of the crash is being put up for auction for the first time and is expected to fetch £30,000. It . also reveals how he struggled to learn to fly after joining the RAF in . 1928 and was rebuked by his instructor for his ‘poor performance’ in . taking too long on solo practice flights. Original . transcripts detailing an extraordinary operation by the RAF and the . Germans to supply Bader with a new wooden leg after he was taken . prisoner in 1941 are also being auctioned. Bader, by now a wing commander, lost his right artificial leg when he bailed out of his Spitfire over Nazi-occupied northern France. The Battle of Britain legend was so respected by the Germans that when they announced his capture in a radio broadcast they also asked Britain for a replacement leg to be dropped. A handwritten account by the RAF officer in charge of the drop describes how the leg was delivered into France by parachute after the Germans guaranteed the aircraft safe conduct. Stoic: Despite detailing an accident which saw him lose both legs, Bader remained remarkably understated in describing it as a 'bad show' Criticism: In one log, tells how Bader was rebuked for a 'poor performance' when he took too long in the air . Flight Lieutenant H.R. Spencer wrote: ‘The new leg was dropped by Blenheim of 18 Squadron just west of St Omer. The enemy fired at the descending package but did not damage it.’ The Germans confirmed its safe arrival via another broadcast. It is the first time this document or the logbook have come on to the open market. The teleprinter message flashing news of the German radio broadcast that announced Bader was alive and had been captured is also being sold. Insight: The detailed, handwritten notes in Bader's flying logbook describe the moment he lost both his legs as a 'bad show' The logbook covers the start of his flying career in 1928 through to the near-fatal crash in 1931. It was acquired from Bader’s widow Joan by aviation enthusiast Ron Mitchell in 1990. Mr Mitchell, 65, has loaned it to the RAF Museum in Hendon, North London, several times but has now decided to sell it. The retired engineer from Norwich said: ‘It has sat in my safe for so long now I felt it really ought to be put out there to be seen again.’ Despite having no legs Bader was credited with more than 20 aerial victories in the Second World War and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. As a prisoner of war he made a number of attempts to escape and was eventually sent to Colditz where he remained until it was liberated in April 1945. Respected: A transcript of a message sent by the Germans tells how they asked for Britain to send over an artificial leg for the captured Captain Bader . Rare: The auction of the logbook will be the first time it has ever come on to the open market . His story was told in the 1956 film Reach for the Sky starring Kenneth More, based on the biography of the same name by Paul Brickhill. After the war Bader worked in the oil industry. He also campaigned for the disabled, for which he was knighted in 1976, and continued to fly until ill health forced him to stop in 1979. He died in 1982, aged 72. The items are being sold by Dominic Winter Book Auctions of Cirencester, Gloucestershire, on November 16.","Hero RAF pilot remained remarkably stoic even after losing legs .

Scroll down to watch another inventive marriage proposal . All carrot and no stick: Pang Kun and his 48 friends wear their carrot costumes before he proposes to his girlfriend . Pang peels off his costume and the crowd chat 'marry him, marry him' Saturday August 6 was the Chinese version of Valentine's Day, and so Pang put some special thought and attention in to planning the proposal. In all, the idea took three weeks to perfect and execute, and cost him over £9,300. Pang, who had installed a microphone into his costume, began jigging and then caused shoppers - including his girlfriend - to become bemused by recounting the couple's first date, six months previous. Cards on the table: The wannabe groom hands his girl a message and grabs the microphone to propose . 'Six months ago I met you,' he said as he danced. 'I still . remember your shyness on our first date, my longing for the next date, . and my excitement the first time I held your hand at the movie theatre.' And when he began peeling off his costume the crowd chanted to his girlfriend 'marry him, marry him', which she promised to do so. His proposal has led him to become an Internet sensation, and online users have nicknamed him 'carrot boy', which has temporarily become one of the most searched terms in China. She does!

In recent years people have become more inventive about marriage proposals and here is a selection of the more eye-catching. In November 2007 an American used computer game Halo to pop the question. Moviesign (his username) customised a map in the game, and set up what his girlfriend of over two years believed was going to be a two-on-two match with his friends. After they started the game, Moviesign led Furtive Penguin (here name) to a location where he claimed he'd left an energy sword. Instead it was a sign which asked: 'Will you marry me?' Mateo Martinez asked his girlfriend to marry him at 20,000 feet - just as the pair were about to sky dive.

And an American named Josh asked his girlfriend to marry him on a roof top, where they were having drinks with their friends. He asks someone to throw him the ring, it falls and, standing on the ledge, so does he, having said: 'Will you marry ...' His girlfriend rushes over to the edge panicked, only to see that he has fallen several storeys and landed on a cushioned safety mat - and is accompanied by a huge sign which reads: 'Me?'","The Chinese man took three weeks and £9,300 on the proposal ."

The Chautauqua County Sheriff's Office said the crash occurred around 7:15 Sunday in the rural town of Sherman, near the Pennsylvania border in New York's southwest corner. As a patrol car arrived at Clymer Hill Road, the Post-Journal reported that one of the Amish buggies suddenly changed lanes, colliding with the police vehicle. The impact caused the buggy to flip onto its side, causing minor injuries to Marvin Byler, 19, one of the people riding in it. He was arrested, along with Marty Troyer, 20, Marianne Troyer, 18, and Leroy Troyer, 20. Marianne was also riding in the buggy that flipped, but was unhurt, Newscore reported.

According to Buffalo News, Marty was also charged with unlawfully dealing with a child, as he appeared to be the host of the rural get-together.

Driving a buggy has proved perilous for many Amish whether or not alcohol has played a factor, as they face off against large SUVs, trucks, and inattentive drivers. Last July, an Amish teen in Wango, New York led police on a slow-speed chase when they spotted him driving with an open beer container. In 2009, a man was arrested in Paradise, Pennsylvania, for getting behind the reins after a few too many. He was found slumped over and asleep in his buggy with a blood-alcohol level of .18 per cent.","Police were on scene investigating reports of underage drinking party .

Leila Sabra fought an eight-month battle for custody of five-year-old daughter A'ishah after she was taken in 2009. The 35-year-old, from Whitefield, Greater Manchester, moved to Cairo and was reunited with the youngster after her father Saber Mesbah Sabra was arrested.

She has now returned to the UK in a bid to get help from the Government after living in Cairo since 2009. A'ishah is thought to be at her father's home in the mountain village of Khafr-el-Sheikh. Mrs Sabra told the Manchester Evening News that the 'chaos' in Egypt following revolution had prevented her getting support from the country's police and courts.

She said: 'I cannot believe this has happened again, I am terrified something will happen to A'ishah as Egypt is not a safe place at the moment.'

Evidence that could hold the key to . the mystery of the spy found dead in a padlocked sports bag might have been . wiped from his computers before they were given to police, it has been claimed. MI6 spy Gareth Williams's family fear . British agents filtered out potential clues when they wiped data to conceal details of . his classified work after his untimely death. According to the pre-inquest hearing held last . week, Scotland Yard's Counter Terrorism Command examined all of Mr . Williams's computers before handing them to murder detectives.

'I hope a witness from SO15 can attend and explain,' she added, according to the Daily Mirror. She confirmed that 'all computers, IT and phones were examined first by SO15' before they were handed over to the murder squad. The discovery of Mr Williams's body in . his flat near the Secret Service headquarters in London sparked a . 20-month police inquiry that has so far drawn a blank. Mr Williams's family last week said they believe their son may have been killed by a secret agent. Their barrister suggested a sinister cover-up had left them with no way of knowing how and Mr Williams died. Security experts have agreed that the . death had all the hallmarks of a professional killing, suggesting that a . Russian or Iranian hit squad may have been involved. It emerged at the inquest last week that the flat may have been swept clean of evidence, with no fingerprints or DNA anywhere. It was also revealed that – far from . being a back-office worker – Mr Williams had just completed training for . deployment on operations. Other revelations included: . Suspicions: Relatives believe a third party was either present when Gareth Williams died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence, lawyer Anthony O'Toole said . The naked body of the super-fit . maths prodigy was found in a large padlocked North Face bag in the bath . of his Government-owned Pimlico flat in August 2010. The codebreaker from Anglesey, North . Wales, was said to have links to London's bondage and gay scene and it . had already been suggested a sex game, possibly with a colleague, may . have had a tragic end. But Westminster Coroner Dr Fiona . Wilcox has heard that his grieving family fear whoever is responsible has . expertly covered up the evidence. Their barrister Anthony O'Toole . rejected the conclusion of an internal MI6 inquiry that Mr Williams's . death 'had nothing to do with his work'. He said: 'There is a high probability . that some third party was in the flat when Gareth was placed in the bag. Evidentially there seems to be no trace of an unknown party in the . flat. 'Our impression is that the unknown third party was a member of some agency specialising in the dark arts or secret services. 'Or perhaps evidence has been removed from the scene post-mortem by experts in those arts.' Mr Williams, pictured riding his bike, was found dead inside a body bag similar to the one pictured, right . Mr Williams, an expert in cyber . defences, was nearing the end of a one-year secondment from the GCHQ . listening station to the headquarters of the Secret Intelligence . Service, or MI6, in Vauxhall, London. Shortly before his death he had . returned from a clandestine visit to Washington where he had worked . alongside U.S. agents in operations to counter infiltrations by Chinese . and Russian computer hackers. Mr Williams's body was discovered by . police at his flat on August 23, 2010. He was found naked inside a . red North Face holdall, which was padlocked on the outside and placed . inside his bath. A wide-ranging and highly sensitive . police inquiry has left many questions unanswered over the circumstances . of his death, Dr Wilcox heard. Experts believe it would have been . 'difficult, if not impossible' for Mr Williams to lock himself in the . bag but can find no evidence of anyone else being present. His body was found curled in the . foetal position in the 140-litre black and red holdall with the keys to . the Yale travel padlock beneath him. Pathologists found no evidence of . injuries or that he attempted to fight his way out. It remains possible . that his dead body was put inside the bag. Dr Wilcox said that whether Mr . Williams was alive inside the bag and locked it himself 'was at the very . heart of this inquiry'. She may order officials to recreate how he . could have got inside it at the full inquest which is due to take place . next month. Experts have been unable to agree on . exactly how Mr Williams died, favouring asphyxiation or hypercapnia, a . catastrophic build-up of carbon dioxide in the blood. Their work was hampered by the heavily . decayed state of his body and his MI6 colleagues face questions over . why they did not raise the alarm earlier. Last images: Metropolitan Police released CCTV of his last known movements at Holland Park tube station . Questions: The family want to know why the alarm was not raised when Mr Williams failed to turn up to work and why it took his sister Ceri, pictured left at his funeral, to ring police to make them aware he was missing . It also emerged at the inquest that . Scotland Yard detectives spent almost 20 months pursuing a DNA trace on . his body that was left by a clumsy forensic scientist. The chief executive of LGC Forensics . will be hauled before the inquest to explain the astonishing blunder . which was discovered only last month ago. Red herring: It also emerged that a Mediterranean couple police wanted to speak to were irrelevant to Mr Williams's death . The inquest also heard that a . Mediterranean couple who called at Mr Williams's block had nothing to do . with the case. Detectives released e-fits of the couple and have now . traced them. They were looking for a friend's house. The inquest heard that Mr Williams's . family were unhappy about several aspects of the inquiry, including the . role of counter-terrorism officers who dealt with MI6 and GCHQ staff. They have raised questions about who ordered a second post-mortem . examination and what happened to Mr Williams's possessions held in a . work locker. The family also want to hear more . details about the nature of his work but MI6 representatives said . disclosing the information could endanger national security.

The U.S. government conducted a three-year investigation on John Soules Food Inc, a Tyler, Texas-based meat processing facility specialising in value-added fajita meat. They alleged that some beef tips that could not be frozen properly were sold to a third-party meat broker who agreed to sell the meat as pet food.

The divorcee who is on course to become France’s next first lady today suggested she will be a far more modest one than Carla Bruni. Valerie Trierweiler, 47, is the partner of Francois Hollande, the Socialist who is runaway favourite to replace Nicolas Sarkozy as President in less than two weeks’ time. If Hollande does win – and the latest polls put him an astonishing ten points ahead of Sarkozy – Ms Treierweiler will become the first Premier Dame in French history to be unmarried. Speaking out: Valerie Trierweiler, pictured, is on course to become France's next first lady and has suggested that she will be a more modest one than Carla Bruni. Miss Trierweiler is pictured leaving Francois Hollade's campaign headquarters yesterday . In an interview in which she discusses her likely new role, Ms Trierweiler suggests that she would remain in the shadows, saying: ‘I will stay among those accompanying. I will bend to protocol. But it will be for me to find my place. ‘First Lady is not something I’ve ever dreamed of because I’ve never imagined finding myself in this position. I’m beginning to ask myself about it but only for a short while. What I’m scared of is losing my liberty.’ Miss Bruni, the former supermodel and pop singer, has taken centre stage since becoming Mr Sarkozy’s third wife following a whirlwind romance of just 80 days in 2008. She has become renowned for keeping a near-empty official diary, ignoring many official functions, and even living in her own Paris town house or Riviera villa rather than at the Elysee Palace in Paris. Pointedly, Ms Trierweiler does not mention Miss Bruni by name in her interview in the latest edition of Femme Actualle magazine. But she praises the way Mr Sarkozy’s former wife, Cecilia Attias, introduced her three children to life at the Elysee Palace soon after becoming first lady in 2007. Different: Valerie Trierweiler, left, has said she would remain in the shadows if she becomes France's first lady. Miss Bruni, right, has taken centre stage since becoming Mr Sarkozy's third wife .

It’s up to them to decide, but I’ve got the feeling that they won’t want to.’ Miss Bruni, a one time champagne Socialist with a string of celebrity lovers including Mick Jagger behind her, has often been accused of marrying Mr Sarkozy simply because he was the President. But Ms Trierweiler, a magazine journalist, said of Mr Hollande: ‘When I’m by his side I’m simply his woman, with everything that implies, just like any woman in love. I tell him what I think, I advise him, but I particularly avoid discussing politics. United: Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande, centre, visits a factory today. If he wins the presidential election, his partner Ms Trierweiler suggests that she would remain in the shadows . Ambitious: Francois Hollande, is pictured at an election campaign rally today. He is the runaway favourite to replace Nicolas Sarkozy as President in less than two weeks' time . ‘I didn’t shy away from getting involved. I’ve always loved politics, meetings and the Left. And I adore listening to Francois. Of course, clapping the man I love while remaining a journalist was a problem for me. 'But not any longer. I raise my hands and clap him like a footballers’ wife! ‘I would like the French to think of me as the woman I really am, someone who is disinterested and simple. I am not with Francois because he became a candidate for the presidency, I love him for what he is, not for what he could be. ‘Francois trusts me completely, except when I Tweet! Some people would like to see me react less on social network, but everybody respects my freedom. I have character and nobody can restrain me.’ Mr Hollande, who has never been married, started seeing Ms Trierweiler following the collapse of his relationship to fellow Socialist Segolene Royal, with whom he has four grown-up children. Under pressure: This combination of pictures shows France's incumbent president Nicolas Sarkozy today. Miss Bruni has taken centre stage since becoming Mr Sarkozy's third wife following a whirlwind romance of just 80 days in 2008 . As far as her personal life with Mr Hollande is concerned, Ms Trierweiler says he is always leaving doors open, but who does the housework, shopping and ‘cooking – with lots of butter!’ Hollande won the first, 10 candidate round of the election by 28.6 per cent to 27.2 per cent for Sarkozy, and the two will now be involved in a head-to-head on Sunday week. An Ifop opinion poll published today showed Hollande on 55 per cent of the vote, 10 points ahead of Sarkozy.

"By . Rachel Quigley . PUBLISHED: . 14:34 EST, 25 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:18 EST, 26 April 2012 . Andrew Young told a court yesterday how John Edwards described his life with cancer-stricken wife Elizabeth as a 'living hell' and how she confiscated his car keys and cell phone after she found out about the affair with mistress Rielle Hunter. The prosecution finally had the opportunity to cross examine the defense's star witness on his third day on the stand, where they branded him a liar and exaggerator who was using Edwards to make money and use him as his 'ticket to the top'. They highlighted discrepancies in his book, subsequent TV interviews and before a grand jury and tried to portray the former aide as bitter against Edwards, asking him: 'You really hate him don't you?' Troubles: Andrew Young told the court yesterday that John Edwards described life with Elizabeth as a 'living hell' after she found out about the affair . During the grilling by attorney Abbe Lowell, Young admitted he called Elizabeth Edwards Ursula - after the evil sea witch from Disney's The Little Mermaid. The defense's cross examination of Andrew Young started yesterday . The defense team also highlighted inconsistencies and mistakes he had made in the book The Politician: An Insider's Account of John Edwards' Pursuit of the Presidency and the Scandal That Brought Him Down, according to ABC. Lowell asked him: 'Isn't it true that in each and every case you've lied? Isn't it fair you viewed Mr Edwards as . your ticket to the top and your only chance at prestige?' Young admitted he 'believed working for a . future president could lead to great things'. Using his earlier testimony, in which he admitted to discrepancies in his book because of lack of time and research, Lowell asked him if he corrected the paperback version which came out six months later and he said no. He also showed the jury the proposal for the tell-all book, in which he wrote that 'every word was provably true'. The intense cross examination will continue today as Edwards' defense team persist in going after Young's credibility as a witness. His wife Cheri, in the courtroom for the first time yesterday, will be the next witness to be called. When the former presidential candidate left the Greensboro court room yesterday, he told waiting reporters, 'Oh the sun is out in more ways than one,' obviously happy with how proceedings ended for the third day of the trial. Young also described yesterday how rapidly the relationship between the once-close friends crumbled around the same time Rielle Hunter gave birth to baby Frances Quinn. He admitted he had a sort of 'bromance' with the-then presidential candidate and that he loved him. When Lowell asked him: 'You fell in love with John Edwards?' he answered, 'We all did. A lot of people in the country did.' Family support: Former U.S. Senator John Edwards . arrives with his daughter Cate at the federal court house in Greensboro . today for the second day of his trial . Nickname: Andrew Young revealed to the court he called Elizabeth Andres, right, Ursula, after the evil sea witch in The Little Mermaid . Edwards' team went on to accuse his . once-devoted aide of wanting to be like Edwards, even getting the same . renovations in his house, and revealing the rest of the staff called him . 'the rose petal' and that his scathing nickname for Elizabeth was due to . jealousy. They painted him as a man who had his heart broken and became hell bent on getting revenge. 'He said he loved me and that he knew that I knew that he would never abandon me,' Young testified earlier yesterday. Lowell then asked him: 'You fell out of love with him?' to which he replied, 'I did, yes.' When asked if he hated him he said he had 'mixed feelings'. He also said the men became increasingly paranoid they were being followed and their phones tapped and began to turn on each other. The last time they spoke was on a . secluded road in Chapel Hill in August 2008 when Young threatened to go . public with the affair. He told the court Edwards reply to this was, . 'You can't hurt me Andrew, you can't hurt me.' Young has been involved in the saga . from the beginning, as he initially tried to cover up Edwards' involvement with Hunter by claiming paternity of the former senator's . love child because Edwards hoped to be named as vice-president to . then-presidential candidate Barack Obama. That meant the child's paternity . needed to remain a secret but Edwards promised Young he would come . forward once he dropped out of the 2008 race. Cover up: Andrew Young's wife Cheri appeared in court for the first time yesterday and is expected to be the next witness to be called . Key witness: On his second day on the stand, . Andrew Young, said Edwards assured him the money coming from wealthy . donors was legal . Fearing their phones were tapped, . they began meeting in hotels and isolated roads and start driving . evasively to avoid anyone who might be following them. They were aware . the National Enquirer - who broke the story about the affair - were hot . on their tail. John Edwards didn't want to claim paternity because he was hoping to be Obama's vice president . He told the court: 'I felt like I was . being taped, recorded, he was acting very oddly,' adding that both men . had broken out into a sweat. The once-loyal aide testified that he . had, by this stage, grown sick of the cover up and urged Edwards to . confess to the affair, otherwise he himself would make it public. 'He looked at me and said, you can’t hurt me Andrew, you can’t hurt me,' before running away from the car, Young testified. Because Edwards was close to being . named then presidential candidate Obama's vice president, the most . important job was to cover up the affair no matter what. Young, on the witness stand for the third day in the former presidential candidate's . criminal trial, said the former North Carolina senator stopped . returning his calls in January 2008, as Edwards was ending his White . House bid. The next month, Edwards' child, Frances Quinn Hunter, was born to his mistress Reille Hunter. The girl, now four, lives with her mother in Charlotte. Young, who initially claimed to be the father, testified that he had grown tired of living with Hunter and wondered why Edwards hadn't claimed paternity after the girl was born, as he had promised. He is a key witness in Edwards' criminal trial. The former senator is accused of conspiring to use secret payments from two wealthy donors to hide Hunter during his White House run. Edwards has pleaded not guilty to six counts related to campaign finance violations. Edwards has denied knowing about the money and his attorneys claim that Andrew Young and his wife, Cheri, siphoned off the bulk of it to pay for the construction of their $1.5 million house near Chapel Hill. Edwards' attorneys will get a chance to cross examine Young later on Wednesday, a day after Young said the candidate once called his mistress a 'crazy slut' who others wouldn't believe was having an affair with him. Young testified that he flew to Texas with his wife to meet with one of the wealthy donors, Fred Baron, with four demands. He wanted to know why Edwards hadn't claimed paternity, he wanted a face-to-face meeting with him, he wanted to know what his long-term plans were and he wanted to stop living with Hunter. Possible defence witness: Rielle Hunter, the . former mistress of John Edwards, enters the federal courthouse in . Raleigh, North Carolina, Thursday, August 6, 2009 with the pair's child . Frances Quinn Hunter . Baron arranged for Hunter to move out of a Santa Barbara, California, house she was sharing with the Youngs, and he set up the face-to-face meeting. But before that could happen, Edwards did eventually call Young and leave a voicemail. It was played in court: 'I miss talking to you Andrew. We'll see you pal.' At the meeting in a hotel room near Washington on June 18, 2008, Edwards had just given a speech for then-Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, and he was telling people that Obama would pick him for vice president, Young testified. Edwards and Young talked. 'He said he loved me and that he knew that I knew he would never abandon me,' Young testified. At one point, Young overheard Edwards talking to interior designer Bryan Huffman who prosecutors say was involved in funneling money to hide Hunter. 'You're a great American. The four of us are going to do great things for the country,' Young said quoting Edwards, who was apparently referring to himself, Huffman, Baron and Young. The meeting grew intense, and Edwards and Young started yelling at each other before Young left. Edwards is accused of directing Young to start giving money to Hunter in May 2007, after she threatened to go to the media and expose the affair. Edwards suggested asking elderly heiress Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, who had already given generously to the campaign. Motherly love: Edwards helps his mother Bobbie . Edwards as they leave the federal court house today where she supported . him in his trial . Prosecutors showed the jury checks from Mellon written to her interior designer, who would then endorse them and send them to Andrew and his wife, Cheri. Starting in June 2007, Mellon would eventually provide checks totaling $750,000. Without telling Mellon what the money would be used for beyond that it was a 'non-campaign' expense, Young said she offered to provide $1.2 million over time to help pay for the candidate's personal needs. Under federal law, donors are limited to giving a maximum of $2,300 per election cycle. This was Young's third day to take the stand. Yesterday he revealed that Edwards launched a verbal attack on Rielle Hunter when he found out she was pregnant, calling her a 'crazy slut'. Young told the court Edwards was 'very angry and concerned' when he found out about the baby in 2007 and said there was only a one-in-three chance the baby was his. He also told the court about the intricate system of check writing used to hide funds given to Edwards my millionaire Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, which he said 'felt and smelled wrong' even though he was assured it was all legal.","Elizabeth confiscated her husband's cell phone and car keys .

A fake bomb smuggled into the Olympic Park stadium has exposed massive security flaws after the dummy device got through two checkpoints. A site worker carrying the fake Semtex device was waved through by security staff as he carried it on the floor of his digger, only hours before the stadium officially opened. The revelation will raise security fears after the construction worker was asked to take the 'bomb' into the stadium by The Sun on Sunday. The Olympic Park stadium in Stratford was officially opened on Saturday for the upcoming London 2012 . A military band plays during the official opening of the Olympic Stadium. Just hours before the 'bomb' had been smuggled through . The construction worker left the site in his digger and returned with the package. Wired like a bomb with a timer, guards on the site failed to notice it. Once inside the park the man, whose identity has been protected, openly took photographs holding the package. He took it to the athletes' village and past the velodrome before posing with it for a photograph in front of the stadium. The construction worker, who has been on the site for several years, said he is only ever searched once in the morning. After that he is able to come and go from the grounds without being checked again. He said he became worried about the . lackadaisical approach towards security and decided to contact the . newspaper so something could be done about it. 'I can meet anyone on the outside without anyone knowing and bring anything inside without anyone checking. 'If I had terrorist connections I could be bringing in explosives, chemicals, anything at all,' he said to The Sun on Sunday. The 'bomb' was made for under £25 and included three sheets of plasticine to resemble plastic explosive, copper wiring, a mobile phone, a nine volt battery and an alarm clock. The pieces were all wired together, the clock was ticking and the components were all placed in a plastic container. The worker then put the 'bomb' on the floor of his digger after he'd left the site. On his return to the stadium it was in full view of guards on the floor. At the first checkpoint where cars are meant to be stopped and searched he was allowed to pass through. The worker said he was concerned about security and wanted to ensure the Games were safe . Locog said they would be tightening up security now that the stadium was officially opened . The digger was also waved through the second check point where security barriers were already raised. Here six security staff moved out of the way and continued their conversation as the digger carrying the bomb drove past. The man, along with other staff, was properly vetted before he was given the job. Tory MP and security expert Patrick Mercer said this was exactly the type of tactic used by the IRA in the past and added that he hoped some lessons had been learned from the exercise. Spokeswoman for the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, Helen Holman, said that security would automatically be tightened now that stadium was officially opened. 'Clearly a tupperware box containing batteries, a moblie phone and some loose wires would not pose a security threat on a construction site,' she said. 'However we will be looking into the allegations to ensure our security regimes are as robust as they need to be at this time. 'As you would expect our security increases significantly the closer we get to the Games. The Park and the Village will be searched and sealed before it is locked down for Games time,' she added. In January a number of dummy runs were . carried out by security staff who managed to smuggle at least one bomb . into the site at Stratford. It is believed the threat to the stadium is so severe the Army's explosive search dogs will be recalled from Afghanistan. Thousands of troops will also be called to assist police and private security firms to carry out searches on members of the public.","A site worker took the dummy device into the Stratford stadium after he noticed security flaws .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:29 EST, 2 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:35 EST, 3 April 2012 . Jailed: Former have-a-go hero Jacikas was convicted of murder in just one hour . A have-a-go hero who tackled a gun-wielding robber has been jailed for life for a brutal murder. Deivydas Jacikas, 21, was praised for his bravery after he was caught on camera stopping a fleeing jewel thief last February. But just eight months later Lithuanian immigrant Jacikas carried out a revenge attack on a grandfather-of-nine Henrikas Baranauskas, 56, who he claimed head-butted his father. Jacikas confronted father-of-eight Mr Baranauskas last October before beating him so savagely his victim sustained 14 fractured ribs and severe brain damage. Mr Baranauskas was so badly beaten that his family eventually had to make the agonising decision to switch off his life support machine. The attack of 'extreme violence' by Jacikas was in stark contrast to the scene in Peterborough city centre eight months previously, when the Lithuanian had risked his life tackling armed jewellery store raiders. The factory worker made national headlines after dramatic images showed him wrestling with a gun-toting robber, who eventually dropped his weapon and fled the scene. During the murder trial, prosecutors had made reference to the jewellery store robbery after which Jacikas was hailed a hero. Angela Rafferty, prosecuting, said: 'At the time you said you were told you might get a medal for what you had done. 'You said you felt like a hero because so many people told you that you were a hero. 'On October 1 did you feel like a hero?' Hailed a hero: Deivydas Jacikas was praised after being pictured confronting a gun-toting raider outside a jewellery store last February . Bravery: The Lithuanian was praised for 'trying to do the right thing' when he tackled the gun-toting raider . Jacikas simply replied: 'No'. After the dramatic incident last February, Jacikas had modestly told how he was just an 'ordinary man trying to do the right thing'. He told at the time how he thought 'I am dead' as he confronted the gunman before describing how residents in Cambridgeshire called him the 'hero of Peterborough'. Killing: A court heard former hero Jacikas used 'extreme violence and showed no mercy' during the attack last October . Speaking after the jewellery heist, he said: 'I have never acted so bravely before, I've never seen a gun, or caught a shoplifter, or anything like that. This is a first for me and it was very scary. 'But I would do the same again, of course.' Jacikas told the court during his murder trial he had been ‘very angry’ when he was told by his mother Mr Baranauskas had head-butted his father, and had gone to his home for ‘revenge’. He also admitted he had washed his trainers the following day as he feared there was blood on them - but he denied stamping or kicking Mr Baranauskas. After Jacikas received a life sentence for murder at Cambridge Crown Court, Detective Chief Inspector George Barr said the Lithuanian used 'extreme violence and showed no mercy'. He said: 'This was a sustained and brutal beating carried out by Jacikas after it was alleged the victim had assaulted his father. 'Jacikas showed Mr Baranauskas no mercy and continued to punch, kick and stamp on him even after he had been knocked unconscious. 'He is clearly a dangerous individual who is prepared to use extreme violence and we are glad he has been brought to justice. 'I . hope Mr Baranauskas’ family will be able to take some comfort from the . decision of the court and are able to move on with their lives.' Pathologist . Dr Benjamin Swift said Mr Baranauskas would have spent the rest of his . life being fed through a tube if he had survived the beating at the . hands of Jacikas.

But it now faces the prospect of being deserted by fans ahead of this summer’s European Championship in Ukraine amid safety concerns and general apathy. Mounting fears that local racist hooligans may use the major event to target fans from ethnic minorities and a spate of terrorist attacks are thought to have added to factors putting off supporters. Shunned: Only a tiny number of England fans look set to go to the Donbass Arena stadium, in Donetsk, Ukraine to support the Three Lions in Euro 2012 . Of the 9,000 official supporters tickets . made available through the Football Association, just 2,000 have been sold for England's opening game against France on June 11 at the Donbass Arena, in the former mining city of Donetsk. And only 1,000 more tickets have been sold for the game against hosts Ukraine in the country's capital Kiev on June 15. The dismal figures will be the lowest turnout ever for the Euro competition. Assistant chief constable Andy Holt, who is leading the British police involvement in the tournament, warned that England supporters could be goaded by local racist thugs. He said: 'It may be a flashpoint for some sort of disorder if fans feel they are being unfairly treated.' He said there was little intelligence that England fans were planning on causing trouble, adding: ‘The reality is that the overwhelming majority of England fans heading to Euro 2012 are there to support the national team and the game of football. Fears: The threat from terrorism, which Ukrainian security forces have been training to prevent, and concern racist hooligans might target England fans all look to put supporters off . ‘Those who engage in any trouble must realise that they will feel the full force of local policing laws. 'Anyone involved in football-related trouble can also expect to face a football banning order when they return to the UK."" England's recent run of poor performances in international tournaments also looks to have dented support. A Football Association spokesman said: ‘We are pleased with the England fans members who have bought tickets to support England in Ukraine.’ The FA says it has been liaising with fans and authorities over safety concerns and believes many more supporters will be getting tickets directly from UEFA. A record 70,000 fans headed to Germany to support England during the 2006 World Cup. Loyal: England could once count on some of the most loyal and fervent fans in the world, seen here at the World Cup in Germany 2006, but recent poor form and lack of results has dented support . But confidence in safety at this tournament has been hit by a series of devastating terrorists attacks. UEFA have played down the threat of trouble and tried to reassure fans that security measures for Euro 2012 are adequate despite a series of explosions in the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk. At least 27 people were injured in the blasts, which local authorities are believed to be treating as the work of terrorists. Four explosions have been reported in Dnipropetrovsk, with a tram stop and railway station among the apparent targets. Dnipropetrovsk was initially set to be a host city for Euro 2012 but was replaced in 2009 by Kharkiv. It is located around 240 miles from Kiev, the destination of the tournament final.","Only 2,000 out of 9,000 tickets sold for opening fixture in Ukrainian mining town ."

Jeremy Hunt was fighting to keep his job today but it appears he has cycled himself into even more trouble by breaking the law three times and risking £3,000 in police fines during one short bike ride. In just 13 minutes and two miles of peddling the beleaguered Culture Secretary was snapped riding through a red traffic light and twice down one-way streets as he wobbled home from work on his bike. Dressed in jeans and a casual shirt, he was not only flouting the highway code but also acting illegally, with each offence carrying a maximum penalty of £1,000.

The single currency crashed to its lowest level for nearly two years last night as Brussels warned that the eurozone faces ‘financial disintegration’. In a hard-hitting report on the dire state of the economy, the European Commission called for drastic action to prevent catastrophe tearing the region apart. It proposed that money set aside for keeping debt-ridden governments afloat should now be used to rescue troubled European banks. Disintegration: The single currency crashed to its lowest level for nearly two years last night . ‘Flexibility and speed are of the essence,’ said EC president Jose Manuel Barroso. The desperate rallying cry came amid mounting fears that the banking crisis in Spain will cripple the eurozone’s fourth largest economy and trigger a cataclysmic break-up of the single currency. The euro crashed below $1.24 against the US dollar to a level not seen for nearly two years. The single currency was also trading below 80p against the pound having lost 20 per cent of its value in the last three years. ‘The market has lost confidence in the euro,’ said Carl Forcheski, a currency expert at French bank Societe Generale in New York. ‘People are battening down the hatches.’ Stock markets around the world were on the slide with the FTSE 100 index down 1.74 per cent or 93.86 points to 5297.28 on a punishing day for investors in London. Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG Index in the City, said: ‘Without wishing to sound apocalyptic, it does feel as if Spain is gradually shuffling towards the abyss. 'Flexibility and speed are of the essence': EC president Jose Manuel Barroso . ‘Investor confidence wanes by the day, and it could only be a matter of time before the Spanish government is forced to ask for financial aid. ‘This would be an event of a far greater magnitude than the bailouts of Ireland, Portugal and Greece, since Spain’s size means it would exhaust Europe’s financial firepower.’ The EC said the eurozone bailout fund could be used to help banks directly rather than fund governments. It said it could ease pressure on countries such as Spain struggling to prop up the banking system. ‘To sever the link between banks and the sovereigns, direct recapitalisation might be envisaged,’ the report said. The money would come from the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone’s permanent bailout fund which launches in July but is currently only designed to lend to governments. Brussels said: ‘A closer integration among the euro area countries in supervisory structures and practices, in cross-border crisis management and burden sharing, towards a ‘banking union’ would be an important complement to the current structure.’ It also floated the idea of Eurobonds - a move that would see debt issued jointly by all 17 countries in the eurozone. The idea is vehemently opposed in Berlin because it would involve German taxpayers underwriting Greek and Spanish debt.",European Commission calls for drastic action .

A police force has agreed to pay £10,000 in compensation to an amateur photographer who was injured while being wrongfully arrested for taking a picture of a bank doorway, his law firm said today. Anthony Finnegan, 49, is also expected to receive a written apology from the chief constable of West Mercia Police, David Shaw, after he claimed to have been pushed face down into a puddle by the officers who arrested him. Neither of the officers involved has been disciplined, but Mr Finnegan's solicitors said the force had indicated it will admit liability for the incident and agree to pay him £10,000 plus his legal costs. The force will also delete all records of Mr Finnegan's arrest, said London law firm Bhatt Murphy, which specialises in civil rights cases. A spokesman for the police force said litigation in the case remained ongoing. Mr Finnegan, a construction worker, was arrested in July 2009 while using an SLR camera to take pictures in the centre of Shrewsbury, Shropshire. One of the photographs was of the front lobby of a high street bank in a period building. He was approached by a police constable and a police community support officer (PCSO) who, Mr Finnegan said, asked why he was taking 'discreet photographs' of a bank. 'I said: ""There's nothing discreet about this, it's an SLR camera. If I was being discreet I'd use a phone"",' Mr Finnegan told the Guardian. Mr Finnegan said that the constable then began searching his pockets, so he suggested they go to a police station, partly because he was not carrying any identification but also because he was embarrassed to be searched publicly in his home town. As they walked to the station, Mr Finnegan claims he was shoved, had his thumb pulled back sharply by the constable, and was eventually pushed to the ground. Mr Finnegan said: 'He grabbed me in a thumb lock and I pulled away from him, going: ""What are you doing?"" I got taken to the ground, face down into a puddle, and the PCSO, who's about 18 stone, his knee went into my ribs, which cracked or broke the back of my ribs.' Legal action: Mr Finnegan was handcuffed and claims he was pushed to the ground by the officers who detained him. (File photograph) A doctor's examination later found other injuries, including abrasions and bruising. Mr Finnegan was handcuffed and driven to another police station, where he was told he had been arrested for a public order offence and placed in a cell. He was released at about 9pm, seven hours after he was stopped. He learned two months later that he would face no further action. Mr Finnegan's solicitor Fiona Murphy said: 'We welcome the chief constable's decision to admit liability, to apologise and to destroy the records of Mr Finnegan's detention. 'We hope that this complete resolution of the claim will enable the force to learn lessons from this regrettable abuse of police powers.' A spokesman for West Mercia Police said: 'This is a live matter subject to ongoing litigation and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further at this time.'","Amateur photographer Anthony Finnegan says he was detained for seven hours by West Mercia Police .

The daughter of a woman whose charred bones were found three years after she vanished has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Lois Hounslea, 21, was arrested by detectives investigating the death of Paula Hounslea, who disappeared in August 2009 after a family meal to celebrate her mother's birthday. Police have confirmed that a 20 year-old man is also being quizzed on suspicion of murder. Arrested: Lois Hounslea (left) has been arrested on suspicion of killing her mother Paula Hounslea (right), who disappeared in August 2009 . Miss Hounslea, who was nicknamed 'Loey' by her family, tearfully appealed for her mother's return last Christmas, saying: 'It is the only present I want, that any of us want.' Her arrest follows a three-year investigation into the fate of Mrs Hounslea, who went missing after allegedly telling her daughter she was going to stay with a friend. Merseyside Police launched inquiries on May 5 after a dog walker found Mrs Hounslea's charred bones in a firepit on the loopline in Fazkerley. The grim discovery was made 12 feet down an embankment, near a disused railway line which is now a walking path. Police investigating the death believe the woman's body may have been dumped as recently as February this year. Officers recovered a gold necklace with the face of the Virgin Mary next to the body, and Mrs Hounslea's parents, Moira and Steve, got in touch when they saw it pictured in a local newspaper. Their daughter's bones were identified using dental records, and forensic examination showed she had been lying in the popular beauty spot for around seven months. The cruel blow came just three days after her grieving parents made a plea for information on what would have been Mrs Hounslea's 40th birthday. Officers are now urging locals to come forward with information about a suspicious fire in the area in the past year. A Merseyside Police spokesperson said: 'Detectives have arrested a 21-year-old woman from West Derby and a 20-year-old man from Bowring Park on suspicion of the murder of Paula Hounslea. 'Merseyside Police launched a murder investigation following the discovery of her remains on the disused loopline railway on Saturday 5th May 2012. 'Officers were called to the loopline, near to its junction with Blackthorn Road, Fazakerley, following a call from a member of the public who had been walking his dog. Distressed: Moira and Steve Hounslea at home in Liverpool. Their daughter's body was found just three days after they made an emotional appeal for information . 'The dog discovered bones that were subsequently identified as belonging to Paula Hounslea in what appears to have been an old fire pit on the embankment close to the railway line. 'Paula was 37 when she was reported missing from her home in West Derby on Saturday, 22nd August 2009. 'The man and woman arrested have been taken to a police station on Merseyside where they will be questioned by detectives.' Since her mother's disappearance, Lois Hounslea has given birth to a daughter named Erin, now aged four months. Paula's father, Steve . She said in a recent appeal: 'I’m living on my own in our house. I miss her so much and want her to come home. If anyone has seen her or knows where she is, please get in touch.' In his appeal on May 2, Paula’s father Steve, 68, a former delivery driver, offered a reward for information about his daughter’s whereabouts. He said: 'You just feel in limbo. It’s the not knowing that’s the worst. She’s a lovely girl. 'On reflection on the night before she disappeared, Paula was a bit quiet - but other than that, there was no indication there was anything wrong. 'It isn’t easy to come up with money but we are so desperate, it’s something we feel we have to do. 'We feel that somebody in Liverpool must know something and if we offer the reward maybe they’ll come forward and give us that information. 'If anybody knows anything, please, we would love to have some good news. Just to know that she is safe would be absolutely brilliant. She has the cheekiest of smiles. I believe one day I’ll see it again.' He went on: 'She could be the most bubbly of people and generous to a fault. If you remarked you liked something she was wearing she’d hand it over; she’d give you the clothes from her back. For her to disappear was completely out of the blue. 'Our house was searched and Paula’s home too, but there was no clue found as to what might have happened. 'We were asked the same things again and again. Her closest friends were spoken to but nothing came to light as to why she might have gone. It was a true mystery. 'Paula’s a gran now. She should be cuddling her new granddaughter and forming a bond.

Warning: Sir Michael Wilshaw said teachers are being forced to battle against an anti-learning culture . Thousands of children from dysfunctional homes should be taken from their families and put in boarding schools, the head of Ofsted claimed yesterday. Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools, said drastic intervention was needed to help youngsters whose futures were being blighted by their parents’ low expectations and chaotic lifestyles. He warned that too many pupils were coming to school from an ‘anti-learning culture’ amid a ‘backdrop of lost standards, values and ambitions’. The problem was being compounded by parents failing to enforce boundaries and absent fathers in particular who, he said, should be condemned by society for their failure to support their children. Fathers needed to see raising their children as the ‘right and manly’ thing to do. Sir Michael, a former head teacher, spoke out as he launched a major review aimed at tackling the achievement gap between rich and poor students. In an interview with LBC Radio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer, he said the inquiry would consider whether some children should be taken from their parents on educational grounds. He said: ‘There are some dysfunctional families where children…come to school completely unprepared to be able to work. Tough battle: Working class communities lack ambition and aspiration, making the job of schools more difficult, the Ofsted chief inspector warned (file picture) ‘I think the Government have said there are 30,000 of these families, and there may be more. ‘Hopefully one of the things we can look at (in this review) is to say some of these children need to be lifted from the home…at a very early stage and put into boarding education where they can be looked after, cared for and loved.’ Sir Michael suggested that Ministers were already considering similar plans, adding: ‘I know the Government is interested in this.’ He also called on fathers to play a far greater role in the lives of their children following divorce or separation from the mother. ‘I would say to absent dads, get involved in your children’s lives,’ he said. ‘If you don’t, you should be condemned.’ Earlier, he warned the National College annual conference in Birmingham that his review – which will report in May next year – will look for ‘radical solutions’ to narrow achievement gaps. Referring to a newspaper article that highlighted the lack of ambition in white, working class areas, he said that historically there used to be a ‘real respect for education’ in these communities. He said: ‘Too many children and young people come to school against a backdrop of lost standards, values and ambitions.’ Under Labour, ministers had wanted boarding schools to admit pupils in the care of social services. It was hoped that 3,000 would eventually be placed. But it was revealed in 2008 that only 25 had been – and eight dropped out. Ex-Government adviser Sir Cyril Taylor said Left-wing social workers had scuppered the scheme. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Placement in boarding schools is an option but would be at the discretion of the local authority. Every case would be assessed on the individual needs of the child.’","Teachers are battling against an anti-learning culture, Ofsted chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw warns .

Falklands war hero Simon Weston has pulled out of standing as one of Britain’s first Police and Crime Commissioners saying it had become ‘too political’.The former Welsh Guardsmen, who suffered horrific burns to 46 per cent to his body during the Falklands conflict in 1982, announced his decision on Twitter on Monday.He tweeted: ‘With regret pulling out of the PCC role for South Wales. Became disillusioned by the fact it was getting too political and not serving the people.’ Too political: Falklands war hero Simon Weston announced he won't be standing as one of Britain's first Police and Crime Commissioners. Tweeting decision: Weston tweeted his reasons why he stood down from the race to become the Police and Crime Commissioner for South Wales. Mr Weston, who lives in Cardiff, had planned to stand as an independent candidate for the £70,000 year job. A previous criminal conviction when he was 14 had also brought Mr Weston's standing into question. The legislation creating commissioners bars candidates convicted of imprisonable offences. Mr Weston was convicted and fined for being a passenger in a stolen car but Home Secretary Theresa May assured the former soldier that he could apply for the role despite having a juvenile criminal conviction. The law was not aimed at people who had a conviction at the age of 16. As a Coalition flagship initiative, the commissioners will replace police authorities in England and Wales and set the police force’s budget and strategic direction. The Falklands veteran is well known for his recovery from horrific burns and for forging an inspiring career as a charity worker, children’s author and motivational speaker. Inspiring career: Mr Weston, pictured with sons Stuart (on the right), James and grandson Zach, wanted to make a contribution and stop ageing politicians taking commissioner roles . When the father of three announced his decision to stand in February he urged others to follow his example to stop ageing politicians taking the roles. He said: ‘Why should the politicians corner the market? Why they should have any greater insight to life? ‘There are so many talented people out there who haven’t had a chance to do their bit yet.‘I’m going to stand as an independent candidate because I believe I can make a contribution and bring something different.’ Other candidates still in the running are former Labour deputy prime minister John Prescott and Iraq War veteran Col Tim Collins. The new roles have been criticised by Labour as a bad idea that risks politicising the police.","Simon Weston announces he will no longer stand in the race to be the Police and Crime Commissioner for South Wales .

A young Olympic hopeful who took time out from her law degree to train for a place at the London 2012 games has been threatened by balliffs over council tax payments. Bristol University student Georgie Twigg, 21, spread the teaching of her final academic year over two so she could focus on a tough training schedule for the GB hockey team. But this loyalty to her country makes Miss Twigg the only part-time student in a house of six, in Clifton, Bristol - leaving her liable for a hefty council tax bill on a property in band E, totalling £1,500. Bailiffs calling: Bristol University student Georgie Twigg, 21, spread the teaching of her final academic year over two so she could focus on a tough training schedule for the GB hockey team . Full-time students are exempt from paying council tax while they study, but as Miss Twigg only attends university for one day a week, she no longer qualifies for this bracket. Miss Twigg spends the other four days of her week training with her GB hockey team in Maidenhead, Berkshire - living in a property that she pays full council tax on. She received a court summons after returning from Argentina in February, where her GB hockey team won a silver medal at the Champions Trophy for the first time. Miss Twigg, who carried the Olympic torch through Clifton, Bristol, earlier this month, contacted Bristol City Council to ask to be treated as a student as she does not have the money to pay the bill - but her plea fell on deaf ears. The summons stated that because she was completing her final year in two years instead of one, she was classed as a part-time student and was no longer exempt from paying council tax, as full-time students are. Miss Twigg's parents wrote to the council, including to leader Simon Cook and chief executive Jan Ormondroyd to ask that she be made exempt due to her exceptional circumstances. In action: Miss Twigg spends four days of her week training with the GB hockey team in Maidenhead, Berkshire - living in a property that she pays full council tax on . But the council told the family there was nothing it could do and demanded the money. At the start of this month, just as she was about to take her final law exams, Miss Twigg received a notice of 'intended bailiff action'. Her . father Robert Twigg, 57, said: 'We feel that Georgie has been penalised . for trying to complete her studies while at the same time qualifying . for the Olympic team. 'It can't be right that this charge wouldn't have been put on her if she had opted out of such a fantastic opportunity. 'Bristol . City Council has been completely unsupportive and unreasonable - no-one . seems to want to stick their head above the parapet and realise that . these are exceptional circumstances - it just seems so wrong.' Miss Twigg challenges with Ireland's Niamh Atcheler during their fifth/sixth place play-off in the Investec London Cup at the Quintin Hogg Memorial Ground in Chiswick, west London, earlier this month . A spokesman for Bristol City Council said: 'Unfortunately the law regarding council tax discount is quite clear and does not allow any leeway on the part of the city council. 'Miss Twigg forfeited her eligibility for the council tax discount when she reduced the number of days she was studying in Bristol. 'We have looked at this case sympathetically to see if there was any room for discretion on our part, given that she is about to represent the UK at the highest level, but regrettably there is none and we are bound by national legislation. 'It is a situation that can also affect other individuals who give up their time for good causes such as special constables and charity volunteers. 'We have offered as reasonable terms as we can for the repayment of the debt incurred.

Allen Stanford was sentenced on Thursday to 110 years in prison for orchestrating one of the largest Ponzi schemes in U.S. history that had defrauded investors out of $7 billion in the course of 20 years. Stanford’s glittering billionaire innings that led to him being listed as the world’s 605th richest person was declared over by a fellow Texan judge who ignored last-minute pleas from his lawyers to reduce the sentence to less than four years. The courtroom in Houston was packed with more than 150 people – many of them the victims of Stanford’s various schemes. Jailbird: Convicted financier Allen Stanford arrives at Federal Court in Houston for sentencing . Two of the estimated 17,000 victims of Stanford’s fraud were allowed to address the court. Jaime . Escalona, who represented Latin American victims, addressed the hearing . before turning to stare directly at Stanford to tell him: ‘You, sir, . are a dirty, rotten, scoundrel.’ The . other victims’ spokesman, Angela Shaw, of the Stanford Victims . Coalition, said of the fraudster: ‘Allen Stanford has stolen more than . billions of dollars. He took our lives as we knew them.’ She said some . 28,000 people had lost money in the scam. Before learning his fate, Stanford, . dressed in green prison garb, a wide grin on his face, delivered a . rambling statement in which he claimed that he had done nothing wrong, . and that he was a scapegoat. Guilty: Stanford was convicted in March of 13 of 14 counts of fraud . He . blamed the federal government and a U.S.-appointed receiver who took . over his companies in 2009, saying they tore down his business empire . and prevented his investors from getting any of their money back. In March, following a seven-week trial, Stanford was convicted of 13 of 14 fraud-related counts, among them wire and mail fraud. Speaking for more than 40 minutes, Stanford told a judge he's ‘not here to ask for sympathy or forgiveness.’ Ever the showman, Stanford, 62, waved to . his elderly mother, Sammie Stanford, who sat in the well of the court . alongside Stanford’s daughter, Randi. Prosecutors sought a 230-year prison term, the maximum possible sentence, while the defense asked for a maximum of 44 months. The prosecutor told U.S. District Judge David Hitner: ‘230 years will not get anyone their money back but on sleepless nights they will know that he got the maximum.’ Stanford’s attorney, Ali Fazel, objected to the use of the term ‘Ponzi scheme,’ but Hittner said the evidence at trial justified the use of the term. During the hearing, the prosecutors also compared him to the infamous New York City financier Bernie Madoff, who is currently serving a 150-year prison term for similar crimes. Stanford now plans to appeal against the conviction and sentence even though he was officially declared 'indigent' – penniless, which means that the government will have to spend tens of millions of dollars on court-appointed lawyers. He said: 'I’m not here to ask for sympathy or forgiveness or to throw myself at your mercy but I will tell you I did not run a Ponzi scheme. I didn’t defraud anybody.' The former honorary knight of Antigua was arrested in 2009. Since then, all of his assets have been frozen and he has been represented by public defenders. The lengthy prison term does not bode well for Stanford, who was severely beaten by another inmate while waiting for trial in jail. He was hospitalized and later transferred to a federal prison medical facility in Butner, North Carolina, as result of an addiction to anti-depressants, which he developed after the beating. Cricket fan: The then Sir Allen Stanford poses with the England team during the Stanford 2020 Super Series match between England and Middlesex in 2008. He was later stripped of his knighthood . Traveling in style: Stanford's 120-foot yacht called the Sea Eagle is seen docked in Christiansted, St. Croix . His defense team had claimed that the trauma left their client unable to remember anything, but government psychiatrist eventually determined that the financier was faking it and set a trial date. Stanford was once considered one of the wealthiest men in the U.S., with an estimated personal net worth of more than $1.9billion, a $7.7million mansion on the Caribbean island of St. Croix, a moated mansion in Miami, which he called Tyecliffe Castle, and a 120-foot yacht named the Sea Eagle. His financial empire stretched from the U.S. to Latin America and the Caribbean. Calling Stanford arrogant and without remorse, prosecutors said he used the money from investors who bought certificates of deposit, or CDs, from his bank in Antigua to fund a string of failed businesses, bribe regulators and pay for a lavish lifestyle that included yachts, a fleet of private jets and sponsorship of cricket tournaments. Left in the lurch:: Stanford Bank headquarters in Panama City, Panama . From prince to pauper: The man who was once transporting chests filled with cash in his helicopter (left) has been declared indigent and having to rely on court-appointed lawyers . Stanford added moments before being led away: ‘If I live the rest of my life in prison...I will always be at peace with the way I conducted myself in business.’ The majority of the victims were small businesses or private investors, looking to cash-in on interest rates above bank rate. Mike Bishop, of Houston, Texas, who lost round $1.4million, said outside the court:  ‘This was a wholesale failure by government agencies who regulate companies such as Stanford. They are as responsible. King of Con: Stanford has been compared to infamous financier Bernard Madoff, who is currently serving a 150-year prison term for a $50billion Ponzi scheme . ‘Here in Texas, we believe in capital punishment but I would not wish it on Stanford, I want him to wake up every morning in his prison cell and reflect on what he did to us all.’ In June of 2008, Stanford signed a controversial deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for a series of five Twenty20 cricket games between England and a Caribbean side nicknamed the ‘Stanford All-Stars.’ The winners would collect a prize-fund of £13.6-million and the losers would get nothing. During the tournament, Stanford was pictured sitting with the England players wives, at one sitting bouncing the wife of wicketkeeper Matt Prior on his knee. His next trick was to fly into Lords cricket field in London aboard a personalized helicopter laden with treasure chests filled with cash. He . planned to be the savior of English cricket, even though he admitted he . never really understood the game. By . the time of his arrest, in February of 2009, the ECB has severed all ties . with Stanford and his honorary knighthood - a Caribbean title provided by Antigua which he misleadingly claimed was bestowed upon him by the Queen Elizabeth II - had been stripped. The . jury that convicted Stanford also cleared the way for U.S. authorities . to go after about $329million in stolen investor funds sitting in the . financier’s frozen foreign bank accounts in London, Canada and . Switzerland. Three other . former Stanford executives are scheduled for trial in September.

Happier times: Allen Stanford poses with Stanford Superstars following their victory at the end of the Stanford 20/20 Super Series match between England and Stanford Superstars in 2008 . Prosecutors said Stanford had treated his victims like 'roadkill.' They had asked for a prison sentence spanning more than two centuries, calling him a 'ruthless predator' who stole from investors 'simply to satisfy his own greed and vanity.' He even claimed to be related to the . founder of the elite Stanford University in California until it denied . any relationship and then filed a trademark infringement against him for . misusing its good name. But Stanford’s pretense at old-money . grandeur is nothing new. His wedding in Susan’s home town of Teague, . Texas, on a hot September evening in 1975 was reported in the local . newspaper as if it were a dynastic match, with the bride adorned in . ‘Venice lace, lavishly appliqued on white English net’. Teague, however, turned out to be a dusty rural town on the scorched cattle prairie of Texas. Susan’s father was a train conductor and her parents own a simple . bungalow on a street where their nearest neighbor lives in a trailer. In 2009, The Mail on Sunday reported that besides his wife of more than three decades, Susan, from whom Stanford got separated, he had several mistresses who were known as his ‘outside wives.’ He has had at least four children with these women. At the time, Stanford’s then-81-year-old father, James Stanford, said: ‘I felt bad for Susan, him having all these outside wives and all these kids. I wouldn’t have approved of it but I heard about it after the fact.’ Susan was a dental hygienist and Stanford, whose father inherited an insurance business, ran a chain of health clubs. His mother was a nurse. By the time he made his first fortune in Texas real estate in the 1980s, Stanford was already an accomplished womanizer. ‘He met his first outside wife through the business,’ his father said.

He introduced Ms Sage to his father. The tycoon’s long-suffering wife Susan petitioned for a divorce in November of 2007. Perhaps Allen Stanford’s undoing was that he began to believe in his own empire of lies.","Stanford was convicted in March of 13 or 14 counts of fraud .

The 'hero' is a grinning maniac behind the wheel of a supercar - and 'winning' means killing as many pedestrians as possible - but ultra-controversial videogame Carmageddon might be unleashed on another generation of teenagers. A Kickstarter 'crowd sourced' funding page has launched, seeking funds for a sequel to the game, which was the first game ever to be refused a certificate by the BBFC in 1997. The game sparked huge controversy in the UK, with vehicles reducing pedestrians to gory slush, and players awarded points for killing as many as possible. At the time, now-defunct game maker SCi said, 'It is violence that sells.' The original Carmageddon was the first game ever to be refused a certificate by the BBFC - but went on to sell two million copies . Pedestrians meet a grisly end in the game, billed as 'the nastiest ever' The game focused on causing car crashes - and gamers could score bonus points for running over pedestrians . An increasing number of games are now funded via the 'crowd sourced' Kickstarter websites, where fans of games or films can pledge money to have a sequel made. The Carmageddon project has already secured $160,000 in funding. 'Max Damage is back,' says the new maker - referring to the game's psychotic anti-hero. The original game deliberately courted controversy with 'bonuses' including one entitled 'Drugs', which turned the screen psychedelic colours. 'Carmageddon: Reincarnation is going to reintroduce the gaming world to the original freeform driving sensation, where pedestrians (and cows) equal points and your opponents are a bunch of crazies in a twisted mix of automotive killing machines. It’s the racing game where racing is for wimps.' Despite the controversy, the game sold two million copies. The original team behind the controversial game are seeking funding for a new sequel . The developer, Stainless Games, was forced to 'recut' the game with zombies instead of pedestrians - although 'patches' were widely available online, which restored the original bloodshed. ;After years of negotiation, the original founders of Stainless recently bought back ALL the rights to Carmageddon,' says Stainless Games today. 'So now it’s back in its rightful home, we’ve embarked on the journey that will reboot the brand, and we want YOU to join us on that journey.'","Game where drivers were rewarded for killing innocent pedestrians .

It's no secret that Mars is a beaten and battered planet - astronomers have been peering for centuries at the violent impact craters created by cosmic buckshot pounding its surface over billions of years. But just how beat up is it? Really beat up, according to a University of Colorado Boulder research team that recently finished counting, outlining and cataloging a staggering 635,000 impact craters on Mars that are roughly a kilometer or more in diameter. Scroll down for video: . History written on its face: The surface of Mars is covered with thousands upon thousands of crater impacts over the planet's life . As the largest single database ever . compiled of impacts on a planet or moon in our solar system, the new . information will be of help in dating the ages of particular regions of . Mars, said CU-Boulder postdoctoral researcher Stuart Robbins, who led . the effort. The new crater atlas also should help . researchers better understand the history of water volcanism on Mars . through time, as well as the planet's potential for past habitability by . primitive life, he said. 'This database is a giant tool that . will be helpful in scores of future Mars studies ranging from age-dating . and erosion to planetary habitability and to other applications we have . not even thought of yet,' said Robbins, who is affiliated with . CU-Boulder's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. 'In a sense it's like building a new and better hammer, which quickly becomes used by everyone. 'We have all this new information . coming from Mars orbiters and landers that have helped generate far . better maps illustrating the planet's topography and surface details. I . basically analyzed maps and drew crater rim circles for four years.' One crater in particular reveals dark traces of sediment thought to have been cemented together by water from an ancient groundwater reservoir, before being carved away by howling Martian wind . Co-author Brian Hynek, a LASP research . associate and assistant professor in the geological sciences . department, said knowing more about the history and extent of Martian . cratering has implications for better understanding the potential for . past life on Mars. He said: 'Many of the large impact . craters generated hydrothermal systems that could have created unique, . locally habitable environments that lasted for thousands or millions of . years, assuming there was water in the planet's crust at the time. 'But large impacts also have the . ability to wipe out life forms, as evident from Earth's dinosaur-killing . Chicxulub impact 65 million years ago.' While there are only about 150 to 200 known impact craters left on . Earth, both the moon and Mercury are still peppered with craters due to . their lack of atmosphere and plate tectonic activity, he said. Cataloging the cratering of Mars and the moon is helping scientists . understand a time a few hundred million years after the inner solar . system formed, including an event about 3.9 billion years ago known as . the 'Late Heavy Bombardment' in which asteroids as large as Kansas . rained down on Earth. 'Although Earth has lost most of its geologic record due to tectonic . plate movements and erosion, understanding the impact crater history on . the moon and Mars can help us reconstruct our early days,' said Hynek. The asteroids litter the landscape - as they would on Earth except we have a geologically active world . Robbins said most of the smaller . diameter craters on Mars are younger than the largest craters and form . the bulk of the planet's crater population. 'The basic idea of age dating is that . if a portion of the planet's surface has more craters, it has been . around longer,' said Robbins. Much of the planet has been . 'resurfaced' by volcanic and erosional activity, essentially erasing . older geological features, including craters. The new database also is expected to . help planetary scientists better understand erosion on the planet, said . Robbins, who earned his doctoral degree from CU-Boulder's astrophysical . and planetary sciences department. 'Our crater database contains both rim . heights and crater depths, which can help us differentiate between . craters that have been filled in versus those that have eroded by . different processes over time, giving us a better idea about long-term . changes on the planet's surface.' Having a better handle on the size and . distribution of Martian impact craters also has implications for . future, manned missions to the planet, said Hynek. NASA wants to know where the craters . are and their particular features both from a safety and research . standpoint. 'Craters act as a 'poor man's drill' that provide new . information about the subsurface of Mars,' he said. Since the most complete databases of . lunar craters include only those roughly 10 to 15 kilometers in diameter . or larger, and databases on Mercury's craters contain only those over . roughly 20 kilometers in diameter, it is difficult to compare them with . the Martian crater database, said Robbins.

The OTS official, who retired from government service in 2010, did not provide any banking information to any prostitute, the report said. The OTS has since merged with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The documents, first reported by The Hill newspaper, were posted online on July 9 and made public through a request under the U.S. freedom of Information Act. The Treasury's Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded that the worker had violated government rules on 'notoriously disgraceful conduct'. Treasury's inspector general also found that a national bank examiner accepted golf fees and food, played golf during work hours and recorded time as work while playing with bank employees.

Instead of blaming a long day or hectic schedule, it seems you may need to look a little further back in time. Women are being put off exercise for life by their school PE lessons, a study has found. Competitive classmates, grubby changing rooms and the embarrassment of getting sweaty in front of boys all contribute to girls avoiding the gym as adults. Uniform: Girls from the Royal Commercial Travellers' School in Pinner, balancing on the wall bars, in 1956 . Secondary school classes are the ones most likely to send girls running – or rather, growing up to do anything but. In a survey, more than half of school-age girls said their PE lessons had put them off doing any exercise at all. Almost half said they felt ‘forced’ into doing the same team sports, such as hockey and netball, year in and year out. Many wanted to try ‘less competitive’ activities, such as dance, but said these were not on offer. And a third complained that PE lessons were geared towards the sportiest pupils. The study also found that one in five girls avoided PE because they ‘felt like their body was on show’. Enthusiasm: Some girls remain keen to take to the pitch . Roughly half said they hated ruining their hair or getting sweaty or dirty at school because they felt it was ‘not feminine’. Others were put off by having to do sport in front of boys or use ‘dirty’ school changing rooms. The researchers said the results were ‘alarming’ and showed that girls were being ‘put off sport for life’ by negative experiences of school PE. Sue Tibballs, of the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation, which carried out the study, said: ‘If the only activities on offer are competitive sports like netball and hockey, you are going to have whole swathes of girls who feel pushed out and don’t want to do exercise. 'That continues into their adulthood.’ Team games: Pupils at St James Primary School in Muswell Hill north London taking part in a mixed netball session . She warned that teachers were finding it increasingly difficult to get their pupils enthused by sport because girls were ‘worried about their hair and nails’. ‘It’s also hard because there aren’t many sporting role models for girls. While boys grow up dreaming of playing for England, women’s sports tend to get pushed out.’ Only 12 per cent of girls aged 14 are doing as much physical activity as they should be, compared with a quarter of teenage boys. During the study, 1,500 school-age boys and girls were questioned about how often they played sport and their attitude to PE lessons. The results revealed that girls tended to become less and less positive about sport as they  grew older, with many blaming  secondary school PE lessons for putting them off. While boys and girls tended to do the same amount of sport until aged 11, after three years at secondary school, girls were doing significantly less. By the age of 14, fewer than a third of girls said they had done 60 minutes of physical activity in the previous week. For boys, the figure was 50 per cent. The researchers found many girls ‘spoke nostalgically about PE at primary school, which they experienced as less formal and more fun’.","Half complained they were ‘forced’ into doing team sports, such as hockey and netball .

A mother who spent £40,000 on IVF over eight years in order to have a son was thrilled to conceive another child a year later, without trying. Jenifer Heneghan, 35, and husband Kevin, 37, spent their life savings on six rounds of IVF treatment after Jenifer was told she was infertile. My miracle babies: Jenifer Heneghan who was told she could never fall pregnant naturally with IVF son Tiernon and daughter Nuala who was conceived naturally . The couple were over joyed when she gave birth . to son Tiernon in May 2010 and accepted he would never have a sibling because . they couldn’t afford any more IVF treatment. But shortly after his first birthday . Jenifer realised her period was late and was left stunned when a test . confirmed she was pregnant. She gave birth to her miracle daughter Nuala ten weeks ago. The former care home manager said: 'We’ve never used contraception because I was told there was more chance . of me winning the lottery than falling pregnant. ‘It took eight years of IVF and every . penny we had to conceive our son, I never expected in a million years to . fall pregnant naturally. To me it’s better than winning the lottery. ‘We bought one and we got one free but to me they are both priceless.’ Inconceivable: A 20 week scan of baby Nuala who was conceived naturally . Jenifer lost her first son Jack to meningitis and miscarried twins at six weeks before having Tiernon and Nuala (pictured) Mrs Heneghan's ordeal started when aged 23 she lost her only son Jack to meningitis weeks before his second birthday. Her grief was compounded when she then . met engineer Kevin and started trying for another baby without . success. A visit to the doctor revealed Jenifer, then 25, had a condition that had fused her fallopian tubes together. She said: ‘He said there was more chance of me winning the lottery and that my only hope was IVF. ‘I was stunned because I had fallen easily with Jack. I was only 25, it didn’t make sense.’ It was engineer Kevin that suggested cancelling their holiday and spending the money on IVF instead. But four painful attempts over four years and £20,000 later Jen was still not pregnant. She said: 'It was heartbreaking and so stressful that I even developed Bell’s Palsy. My consultant advised me to take a break form the IVF because emotionally I was so drained.' But thee years on the yearning for a baby was stronger than ever and in 2008 the couple started another course of IVF. Jenifer with husband Kevin: The couple tried IVF over eight years . Three weeks later Jenifer fell pregnant with twins but miscarried at six weeks. She said: 'I wasn’t sure I could keep putting myself through it. We had spent £26,000 which was everything we had. All our friends had bought bigger houses or new cars but we had ploughed it all into the chance of having a baby.’ The couple decided to have one last shot using two frozen eggs they had left and Jen’s parents gave them the £14,000 they needed to have them thawed and implanted.  It took the total they had spent to £40,000. One egg didn’t survive, but the other did and two weeks later Jenifer was pregnant. Her son was born in May 2010. 'We were overjoyed, he felt like a miracle and even though we would have loved more, we felt blessed to have Tiernon. 'There was no way we could afford more IVF so as far as we were concerned our family was complete.' But shortly after his first birthday Jenifer felt sick and realised her period was late. She bought a test and went into shock when it gave a positive result. Tiernon and Nuala: Jenifer was convinced she was going to have an ectopic pregnancy . She says: 'I bought a cheap one because I didn’t want to waste my money knowing deep down it was impossible for me to pregnant. I’d spent eight years an £40,000 on IVF to have Tiernon so I didn’t get my hopes up.' 'When I saw the blue line I was convinced something must be wrong. Because the condition of my tubes there was a high chance the pregnancy would be ectopic.' Her GP arranged an urgent scan and to everyone’s relief and astonishment it showed Jenifer was six weeks pregnant and the baby was developing normally. 'Even they couldn’t tell us how or why it had happened, I couldn’t believe it and neither could they. 'My consultant said just being relaxed and not trying may have made all the difference and I think he’s right. We spent so long trying and it never happened and then when we stop it does.' The doctor told Jenifer being relaxed made all the difference to conceiving Nuala . Jenifer was closely monitored throughout her pregnancy and had a planned caesarean section on Feb 8th this year. She said: 'Even when I held her I still couldn’t quite believe what had happened to us. We went through years of heartache and spent everything we had on having our son, and then we get a daughter for free. 'I thought we were the luckiest parents in the world when we had Tiernon, now I know we are.'","Mother tragically lost a child to meningitis before she was told her fallopian tubes had fused together .

A plaque commemorating two children murdered by the IRA was ripped down for a drunken prank, it emerged yesterday. One man carried out the vandalism  while two friends looked on before they left the memorial lying on the pavement in Warrington town centre. Shortly afterwards an older man took it home. The culprits are likely to be ordered to apologise to relatives of the victims, while the plaque – which was recovered at the weekend when the alleged thief was arrested – will be put back in place at a ceremony. Father's anguish: Colin Parry and his son on holiday, a year before Tim was killed at the age of 12. The plaque (right) put up in memory of Tim and the other victim Johnathan Ball, 3, was ripped down in a drunken prank . There was outrage last month when the . bronze memorial to two victims of the 1993 blast – 12-year-old Tim . Parry and three-year-old Johnathan Ball – went missing. But a breakthrough at the weekend after the release of CCTV images led to its recovery and the arrest of the suspects. On Saturday, police arrested a . 57-year-old man in the Penketh area of Warrington, where Tim’s family . used to live, and recovered the memorial. They also released photographs showing three young men hanging around the plaque on the night it vanished. Shortly afterwards, the men handed . themselves in and confessed that two of them, aged 27, had stood by and . watched while their 28-year-old friend took it off the wall. Bombing victims: Johnathan Ball, aged three, and Tim Parry, 12, who were killed in the blast in Warrington in 1993 . He abandoned it on the pavement, before it was allegedly taken home by the 57-year-old around 6am. The older man was released on police . bail after being arrested for ‘theft by finding’, while the . 27-year-olds, from Warrington, were released without charge. Tim’s father Colin, 65, is being consulted on what action should be taken against the 28-year-old from nearby Newton-le-Willows. Mr Parry and community representatives will also be consulted about whether the 57-year-old should be prosecuted. It is the second time Warrington memorials have been targetted. Just last month, Lithuanian Spartakas Grachauskas, 25,was jailed for 18 weeks after he was caught red handed trying to steal another plaque commemorating the Tim Parry, Johnathan Ball and the 54 people hurt in the IRA attack. The Warrington bombings consisted of two separate attacks – the first in February 1993 at a gas storage facility and the second the following month in the centre of the Cheshire town. Stolen: This is where the bronze memorial plaque which paid tribute to the two boys killed in the IRA blast was placed . In the second attack, The Samaritans received a coded message wrongly stating a bomb would be detonated in Liverpool. In the event, there were two blasts, in litter bins outside Boots and Argos, within a minute of each other causing carnage and confusion. Johnathan Ball was killed almost instantly and Tim Parry was so badly injured his parents later had to take the agonising decision to turn off his life support machine. More than 50 other victims were injured, with many suffering serious shrapnel wounds and cuts and lacerations from flying glass. The bronze plaque was put up in 1996 alongside a water feature in part designed by local schoolchildren. Speaking after it was discovered missing, Tim Parry's father Colin, 65, said of the thieves: ‘Even if they are really hard up it is without any justification. Blast: The scene is cordoned off after two litter bins exploded outside a Boots store and a McDonald's . ‘It really upsets me that they have disfigured something which symbolises a horror which took place in our town and has been worked on by many local youngsters. ‘It leaves an awful taste in my mouth that they must have snuck in, in the middle of the night and just taken it without any regard for the people that suffered. They did not give a moment's thought to the significance of what they had just stolen. It is despicable.’ His wife Wendy, 54, said: ‘It’s really sad to think that anyone would even think about stealing or defacing a memorial of any kind. Tim and Johnathan had so much to live for and I wonder whether the person who stole the plaque ever gave them and the 56 other people injured a second thought. ‘It is a sign of the times, I suppose, but there are other ways to make money without hurting those who had the misfortune to be caught up in that dreadful day.’ The bombings triggered a campaign for peace, with Mr and Mrs Parry – who have two other children – working tirelessly to promote greater understanding between Britain and Ireland. They set up a Peace Centre in the town and played an active role in the Peace Process in Northern Ireland, for which Mr Parry was given his OBE in 2004. Tragically, the parents of Johnathan Ball never recovered from the death of their son and they split up shortly after the bomb blast. Johnathan’s father, Wilf Ball, 69, died from a suspected heart attack in 2004 and his body lay undiscovered for two days. Memorial: This River of Life runs down Bridge Street, Warrington, in honour of the two boys killed in the 1993 IRA bomb blast . The boy’s mother, Marie Comerford suffered a fatal heart attack on the 16th anniversary of her son’s murder with the coroner saying she died of a broken heart. The bronze plaque, which depicts the course of the River Mersey as it flows through the Borough of Warrington, reads: ‘The central water feature is in part a memorial to two local children who died following the terrorist bomb explosion in Bridge Street in 1993.  Young people helped the artist with the design work.’ Helen Jones, Labour MP for Warrington North, said: ‘This is a callous theft which shows no regard for the families involved or for other Warrington people who were injured in the bombing. ‘Warrington is very proud of the way it conducted itself after the bombings and the way it didn’t turn to hatred and instead worked constructively for peace. But these thieves have trashed the reputation of the town and ought to be ashamed of themselves.’ David Mowat, Conservative MP for Warrington South, said: ‘I am utterly disgusted by how low these mindless vandals have stooped.’ Liz Antrobus was 22 when she and her 29 year-old fiance Gordon Edwards were blown into the air by the blast of the second bomb. They suffered horrendous injuries and spent months in hospital but were married in 1994 in a ceremony attended by bomb victim Tim Parry’s mother, Wendy. There has been a rise in cases of criminals targetting war memorials, lead from church roofs . and cables from railway lines for their scrap value. Each year, at least . 15,000 tons of the 13million tons of metal sent for scrap is believed to . be stolen, worth an estimated of £800million.

Two-year-old Abi Marshall suffers from Reflex Anoxic Seizures, which means extreme emotions can make her heart and breathing stop temporarily. The youngster was just ten-months-old when she had a first fit and has even suffered five in one day. Ssh! Abi Marshall's parents try to stop their daughter from being surprised as it can trigger a fit . Surprise, pain and excitement can trigger a seizure so her mother Cherish Ayres, 26, tries to make sure her daughter avoids the unexpected. Ms Ayres, from Crawley, West Sussex, said: 'Playing something like peek-a-boo is out of the question. 'Her cousin can just brush past her or the door will bang and she will have a seizure. 'Something will make her jump and her face will freeze. Her body locks and her eyes roll back in her head. Then she falls to the ground. It’s like she’s frozen in time. Her heart and brain stops. 'Her back arches and she will have a fit. The longer she’s unconscious, the longer she’s starved of oxygen, which can cause brain damage.' Abi, who is unable to go to nursery because of her condition, was at home with her parents when she had her first fit. Ms Ayres said: 'We’d just got in from shopping. My keys had been left on the side by the bags and Abi picked them up. 'I took them off her and carried on putting the shopping away. When I turned around again she’d gone all floppy. 'I picked her up then she went completely unconscious. I really thought she had gone. I didn’t think she was coming back.' Cherish and Dave with daughter: They are hoping Abi will grow out of the condition . Father Dave, 26, who works for McLaren, quickly checked Abi’s airways thinking she had accidentally swallowed something, while Cherish called an ambulance. By the time it arrived, Abi had come back to life. She was kept in hospital over night so doctors could check her heart.When the results came back normal, they put it down to deliberate breath-holding, which are common in babies and not harmful. However, two months later Abi collapsed three times in the space of a week. Her mother took her back into hospital but, again, a doctor said it was a breath-holding spell. Ms Ayres said: 'I wasn’t convinced that was it so I looked on the internet. 'There was a video of a little boy and the position of the boy’s body was exactly the same as Abi’s when she has a fit. 'The heading on the video was Reflex Anoxic Seizures. I was certain that’s what she had.' She then contacted the charity Syncope Trust And Reflex Anoxic Seizures (STARS) who believed Abi had the condition and suggested she see a paediatrician specialising in cardiology. Cherish said of Abi: 'She's a really girly girl, she just can't stop chatting' Back at the hospital, Abi had three ECGs to record electrical activity in her heart and an ultrasound scan. During this time, she caught a viral infection and her heart rate became dangerously high. Abi was rushed into hospital and was kept in for four days while they monitored her heart. Doctors were left baffled when all the tests came back clear so Abi was later referred to a specialist at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London.She was diagnosed with RAS last month. Ms Ayres said: 'The condition is so hard to diagnose. They had to eliminate everything else first. 'Having a diagnosis felt like a weight had been lifted.' Reflex Anoxic Seizures are caused by the vagus nerve being over stimulated due to an unexpected stimulus such as pain, shock or fear. It can cause a sudden lack of blood in the brain, which means she temporarily stops breathing and loses consciousness. There is no known cure for the condition but children’s attacks tend to lessen as they get older. Her parents hope Abi will eventually grow out of the condition. Doctors have shown her parents how to put their daughter in the recovery position and have warned them to avoid surprising Abi. Ms Ayres, who gave up her job as a receptionist to care for Abi said: 'We can’t make her jump. It’s an impossible task. There’s no telling. 'She has to be in my sight all the time.' However, despite her condition her parents say Abi is just like any other girl her age. Ms Ayres said: 'She’s a really girly girl. She doesn’t stop chatting. 'We try to keep things as normal as possible. Her condition won’t stop her doing things other kids do.' Her parents are now waiting for Abi to be fitted with a device to monitor how long her heart stops during an episode to see if she will need a pacemaker when she is older. Dr Jan Till, a consultant paediatric in electrophysiology at the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation trust, said: 'Reflex Anoxic Seizures (RAS) are a type of reflex attack, most common among children aged 18 months to five years, which are triggered by pain, shock or fright. 'Patients will pass out, the heart stops and their breathing stops and this can be very shocking for small children and their families. 'In very extreme cases a pacemaker can be discussed as one option to help manage these episodes. 'Most children grow out of RAS and will suffer no long term effects on their health.'For more information about Reflex Anoxic Seizures, visit http://www.stars.org.uk/ .",Fits cause Abi Marshall's breathing to stop putting her at risk of brain damage .

David Cameron has given his strongest warning yet that the euro is doomed to fail as fears grow that Greece is close to crashing out of the single currency. The Prime Minister dismissed new French president Francois Hollande’s claim that Britain was ‘indifferent’ to the fate of the eurozone, insisting it was essential for our economy that the Continent recovers. ‘We want the euro area to succeed,’ Mr Cameron said in an interview with the Daily Mail. ‘It’s 40 per cent of our exports. It’s vitally important these economies get back to growth. Crashing down? Fears are growing that Greece could soon fall out of the euro, with David Cameron saying their exit could spell the end of the currency . ‘The difficulty for us is we take a different view about the euro. We didn’t join. We think that single currencies really require single governments if they are going to work properly. ‘We have to recognise that the euro is a project in enormous transition. It could go in any number of different ways. Making sense of the euro for me would mean that those eurozone countries would have to have much more co-ordinated economic policy, much more co-ordinated debt policy. ‘There’s nowhere in the world that has a single currency without having more of a single government.’ Markets slumped yesterday as doubts grew about Franco-German relations following the victory of socialist President Hollande over Nicolas Sarkozy. EU leaders will gather later this . month for an emergency summit to discuss the new French leader’s . proposal to tear up an EU ‘fiscal pact’ to allow for a greater focus on . growth, rather than austerity. Athens, meanwhile, was gripped by . political chaos. The far-Left Syriza group was seeking to form a new . government after Greece’s two main parties saw support crash in Sunday’s . elections. David Cameron has dismissed French president Francois Hollande's (right) claim that Britain was 'indifferent' to the fate of the eurozone, insisting it was essential for the economy that the Continent recovers . Two-thirds of voters backed parties that refused to sign up to austerity measures demanded by Brussels. If a deal is not reached in three days, the country will have to return to the polls. Mr Cameron said Greece was in a ‘very difficult situation’ and gave a strong hint that he believed it should ditch the euro and reinstate the drachma, giving it freedom to cut interest rates and devalue its currency. ‘All these countries have to make their own choices,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘We chose to stay out of the euro. I have always believed different countries at times will need different economic policies, interest rates tailored to their own needs. ‘We are having to do very difficult things, but we are able to do things to ourselves, for ourselves, by ourselves. 'We can do them at a time of having very low interest rates and a currency that is enabling the competitive parts of our economy to get out and sell to the world. ‘We have made our choice. What I think about all these European economies is they have to make their choices. ‘We want them to sort out the problems that they have. We want to be in the single market, we want European co-operation, we don’t want to be in the euro. ‘We’ve started to demonstrate that it is possible to have a Europe where you’re leading some things – the single market, Nato – but other things you’re not involved in.’","Cameron claims he wants single currency to succeed .

A pregnant woman went into labour after falling 10 feet through her bathroom floor. Jo Tointon, 37, thought she had broken her back when she landed in her kitchen of her home in Sherwood, Nottingham. But she was able to call paramedics - and then felt as if she was going to give birth. Mrs Tointon, who was 35 weeks pregnant, was taken to the city's Queen's Medical Centre, where her son Eddy Austin, weighing 4lb 11oz, was delivered by Caesarian section hours later. She and her husband David, 33, only moved into the home two months ago and been renovating the bathroom in anticipation of Eddy's arrival. Mrs Tointon was discovered in the kitchen by her son, Ollie, two, followed shortly by her father Nigel Baxter, 64, who had been in the bathroom with her when she fell. Mrs Tointon said: 'There was nothing but plasterboard and joists and I must have missed a step and fell through to the kitchen. 'I fell through and my feet hit the breakfast bar in the kitchen.

'I didn't think I was, but when I moved I could feel something and I knew it was either blood and I was losing the baby, or my waters had broken. 'They had to check me first before checking my baby, and it felt like forever before they checked for his heartbeat.' Eddy, who was born on June 1, is still in intensive care after suffering a collapsed lung, but his health is improving.

Linesmen and referees can make errors due to hot and cold conditions, a new UEFA report claims - and urges that officials be allowed to double up numbers or be supported by goal line technology. The finding could have important implications for controversial decisions such as Diego Maradona's infamous 'Hand of God' goal - and for the upcoming 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Professor John Brewer of the University of Bedfordshire said, 'We need to look at ways to help them cope with the conditions that they will face.' Diego Maradona's infamous 'hand of God' goal past Peter Shilton: A new report presented to UEFA suggests that referees can make bad decisions in hot climates . John Brewer, of the University of Bedfordshire, found that physical performance and decision making of referees and linesmen were impaired when conditions were hot - similar to those likely to be found at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, or cold, as is often the case in Champions and Europa League. He was funded for the study by the European football governing body, UEFA. He presented his findings to its Medical Commission in Geneva prior to next month’s European Championships in in Poland and Ukraine. Professor Brewer said: ‘These findings have serious implications for the performance of referees and goal line officials who are officiating in challenging climatic conditions. It could be argued that this even lends further weight to the argument in favour of goal line technology in important matches.’ Professor Brewer pointed out the referees and goal line officials would have to work in extremely hot conditions while taking part in the World Cup in Qatar in 2022. However, cold climates can also cause problems. ‘The decision making of the goal line officials would also be cause for concern if they are working in the cold conditions seen in the Championships and Europa leagues. Our findings show that they are at risk of hyperthermia and making incorrect decisions, especially in the second half, ‘ he said. John Brewer, of the University of Bedfordshire, found that physical performance and decision making of referees and linesmen were impaired when conditions were hot - similar to those likely to be found at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar . He said pre-match and half time cooling in hot conditions would lessen the chance of a referee making a mistake. He also recommended that all match officials should receive appropriate education in hydration strategies. For officials working in cold conditions, Professor Brewer suggested that they should be permitted to wear additional clothing and, potentially, for four officials to be considered per match, rather than the current two, allowing each to only officiate for 45 minutes. Professor Brewer added: ‘When matches are played in extremely hot and cold conditions, the football authorities should observe the physical condition of match officials to ensure they are able to continue officiating effectively which may include measuring body temperature at half time. ‘The ultimate aim must be to protect the health of the officials, and ensure that they are in the best possible state to make correct decisions.’","Both hot and cold climates can make referees and linesmen make errors .

Earth had a near-miss on Sunday from an 150-foot asteroid that was detected only two weeks ago, it was revealed today. The space rock, 2012 EG5, flew past earth closer than the moon, at a distance of just 143,000 miles. The asteroid has a diameter of around 150 feet - and would have exploded with the force of an atomic weapon had it hit our planet. The flight path of asteroid 2012 EG5, showing its near-miss with Earth on Sunday . Nothing is known about its likely composition. The asteroid flew past Earth on Sunday at 9.32am GMT. An impact with an asteroid of that size would not cause a planet-wide disaster similar to the one that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago - but would hit Earth's surface and explode. The asteroid was spotted by the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope in Hawaii on March 13 this year. 'Asteroid 2012 EG5 will safely pass Earth on April 1,' said scientists at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory via a Twitter post. No danger: U.S astronomer Phil Plait has said we have nothing to fear from 2012 DA14... for now . Nasa's latest scan for 'impact event' threats used the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE and took two infrared scans of the entire celestial sky between January 2010 and February 2011.The scan aimed to find asteroids and comets 'near Earth' - ie within 120 million miles.The scan found there are 20,500 asteroids and comets that could destroy a city-sized area within 120 million miles of earth - previously the figure was thought to be 36,000.Nasa says the risk of impact is less than previously thought. The likelihood of a 'planet-killer' - the mountain-sized asteroids in the 'large-sized' range, above 3,300ft - appears to have fallen more significantly.There are only 981 of these objects near Earth, and Nasa has found 911 of them.

Nasa has been keen to dispel any panic surrounding asteroids this year as rumours of an apocalypse linked to the Mayan calendar have surfaced on the internet. 'The Earth has always been subject to impacts by comets and asteroids, although big hits are very rare,' Nasa scientists wrote earlier this year. 'The last big impact was 65 million years ago, and that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs. 'Today Nasa astronomers are carrying out a survey called the Spaceguard Survey to find any large near-Earth asteroids long before they hit. 'We have already determined that there are no threatening asteroids as large as the one that killed the dinosaurs.

The struggling outdoor clothing store, which put itself up for sale after massive losses, admitted it had failed to attract interest in its shares. Workers at the head office and distribution centre in Northamptonshire could begin the year without a job, with the outlook bleak across the entire British High Street. Who will buy? Loss-making Blacks has failed to attract interest in its shares after putting itself up for sale . Miserable month: Carpetright had an £800,000 loss over six months, Thomas Cook is merging with Co-Op travel, La Senza is 'restructuring' and Cadbury is laying off 200 jobs . Blacks at least hopes to sell off its trade, assets and brands - which include Peter Storm and Eurohike . The loss-making group, which owns 98 . Blacks outlets and 208 Millets stores, is still in talks with potential . buyers, who are said to include clothing companies Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Mountain Warehouse. The unseasonably warm weather in . October and November was a crippling blow for the outdoor clothing group . after a tough year. Blacks is in £36million of debt and made a £16m loss in the . first half of the year, reflecting the pain on much of the High Street. Topshop owner . Arcadia and department store John Lewis have both also cited the negative effects of autumn's . record temperatures in the run-up to Christmas. Dismal December: Millets, which is owned by Blacks Leisure, has been hit hard while retailers Barratts collapsed, Peacocks is closing 200 stores and Comet was sold for £2 after announcing losses of £22m . Even Tesco's sales were down almost one per cent on a year ago, despite its major price-cutting campaign. Comet was sold for just £2 last month after losses of £22m in six months of trading. The electrical retailer has 245 stores, in which revenues slid by 18 per cent in the period to October 31. There was more misery for workers last week when Thomas Cook, which posted losses of £400m for last year, said it was closing 200 stores last week. The travel agency will cut around 1,000 jobs as it merges with Co-Op's high street travel agency business. And in a depressing season, this month has seen La Senza begin a restructuring, putting 2,600 jobs and 158 stores at risk, and Kraft laying off up to 200 workers at Cadbury’s Bournville factory in Birmingham. Shoe retailer Barratts collapsed earlier this month and Peacocks is also looking to close an estimated 200 stores. Dark tidings: Blacks saw its shares plummet this year . Carpetright added to the gloom by . posting the worst first-half performance in its history, making an . £800,000 loss in the half-year which ended on October 29. In the . previous six months they had made a £9.8million profit. The news is a serious blow for the economy, with more than two million people currently unemployed. Blacks now has a market value of less than £1million, and has indicated the likelihood of a pre-pack deal.

In what is being hailed as a landmark case, Stephen Bogart – the son of the late star and Lauren Bacall – filed a lawsuit again Burberry at Los Angeles Superior Court last month. He claims the company used an image of his father from the 1942 movie Casablanca to plug its products on social media sites including Facebook and Twitter. Classic shot: Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in 1943 film Casablanca . Burberry has filed a counter- claim saying the picture of ‘Bogie’ was a historical reference protected under America’s First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech. In a statement, Stephen, 63, said: ‘This is such a disrespectful action by Burberry. Lawsuit: Humphrey Bogart's son Stephen . ‘It is important brands are not allowed to commercially use my father’s name or image without our permission.’ He also cast doubt on whether Bogart is wearing a Burberry in the picture, taken from the closing scenes of Casablanca as Bogart’s character Rick Blaine says goodbye to his lover, played by Ingrid Bergman. ‘It is well known my father was a loyal Aquascutum customer in his personal life,’ he said. Bogart died in 1957, aged 57, but continues to earn millions in death through lucrative licensing deals, including a furniture range. Lawyer Michael Crain, representing the Bogart estate, said last night: ‘This case is historic because the role of social media in advertising is new.’ In its lawsuit, Burberry states: ‘Burberry’s use of the image was not directly connected to the sale of any merchandise but rather was a historical positioning of the image within  an educational project along with numerous other photographs.’ The Bogart estate is seeking ‘unspecified damages’ that could run into  millions.

Police sealed off the road in Luozhou, Sichuan province, but abandoned a murder hunt when the driver turned out to be a professor from the city's medical school who'd bought the bodies for his students to use in class. 'They began to go off pretty quickly once they were stretched out in the sun. The smell was sickening,' said one motorist. Murder alert: Witnesses feared a serial killer was on the loose when this truck overturned on a motorway in China, spilling 16 bodies onto the tarmac . 'A lot of people stopped to have a look, but when they say the horrific sight and caught a whiff of the bodies many people jumped back into their cars and went away as fast as possible.' Police were having difficulty dealing with the incident because of the smell, but had to grit their teeth and get on with the job after they were given masks to cover their noses and mouths. One officer said: 'It was the worst scene I have ever had to attend. There were so many bodies. The smell was overwhelming. We had to pick the bodies up and clear the road.' Police loaded the bodies into ambulances to take them to their not-so-final resting place - in the college fridge. False alarm: Police sealed off the road, but later established that the driver was a professor who had legally bought the corpses for use at his medical school . Now the college is facing furious public criticism for carrying bodies 'without dignity' on the back of a truck. A spokesman for the Luozhou Medical School said: 'We bought the bodies legally and fairly."" 'They are the remains of unclaimed . murder victims, street people who have died and criminals who have been . executed,' they added. 'It is normal practise to use cheap . bodies from such sources.

A foul-mouthed pensioner branded 'Britain's nastiest granny' for making her neighbours' lives hell during a 12-year harassment campaign was given an ASBO today. Joan Nisbet, 71, sprayed weedkiller in a woman's face, blared gangster rap music, took part in naked sex acts and drove one neighbour to the brink of suicide. Nisbet was today handed an interim ASBO, after Croydon Coucnil ruled that the restraining order she received in September was ‘insufficient’ to protect her neighbours in Kenley, Surrey, from her abusive behaviour. In an unprecedented move, Croydon Council in Surrey have also applied to place a closure order on her home in Kenley - a procedure normally used for shutting down drug dens. 'She's a nightmare': Joan Nisbet (above) faces being evicted from her Croydon home after waging a 12-year campaign of harassment against her neighbours . Nisbet, currently serving a four-month prison sentence for breaching a restraining order in January, appeared in court on May 1 as the council applied to have her evicted from her home for three months. Today’s ASBO bans her from causing harassment, alarm or distress to her neighbours and from assaulting or threatening them when she is released this Friday. She has been barred from contacting next door neighbours Lorraine and Paul Crowley directly or indirectly. Nisbet, who sat impassively as she was read out the sanctions is also forbidden from pestering those who gave information about her campaign of abuse. Campaign of harassment: Police visit Nisbet's home in Kenley to arrest her last year. She was given a suspended jail term after a trial in September .

The interim ASBO runs until August 14, when Croydon Council will apply to have it formally recognised. Prosecutor Kuljit Bhogal said the current restraining order against Nisbet was ‘not sufficient to ensure that she behaves appropriately.’ She said: 'The position today is that Miss Nisbet is here and the local authority seek to pursue an authority for an ASBO. 'This is because the local authority take the view that as Miss Nisbet has been detained in prison there has been respite for the community and there is not a need to close her home and prevent her from living there. 'What we seek is an order concerning her behaviour when she is released on June 15. All of these matters have been served on Miss Nisbet prior to May 1.'

Rielle Hunter, the former mistress of disgraced senator John Edwards, is set to give an explosive interview where she will spill the details of their love affair which shattered his presidency dreams, ended his marriage and culminated in a political corruption trial. She will open up about the state of her relationship with the former North Carolina Senator and his relationship with the couple's four-year-old daughter Quinn. Dressed in a short, printed dress with bare legs and wedge heels, 48-year-old Ms Hunter was pictured for the first time being interviewed on ABC's 20/20. The show will air next Friday, June 22. Revelations: John Edwards' former mistress Rielle Hunter is set to speak publicly for the first time on June 22 about their relationship since the disgraced senator was found not guilty of illegally accepting campaign funds . She will also talk about what she would have said if called as a witness in Edwards' trial. Her book What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter, and Me hits the shelves four days later on June 26 when she will make further scheduled TV appearances on ABC. It is being billed as the tell-all behind the love affair. On May 31, John Edwards was acquitted of one count of corruption . and a U.S District Court judge ruled a mistrial on five other . counts. Outside court, Edwards addressed the media to take responsibility for his sins and personally mentioned Quinn saying: 'My precious Quinn, who I love more than any of you can ever imagine, who I am so close to, so, so grateful for.' Tell-all: Ms Hunter, who has a four-year-old daughter with Edwards, speaks to presenter Chris Cuomo in an interview to air on June 22 . Rielle Hunter was not called to give . evidence in the trial and she has not spoken about her affair with . Edwards and their child Frances Quinn since an interview with GQ in . 2010. She told the magazine at that time: . 'I know he loves me. I have never had any doubt at all about that. We . love each other very much. 'And that hasn't changed, and I believe that . will be till death do us part. The love doesn't go away. It's . unconditional.' Originally hired as a videographer for the Edwards presidential campaign, Rielle Hunter started a romantic relationship with ‘Johnny’ while the two were on the road.

Her own personal narrative is as . fascinating as the ensuing campaign scandal: her father was involved in . the death of her show horse when she was a young girl. She then became a muse for . Manhattan’s 90s literary scene and author Jay McInerney based a . ‘cocaine-addled, sexually voracious’ character on Hunter. Money-maker: Rielle Hunter's book is out on June 26 in the middle of a slew of interviews . By the time she met Edwards in a New York hotel bar in 2006, she was a convert of new age philosophies and mysticism. She walked up to him, said, 'You’re so hot', and ended the conversation . by passing him her business card which read: 'Rielle Hunter: Being is . free'. After the pair began their romantic partnership, she became pregnant and agreed with the plan to have Edwards’ long-time aide Andrew Young claim paternity in an effort to keep Edwards’ political prospects alive. Until now, no one has heard her full version of events after she did not testify during Edwards' trial. Though he was acquitted, the trial exposed a sordid sex scandal that unfolded while Edwards' wife Elizabeth was dying of cancer.

The debris was spotted by Alaska Army National Guardsmen on board a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter flying a routine training mission at around 1pm local time on Sunday, officials from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson said yesterday. 'It looks like it is a military aircraft,' said Air Force Master Sergeant Mikal Canfield, a spokesman for the Anchorage base. No other details about the wreckage were available, he said. Mystery: The remains of a military plane and possibly bones have been spotted on scattered across a glacier in Alaska (file picture) The base called the wreck possibly 'historic' and said the Federal Aviation Administration had issued a temporary flight restriction for the area, but did not elaborate. Nothing has been taken from the site, pending further investigation, Canfield said. At the request of Alaska military officials, the Hawaii-based U.S. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) is trying to plan a recovery mission at the Knik Glacier site near Anchorage, a spokeswoman said.

Thief: Mother-of-four Michela Golden, 31, admitted taking £6,000 from the childcare company and escaped jail . A director of a children's breakfast club stole £6,000 and spent the money on wine and paying for meals out for herself, a court heard. Mother-of-four Michela Golden, 31, took the funds from a not-for-profit childcare company to buy alcohol, clothes, fuel and pay for food. The cash, which was stolen over the course of a year, had been given by parents to pay for children's clubs in Rossendale, Lancashire. When questioned, Golden denied she had taken the money and instead said the founder of Kids@Play Child Care must be responsible, Burnley Crown Court heard. The company, which ran before and after school sessions, was forced to close after the thefts which happened and eight members of staff lost their jobs. Golden, who admitted two counts of theft, escaped jail and was given a 10 month suspended sentence when she appeared before the court. Kids@Play was set-up in 2008 to provide childcare outside school hours and had initially received funding grants from bodies such as Sure Start. Nicholas Courtney, prosecuting, said the thefts started in July 2009 and went on for a year. Golden took control of the company's finances at her own suggestion after they opened a second site in Newchurch, near Rossendale in September 2009. She was issued with a company bank card so she could make purchases on their behalf. But Lindsey Foster, the company's founder, noticed a series of unusual transactions when she looked at the bank statements in April 2010. She also noticed that some of the money parents had given never turned up in their account. A full audit was carried out before Golden was arrested and suspended. When police searched her home in June last year they found paperwork which said the mother had several thousands of pounds in debts and her mortgage and council tax was in arrears. Mr Courtney said that Golden, from Bacup, Lancashire, blamed the company's founder for the missing money. Child care: Kids@Play ran before and after school classes for children in Rossendale, Lancashire . He said: 'She suggested Lindsey Foster may be responsible for missing funds, saying she seemed to be living an extravagant lifestyle at the time. 'Lindsey Foster was very upset by that suggestion, which it seems was made not just to the police in interview, but to various other people.' In mitigation Bob Elias, defending, said the defendant's marriage had failed. He said: 'She has issues both as to her younger years and marriage and possibly alcohol, which would benefit from engaging with a trained individual.' Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Gibson said: 'This was, of course, mean offending. I accept it was to fund household expenditure, at least to a significant extent and it’s right to say there was evidence, when police came to investigate you, of a significant quantity of debt. 'I also accept you had difficulties with an abusive relationship. It’s particularly troubling a great deal of the money appears to have been spent on alcohol.' The judge gave her a suspended sentence . and ordered her to carry out 150 hours unpaid work. She was also given a . 12 month supervision order.","Mother-of-four Michela Golden escapes jail after admitting theft .

BBC weather forecasters have been accused of driving away tourists from seaside resorts with 'alarmist' reports of floods and storms. One holiday park owner in Devon criticised meteorologists for 'trying to cover all eventualities' to avoid a repeat of the infamous 1987 hurricane blooper by Michael Fish. Another, who runs resorts in Suffolk, said staycationers were 'terrified' to come to his sites because of fears their caravans would be left 'bobbing around' on flood water. 'Alarmist': Seaside resorts have accused BBC forecasters of driving away tourists with overly negative predictions, but in some areas such as Bracklesham Caravan Park (pictured) in West Sussex they have proved accurate . Angry: One resort owner in Suffolk said meteorologists were tarnishing the whole country with a 'single wet weather symbol' by making it seem like floods such as this one in a Welsh caravan park would affect all tourist hotspots . They are now asking for weathermen to not tarnish the whole country with a 'single wet-weather symbol' and be 'more careful with their phrasing'. Claire Jeavons, who runs the Beverley Park holiday site in Paignton, Devon, said 'alarmist' forecasts, which often proved groundless, were having a major impact on bookings across the West Country. She said: 'It is already causing holiday-makers to stay away. Just a few days ago we were hearing that all caravan parks in the West Country were on flood alert and this simply wasn't the case. 'We've been receiving many calls from worried customers, but we assure them that flooding at our altitude would also mean the entire English Riviera was hundreds of feet underwater.' 'Trying to cover all eventualities': Waves crash into Porthcawl lighthouse during a storm. Forecasters have been accused of over-egging reports to ensure they don't end up with another 'Michael Fish' incident . Tony Clish, director of Park Holidays UK, which has more than 700 caravans at Felixstowe Beach Holiday Park and Suffolk Sands Holiday Park, said: 'Just last week we were told that all caravan parks in southern England were on flood alert and this simply wasn't the case. 'Some parks in Wales did flood recently, but that's no reason to suggest that caravans in Suffolk would soon be bobbing around on parks which have never flooded before.' He added: 'Coastal holiday parks in Suffolk often stay dry when it is raining inland, yet forecasters frequently tarnish the whole county with a single wet-weather symbol.' BBC weather presenter Tomasz Schafernaker said there was no reason why forecasters would want to 'dampen the sprits or be deliberately pessimistic.' 'Our job to focus of negatives': BBC weather presenter Tomasz Schafernaker said forecasters needed to warn people of any dangers . Mr Schafernaker, who predicts the weather on BBC South East Today, said: 'I understand the frustration and there is a tendency for weather forecasters to emphasise on the negative aspects of the weather. 'It's just that our job is to pick out the most important parts of the weather which can affect people's lives. 'If indeed there's going to be a shower somewhere we need to flag up that possibility.' In 1987, Mr Fish drew stinging criticism when he flatly denied a viewer's claim that a hurricane was about to hit Britain just hours before the Great Storm caused devastation across the country.","They are 'trying to cover all eventualities' over fears of another 'Michael Fish' incident, owners claim ."

Apps have become so cheap, fun and useful that they are actually becoming more popular than the internet, say statisticians. Apps have actually overtaken the Web - the term for sites accessed via web browsers - in terms of the number of minutes users spend per day. It's a huge change for the connected world. A new report from Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project and the Imagining the Internet Center at North Carolina's Elon University says that Apps have actually changed the way we use the internet – and recent statistics back this up. Web killer: There really is an app for just about everything . After all, these days, there really is an . app for everything, from smartphone downloads to keep you entertained . such as Robo Surf to apps that find last-minute accommodation deals such . as Hotel Tonight. Susan Crawford  a Harvard Professor and one of the report’s authors, said: ‘Apps are like cable channels - closed, proprietary, and cleaned-up experiences. ‘I don’t want the world of the Web to end like this. But it will, because people’s expectations have been shaped by companies that view them as consumers. 'Those giant interests will push every button they can - fear, inexperience, passivity, and willingness to be entertained. And we’ll get a cleaned-up world that we can be perfectly billed for. It’s not good.’ Meanwhile, last June, comScore, Alexa and Flurry Analytics measured apps as being viewed more than the Web for the very first time, with 81 minutes on average being spent on an app per day, compared to 74 minutes surfing. Last December, the gap had grown to 94 minutes on apps compared to 72 minutes on the internet. It’s a startling statistic – and the numbers associated with the app business have been hitting some huge landmarks recently. Apple’s App Store hit the 10billion download mark in December, boasts 585,000 apps and receives more than one billion downloads a month, while Google Play (formerly Android Market) is fast catching up with 450,000 apps.

An arrest has been made in the death of a 4-year-old boy whose body was found badly burned and buried beneath his mother's porch on a Michigan Indian Tribe reservation on Thursday. Anthony Bennett, the boyfriend of Carnel Chamberlain's mother, has been charged with beating and dragging the Saginaw Chippewa Indian boy weeks before his death, but not in his murder. Described as a 'wannabe thug,' family members say Bennett, 20, was the last person to see Carnel of the Saginaw Chippewa tribe before his disappearance on June 21. Scroll down for video . Assault: Anthony Bennett, 20, has been charged with assaulting his girlfriend's 4-year-old son who was found dead after missing since June 21 . Bennett has a long history of trouble with the law, bouncing in and out of prison according to WOOD-TV. According to one woman who had previously lived with him, he once killed and burned her granddaughter’s dog. 'We slowly found out he wasn't a good person,' Violet Green who says she knew Bennett for five years told WOOD-TV. On Friday Bennett faced a charge of assault resulting in substantial bodily injury to a child under 16. He was sent back to jail after the brief hearing in federal court in Bay City to await a detention hearing next week. Tragic discovery: The body of 4-year-old Carnel Chamberlain of the Saginaw Chippewa tribe was found on Thursday beneath his mother's porch . Grave: Following an extensive search of the boy's tribal reservation cadaver dogs found him buried beneath this home's porch . Federal prosecutors, who handle major crimes on Indian reservations, do not want him released on bond but would not comment when asked if Bennett was being charged with assault as a way of holding him until a more serious charge is brought. The boy's mother, 21-year-old Jaimee Chamberlain, has said Bennett was in charge of watching Carnel while she was at work. When she returned, the boy was gone and according to police Bennett was uncooperative. According to a family spokesman and the tribe's former chief, Jaimee's cousin Kevin Chamberlain said Bennett had been in her life for about seven months. Criminal past: Bennett, who early into the investigation was not cooperating with search efforts, has a lengthy criminal record and once set a dog on fire according to one woman . He said the family believed Bennett had a 'troubled past' and that he came off as 'a kind of wannabe thug.' 'We have no choice but to believe he had something to do with it,' Kevin Chamberlain said of Carnel's death. 'All eyes and arrows point right to him.' 'Who sets somebody on fire?' Ms Green responded to the child's body's condition, described as 'very badly burned' according to police. 'I want to know, did that boy suffer? Did he set him on fire alive or did he beat him first and then set him on fire?' Abuse: Carnel, seen in his most recent photo, had been abused by Bennett for some time before his arrest on Friday according to the mother . Gather reports neighbours saying they smelled a smokey 'barbecue-like smell' coming from the area of the home the night the boy disappeared. According to the two-page criminal complaint, the boy had knowingly been abused by Bennett for some time before his death but it wasn't reported. Jaimee Chamberlain told the FBI that in late May or early June she saw her son with a bruised and swollen face as well as a cut lip. She said her son had been struck by Bennett when she was away from the home. A few days later, she said she saw Bennett pick up her son by the neck and drop him before dragging him into a room by his foot, according to the court document. Never gave up: A K-9 search and rescue team is seen during the exhausting search that ended on Thursday with the boy's discovery and boyfriend's following arrest . It wasn't known why Jaimee Chamberlain allowed her son to be in her boyfriend's company if she believed he was abusing the boy. She answered her phone when contacted by The Associated Press but hung up without commenting. Bennett did not appear with a lawyer Friday but suggested he might hire one. Authorities declined to comment outside the courtroom. The courtroom Friday was full of people who were there to support Carnel and his mother. 'I'm here for Carnel. I am Carnel,' grandmother Joann Chamberlain said. A tribal police car sat outside the family's house, not far from the headquarters of the Saginaw Chippewa tribe and the tribe's financial lifeblood, the Soaring Eagle Casino and Resort. Future charges: Prosecutors declined to say whether they wished to hold Bennett without bond until a more serious charge is brought against him . People were leaving flowers and items of remembrance for the little boy at the home. At midday, a man got out of a vehicle and placed a stuffed animal on the fence before hopping back in and driving away. 'Nothing this monumentally horrific has ever happened in our community,' Kevin Chamberlain said. 'Right now, it's a very sombre place with a lot of broken hearts.' Carnel's great-aunt, Esther Chatfield, 58, lives next door to the home. She said she and her husband became Jaimee Chamberlain's foster parents when Chamberlain was 8-years-old. 'My husband and I are just destroyed by this,' Chatfield said. Watch the video here: .

Family doctors are being ordered to slash the numbers of patients they send to hospital to earn extra cash. Six out of ten GPs said they face ‘inappropriate’ pressure to refer fewer patients and potentially deny them the best care. The controversial scheme can pay out almost £9,000 a year to surgeries. GPs could get extra cash for not sending patients to hospitals for treatment (picture posed by models) It started last May when ministers brought in a series of targets enabling GPs to  be rewarded for cutting the number of patients sent to hospital specialists or A&E departments. However, a poll of 667 doctors found that 60 per cent were facing ‘inappropriate demands’ from managers. The proposals have left Chief executive of the Patients Association Katherine Murphy 'concerned' The NHS has been told to save £20billion over the next three years, leaving health trust managers looking for ways to cut costs. Primary care trusts are charged for each of their patients who is treated in hospital. One doctor in the survey carried out by GP Newspaper said the scheme was a ‘huge waste of time’ and ‘meaningless Government box-ticking’. Another admitted: ‘If patients knew how much external pressure we were under to keep them out of hospital, they would mistrust our motives.’ And one said he was so dismayed by the system that it was the main reason he had decided to retire. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘Once again, it is patients who are having to bear the brunt of supposed “efficiency savings” in the NHS. ‘Trusts and the Department of Health cannot continue to  pretend that it is business as usual while patients suffer.’ The scheme is part of the controversial Quality and Outcomes Framework target system, whereby practices earn points which are converted into cash. They get 68.5 points if they promise to ‘review’ the numbers of patients referred to hospital. Each point is worth £130.51p, so a practice can earn up to £8,939 a year, which can be ploughed back into running costs or staff pay.","Controversial scheme can pay out almost £9,000 a year to surgeries .

"By . Peter Allen . PUBLISHED: . 11:13 EST, 3 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:55 EST, 3 July 2012 . The home and offices of Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni were today raided by police investigating claims of widespread corruption. Detectives launched a dawn swoop on the Paris mansion where the ex-French president and his former supermodel third wife live. There were coordinated raids on Mr Sarkozy’s new office in the centre of the French capital, and on the law firm which represents him. In the spotlight: Police seized evidence from the home of Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni, and from the former president's nearby offices . Papers and computer discs were seized, along with any other material ‘likely to be of evidential value’, said a police source. All the raids were connected to the so-called Bettencourt affair, in which Mr Sarkozy is accused of accepting cash from L’Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt in return for tax breaks. Judge Jean-Michel Gentil believes that Mrs Bettencourt, France’s richest woman, may have illegally contributed two payments of 400,000 euros (£335,000) each to Mr Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign. Both were traced to Swiss accounts, and one was allegedly received by Mr Sarkozy in person in Paris, in return for offering Mrs Bettencourt tax breaks once he came to power. Numerous witnesses including a butler, nurse and chauffeur have described seeing Mr Sarkozy paying personal visits to the Bettencourt mansion in Neuilly-sur-Seine, the upmarket Paris suburb. Power: Sarkozy is accused of accepting cash from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt in return for tax breaks . The 57-year-old lost his presidential immunity from prosecution in June after losing the election in May to the Socialist Francois Hollande. Mr Sarkozy has insisted that he could not have used illegal cash to fund his election as French President because he did not write about it in his diary. But a judicial source close to the case said: ‘A personal diary is unlikely to have recorded the illegal receipt of cash.’ There is only one official mention of a meeting between Mr Sarkozy, Mrs Bettencourt and her late husband, Andre, in Sarkozy’s diary. It took place on February 24, 2007 - two months before the first round of that year’s presidential elections, but Mr Sarkozy insists it was just a 25 minute ‘courtesy call’. Mr Sarkozy’s close friend and former treasurer and minister, Eric Woerth, is already under examination and facing charges over the affair. Both he and Sarkozy deny any wrong-doing. Mr Sarkozy’s lawyer Thierry Herzog said the former president’s personal diary would prove his innocence, and that his client was going on the offensive ‘to defend himself against accusations made publicly against him for several months.’ Mr Sarkozy is also facing allegations that he profited from illegal arms sales to Pakistan, and that he accepted millions from former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Since being kicked out of the Elysee, Mr Sarkozy is living in Paris permanently with Ms Bruni and their baby daughter, Giulia. The conservative politician is a trained lawyer and had opened an office in Paris from where he was expected to work on his defence to all the allegations. Both Mr Sarkozy and his wife left on a holiday to Canada yesterday, so were not at home during the police raids, said Mr Sarkozy’s lawyer, Thierry Herzog.","Accused of accepting £670,000 from France’s richest woman in return for tax breaks .

Charged: Leonard Jackson, 53, has been charged with the murder of Estella Brantley in 1980 following the discovery of new DNA evidence . A man has been charged with murder after a DNA breakthrough linked him to the body of a woman found strangled in a park more than 30 years ago. The body of 30-year-old Estella Brantley was found lying half-naked on the grass in a park in Bridgeport, Connecticut on October 30 that year. She had been beaten and strangled and was found with a $50 note lying beside her. The identity of the person responsible for her murder remained a mystery for more than three decades. But police have now arrested and charged 53-year-old Leonard Jackson with the killing in the city's Seaside Park, after linking him to her body using new DNA evidence. Jackson, of East Main Street, admitted to the murder after being confronted with the DNA match, according to the police. At the time of the murder officers thought it was one of a string of prostitute killings in the area. 'We want people to know she had a family with two kids who loved her . very much,' said Ms Brantley's daughter, Gwendolyn Brantley, according to the Connecticut Post. She was one of a number of Mrs Brantley's family who attended Jackson's arraignment hearing at the Golden Hill Street courthouse. Jackson was held in lieu of $1million . bond with the case set to continue on August 28. The Police Department's . Cold Case Unit made a breakthrough in the case last July thanks to new DNA evidence which had been preserved from Mrs Brantley's body. The sample was found to match DNA from Jackson, who was then an inmate at Garner Correctional Center in Newtown, Connecticut. He had been arrested in 2006 for illegally disposing of the body of a prostitute who had taken a drugs overdose. According to his affidavit, Brantley said he had begun to hit Mrs Brantley during a walk in Seaside Park. Murders: Police initially thought Ms Brantley's murder was part of a string of killings in the Bridgeport area . He had begun to shout at her for dating another man. Her autopsy revealed she died as a result of being strangled, reports the Connecticut Post. Jackson told police he could not remember whether he had strangled Mrs Brantley but said when he left Seaside Park she was still lying on the ground. He said he was sorry about what had happened. Students at the nearby University of Bridgeport had told officers at the time that they heard a woman screaming in the park in the early hours of the morning, but none of them called the police. Despite his known involvement with prostitutes in the city, Jackson was not considered a suspect in the case until the DNA breakthrough.","Leonard Jackson, 53, 'admits' to the killing after being confronted by police .

Prescriptions for ‘chemical cosh’ drugs to treat hyperactivity have soared four-fold in a decade amid evidence that children as young as three are taking the medication. The number of prescriptions for Ritalin leapt from 158,000 in 1999 to 661,463 in 2010, NHS figures have revealed. Psychologists said they were seeing a sharp rise in the number of children below the age of six, and some as young as three, being prescribed the drug. They also warned dosages were getting stronger, with children increasingly given a powerful ‘kickstart’ dose in the mornings. Ritalin – whose generic name is methylphenidate hydrochloride – can cause nausea, fatigue and mood swings and has also been linked to suicides. Most prescriptions would have been given to those diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactive disorder, with symptoms including an inability to concentrate and restless or impulsive behaviour. The Association of Educational Psychologists surveyed members in the West Midlands and found more than 100 children under six on medication in the area. ‘This is reaffirmed across the country,’ it said. Figures show almost 1.7million children aged up to 16 in England – 21 per cent – were recorded with special educational needs in 2011, up from 19 per cent in 2006. Psychologists also warned that children with behavioural problem were increasingly prescribed Ritalin in conjunction with anti-depressants. Chemical cosh: Ritalin - whose generic name is methylphenidate hydrochloride - can cause nausea, fatigue and mood swings and has also been linked to suicides . This was despite ‘little to no evidence about the effect which these cocktails of drugs are having on the development of children’s brains’. Figures for Ritalin prescriptions were released to Liberal Democrat MP Tessa Munt, formerly a member of the Commons Education Select Committee. She said too much attention was being given to ADHD treatments that involve medication at the expense of natural alternatives that could help combat the condition. ‘It is extremely alarming that in the decade up to 2010, prescriptions for Ritalin quadrupled,’ she said. ‘Statistics show that 90 per cent of prescriptions for this powerful drug in 2004 were used to combat behavioural problems in school-age children.‘I am shocked that there has been such a huge explosion in use.’ She highlighted a report commissioned . by the RSPB that found activities in a natural environment appear to . improve ADHD symptoms compared with playing indoors and playing outdoors . in an urban area. Research: Tessa Munt said the findings were 'extremely alarming' But Mrs Munt said too many youngsters were prevented from enjoying the outdoors due to a lack of school playing fields and the lure of video games and social networking. ‘We hear teachers tell of their students’ lack of ability to concentrate, from police about increasingly disruptive and anti-social behaviour, and from parents unable to control the actions of young family members. ‘We need to show young people how to deal with the normal stresses and strains of growing up. Resorting to powerful drugs only stores up trouble for the future.’ She added that it was difficult to quantify how many children are being prescribed Ritalin. ‘Unless the Department of Health collects vital statistical data about prescribing habits, no one will know what is happening,’ she said. Official figures show that almost 1.7million children aged up to 16 in England - 21 per cent - were recorded as having special educational needs in 2011. This includes the whole spectrum of learning difficulties and physical disabilities including ADHD. Rates had risen from 19 per cent in 2006. Experts claimed last week that poor parenting and weak teaching are contributing to the rise in the number of children labelled as having special needs. Katherine Ann Angel, an experienced teacher of children with special needs, said she believed conditions such as ADHD existed but added: ‘Some of these children have erratic or poor behaviour because of poor parenting - very few books, very poor diet and very late bedtimes.’ Jean Gross, the Government’s former speech and language tsar, said a special needs diagnosis can be ‘used as an explanation for failure’ by schools. ‘One-third of nine and 10-year-old boys have special educational needs (SEN). ‘It’s at that age that schools start to think they are not going to get a level four on their [national tests], so they get labelled as having SEN. ‘Teachers are also worried the child will not get help when they move to secondary school. ‘This is not done out of malice - schools are just trying to explain themselves. ‘It’s a real incentive to do this when schools don’t hit their floor target.’","Number of Ritalin prescriptions leapt from 158,000 in 1999 to 661,463 in 2010 ."

Russian police are seeking to arrest two more alleged members of the female Pussy Riot punk group who eluded them in the controversial cathedral protest against Vladimir Putin. ‘The criminal case is ongoing and a search is under way,’ disclosed a spokesman for the Interior Ministry yesterday. The move to open a new front against the balaclava-clad group - which has brought international outrage against Putin - came as chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov also faced questioning on a police claim that he 'bit' an officer arresting him. Scroll down for video . Search underway: While Maria Alekhina, Yekaterina Samutsevich, and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were sentenced over the controversial protest, Russian police are searching for two more alleged band members . Chess master questioned: Garry Kasparov faced questioning for claims he bit an officer arresting him outside the Moscow court where Pussy Riot were sentenced . But in another development a top member of Putin's government yesterday gave the strongest hint that the two year sentences for hooliganism aimed at inciting religious hatred for Yekaterina Samutsevich, 30, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 22, and Maria Alyokhina, 24, could be reduced on appeal. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, one of Russia's most respected figures in international circles, blasted Western criticism of Russia for their ‘tantrum’ over the case, but gave the clearest indication yet that the three women could be released early. International outrage: Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov suggested band members could have their sentences reduced but blasted Western criticism of the case as a worldwide 'tantrum' Madonna backs band: Among the well-known protestors was Madonna who showed her support during a performance in Moscow earlier this month . 'Hysterical' reaction: Lavrov said protestors should not interfere with the verdict which could see the women serve two years in a prison colony . ‘You may personally agree or disagree with the verdict. But it is unacceptable to interfere with the court,’ he said in Helsinki. Working on appeal: After Miss Tolokonnikova was sentenced with the other members, their lawyer began preparing an appeal . Warned against 'hasty conclusions and hysterical reaction', he said: ‘There is always the appeals option.’ With the group's lawyer's now working on an appeal, Lavrov stressed Putin had recommended leniency for the group members during his London visit for the Olympics. ‘A similar stance was taken by the Russian Orthodox Church,’ he emphasised. His statement ahead of an expected appeal is the most decisive statement from a top member of the Russian government since the women were jailed. But Alexei Navalny, a whistle-blowing anti-corruption campaigner who is emerging as the opposition's most prominent figure, warned yesterday: ‘Putin has decided to put all his opponents behind bars.’ He urged: ‘We have to take to the streets in great numbers. Foreign countries should impose sanctions against Putin's corrupt network. But we'll probably wait in vain for that to happen.’ He claimed the Pussy Riot case highlighted the seriousness of the problem faced by Putin foes. ‘When men are arrested without any legal basis and for political reasons, it's merely a routine, everyday occurrence in Russia, and hardly anyone has any sympathy,’ said Navalny who is facing charges which could jail him for a decade. ‘But until recently, everyone deluded themselves into thinking that the Kremlin wouldn't dare put women behind bars. The women from Pussy Riot have also become symbols partly because this cliche has been shattered.’ Tough stance on opponents: Whistle blower Alexei Navalny warned that president Putin, pictured, 'has decided to put all his opponents behind bars' and urged foreign countries in impose sanctions .","Chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov questioned over police claim he 'bit' officer arresting him .

Two men were arrested on terrorism charges following the discovery of suspected explosives in a garage during raids on two properties in Cheltenham, according to police. Officers arrested a 52-year-old man from the Hester's Way area under the Explosive Substances Act. Fear: Two men were arrested by anti-terrorism officers and bomb disposal experts, pictured, carried out explosions at a cordoned-off garage . Troubling news: Police searched two homes in Cheltenham after 15 neighbours spent the night at a hall and 13 were rehoused . They later found suspected explosives at a house in nearby Up Hatherley and arrested a 31-year-old local man, Gloucestershire Constabulary confirmed. The controlled explosions took place at 11.30am on Saturday, after 15 residents spent the night in a nearby hall and 13 vulnerable people were rehoused. A 200-metre cordon was placed around the garage as bomb disposal teams joined anti-terrorism officers, ambulance crews and firefighters combing the area. Grandmother Sandie Williams, who lives nearby, told a local newspaper: 'This really is a quiet area and we have not really been told anything. We are just half a mile from [intelligence agency] GCHQ so you do worry and they have to investigate it properly.' Resident Ian Boucker said he heard the sirens at around 9.30am. He said: 'I have been afraid and I hope they bring to justice anyone who may have put others' lives at risks.' Mechanic Dave Cumberbatch, 21, who works nearby, added: 'Not a lot happens around here and people are all a bit shocked. It certainly sounds very serious. Disturbance: A 200m cordon was placed around the garage where the suspected explosives were found . 'I imagine the residents are very worried as it really does not happen around here and there are a lot of older people in the area.' ITV correspondent Ken Goodwin tweeted : 'The bangs were like loud gunshots rather that a huge blast. The first was the loudest and interestingly it made my camera shake slightly.' The force’s Assistant Chief Constable Richard Berry said he was grateful to local people for their support and patience during a 'thorough and methodical' investigation. 'At the moment we unfortunately are not able to say when we will be able to lift the cordon,' he added. 'It remains in place for the public’s safety and we have seen that it is justified by the results of the search thus far. Drama: Residents and workers said they were shocked and frightened by the events of the past 24 hours . 'We will endeavour to return the area to . normality as soon as practicable when we can ensure there is no risk of . harm to local residents.' A rest centre has since been set up in St Margaret’s Hall for residents evacuated from their homes and care staff from NHS Gloucestershire are on duty to assist with medication and health concerns. Chief Executive of Cheltenham Borough Council Andrew North, said: 'We understand how distressing this may be for a number of Cheltenham residents, but people should be reassured that we will get things back to normality as soon as possible.' Earlier on Saturday, police confirmed they had re-arrested two men who had initially been detained on Friday evening. Serious danger: Police thanked residents living near the garage for their patience as their homes remained evacuated . Concerns: Officers and emergency services combed the streets, where many older and vulnerable people live . A spokesman said: 'The two men arrested in Cheltenham yesterday, have both been further arrested on suspicion of the commission, instigation or preparation of a terrorist act (contrary to the Terrorism Act 2000).

Walcott, 23, was yesterday named in Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad for the tournament. The Arsenal star was subjected to dreadful monkey taunts along with England's other black players by Bulgarian fans during a previous away game in Eastern Europe last September. Theo's father Don and his brother Ashley, who is a chef, have watched him in action across the world. But yesterday Ashley took to Twitter to say they would be staying away from Ukraine this summer. He wrote: 'Unfortunately my dad n i have taken the decision not to travel to the Ukraine because of the fear of possible racist attacks confrontations (sic). 'Something's aren't worth risking, but begs the question why hold a competition of this magnitude in a place that can not police itself for foreigners of any creed to feel safe, but I'll be watching every minute.' He added: 'Racism has no place in the modern world.' England face France, Sweden and co-hosts Ukraine in the tournament which kicks off next month. They could also face matches in Poland if they get through to the latter stages of the competition. Ukrainian extremists have warned black and Asian England fans not to travel back to the tournament. England boss Roy Hodgson warned yesterday that supporters risk being targeted by right-wing extremists. 'There's no doubt that the issue of racism... hooliganism and violence in Ukraine is obviously a concern for us all - not least the supporters who go over there and risk maybe getting beaten up, or if they don't happen to be white, subjected to a lot of abuse.' Tweet: Ashley Walcott, Theo's brother, wrote yesterday that they will be staying away from the tournament in Poland and Ukraine next month . Theo Walcott became the youngest ever England player in May 2006 at the age of 17. Kevin Miles, from the Football Supporter's Federation, said today that racism is an 'endemic social problem' in the Ukraine. 'Racism has no place in football but it is a social problem in Ukraine,' he said. 'The Foreign Office advice in normal circumstances to citizens of black or Asian heritage is to exercise caution and we reiterate that. 'We are talking about racism as an endemic social problem. There is no question that UEFA (the tournament organisers) takes this issue very seriously and stewards inside grounds are being trained to deal with it. Support: Theo's parents Don and Lynn Walcott. The family won't be travelling to Ukraine to watch him play in Euro 2012 because of the risk of abuse . 'What's more difficult to deal with is away from the football stadium.' The supporters' group have put together a free guide on their website offering advice to fans travelling to the tournament. He added: 'Our advice to fans is is to exercise common sense - stay together and don't wonder too far off the beaten track. 'In city centres and in fan zones it should not be an issue. It is when you go beyond that use common sense and stay together.'

Role model: Goalkeeper Luke McCormick killed two boys aged ten and eight while drink driving but is set to sign for Swindon on his release . A goalkeeper who killed two young brothers in a drunken car crash has been offered a return to professional football. Luke McCormick, 28, is expected to play for Swindon Town FC when he is released from prison next month. Arron Peak, ten, and his eight-year-old brother Ben died when McCormick smashed his Range Rover into their father’s car at 97mph on the M6 in Staffordshire. McCormick, who had played for Plymouth Argyle, was sentenced to seven years and four months in 2008 for causing death by dangerous driving and being twice the drink-drive limit. Under the early release rules, he is due to be freed after serving less than four years. McCormick has been training with Swindon since January while on day release and is set to join the club on a trial basis this summer. The boys' angry father Phil, of Partington, Greater Manchester, who was also seriously injured in the crash, said: ‘We’ve lost two sons as a result of Luke McCormick drinking and driving - yet not even four years on he’s being released from jail and will be back playing the game he loves. ‘Our lads will never play football again. It is so wrong on so many levels. ‘When he’s released he’ll be going on a pre-season tour to Italy - very nice, not a thought for the victims. ‘We are disgusted to find out only now that while he’s been in prison he’s been training with the team. Tragedy: Ben and Arron Peak were killed in a horrific car crash caused by footballer Luke McCormick . ‘We are the injured party here - we’ve lost our sons and I have terrible injuries that I live every day with - yet he’s living it up like nothing has happened. Just how can this be right? ‘If McCormick had just killed one of our sons he may not even have been given a custodial sentence - it’s not real justice at all. ‘Now he’s coming out into a cushy job that he loves. It absolutely stinks. ‘You would have thought managers of high-profile football clubs would have steered clear of him. As far as I am aware he clearly has an alcohol problem.’ His sickened wife Amanda added: 'That is the justice system - the families and the victims are just being forgotten. There is no justice here at all.’ Controversy: Swindon Town manager Paulo Di Canio is giving a trial to Luke McCormick (right) who was been triaining with the club while still in prison . Swindon chairman Jeremy Wray said: 'Our sympathy is with the family of the victims - that will never change. There's been a complete tragedy and lives have been destroyed. 'This guy has done his time in prison. He wants to come back and give something back to society. 'The best way we can do that is to rehabilitate, and that's the role Swindon can play. It's a benefit we've thought about in the long term. Speaking to BBC Wiltshire, Wray added: 'It's going to be a big debate and I'm not frightened of it. 'Luke might have done three and a half years but he undoubtedly wakes up with a life sentence every day and thinking about what he's done. 'Does he try and do something positive with the rest of his life and give something back? If one life is saved in the future because of that, then it's the right action.'","McCormick 'wakes up with a life sentence every day  thinking about what he's done' insists Swindon chief .

R&B singer Ashanti travelled to Atlantic City earlier this month, and came away with $20,000 in her purse. But the Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter wasn’t gambling – in fact quite the opposite. She was making an appearance at Atlantic City High School and speaking to its students. Officials paid her the amount for her June 1 appearance, saying the sum is typical for appearances of her calibre. Scroll down for video . Prized performance: R&B singer Ashanti sang and spoke at Atlantic City's high school . Captive audience: Hundreds of students listened to her perform; she later told them the values of hard work . Singer-songwriter: Ashanti won a Grammy Award in 2003 . The 2003 Grammy winner led assemblies, met privately with a group of middle school students and did an interview with the high school's radio station, according to the Press of Atlantic City, which obtained the Board of Education’s meeting minutes. The Press reported that Ashanti encouraged students to stay in school and work diligently, guided by the support of friends and family. ‘Continue to grind it out,’ she told students during an assembly. ‘Nothing that is worth it is easy.’ Money to pay the performer came from funds in a district budget account designated for the improvement of instructional services. Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum Donna Haye told The Press that the school budgets for special events and officials saw the singer's appearance as 'a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.' She added: ‘(Ashanti) was paid like any other vendor.’ Atlantic City Mayor Lorenzo Langford said that none of the funds were paid by the city or its taxpayers. Backstage: The singer spoke with a local news station after performing; school officials said she was paid the standard fee . Costume change: Ashanti posted pictures of the event, thanking Isiah, left, and Elijah, right; she performed Whitney Houston's I Have Nothing in honour of the late singer . The singer was initially in town for the Multi-Cultural festival, where she performed a section of the ‘R&B Gone but Not Forgotten’ tribute. Ashanti performed I Have Nothing in honour of the late Whitney Houston, sporting a high ponytail and a short metallic dress. On June 2, she posted her thanks on Twitter, writing: ‘Super special S/O to Elijah who’s actually the 1 that help REALLY make it happen today @ AC high.’ Board members decided to bring the singer in during a May 1 meeting – according to the Press, the money was paid from a budget allocated for improving instructional services. A taste of Jersey: Last year, Rutgers University paid Jersey Shore sensation Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi $32,000 to speak at two events on campus; the funds came in part from mandatory tuition fees . Last year, Jersey Shore reality star and pop culture phenomenon Nicole ‘Snooki’ Polizzi travelled to Rutgers University for a two-hour long Q&A session with around 1,000 students  - for the staggering price of $32,000. Some students were outraged that their university shelled out such a sum for someone like Snooki. Student Hina Rehman told Reuters at the time that it was disappointing. ‘The fact that our school spent $32,000 to bring her is ridiculous. It’s fine the money used here is for entertainment purposes, but I think we can get better entertainment than that.’ Rutgers spokesperson Steve Manas told Reuters at the time that while some of the money was from mandatory student tuition fees, other parts came from corporate sponsor PepsiCo. Snooki bestowed a wealth of knowledge to the students, including the gem: 'Study hard, but party harder.'","Board of Education voted to bring Ashanti to Atlantic City High School for $20,000 fee .

Seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin was killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest fired from 'intermediate range', according to reports. An autopsy report reviewed by NBC News claims the Florida teenager, whose alleged killer, self-appointed neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman, is on trial for his murder, also had broken skin on his left ring ringer below the knuckle. The report, prepared by the medical examiner in Volusia County, follows a separate medical report on Zimmerman which found he had a pair of black eyes, a nose fracture and two cuts to the back of his head a day after the fatal February 26 shooting. Evidence: This photo, obtained by ABC News last month, shows the head wounds that George Zimmerman's doctor noted in his medical report . A brawl: Injuries to Zimmerman's face and head, combined with Trayvon Martin's bloody knuckles, reveal a fight between the two that is consistent with Zimmerman's story to police . The medical report issued by Zimmerman's doctor at Altamonte Family Practice revealed on Tuesday bolster the 28-year-old's claims that he was being punched and pummeled by the unarmed teen when he opened fire in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman, who is charged with murder in the killing, claims he acted in self-defense and only shot Trayvon when the teen saw the pistol he was carrying and reached for it. It was then, Zimmerman said, he drew the gun himself and pulled the trigger. On Tuesday, ABC News obtained a medical report from Zimmerman's family, who examined the neighborhood watch volunteer the day after the shooting. Zimmerman wanted to be checked out so he could be cleared to return to work. KFTV in Orland also reported on Tuesday that Trayvon had broken skin on his knuckles when his body underwent an autopsy. The new report contradicts a previous claim by Richard Kurtz, the funeral director who handled the teen's remains, there was no damage on his knuckles. Injuries: This enhanced image taken from surveillance camera footage of Zimmerman shows the bloody wound on the back of his head . Zimmerman's doctor found a 'closed fracture' in Zimmerman's nose, meaning his nose was broken but the skin had not ruptured to expose the nasal bones. He also discovered two cuts on the back of his head, one was one-inch long and the other was a quarter-inch. George Zimmerman could face the death penalty if federal investigators believe the killing of Trayvon Martin was racially motivated. The neighborhood watch volunteer is currently charged with second-degree murder, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. However, WFTV reports the FBI is investigating whether Zimmerman targeted and shot Trayvon out of a hated for blacks. If a federal prosecutor finds enough evidence to charge Zimmerman with a hate crime murder, the maximum penalty is death. Zimmerman also had two black eyes and bruises on his upper lip and cheek. He also complained of lower back pain, according to the doctor's notes, ABC News reports . The injuries are consistent with Zimmerman's account of his encounter with Trayvon. He told police the high school junior approached him and suck-punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. Trayvon then climbed on top of Zimmerman and bashed his head into the sidewalk several times. Zimmerman, 28, told his doctor he was troubled by what happened the night before, saying he experienced 'occasional nausea when thinking about the violence.' The doctor said it was 'imperative' that Zimmerman go to a psychologist he had been seeing to be examined. It's unknown what Zimmerman had sought counseling for in the past. Before the shooting, Zimmerman had been prescribed Adderall, a common psycho-stimulant used treat ADHD, and Temazepam, a sleeping medication. Both drugs cause agitation and mood swings as side effects, though they occur in fewer than 10 percent of patients. Zimmerman claims he followed Trayvon, who was wearing a hoody, when he saw him walking through the gated community when Zimmerman lives. Hiding out: Zimmerman walked out of jail in the dead of night after posting bail and was quickly whisked away to an undisclosed hiding place . Trayvon, who was staying at his father's girlfriend's condo, was returning home after buying at snack. Zimmerman followed the teen in his car and called 911. He then got out of his car, despite the emergency dispatcher saying he didn't need to continue pursuit. Zimmerman claims that's when Trayvon approached him and threatened him. He told police the teen started the fight by punching in him the face. A national uproar resulted in protests across the country after police declined to arrest Zimmerman. Protestors and Trayvon's parents say he was targeted for being black and the Zimmerman went free because he is not black. Building a defense: Zimmerman's lawyers received dozens of documents and other pieces of evidence from prosecutors on Tuesday . Zimmerman was later charged with murder by a special prosecutor who was appointed by Florida Gov Rick Scott. Zimmerman is currently free after posting $150,000 bail. He is currently in hiding after receiving 'thousands' of death threats. On Tuesday, prosecutors 67 CDs with evidence over to defense lawyers. They also released a list of 78 possible witnesses who could be called during the trial. Included in the list are 50 law enforcement officers, including 28 members of the Sanford Police Department. There are also 28 civilians on the list. Among them are Zimmerman's friends and family members. However, the names of 22 witnesses -- mostly neighbors who happened to see or hear part of the confrontation -- had their names redacted from the public list, in an effort to shield them from the international attention that case has received.","The skin on Trayvon's knuckles was broken when his body was autopsied .

Liverpool have suffered their first snub in the search for a new manager - and it has astonishingly come from Brendan Rodgers. The Swansea boss was one of the contenders to replace sacked Kenny Dalglish at Anfield but he has decided to reject the opportunity to talk to owner John W Henry. It is the first setback for Liverpool, who have approached at least four high-profile names, including former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola. The last straw: Swansea boss Brendan Rodgers (right) oversaw Swansea's 1-0 victory over Liverpool in Kenny Dalglish's final match in charge . Anfield officials cast their net as wide as possible in their search to replace Kenny Dalglish by sounding out Guardiola and former England boss Fabio Capello. They have also made formal moves to speak to Roberto Martinez of Wigan, and are considering Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp. A Swansea statement read: 'Swansea City can confirm that an approach from Liverpool FC to speak to manager Brendan Rodgers was officially received by club chairman Huw Jenkins this morning. 'The club is pleased to confirm that Brendan has declined the current opportunity to speak to the Anfield club about the vacant position. 'The Swansea manager is currently working hard to strengthen the squad in readiness for the new Barclays Premier League campaign.' Wanted: Pep Guardiola is free after leaving Barcelona . Top of the pile: Pep Guardiola is hurled into the air after taking charge of his final game at the Nou Camp . Rodgers, 39, signed a new three-and-half-year deal in February, made a huge impression by guiding Swansea to an 11th-place finish in their maiden Premier League campaign. The Welsh club rounded off their season by beating Liverpool 1-0 at the Liberty Stadium, a fixture which proved to be Dalglish's last in charge of the Reds. Swansea's attractive possession style of play also won former Reading and Watford manager Rodgers plenty of admirers, and chairman Huw Jenkins has admitted the Swans will have to become used to their boss being linked with other clubs. Rodgers is due to fly out to Austria this weekend as he gets the chance to spend four days with world and European champions Spain at their pre-Euro 2012 training camp in Schruns, before heading to New York to take in Wales' friendly with Mexico. On the shortlist: Former England boss Fabio Capello has also been approached by Liverpool . Wigan chairman Dave Whelan confirmed he had given permission for Martinez, the bookmakers’ favourite to replace Dalglish, to speak to Liverpool’s American owners Fenway Sports Group. Sportsmail understands the discussions were positive, to the point Martinez is giving serious consideration to succeeding Alex McLeish rather than leaping into the highly-scrutinised role at Anfield. Liverpool have made it clear that Rodgers and Martinez were not the only candidates on their list and they will not rush any decision. The owners are eager to gather as much information as possible before they fill the post and Henry will leave no stone unturned in his bid to find the best man for the job. Guardiola is available after deciding to take a year away from football after a remarkably successful spell at Barcelona. Man of the people: Former Wigan player Roberto Martinez is idolised in Greater Manchester . Didier Deschamps, the Marseille manager who almost succeeded Rafa Benitez in 2010, remains highly-regarded at Anfield, while Borussia Dortmund’s Jurgen Klopp and the Holland national coach Bert van Marwijk also have their admirers. Former Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas could also come into contention. The sense of farce at Anfield deepened as the American owners managed to score another PR own goal over Luis Suarez. Days after sacking the long-serving director of communications Ian Cotton — clearly a casualty of the Suarez debacle — an American journalist who has worked for Sports Illustrated and ESPN called Jen Chang was appointed in the role. But on his Twitter account on December 20 Chang responded to the news of Suarez’s eight-match ban by stating that Patrice Evra, the victim of the racist abuse, should have been charged by the FA too. Seismic proportions: Repercussions from the Luis Suarez-Patrice Evra race row are still being felt . Chang wrote: ‘Suarez decision aside, why is Patrice Evra not getting charged by FA? Evra admits in evidence he used insulting language towards Suarez.’ Whichever manager takes over from Dalglish, the task facing them will be enormous and Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre has admitted the club have to make the biggest decision in their modern history. Ayre expanded on the reasons for ending Dalglish’s 16-month reign and revealed that not even a win in the FA Cup final earlier this month against  Chelsea would have been sufficient to save his job. Wembley woe: Not even an FA Cup victory would have kept Dalglish in charge . Liverpool are seeking their fourth manager in less than two years and Ayre said: ‘It’s absolutely critical we get it right and we move forward. It’s where the club has to be. It’s where everyone wants it to be. ‘When John (W Henry) and Tom (Werner) arrived, they said they wanted to win. You can only live on  history of success for a certain amount of time. I am under no illusion that we can find a top-class  manager to come to this football club.’ On the decision to axe Dalglish, after he had won the Carling Cup and taken Liverpool to within a whisker of following up in the FA Cup, Ayre added: ‘It was a very simple decision based on results and if we believed that was going to change. ‘We were 37 points off the winners (Manchester City), 17 points off fourth (place) and had 14 losses. It was never about an individual result – and rightly so. It was always about taking a review of the stock of the season in full.’ Liverpool’s continued absence from the Champions League, coupled with their failure to challenge at the top of the Barclays Premier League, has led to a dip in their global appeal. A recent survey revealed they are only the fourth most popular English club in South East Asia. This, clearly, will be a defining summer and Ayre knows steps need to prevent Liverpool becoming a relic. He said: ‘That is why it is so critical. That is what everyone is working for. Nobody is looking for average, mediocre progress. We are looking for progress that will get the club back where it needs to be.’ Dalglish’s assistant Steve Clarke offered his resignation out of loyalty but it has not been accepted by the club. Several players, including Suarez, Lucas Leiva and Jamie Carragher, expressed their sorrow that Dalglish had left, but the most poignant tribute came from Steven Gerrard. The Liverpool skipper, who has just been appointed England captain, said: ‘The last 24 hours have been a rollercoaster. Kenny is my idol and always will be.’ Dalglish said on Twitter on Thursday night: ‘Overwhelmed by support of the fans. Always been special but even more so now. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. YNWA and I never have.’","Liverpool fail to lure Northern Irishman for discussions over post .

Jeremy Lin, the New York Knicks basketball star who took the NBA by storm last season, has agreed terms with the Houston Rockets, it was claimed today. The 6ft 3ins point guard has accepted contractual terms with the Texas side, a source close to the deal told the Associated Press. The Knicks star can sign for Houston on July 11, after which his the New York side, who have insisted they want to keep him, will have three days to match his contract terms. Write caption here . The Associated Press reported the development from a source who would not be named, as the Houston Rockets have not officially announced the deal. Other reports suggested that the Knicks are willing to match any contract deal offered to their star point guard. The contract for Lin is said to be worth $10.2 million over the first two seasons and $9.3 million in each of the last two years. The fourth season is a team option. Lin was claimed by the Knicks after the Rockets let him go and soon became New York's starting point guard and 'Linsanity' ensued. High scorer: Lin scored a career-high of 38 . points outplaying Kobe Bryant, as New York held off the Los Angeles . Lakers 92-85 in February . Winning streak: Lin was one of the Knicks' key players last season, averaging 14.6 points a game . He averaged 14.6 points, 6.2 assists and 3.1 rebounds in 35 games with 25 starts before his season was cut short because of torn knee cartilage. The point guard from Harvard, an elite college better known as a springboard to the U.S. presidency than to basketball success, galvanized a struggling Knicks team last season and inspired a craze dubbed 'Linsanity' by New York's tabloids. Lin, the first Taiwanese-American to play in the NBA, rose from total obscurity to hero status after averaging 25.3 points and 8.3 assists in his first three starts, leading the Knicks in victories that captivated the city and Asian-Americans. Rising Star: Lin galvanized the struggling Knicks, launching a craze dubbed 'Linsanity' by New York's tabloids . His hero status grew with a remarkable stretch in February where he scored at least 20 points in nine of 10 games. A high point of that span came when he scored 38 points with seven assists in a 92-85 win over the Lakers on Feb. 10. The Rockets are already popular in Asia because of the career of former star Yao Ming, who retired in 2011. With Yao's retirement, Lin could add to their appeal there as the first American-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese decent.",Knicks prodigy 'accepts $10.2m contract with Houston Rockets'
"By . Beth Stebner . PUBLISHED: . 19:07 EST, 5 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:53 EST, 6 July 2012 . Someone in the Anthony house conducted several suicide-related searches on the family computer, including ‘fool-proof suffocation’ and ‘venturing into the pro-suicide pit’ on the day little Caylee Anthony vanished, Casey Anthony’s defence attorney Jose Baez said. The attorney revealed in his book entitled Presumed Guilty, Casey Anthony: The Inside Story, that the searches were conducted around an hour after Casey’s father George Anthony said she left the home. While last year’s trial famously revealed that the family computer also had searches for ‘chloroform,’ the suicide searches were not revealed, Baez said, because they were discovered after the fact. Casey Anthony's defense attorney: Jose Baez gestures as he speaks about his just-published book Presumed Guilty, Casey Anthony: The Inside Story almost a year to the day she was acquitted . One year on: Casey was sensationally acquitted by a jury last July 5, left, and walked free from jail just over a week later, right . He told Good Morning America: ‘I have . a hard time believing that law enforcement wouldn’t check the internet . history of the day that the child went missing. That would have been . bombshell evidence in the trial if it had come out.’ Jose Baez, Casey Anthony's defense lawyer, has written a tell-all book about the case . Prosecutors claimed Anthony . suffocated Caylee with duct tape so she could spend time with her . boyfriend and be free for Orlando's nightlife. Baez said during the trial - repeated . again in his book - that Caylee accidentally drowned in a family . swimming pool and that her father, George Anthony, hid the body. Baez . also claimed George Anthony sexually abused his daughter. George Anthony denied both . allegations, and there was little brought up about them during the . trial. Baez said the defence wasn't required to put on any such evidence . because proving the case is the prosecution's burden, not the other way . around. George Anthony tried to commit . suicide in January 2009, and was found in a Daytona Beach hotel after . overdosing on prescription drugs. A five-page suicide note was also . discovered at the hotel. Baez told GMA that it was hard to . determine who in the Anthony family conducted what searches on January . 16, 2008, but said it was possible to infer who searched what, based on . the terms searched. For instance, one of the terms . searched was ‘foolproof suffocation.’ Baez noted that the terms were . spelled incorrectly, and that George struggled with good spelling. He wrote in his book: ‘By looking at . the websites being researched, all concerned with suicide and death, it . certainly appears that the one who felt the blame was a guilt-ridden . George Anthony.’ Evidence and testimony showed that . Anthony was a habitual liar, even making up fake friends and pretending . every day to go to a job she didn't have. Baez was asked whether . Anthony's lies surrounding her daughter's disappearance might be . indicative that she was guilty. Troubled: Casey's father, George Anthony, seen in court last June, attempted suicide in 2009; Baez pontificates that the suicide searches could have been his . Counsel: Defence attorney Jose Baez talks to . Casey Anthony during her trial when the jury heard her father say . her car smelled of human decomposition. Baez revealed in his book he also thought he could smell a dead body . Innocent: Mystery surrounds the cause of Caylee Anthony's death after her mother was acquitted of her murder one year ago today . 'I don't think the lies are . indicative of innocence or guilt,' he said. 'The lies were there long . before Caylee passed away.' In the book, he says Anthony had built a . 'fantasy world,' and her lies weren't evidence of guilt but signs of . someone with 'serious mental health issues.' Baez said one piece of prosecution . evidence he was most concerned about was that police cadaver dogs had . indicated a body may have been in the trunk of Anthony's car at one . point and also that a body may have been in the backyard. None was . discovered in the backyard and there was nothing but rotting bags of . trash in the trunk. But, he said, people - and jurors - believe in dogs. 'That concerned me a little bit. Most people really think dogs can do magic,' Baez said. He also strongly considered early in the case whether she should plead guilty to . a lesser charge to avoid the death penalty if convicted of murdering . her two-year-old daughter Caylee, but Anthony adamantly insisted she had . nothing to do with the toddler's death. New Look: The last time the public saw Casey was when this video was released in October. She is said to be living in Palm Beach, Florida . 'Found': West Palm Beach, Florida, where Casey Anthony is reported to be staying with a friend . Baez said . prosecutors offered in 2008 to allow Anthony to plead guilty to . aggravated manslaughter of a child and serve up to 13 years in prison. He said that in those early days he thought taking it might be in . Anthony's best interest. 'There were times, difficult times, . when the evidence didn't look good for Casey,' Baez said, adding that it . was his obligation as a lawyer to convey any such plea offers. The prosecution's flaw, he added, was . that regarding the car search the dog and handler were focused only on . Anthony's vehicle and did not include others in a lineup to give the dog . options. Overall, Baez attributed the strong . public backlash against the jury's verdict to a lack of understanding . about the judicial system and because 'a lot of people bought into the . hype' that Anthony must have been guilty. He noted that jurors who gave . media interviews after the trial said they waited for weeks for strong . evidence that never came. 'We need to talk about whether an actual murder occurred,' he said. 'That's where the focus should have been, and it never was.' Baez declined to comment on what . Anthony is doing these days and on how often he talks to her. He said he . promised her confidentiality when she agreed that he could write his . book, in which she did not participate. Anthony is living in an . undisclosed location in Florida serving probation for an unrelated . conviction, which Baez said ends on August 21. Parents: George and Cindy Anthony both lied to cover up what really happened to Caylee, claims Baez . 'She's doing a lot better than she was in prison,' Baez said, but then added: 'She's a prisoner of her own freedom.' Anthony, he said, 'would not . entertain it for a second'. As he became more familiar with the state's . mostly circumstantial case, Baez said he grew convinced she would be . acquitted by a jury – as she was a year ago today of all charges except . for four misdemeanors of lying to investigators. 'There was nothing in the trial that . ever made me think Casey was guilty of anything as related to the . murder,' Baez said. 'Every single piece of evidence favored us.' In his book, Baez also lashes out at . several entities - calling the media a 'monster', the police 'careless' and the prosecution 'scheming and ruthless'. He wrote: 'This was not real life, it was the media's Casey Anthony . reality show, a show that depended on name-calling and controversy for . television ratings.'

A ten-year-old boy with cerebral palsy who learned to walk just two years ago took part in a triathlon to raise hundreds of pounds for a girl with the same condition. Aspiring paralympian Jack Lawrence is so delighted with his progress since undergoing a groundbreaking operation in 2009 that he wants to spread the word and help others walk like he does. The selfless schoolboy ran half-a-mile, cycled half-a-mile and did 25 lengths in his local swimming pool in Filey, North Yorks., to raise 832 pounds to help India Robertson, 11, reach her fundraising goal for the procedure in America. His delighted mother, Debbie, 48, said: 'It was so wonderful to see Jack do all these events, he looked marvellous running down the street, it is nothing short of a miracle. 'He loved doing the event, he felt like an Olympic athlete. He now wants to compete in the Olympics when he’s older. 'He is so pleased with his progress that when he sees anybody else with the condition he tells them about what has happened to him so they will be able to walk too. 'He was determined to help someone else and he’s really happy he’s helped India so she can hopefully walk like him too.' Proud father Chris, 38, said: 'There was no struggling at all throughout the triathlon. He took a short break during the swim but he took it all in his stride. 'On his jog, which he finished as the first stage, he said he wished he could have gone further. 'The cycling part he thought because it was downhill it was too easy and he wanted a bit more of a challenge. 'He is full of energy. Apart from a slightly quirky walk he is just the same as anybody else.' It’s . astounding to think that just two years ago Jack couldn’t walk without . the aid of his walker or his wheelchair, and he would get around his . home on his hands and knees. Spirited: The brave ten-year-old completes a triathlon, next to his father Chris, to raise money for India Robertson, 11, who also suffers from the same condition and hopes to have the same procedure as Jack . Jack was born with cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy is an umbrella term covering a number neurological conditions that affect a child's movement and coordination. Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to . the brain, which normally occurs before, during or soon after birth. It is estimated that 1 in every 400 children in the UK is affected by cerebral palsy. Approximately 1,800 babies are diagnosed with the condition each year. It does not develop as the sufferer gets older - but it can put a great deal of strain on the body, which can cause problems in later life. Altohugh Jack underwent a groundbreaking operation which means he can now walk, there there is no cure for cerebral palsy. A range of treatments can help relieve symptoms and increase a child's sense of independence and self-esteem. These include physiotherapy, occupational therapy and medication to relieve muscle stiffness and spasms. Source: NHS Choices .

Vulnerable: Gareth Williams (above) may have left himself open to blackmail after making illicit searches on secret MI6 files, his inquest heard . An illegal party drug was found in tests on body-in-the-bag spy Gareth  Williams, an inquest heard yesterday. Scientists said their investigation revealed a small trace of GHB, a dangerous sedative popular in the clubbing and gay scene. They also refused to rule out poisoning because Mr Williams’s body was so decomposed that a host of potential killing agents including cyanide, insulin and chloroform would have been undetectable. The spy’s family fear the failure of MI6 bosses to raise the alarm for seven days after he went missing deprived police of opportunities to solve the riddle of his death in August 2010. His body quickly began to decay after being padlocked inside a sports holdall in the bath of his Pimlico flat in central London. His curled-up, naked body was found uninjured and he did not try to escape. The fourth day of the inquest into his death also heard the high-flying code-breaker’s eccentric private life was no barrier to his secret work. A senior MI6 officer suggested his superiors knew about his collection of women’s designer clothing, love of transvestite comedy and visits to bondage websites. Speaking from behind a screen, a top official, known only as SIS F, said Mr Williams was known for his ‘world class’ work at GCHQ, the Government listening post. The family’s lawyer Anthony O’Toole asked SIS F whether ‘revelations about Gareth’s private life might have rendered him unsuitable’ for MI6. She replied: ‘There is no set template for what their lifestyle should be. 'Individuals have lifestyle and sexual choices and preferences which are perfectly legitimate.’ Scroll down for videos . Difficult time: Gareth Williams' mother, Ellen, arriving at Westminster Coroners' Court this morning for the fourth day of her son's inquest . 'Communication breakdown': A senior manager at MI6 (pictured) apologised for not raising the alarm until the 31-year-old codebreaker had been missing from work for a week . The inquest heard Mr Williams made a . ‘small number’ of illicit searches on the MI6 database that could have . left him vulnerable to blackmail by foreign agents. But colleagues said there was no evidence he was targeted by a foreign power. His family fear the ‘dark arts’ of the . secret services may have been involved in his death or in a cover-up. The MI6 officer apologised for the failure to act when punctual and . reliable Mr Williams did not show for work. Unsolved: Coroner Fiona Wilcox has said that . whether Mr Williams was alive inside the North Face bag like this one . and locked it himself 'was at the very heart of this inquiry' Mystery: Mr Williams was found dead locked . inside a holdall in the bath of his flat . Family members stormed out of the . hearing sobbing after Mr O’Toole accused the secret service of ‘total . disregard’ for his safety. Denise Stanworth, a forensic . scientist, said samples from Mr Williams’s body had been subjected to . almost every test imaginable for evidence of suspicious substances and . none was found. Speaking about the party drug, she . said she could not completely rule out that the spy had taken GHB but in . her opinion it was unlikely. She said it was far more likely to have been produced naturally following death. The inquest continues. Being tracked? Mr Williams is caught on CCTV in Holland Park on August 14, 2010, just over a week before his naked and decomposing body was found locked in a bag in his Pimlico flat .

The agency sued Hansen to deter others from doing anything similar and to show the Russians that 'you cannot do this in America and get away with it,' Mr Crain said. 'It has certainly caused concern on the part of Russian officials that unless there are consequences when a parent abandons a child placed in their home, there's a need for safeguards to make sure this never occurs,' he added.

The judge said in his order that when Hansen adopted the boy she signed a contract acknowledging that it was possible the child could have physical, emotional or behavior problems that were unreported and even unknown to the adoption agency. Lee said $58,000 of the $150,000 will pay for the past two years' worth of support and medical fees for the boy in Russia. Court documents say the boy was hospitalized for three weeks after he returned to Moscow, but they do not say what he was treated for.

The judge heard Fisher first touched the terrified schoolgirl when she was nine. She told her mother about the attack but nothing was done about it, the court heard. But the twisted predator attacked her again over a year later when she was 10. Robert Sadd, prosecuting, said the victim's quick thinking prompted her to reach for her games console and use the camera on her Nintendo DS to capture the assault. Fisher, of Lowestoft, Suffolk, was caged after he admitted two offences of sexual assault in January 2010 and November 2011. He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register indefinitely. Fisher was made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order, restricting his contact with children under the age of 16 for the next ten years.

A second woman has been arrested on Thursday night as the third suspect in connection with the killing of the young wife of a U.S. Marine at Camp Pendleton. Dorothy Grace Marie Maraglino, 36, of Fallbrook, California, was taken into custody at a hotel in downtown San Diego, Sheriff Bill Gore said in a written statement. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service assisted in the arrest, according to the statement. Mystery suspect: Dorothy Grace Marie Maraglino (pictured) was arrested in San Diego in connection with the April murder of 22-year-old Brittany, Dawn Killgore . Gore said that Maraglino was taken into custody as a result of information and evidence obtained during the ongoing investigation into Brittany Dawn Killgore's death. Killgore, 22, was last seen April 13, three days after she filed for divorce from her husband, Lance Corporal Cory Killgore. Her body was found in brush near Lake Skinner on April 17. Authorities did not mention what role investigators believe Maraglino played in the alleged murder. The 36-year-old was ordered held without bail. She is expected to be arraigned on Monday at the Vista branch of San Diego County Superior Court . The other suspects in the killing are Maraglino's boyfriend, Louis Ray Perez, 45, a . Camp Pendleton Marine staff sergeant, and Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, who . was a roommate of Perez and Maraglino. Both have pleaded not guilty to . murder. During Perez's arraignment in April, prosecutors revealed that Killgore met him for a night out after she filed for divorce. Another woman was supposed to join them, but canceled last minute. During their date, however, something apparently went awry. ‘She sent a text saying, 'Help,'' said Patrick Espinoza, a deputy San Diego County district attorney. ‘She was missing from that point on.’ According to Espinoza, investigators found Killgore's blood and a weapon in Perez's car. He also said Perez told investigators he dropped off Killgore in downtown San Diego's Gaslamp District, but investigators concluded that he lied about his whereabouts and stayed about 60 miles north in Fallbrook, where Killgore lived. Authorities said Killgore's body was found hours after paramedics were called to a San Diego motel and found Lopez with self-inflicted cuts and a suicide note. Tragic: The body of Brittany Killgore was discovered on Tuesday, four days after she was last seen with a marine who was later arrested on an unrelated charge . Suspect: Authorities believe that the victim knew Jessica Lynn Lopez (pictured here), and the two were involved in some kind of sex slave ring . While authorities would not elaborate . on the nature of the relationship between Lopez and the victim, Lopez's . neighbor claims she and Mrs Killgore were involved in a dangerous sex . ring, playing sex slaves. According to online profiles cited by the San Diego Union-Tribune, Perez and Maraglino were also involved in sadomasochism and bondage. The prosecutor said Lopez and . Perez once lived together but didn't indicate when or where. Lopez lives . a mile from Killgore's second-floor apartment overlooking Camp . Pendleton.It is still unclear how Killgore died. Cory Killgore has not been named as a suspect or person of interest in the killing. The couple married in July of 2010. Lopez's attorney Dean Broyles said he . didn't know if his client knew Perez or Mrs Killgore, who was reported . missing one day after Lopez turned 25. 'There's a lot of speculation, a lot of innuendo, a lot of weak allegations and charges out there,' he said. 'I would caution everyone to not jump to conclusions and prejudge based on all the information flying around right now.' Suicide attempt: Jessica Lynn Lopez was found with numerous self-inflicted stab wounds on her body at this Ramada Inn near the San Diego Airport .

'We ask that you pray for all of those impacted by this tragic situation, including our family.' Authorities have not disclosed Mrs Killgore, Lopez, and Perez are connected. A neighbour, who declined to be identified, told ABC 10 that both Lopez and the victim took part in some kind of sex ring. She said: 'They're into the sex slave things... I try not to judge, but that's what they're into.' Missing: Brittany Killgore lived in Fallbrook, California, not far from Camp Pendleton US Marine base . Perez, 45, had initially pleaded not guilty to stealing a AR-15 rifle from Camp Pendleton, but was re-arrested on April 24 and charged with Killgore's death. Lopez's bail was set at $3 million.

County about 25 miles northeast of her modest, two-story apartment in . Fallbrook, a San Diego County community known for its avocado orchards. Killgore lived a short walk from an . entrance to Camp Pendleton, and her complex - like others around it - is . full of Marines and their families who tend to be short-term residents . and often don't get to know each other well.

Authorities investigating the homicide said a suicide note . of the prime suspect contained key details about the case, including . the location of a body. Serious: The Fallbrook scene where Louis Ray Perez is being questioned in connection with the disappearance . Authorities in California are now reportedly examining a possible link between Killgore, the suspect, and a seedy sex ring. ABC 10 reported that officers later responded to a Ramada Inn near the San Diego Airport, . where they found a woman with stab wounds all over her body in an . apparent suicide attempt. That woman, 25-year-old Lopez, was arrested at the scene but hospitalized at UCSD Medical Center. Cory Killgore was deployed to Afghanistan earlier this year as a vehicle operator.

Prison: Peter Jee has been jailed for two years for engaging in a sex act with a vulnerable woman he knew had mental health difficulties . A married police officer has been jailed for two years for getting a vulnerable woman who had threatened to kill herself to perform a sex act on him. Peter Jee 38, who was a Greater Manchester Police sergeant at the time, committed the crime after she dialled 999 and he drove her home. Jee was one of three officers responding to the call from the confused woman who was threatening to take her own life. Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court was told she had taken a mix of drink and medication and just wanted police to take her home. Having satisfied themselves that she was in no danger, the officers had left her house in Rochdale. But Jee returned, minutes later, when he was sure his two colleagues had driven off and got the woman to perform a sex act on him as he fondled her. He was caught out after making what he thought had been discreet admissions to three colleagues - and from DNA found at the scene. The court was told that at first he denied he had even gone back to the house, and later claimed his victim had ‘come on’ to him. After the woman made an official complaint, Jee used police computer equipment to see how close he was to being arrested. Jee, who is married with children, later sent a text message to a colleague saying: 'I’m going to resign. It’s all my fault.' Jailing him, Judge Timothy Mort said: 'You went to this address as a serving police officer in uniform, with a very high degree of trust placed in you. Vulnerable: The woman had dialled 999 and had taken drugs and been drinking before Jee accosted her . 'You abused that trust to take advantage of her vulnerability to satisfy your own sexual needs, and you realised that you might be able to get away with it because of your position.' Jee - who was in the top three per cent in the country in his sergeant’s exams - had been arrested on suspicion of rape, but the Crown later accepted a guilty plea to a charge of misconduct in public office. His victim was described as having a bi-polar illness, which can make her appear at times elated, or in a low mood. Alcohol complicated her symptoms. When officers arrived she was drunk, was slurring her words, and couldn’t walk without stumbling. When asked why she had not made an immediate complaint, she said: 'Who would have believed me?' His victim told police that the incident had had a significant impact on her life, she suffered panic attacks, and she could no longer trust police officers. Michael Lavery, defending, said Jee’s greatest shame had been to have been arrested in front of his family. His main concern now was the impact on his children. Judge Mort added: 'What possessed you to go back to the address I just don’t know. You knew there were problems, and it should have been a clear red traffic light.' Deputy Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, said: 'Jee’s inexcusable actions let everyone down: those that we protect and those that work selflessly to deliver policing across Greater Manchester. The sentence given sends out a clear message that society expects the highest standards from those who have a duty to protect them.'","Peter Jee returned to the victim's house in Rochdale after he knew that his colleagues had left the scene .

Put in the graft: Top chef Marcus Wareing criticised young cooks for chasing 15 minutes of fame on television shows . Top chef Marcus Wareing has criticised young cooks for chasing 15 minutes of fame on television shows like MasterChef. Wareing, whose restaurant at The Berkeley has two Michelin stars, said trainees needed to put in hours of graft because being on TV was not the key to success. The 41-year-old, speaking at the launch of Aalto restaurant at Birmingham’s new £24million Hotel La Tour, said his name was not attached to the eatery because diners no longer bought into celebrity chefs in the same way. He also runs The Gilbert Scott at St Pancras in London but only cooks at Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley. Asked about his biggest gripe, Wareing said: 'Young chefs who want to be at the top, . but don’t want to put the work in,' he said. 'Young people come into your kitchen . judging you rather than us judging them. 'If it carries on the way it is there’s . going to be no future. There’s no two ways about it, you put the graft . in whether you like it or not.' He said the BBC’s MasterChef, presented by Gregg Wallace and John Torode, was a 'brilliant' show. But he added: 'They can turf out as much as they like. The key to success is longevity, not a five-minute trip on television, five-minute wonder. 'I have more cooks coming to me now . wanting to know how many hours are they going to do, how many shifts is . it, what are we going to get paid, how many holidays is it? 'You know what, do me a favour, mate. I’ll do it myself. I’d rather do it myself than have some a***hole stand . in my kitchen and think he’s better than me or bigger than me.' Fame hungry: Wareing said many new recruits thought they could make it to the top simply by appearing on a show like MasterChef, presented by Gregg Wallace and John Torode . The award-winning chef, who has devised Aalto’s menu and supervised the training of staff, was a protege of notoriously bad tempered celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay. Wareing ran Petrus at The Berkeley on behalf of Ramsay, before he took complete control, resulting in a bitter legal feud with his former mentor, who was also his best man. Wareing later told Waitrose Food Illustrated magazine that Ramsay was a 'sad b*****d', adding, 'if I never speak to that guy again for the rest of my life, it wouldn't bother me one bit.' Now, he has called for change in the food world as a whole. 'The industry needs to stop and close . the door,' he said. 'We need to clamp down. Gourmet experience: Wareing, whose restaurant at The Berkeley, pictured, has two Michelin stars, said diners no longer bought into celebrity chefs in the same way . 'There’s a recession on out there at the . moment. It’s not easy. And young people haven’t got a clue. 'If I stood 10 or 15 people in front of . me between the ages of 16 and 21 and asked them to tell me about the . depth of the recession, the biggest percentage won’t know. Wareing said he offered advice to his chefs and front-of-house team. 'I try to wake them up to the reality of life and the world outside,' he said. 'My message to anyone that comes to work with me is if you aren’t prepared to put the effort in go and find a job elsewhere.'","Restaurateur said 'a five-minute trip on TV' was not key to success .

Linebacker: Andrew Sweat, a standout at Ohio State University, says he won't play in the NFL . A college football standout is causing a fan frenzy after deciding that he would rather hit the books than opposing players. Andrew Sweat, a talented linebacker at Ohio State University, was brimming with excitement when he was offered a free-agent deal with the Cleveland Browns last month, but has since changed his mind. Sweat, 23, announced that he is now declining the offer, saying that he cares more about his own well-being than a career in the gridiron. He took to Twitter on Monday morning, telling his followers: 'Concussion symptoms didn't want to risk it.. Thanks to the Browns for the opportunity. Health trumps football any day'. Instead, Sweat will enroll in law school - and he's got five to choose from, The Columbus Dispatch reported. While many football fans praised Sweat for his decision and offered their support, others could not help but shake a finger at the young athlete. Among them was Elie Mystal, an editor at AbovetheLaw.com, who wrote in a blog post that Sweat was making ‘the biggest mistake of his life.' Mystal also drew comparisons between a lawyer drowning in student loan debt to a rookie football player making at least $390,000 a year.

Speaking to StlToday.com two weeks ago, Bell said: 'I don't want to be at the point where I'm jeopardizing my true health for money pretty much - for money and for celebrity.' Likewise, health is a major concern for Sweat, who was sidelined for most of last season with a concussion and an injured elbow. He told the Cleveland Plain Dealer last month: 'I was hurt my whole senior year… I'll let my actions speak for themselves and go out and play.'

With the final words of 'I regret nothing' a defiant Arizona killer who asked for no mercy, shunned a clemency hearing and railed against immigrants in his 1993 sentencing, was executed on Wednesday. Thomas Kemp, 63, was put to death by lethal injection and declared dead at 10:08 a.m. local time inside the state prison in Florence, about 60 miles southeast of Phoenix, seven minutes after the execution began. For his last meal Kemp had a cheeseburger, french fries, root beer, and boysenberry pie with strawberry ice cream. Arizona executed Thomas Kemp on Wednesday for the 1992 kidnap and murder of a community college student. His last words were 'I regret nothing' Kemp was sentenced to death in July 1993 for, along with an accomplice, snatching  for community college student Hector Soto Juarez from outside his Tucson apartment, taking him to a mine northwest of the city, and forcing him to disrobe. Juarez, 25, was shot fatally in the head. The former trailer park maintenance man has consistently showed no remorse about the killing, refusing to attend a hearing this month by the Arizona Board of Execution Clemency. He branded the proceeding a 'dog and pony show.' Inside the execution: Kemp died by lethal injection in the chamber seen here and declared dead at 10:08am . At his 1993 sentencing, Kemp said his only regret was not killing his accomplice and unleashed a tirade against Mexican immigrants and the legal system, saying his victim was 'beneath my contempt.' 'If more of them wound up dead, the rest of them would soon learn to stay in Mexico, where they belong,' Kemp said at his sentencing, according to court documents. 'I spit on the law and all those who serve it.' Kemp and his partner, Jeffrey Logan, set the crimes in motion by buying a .380 semiautomatic handgun from a pawn shop days before the abduction. Late on July 11, 1992, the men took Juarez from the apartment parking lot. At midnight, the two withdrew $200 with Juarez's bank card and drove him to the Silverbell Mine area. Kemp was put to death by lethal injection in Florence, Arizona. He is the third execution in the state so far this year . Kemp walked his victim 50 to 70 feet from the vehicle, made him take off his clothes and then shot him twice, testimony showed. Kemp and Logan drove to Flagstaff, Arizona, where they sold their now repainted vehicle and bought another gun. The two then kidnapped a couple and forced them to drive to Durango, Colorado, where the husband and wife were sexually assaulted. The couple escaped after driving to Denver, and Kemp and Logan soon separated. Logan was arrested after contacting Tucson police about the Juarez murder. Kemp was taken into custody at a homeless shelter in Tucson. Kemp was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnapping and armed robbery. Kemp's execution was the third in Arizona this year and the 94th since 1910 .",Thomas Kemp killed community college student Hector Soto Juarez in Mexican hate crime .

Authorities say a longtime security supervisor at a New Jersey airport has been arrested on a charge he was using the identity of a New York City man who was murdered 20 years ago. Illegal immigrant Bimbo Olumuyiwa Oyewole, 54, of Nigeria, was arrested on Monday at his home in Elizabeth. His co-workers knew him as Jerry Thomas, a man who was murdered in New York City in 1992, the same year Oyewole allegedly assumed his name when he started working at the airport. It wasn't immediately clear how Thomas' personal information was acquired. Scroll down for video . Busted: Bimbo Olumuyia Oyelwole, or Jerry Thomas (as he was known at work) was arrested on Monday after an anonymous tip to Port Authority police . The Port Authority of New York and New . Jersey says Oyewole had worked at Newark Liberty International Airport for . about 20 years and had passed background checks. Oyewole allegedly had all the documents he needed, including a birth certificate and a social security card. He had worked under several contractors at the airport, most recently FJC Security Services. A message left Monday on Oyewole's . home phone was not immediately returned, and the Port Authority said it . wasn't sure if he had retained an attorney. FJC Security, which received an . airport contract in 2003, said it conducted a background check on the . guard as had New Jersey state police and U.S. Customs and Border . Protection. FJC spokesman Michael McKeon said: 'In . all cases, he passed the background checks. 'During his time with FJC, . he had nothing in his record or his performance to indicate a cause for . concern or a reason to question the state police and federal . government's background checks.' NorthJersey.com reported that the suspect supervised over 30 security guards and was allowed access to secure areas. Authorities told the website that it appears he was using the bogus identity so that he could stay in the U.S. Security threat? Bimbo Olumuyiwa Oyewole, who worked at Newark Liberty airport, allegedly used the ID of a New York City man murdered in 1992 . While it doesn't appear that the arrest is terrorism-related, the arrest exposes a disastrous lapse in airport security. Nigeria is also the origin of the underwear bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who was convicted of trying to blow up a U.S.-bound jet on Christmas Day 2009. An investigation by the Port Authority Inspector General's office was reportedly sparked by an anonymous tip about Oyewole. Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman told NorthJersey.com: 'The IG's office is looking into how he obtained the documents to maintain another person's identity.' He was due in court later Monday to face charges including identity theft. Access: Oyewole reportedly supervised over 30 security guards and was allowed inside secure areas at the airport . In a statement, the TSA said it was reviewing the Port Authority's procedures for validating employee and contractor documents. 'This . investigation indicates that the individual's identification documents . were presented to the Port Authority for verification about a decade . before TSA existed,"" the statement said. State police spokesman Lt. Stephen . Jones said New Jersey requires security guards to undergo training under . the Security Officer Registration Act and be fingerprinted. The fingerprints are run through the state police criminal history database before a guard is certified. A candidate is disqualified if he or she has a conviction for a fourth-degree offense or higher or a drug offense of any level, Jones said. Oyewole, as Thomas, was certified under SORA, he said. A spokesman for Customs and Border Protection didn't immediately return a message seeking comment Monday. An airport employee who was familiar with Oyewole as Thomas said the private security guards he supervised are responsible for manning TSA security checkpoints after passenger gates close for the evening and before they reopen in the morning. The guards also inspect delivery vehicles for possible unauthorized cargo, he said, speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the matter. A search of public records found evidence of a Bimbo Oyewole and a Jerry Thomas living at the address where Oyewole was arrested. A report released Monday by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General found that only 42 per cent of reported security breaches from January 2010 to May 2011 led to corrective action, though it also found TSA had worked to improve its response.

The death of a Harvard Business School student who vanished on Sunday after drinking with friends in a bar has been ruled an accidental drowning. Nathan Bihlmaier, 31, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, disappeared after leaving the Ri Ra Irish Pub in Portland, Maine, where he was celebrating his upcoming graduation with two friends. His body was pulled out of a nearby harbor by divers on Tuesday afternoon after clothing that belonged to the 31-year-old was found the day before. Vanished: Harvard student Nathan Bihlmaier, 31, was last seen by the Portland waterfront late on Saturday night. He is pictured with his wife, Nancy . Last seen: He and two friends had visited the Old Port area before Mr Bihlmaier vanished around 1am, divers found a body there today . The state medical examiner ruled Mr Bihlmaier's death an accidental drowning on Wednesday. Portland Police Chief Michael Sauschuck had earlier confirmed the identity of the body, saying: 'It’s a tragic end.' He added: 'We had high hopes throughout working with the family and the community to bring Nate home. These weren’t the circumstances that we wanted to.' Police said Mr Bihlmaier was separated from friends after being asked to leave the waterfront bar at 12:20am on Sunday because he was intoxicated. He later failed to return to his hotel. Found? A missing poster of Nathan Bihlmaier, 31, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, is seen today in Portland, Maine. Police have yet to confirm the identity of the body . His wife is pregnant with their first child. He was due to graduate on Thursday. Police told the Portland Press Herald that Mr Bihlmaier and his two friends traveled to Portland for the weekend to celebrate their graduation from business school. Police confirmed that he had 'a little bit too much to drink' when he was asked to leave, but added that he did not cause a disturbance while leaving the bar. Concerned: Mr Bihlmaier's pregnant wife, Nancy Hi Bihlmaier, pictured with her husband at right, rushed to the coastal city after receiving the news of his death . 'At that point he left the bar very cooperatively,' police chief Michael Sauschuck said, according to the Bangor Daily News. 'There were no altercations - he just left voluntarily after being spoken to by bar staff.' He spoke to his friends on the phone, but never returned to the hotel where they were staying. They searched for him to no avail and reported him missing at 9am. 'He is a well-established individual from a strong family. He has a wife who is expecting their first child. There is no reason he would [purposely] go missing,' Lt Gary Hutcheson told the Press Herald. Family: Mr Bihlmaier, originally from Kansas, with his wife Nancy and his parents Cheryl and Steve . According to his cell phone records, Mr Bihlmaier did not venture far. Police tracked his movements through his phone signal after he left the bar until his battery apparently died 40 minutes later. The Coast Guard and the Portland harbormaster worked together with police to launch the underwater hunt for clues. They even used a cadaver dog on an inflatable raft to search for the man's scent. His pregnant wife, Nancy Hi Bihlmaier, rushed to the coastal city after receiving the news that her husband was missing, as did around 20 of his business school friends.

A teenager who survived being shot by Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik told his trial that she heard him 'scream a battle cry' as he rampaged around a cafe building shooting dead 13 people. Ingvild Stensrud, 17, who was shot in the leg and shoulder, said she sought refuge in the summer camp's cafe on the island of Utoya, hiding behind a piano, only to get trapped as Breivik walked from room to room in the small building, killing more than a dozen people. She said she only survived because another victim fell on her, knocking her to the floor and giving the impression she was dead. Traumatised: Survivor Ingvild Stensrud, 17, was shot in the leg and shoulder during the carnage . On trial: Witness and victim Glenn Martin Waldenstroem said Breivik (pictured in court today) appeared both joyous and angry as he fired shots in the cafe building on the island of Utoya . Speaking at the trial in Oslo today she said she initially thought Breivik was not alone as he rampaged around the island dressed as a police officer shooting dead dozens of people. 'I thought they (the attackers) were exchanging messages but realising he was alone, I think the scream was actually a battle cry,' she testified. Breivik made sure his victims were dead by delivering a control shot to their heads one by one, she added. Speaking about her ordeal, she said: 'I tried to get to the door behind others and when they got shot, they fell on me. One laid across my chest. Breivik shot 69 people, most of them teenagers, at the ruling Labour Party's summer camp on Utoya Island, pictured with rescuers last July . Moving forward: Ina Rangones Libak, 22, was convinced she would die after being shot in the jaw and chest . 'That's when I got hit in the left thigh. Many were shot lying on the floor.' 'Next to me (a man) was coughing up blood,' she added. That person, Glenn Martin Waldenstroem, said Breivik appeared both joyous and angry as he fired shots. 'His face looked distorted,' said Waldenstroem, 20, who survived being shot in the face. 'He looked angry and smiled simultaneously,' he added, after asking the court to escort Breivik out of the room, saying he was unable to testify with him present. When rescued, Waldenstroem could not speak and wrote his relatives' phone number down on the floor with blood so they could be notified he was alive. Breivik has said he initially tried to call an end to his killing spree after leaving the cafe, picking up a victim's mobile and phoning police, only to be forced to leave a message. He continued killing, shouting 'you are going to die today, Marxists,' ignoring pleas of mercy from people begging for their lives. The evidence emerged after a day high drama at the courthouse yesterday where an unknown man set himself on fire outside the building. After dousing himself in a flammable liquid, the burning man ran towards the entrance. Blaze: A man set himself on fire outside the courthouse where the trial of right-wing extremist Anders Behring Breivik is taking place. He is in a serious condition in hospital . Marius Hoft, who was rescued from Utoya island hides on a cliff to escape Breivik. He was one of the last people to be rescued from the island . Police officers rushed to his aid, pulling his burning jumper off before attempting to put the fire out. Police said the man was a Norwegian citizen and had serious wounds to his chest and stomach. It is not yet known if the incident is connected to the trial although police believe it could be. On Tuesday, Ina Rangones Libak told the court she remembered all the shots that hit her, in the arm, the jaw and then the chest. The 22-year-old said when she was shot in the chest she thought it would kill her. She said: 'I started to fell that I am stumbling, falling, I don't have full control over my body and I'm thinking, OK, I'm going to die. This is how it feels to die. ' She described how her friends supported her and they encouraged each other, willing each other to survive the ordeal. Injured: A man is taken away from paramedics after he set fire to himself outside the courthouse in Oslo where Anders Brevik is on trial . The man is said to be in a serious condition in hospital after dousing himself in a flammable liquid and setting fire to himself outside the entrance to the building . Earlier this week, Marius Hoft, 19, told the court how he fled with his best friend Andreas Dalby Grønnesby as Breivik slaughtered dozens of his friends. They clambered over heaps of bodies in a desperate bid to find a hiding place and were finally forced to climb down the sheer side of a cliff. But as they searched for a secure spot to wait for rescue, Andreas lost his grip and plunged to his death. Mr Hoft told how he was forced to listen as Breivik continued his shooting spree in the woods above before the police arrived to stop him. He was then hauled to safety on a rope by rescuers. Chilling photographs that show Mr Hoft clinging to the cliffside were released for the first time on Monday. Breivik killed 77 people on July 22 last year, first detonating a car bomb outside government buildings in central Oslo which killed eight, and then shooting 69 people, most of them teenagers, at the ruling Labour Party's summer camp on Utoya Island. He admits the killings but denies criminal guilt, arguing the killings were necessary since his victims were 'traitors' who promoted Muslim immigration and multiculturalism, thereby threatening Norwegian ethnic purity. If deemed sane, Breivik faces a 21-year jail sentence which could be indefinitely extended for as long as he is considered dangerous. One court-appointed team of psychiatrists concluded he was psychotic, but a second team came to the opposite conclusion. The five judges will take a final decision on his sanity at the end of the trial. Breivik has said he should either be executed or acquitted, calling the prospect of a prison sentence 'pathetic'. If he were to be declared insane, he has said that would be 'worse than death'.","Ingvild Stensrud said she only survived because another victim fell on her, giving the impression she was dead ."

The crisis threatening Greece's Euro membership tonight deepened after a second attempt to end a crippling political deadlock by forming a coalition government failed. This latest blow came after German politicians broke ranks and actively demanded that Greece gets out of the eurozone. The calls come amid a meltdown in financial markets across the globe and the common currency sinking further against the pound. No deal: Radical Left party leader Alexis Tsipras, left, leaves a meeting with New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras, right after failing to reach an agreement to form a coalition government and end the country's political deadlock . Greece now looks set to have to hold a second general election after Radical Left leader Alexis Tsipras gave up on attempts to raise enough support for his anti-austerity agenda. Tsipras, whose party was the surprise runner-up in weekend national elections, has been seeking support for a left-wing government that will reject the terms of Greece's international bailout - which critics say will lead the country out of the euro. Tsipras, 38, told a meeting of party . lawmakers: 'We saw that our proposal enjoys broad social support but . weak parliamentary backing. ‘We can't make our dream come true and . form a left-wing government.’ Tsipras was given the presidential mandate on Tuesday and tasked with forming a government after first-placed conservative leader Antonis Samaras - who backs the country's international bailout terms - failed to do so within hours of getting the mandate on Monday. Next in line is Socialist leader Evangelos Venizelos, Greece's former finance minister. If he also fails, the president will host party leaders in a last-ditch effort to avoid new elections next month. Antonis Samaras, leader of the New Democracy party, left, failed to reach agreement with Alexis Tsipras, head of the left party PASOK, right, during a bit to try and see if there is any possibility of forming a government . The pound is going strong against the euro as it reached a three-and-a-half-year high today . If he also fails, elections will be called in three or four weeks in the hope of breaking the deadlock. Venizelos said he would continue the search for a coalition when his turn comes but there seems little space for compromise between pro and anti-bailout forces, almost equally balanced in parliament. ‘We must form a government and give the country prospects for the future, hope and security,’ Venizelos said . Yesterday, Tsipras said Greece should . pull out of its bailout commitments, saying the financial pain hitting . ordinary Greeks has been too high. Samaras . stressed it was imperative for the country to remain in the euro. Although he has called for the bailout terms to be renegotiated, he said . pulling out completely would be disastrous. Portugal has axed four of its 14 national holidays in an attempt to boost the economy. They have been axed for a five-year period in the hope that extra working time will help boost GDP. The Catholic holidays All Saints Day and Corpus Christi have been scrapped. The day off to commemorate the formation of Portugal also goes - as does the day to celebrate independence from Spain. The Catholic Church reached an 'exceptional understanding' with the state over axing the holidays, the Diario de Noticias newspaper reported. Public sector wages have already been cut and taxes increased to reduce the budget deficit. Portugal accepted a £63bn bailout from the EU and the IMF last year. On . the markets the Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks was . down 1.2 per cent on the back of the deadlock in the Greek government. There were also very slight losses on the FTSE100 and French CAC 40. The German Dax was up 0.32 percent after falling earlier. Spain's financial markets were also shaken as investors were worried about the fallout from Greece's political crisis and awaited details of the Spanish government's latest plan to shore up the banking sector. The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds rose to 6.02 percent by late afternoon, a jump of 0.24 percentage points on the day and uncomfortably high. Bond yields indicate the rate the government borrows at when it taps financial markets. Just . a few weeks ago it would have been heresy for Chancellor Angela . Merkel's supporters to suggest that Greece throws in the towel - but not . any longer. 'We should make . Greece the offer to leave the eurozone in an orderly fashion, without . leaving the European Union,” said Klaus-Peter Willsch, the budgetary . expert for Merkel's CDU party. He . told Wednesday’s business daily Handelsblatt it was 'not up to the . Germans to tell the Greeks how to live,' but that weekend election . results indicated they were 'not willing' to implement the . Berlin-dictated savings course. 'The dogma that no country can leave the eurozone has already caused too much political damage in Europe,' he added. President Karolos Papoulias, right, has given Tsipras, left, the mandate to try to form a government . Michael Meister, deputy chairman of the CDU in parliament, said; 'It is clear that if the new Greek government, contrary to expectations, does not keep to the contracts, it will have to accept the consequences already announced.' Frank Schäffler, a finance expert . from the CDU’s coalition partner the Free Democratic Party, also said he . was open to a possible exit of the Greeks from the eurozone. 'One must . be prepared,' he added. 'The government should now, at the very latest, draw up a plan B.' Germany's Michael Meister, pictured, said that if Greece fails to keep its side of the deal it will have to face the consequences . The head of economics at the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich, Kai Carstensen, said: 'It is absolutely correct to develop a Plan B which would enable the exit of Greece in the most orderly fashion . 'At the moment that which many have feared is happening – the necessary internal devaluation through wage and price reductions is politically barely tenable.' Greece is in its fifth year of recession with unemployment at 20 percent – and had committed itself to earmarking in June another €11.5billion in savings over the next two years. All bets are off after the weekend vote which saw people vote against more austerity. Germany's Der Spiegel magazine ran the headline yesterday 'Welcome to Weimar' in an essay about Greece - a reference to the post WW1 republic in Germany that collapsed under chronic debt triggered by the Great Depression and which ushered in the Nazis. Alexis Tsipras, leader of Greece's Radical Left Coalition party (SYRIZA), has said that the recent Greek elections rendered the bailout agreement invalid, which sent tectonic shocks to stock markets around the world, including London. Germany has warned that it must stick to the savings course if it wants to remain in the euro. 'Greece must know that there is no alternative to the agreed to restructuring arrangement, if it wants to stay a member of the euro zone,' said ECB board member Jörg Asmussen. He said it country risked missing a 130 billion euro tranche of bailout money due soon if it backed away from the previous savings agreement. Sunday's parliamentary elections in Greece left the country with no clear winner, as voters rejected mainstream pro-austerity political parties, and split their votes among several splinter parties, ranging from the extreme left to neo-Nazis.","Euro falls against pound and dollar as unease for single currency grows .

A drink-driver crashed into a parked car – because he bent down to pick up his kebab when it fell off the dashboard, a court heard. Labourer Colin Watson, 27, who had drunk six pints before getting behind the wheel, leaned down to retrieve the snack which had dropped into the car footwell when he smashed into a parked car, in Harraby, Carlisle. At Carlisle Magistrates’ Court, Watson, who was more than three times the legal drink-drive limit, after the collision, admitted driving while drunk. Danger: Drink-driver Colin Watson said he crashed into a parked car when he leant down to pick up his kebab which had fallen off the dashboard . Geoff Clapp, defending, said: ‘He realised he had had too much to drink to drive home and was turning back when, unfortunately, the kebab – which was on the dashboard – fell on the floor. ‘Mr Watson leaned down to get it and barged into the other car.’ A breath test found he had 112mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath – the legal limit is 35mcg. Prosecutor Paul Gibson said Watson,  from Brampton, Carlisle, had gone for a drive on May 18, to ‘clear his head’ after an argument with his parents. He stopped off at the Border Rambler pub, in Botchergate, and ended up drinking six pints before offering to drive a friend home. The pair had stopped for a kebab in Harraby and Watson, then realised he was too drunk to drive. Crash: Watson admitted drinking six pints of beer before getting behind the wheel of his car . As he was turning around to return to the city centre to get a taxi, he crashed into another vehicle. Mr Gibson said: ‘A woman was in her car, which was stationary, talking to a friend she had dropped off. ‘All of a sudden she heard a loud bang and the car jolted forward.’ The driver got out and began apologising, but the woman told police he appeared drunk and was slurring his words. She was uninjured, but the rear tyre arch was dented and the tyre was flat. In mitigation, Mr Clapp said: ‘He is 27, single, without work and lives with his parents.’ Sentencing him, District Judge Gerald Chalk took into account that Watson, who had previously worked for Network Rail,  was about to start a new job in Scotland which would see him only returning to Carlisle on weekends. He disqualified him from driving for 27 months and made him the subject of a 12-month community order. As part of this, he must complete 100 hours’ unpaid work.","Colin Watson had drunk six pints before crashing into the parked car .

A great-grandmother died after an unknown killer set fire to her bedding in a care home, an inquest found yesterday. Coroner Simon Jones said it was a ‘disgrace’ that no one had been brought to justice for the unlawful killing of Edith Stuart, 96. Yesterday, in extraordinary scenes at the inquest into her death, two former employees of the privately run home took the stand to deny being in non-smoker Mrs Stuart’s room at the time the blaze started. But last night her family said they were devastated that her killer had not been caught and that she had been ‘murdered in her own bed’. Her daughter Shirley Fish, 76, said: ‘We feel extremely let down that we have had no justice. Elderly people are in care homes as a place of safety. ‘Nobody expects them to be murdered in their own bed by arsonists. ‘We hope whoever committed this crime understands that they have to live with the consequences of their despicable act for the rest of their lives. ‘Whoever has done this obviously needs help and we just want them to come forward so that we can put this behind us. ‘This horrific thing that has happened has been like a cancer that spreads and I don’t think we will ever recover from it.’ 'Discrepancies': The coroner noticed differences in the accounts given by care workers Charlene Clough (left) and Sophie Nolan (right) The two care workers from Cleveleys Park Nursing Home in Fleetwood, Lancashire, had initially been arrested on suspicion of murder but no charges were ever brought. Mrs Stuart, formerly of Burnley, had been living at the home for around four years when she was killed. She died in hospital the day after the fire on October 18 2010. The inquest heard care workers Charlene Clough, 28, and Sophie Nolan, 18, were the sole members of staff on duty to look after ten elderly residents, nine of whom were mentally or physically infirm. The one mobile resident was upstairs in her room at the time of the fire, while police ruled out the involvement of an intruder. West Lancashire coroner Mr Jones said he noticed ‘discrepancies’ in the care workers’ accounts of their whereabouts before the fire alarm went off. But the Crown Prosecution Service ruled last March that there was insufficient evidence to charge either of the two women in connection with Mrs Stuart’s death. Appeal: Jean Worgan from Northampton (left) and Shirley Fish, from . Poulton (right) have pleaded for their mother's killer to come forward . Recording a verdict of unlawful killing at Fleetwood Magistrates’ Court, Mr Jones said: ‘I am entirely satisfied that the fire was started deliberately by a person or persons that the police were unable to identify. ‘It is hard to conceive a more dreadful act for someone to deliberately set fire to a bed in which an elderly and frail and relatively immobile lady is lying in the knowledge that the lady has limited possibility of escaping once the fire had been started and in doing so to bring about her death.’ He shared police regrets that they ‘have been unable to identify anyone responsible for this dreadful act which could have resulted in them being brought before a criminal court’. Mr Jones said: ‘I offer my condolences to the family and I recognise the fact that this inquest has now concluded and that the family are left with the one question: Who is responsible for Mrs Stuart’s death? ‘I take some comfort that this is not a closed case. If any new evidence does come to light, it will be reconsidered.’ Home Office pathologist Dr Alison Armour confirmed the cause of Mrs Stuart’s death was 50 per cent burns and that she had been lying down when the fire spread to her bedding. Richard Percival, of Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, said a cigarette lighter was found on Mrs Stuart’s bedroom floor, but she did not smoke. No DNA evidence could be obtained from it. He said the pattern of the fire was not consistent with a dropped cigarette, and the flame would have had to be held for three seconds to start the blaze. He concluded that it was ‘highly likely’ the fire had been started deliberately.","Someone held a flame to the side of Edith Stuart's bed at a Lancashire care home, an inquest heard .

A mother has been accused of helping her 14-year-old daughter smear faeces, swastikas and slurs in maple syrup on the houses of her classmates. Catharine Whelpley, 43, has been charged with nine misdemeanors including vandalism, trespassing and contributing to the delinquency of minors. Prosecutors say she drove her daughter and friends to vandalise the house of a former friend from her Los Angeles middle school with syrup, faeces and toilet paper. Degrading: A picture posted on the Twitter account of comedian Jon Lovitz showing the swastika and faeces allegedly left by the daughter of Catharine Whelpley at her classmate's house in Los Angeles . They say the Northridge woman then took them to another girl’s house in the San Fernando Valley, which belonged to the son of Holocaust survivors. They did the same thing, but Whelpley’s daughter also allegedly drew a swastika on the front door and wrote 'Jew' on a concrete path. Whelpley waited for the girls to finish, then drove them home, it is claimed. Surveillance video on a neighbour’s house led police to Whelpley. But the vandalism was also pictured by actor and comedian Jon Lovitz, who claimed on Twitter that the second house belonged to his friend. 'Insult': Mr Lovitz tweeted that the house where he took the picture belonged to his friend, who was the son of Holocaust survivors . He tweeted a photograph of the swastika and faeces outside the front door and wrote: 'Some coward & idiot left this on a friend’s doorstep, yesterday. This is an insult to all of us.' He added later: 'My friend’s parents are Holocaust survivors.' He claims they did it to 'bully' his friend's daughter. According to a report by the Los Angeles Daily News, the incident has also driven the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in Los Angeles to hold discussions with youths about how to confront anti-Semitism. The actions by the girls on April 3 do not consitute a hate crime because the words and symbols were written in material that can be washed off, the City Attorney’s Office said. But the Los Angeles-area director for the ADL, Amanda Susskind, said the decision to hold the mother accountable should be commended. ‘The whole thing painted a picture of ugliness,’ she said. If convicted on all charges, Whelpley could face up to seven years in county jail or a $13,500 fine, according to prosecutor Ayelet Feiman. Whelpley’s arraignment is scheduled for June 28. According to the Los Angeles Daily News, the number of hate crimes fell by 28 per cent in the county in 2010, but California leads the country in anti-Semitic incidents, with 297 reported to the Anti-Defamation League in 2010, the last year for which data was released.","Catharine Whelpley, 43, charged .

Jailed: Patrick Besiris, 21, who was caught on CCTV hurling rocks at police officers during disorder in Bristol on the day of the Royal wedding . A university graduate has been jailed for 14 months for throwing rocks at police  during an anti-Tesco riot. Patrick Besiris, 21, was part of a 200-strong crowd of protesters who attacked officers patrolling a rally against the supermarket chain. The former politics student was filmed on CCTV hurling large stones near a controversial new store. Despite the charges against him,  Besiris was allowed to complete his studies and achieved a first class honours degree. But the now highly-qualified defendant has been sent to prison for his role in the Bristol riot. Judge Michael Roach told him: ‘Your behaviour on the night in question was disgraceful. It is obvious that sort of behaviour must attract a custodial sentence.’ Besiris was filmed rioting wearing a mask and throwing missiles in the early hours of April 29 last year, the day of the Royal Wedding. The anti-Tesco protest had drawn a 200-strong crowd to a squat known as Telepathic Heights, opposite the store, and Besiris had written on Twitter that he was ‘looking forward’ to the gathering. He was sentenced at Bristol Crown Court after he pleaded guilty to one charge of violent disorder. His lawyer, Srikantharajah Nereshraaj, said Besiris wished to apologise to the police and community. He said: ‘It was inexcusable and unjustifiable. He saw the CCTV and was ashamed and appalled.’ Mr Nereshraaj said his client had overcome the behavioural condition ADHD and an inherited bi-polar disorder to obtain good qualifications.

A woman who is eight months pregnant claims she was Tasered by a police officer Tuesday morning after a confrontation escalated. Tiffany Rent, 30, said she and the Chicago officer were fighting after Rent parked in a handicap parking spot outside of Walgreens. According to police reports, Rent tore up the ticket the officer handed her and attempted to drive off, but the officer – who warned her not to leave the scene – grabbed his stun gun and fired the weapon. Scroll down for video . Stunned: Tiffany Rent, who is eight months pregnant, was Tasered outside of a Walgreens while fiance Joseph Hobbs bought batteries . Errand: Rent was parked in an SUV two young children in the handicapped parking spot of this Chicago Walgreens . The Chicago Tribune reported that Rent and her fiancé, Joseph Hobbs, were at the Chicago-area drug store so that Hobbs could pick up a battery for his keyless entry remote for his car. Rent’s two young children were also in the SUV with her. Rent told NBC Chicago that she remained in the SUV while her fiancée went in, and got out to re-seat her three-year-old daughter. A police officer attempted to issue Rent a ticket for parking in the handicap space when Rent tried to get back in the vehicle. ‘He gave me the ticket and I threw the ticket on the ground,’ she told NBC Chicago in a phone interview. She then proceeded to get back in her car. The officer told her that he was arresting her and wrote a ticket for littering, the Tribune reported. Dispute: The confrontation became violent after Rent tried to pull out from the parking spot after the officer warned her not to . Little one: Neither Rent nor her unborn child were ultimately harmed from the stun gun . When asked for identification, Rent responded ‘I ain’t giving you (exploitive),’ according to the police report. The report went on to say that the officer threatened to use his stun gun on her if she attempted to drive away. Rent put her hand on the gear shifter, and that’s when the officer fired. According to the police document, Rent’s fiancé was injured as he tried to intervene and suffered a dislocated elbow. It is unclear whether the officer knew Rent is eight months pregnant. Rent’s sister, Shareeta Rent, was furious at the alleged attack. ‘I’m outraged, just livid,’ she told the Tribune. ‘How could you do that to a pregnant woman?’ Rent and her unborn child are both fine, and have been checked over by doctors at two separate hospitals.

Police Supt. Garry McCarthy told reporters at an unrelated press event: ‘You can’t always tell if somebody’s pregnant.

A school resource officer was fired for repeatedly dropping his trousers and flaunting a green Speedo during a Princess and the Frog birthday skit at a school function. And now Cody Harris wants his job back. Harris was dismissed from his position at Provo High School in Utah last month after playing a frog at a secretary's lunch-hour birthday party, and has no filed an appeal. Scroll down for video . It ain't easy being green: Officer Cody Harris donned a green Speedo for a birthday skit at Provo High School and was fired for repeatedly dropping his trousers . Green machine: Harris told investigators he couldn't fit into green leggings provided for him that day and decided to wear the Speedo alone under his uniform trousers . The ordeal started when Harris agreed to dress in a frog suit with green sweats and a green hooded sweat shirt with sewn-on 'frog' eyes for the May 2 birthday party, which was held over the lunch hour in a Provo High School conference room, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. The party, for a secretary known as 'princess,' was attended by students and staff. Harris told investigators he couldn't fit into green leggings provided for him that day and decided to wear the Speedo alone under his uniform trousers, playing off a running joke about him donning the swimsuit at a Lake Powell outing for administrators. The police investigation found Harris removed his pants several times, and made cheeky comments while posing suggestively in the skimpy swimsuit before female students and staff. The report claimed Harris picked up the secretary and carried her about the room, posed suggestively before the assistant principal, and attempted to hug the head principal while his pants were down around his ankles. The appeal will be heard by the city's civil service board, Provo School District officials said Wednesday. But even if Harris wins reinstatement, the district will not rehire him after such 'questionable' behaviour, its acting superintendent said. Royal reveal: Harris was participating in a Princess and the Frog skit, and was playing the frog; however, the leggings he was supposed to wear didn't fit, he said . Schooling: The report claimed Harris picked up the secretary and carried her about the room, and posed suggestively before the assistant principal at Provo High in Utah . 'He was supposed to be a frog,' Robert Gentry, interim superintendent at the district about 50 miles south of Salt Lake City, told the AP. 'We feel like he was a very good resource officer and did an outstanding job. He interacted very well with the students. This was just so out of character.' Mr Gentry added Harris' behaviour was 'too far out of line' to warrant a second chance. 'There were students in and about the area,' Mr Gentry said. 'The Speedo itself is not appropriate in a setting like that.' 'There were students in and about the area. The Speedo itself is not appropriate in a setting like that.' -Interim superintendent Robert Gentry . Harris was fired May 10 for violating several police policies, including those addressing sexual harassment, conduct toward the public and conduct unbecoming an officer. A working phone number could not be found for Harris, and it was not immediately clear what attorney was handling his appeal. In his defence, Harris said he agreed to be part of the birthday party because he felt there was a lot of stress in the administration and thought the skit would relieve it, according to a police memorandum. He also told investigators he believed only administrators, not students, would be at the party. Students who witnessed the party told police they laughed at the skit. Some backed Harris, saying it was only a joke and not grounds for dismissal, Fox 13 reported. Others said they felt uncomfortable and knew Harris was going to be in trouble. The police report said students were told to delete photos and videos of Harris in the Speedo.

"PUBLISHED: . 10:34 EST, 24 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:03 EST, 24 May 2012 . Breakdown: Tube passengers are forced to walk along tunnels between Baker Street and St John's Wood . London's transport system came under fire today after a major technical failure on the Underground saw hundreds stuck in stifling carriages on the hottest night of the year. More than 770 passengers have been offered just £40 compensation after they had to be walked through tunnels last night because of a broken down train on the Jubilee Line. There are fears the capital could become a 'laughing stock' if similar faults are repeated during this summer's Olympics, which kick off in a matter of weeks. The faulty train was specially decorated with a bunting design for the Diamond Jubilee - but among those delayed when it ground to a halt were some of the Queen’s guests on their way to a celebration at the Royal Academy of Arts, attended by celebrities from the arts and fashion worlds. The network's problems continued this morning when a signal failure at Embankment led to severe disruption on the Circle and District lines. London Assembly Member and Labour’s transport spokesman Val Shawcross said: 'The Olympic Games opening ceremony is now less than nine weeks away and still ordinary commuters are being hit by delays caused by faulty track, faulty trains and faulty signals. 'Passengers on the Jubilee Line have endured months of shutdowns for maintenance and upgrade works that were supposed to stop this happening. So why are there still issues with the line? What will happen if the chaos happens during the Olympic Games? Quite simply the Mayor needs to get a grip, otherwise London could end up as an international laughing stock.' Today, in an unprecedented move, Transport for London announced it would be making £40 'distress' pay outs for those caught in the nightmare journey. But one passenger, Jennifer Siggs, who claimed temperatures soared to over 30 degrees, dismissed the compensation offer. The world is watching: A London Underground train passes a advert for Olympics tickets. Recent faults have led to fears the capital could become an 'international laughing stock' during the Games . The train ground to a halt between Baker Street and St John’s Wood just after 5.30pm. Ms Siggs, 27, an events co-ordinator at the Churchill War Rooms, said: 'Everyone was a bit huffy and distressed. 'It was sweaty and horrible, I didn't have any water. 'The woman sat next to me looked like she was going to have a panic attack. 'She was saying that her eight year old son at home didn't know where she was and he couldn't go to sleep without her being there.' Ms Siggs added: 'A woman in my carriage said she felt unwell and she wanted to stand between the doors, I think she had a fit.' 'Then she slumped down on to the floor and the paramedics and police came. 'When we got off she was sitting up with an oxygen mask on. 'No one gave us any information, that's what made people most worried. 'Eventually the lights flickered on and the driver said we were going to walk three quarters of a mile along the tracks. Hush money? Transport for London, chaired by Mayor Boris Johnson (pictured) has offered £40 compensation to those delayed last night, but one passenger said TfL officials were simply trying to 'stop people complaining' 'I was one of the last people out and it was quite bizarre to see hundreds of people stretched out in front of me. 'It was for me even harder because I had to leap from plank to plank in my heels.' Ms Siggs said TfL were 'just trying to cover themselves and stop people complaining' by offering £40 compensation. She added: 'This shouldn't be happening in 2012 that you're stuck for two-and-a-half hours and no one tells you anything. 'I'm concerned about the tube during the Olympics, because if something like this happens now, what will happens with trains full of distressed people who can't speak the language? It will be hell.' 'Sweaty and horrible': It took passenger Jennifer Siggs , who took this picture, four hours to get home from work . Ms Siggs finally got home to Acton at about 10pm - more than four hours after leaving work. London Ambulance Service said one patient was treated for breathing difficulties and taken to the Royal Free Hospital, while another was treated for a 'pre-existing condition'. Another passenger caught up in today’s Tube delays said it took her three hours to travel from Liverpool Street to Victoria, adding: 'There was little or no information - the only thing we were told was that we were going nowhere. I had to catch a bus instead - and they were all packed.' Nigel Holness, London Underground operations director, apologised for last night’s disruption, saying: 'This was caused by a faulty train between Baker Street and St Johns Wood which led to the suspension of the line between London Bridge and Finchley Road. 'Our staff tried to move the train, which stalled at around 1735hrs, using a train to push it from behind. This was not successful and we subsequently took the decision to walk passengers off the train. 'This is clearly not the level of service our customers have a right to expect, and we will be refunding those affected.' LU drafted in additional staff from its special requirements team to help passengers off, saying they could not be disembarked sooner as it was thought the train could be pushed forward using the other train. However this was not possible, partly due to the slope of the tunnel. Mike Brown, LU’s managing director, said: 'The Tube is staffed and maintained to the highest standards and to a level that has made it the safest significant sized railway in Europe. Party pooped: The Queen talks to Sir Paul McCartney and his wife Nancy Shevell (left) at a special 'Celebration of the Arts' at the Royal Academy of Arts. Guests on their way to the event were among those delayed last night . 'The fact is that we have just recorded the most reliable year on record, carrying more passengers than ever before and operating more services. But we will never be complacent and accept that in the last few days our customers have not had the level of service they are right to expect. 'That is why we and the Mayor are committed to working to improve reliability even further as we go into this exciting summer for London.' Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: 'This is shaping up to be a pre-Olympic London transport week of hell with London mayor Boris Johnson and his officials claiming a brilliant service while millions of Londoners know better. 'We are paying a heavy price for a programme of cuts to staffing and maintenance that has reduced the transport system to total chaos just weeks away from the Olympics and the blame lies firmly with the mayor and his senior officials.'","Queen's guests for Jubilee celebrations among those caught in disruption .

Police were called to break up a girl’s 14th birthday party when a gang of knife-wielding teens torched a balcony and started a fight after finding out about the celebration on Facebook. Mother-of-four Sue Sutheran, 46, was forced to dial 999 after more than 40 people turned up uninvited at her home for her daughter Keeley Lee's party. Police sent five police cars and officers armed with Tasers to bring the half term party in Southend, Essex, under control. Party horror: The half time event was being held for Keeley Lee, 14, left. Her sister Paige, second left, was also at the party which spiralled out of control after Sue Sutheran's (right) purse was stolen. Kaylee Gane, 22, (in the green) was allegedly told she would be killed . The trouble started after Mrs Sutheran, 46, realised her purse had been stolen and refused to let anybody leave her three-bedroom flat until they had been searched. Although 24 people had been invited to the party, more than 40 turned up. Some of the party-goers started making trouble, grabbed knives from the kitchen as weapons and summoned a gang of people via Facebook to join in. A group of thugs kicked in a neighbour's front door and started a fire on a balcony at the property. Mrs Sutheran then claimed she was pushed down some stairs and said her other daughter Paige, 16, was punched in the ribs during a fight. She said: 'I told them no one was leaving until everyone's been searched. That's when they started kicking off. 'My daughter was screaming because I ended up in the street surrounded by these people who had nicked my carving knives.' One of the yobs allegedly threatened to kill Mrs Sutheran's son's fiancee Kaylee Gane, 22, and said he would 'post her body parts to her boyfriend'. The mother added: 'My neighbour's door . was kicked clean off it's hinges, I've got bruises on my arms and my . daughter Paige has got a swollen side and swollen hand. 'One of them even squared up to my . future daughter-in-law's face and said he was going to post her body . parts to her boyfriend.' Jewellery and £60 cash was also stolen from the property which was meant as a wedding fund for Mrs Sutheran's son Shane, 23. She added that some baby photos went missing from a purse and she has got the locks changed because a set of keys went missing. Police said they had initially been called at about 9.30pm last Friday by a concerned neighbour who thought a party was getting out of hand. But as they were en route, they were told things had calmed down and there was no need for their help. They eventually dispatched five police cars and a Taser unit just after midnight when they received a flurry of calls. Inspector Matt Bennett, of Southend police, said they were trying to get to the bottom of what happened. He said: 'We did attend and as a result there are numerous inquiries to follow up that will be quite time consuming. 'But nevertheless we will get to the bottom of what happened and deal appropriately with our findings.' They managed to disperse the group but will now be taking statements and viewing CCTV, before arrests are made. Mrs Sutheran has now been warned she faces . being thrown out of her Housing Association property if there is a . repeat of the violence in her flat on the Woodrange Estate.","Thugs snatched carving knives from the kitchen and kicked in a neighbour's front door .

A fresh supermarket price war on the forecourts is underway with giants Asda and Sainsbury's cutting up to 3p a litre from the price of fuel. The retailers said the new charges would come into effect tomorrow. The slash follows April’s record high petrol prices, which pushed the price of filling a family car to £100. Slashed: Supermarket giants Asda and Sainsbury's are cutting up to 3p a litre from the price of fuel. The retailers said the new prices would come into effect tomorrow . The cuts mean that filling a typical car will be the cheapest since February 2011, according to  experts. Asda said an ease in global oil prices has enabled it to pass those savings on to motorists. Transport Secretary Justine Greening said the Government would be prepared to introduce new laws to control prices . Drivers filling up at any of Asda's 195 forecourts nationwide will now pay no more than 129.7p per litre for unleaded and 134.7p per litre for diesel. Andy Peake, Asda's director of petrol trading, said: 'Motorists will be pleased to know fuel is now at the lowest price in over a year as prices have fallen 11p since their peak in April. 'Unlike other retailers, our price cuts benefit everyone across the country, meaning that no-one filling up at Asda will be forced to pay a premium for their fuel.' A Sainsbury's spokesman said: 'From tomorrow we will be cutting petrol and diesel prices in our petrol stations by up to 3p per litre. Sainsbury's is committed to delivering great value and helping customers cut down on cost wherever possible.' A spokesman for the AA welcomed the cuts, saying that motorists would be getting a 'good price' for fuel. But the cost . of petrol looks set to rise again in the summer - in August the .

Fewer than a third of the most senior jobs in the UK are currently held by women, prompting calls for quotas to be forced on male-dominated British boardrooms. Female candidates have been most ignored when senior posts in the armed forces, courts and universities are filled, new figures show. And the European Commission is now considering new laws to get more women . into top management jobs, including mandatory . quotas for the private and public sectors. As a consultation on the issue closed today, EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding said it is 'crystal clear' the issue needed to be addressed in the UK. Woeful: Only 30 per cent of senior employees in the UK are women, according to new study . Overall, women occupy on average 30.9% of top jobs across 11 sectors in the UK, including business, politics and policing, new BBC figures show. The armed forces and judiciary have the fewest women in top posts - 1.3% and 13.2% respectively - while secondary education have the most at more than a third, or 36.7%. According to the findings, women represent 1.3% of brigadiers or their equivalent and above across the Army, Navy and RAF; 13.2% of the most senior judges; 14.2% of university vice-chancellors; 16.6% of the most senior staff in the police; and 34.7% of the senior civil service. Women are most strongly represented in secondary education, where they make up 36.7% of headteachers, and in public appointments, where they account for 36.4%, the analysis found. Cherie Blair backed quotas for women in the boardroom and Parliament in a speech last December. 'The truth is that we have waited and waited and unless we do take special measures to look at the systemic reasons why women aren’t making it to the top, we are never going to succeed,' she told the BBC. But Edwina Currie, the former Conservative health minister, told BBC Breakfast that she opposed quotas for women. 'I would love to see more women at the top in all sort of posts, and particularly things like judges, where it really does matter,' she said. Upset: Cherie Blair, wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, says that a quota system is needed to help women get into senior positions . 'But I think the way forward is for us women to be as good as we can get and to go and bang on that door and say ""Actually, you are missing really good talent here"".' She added: 'The moment you start having special arrangements, the people who come through have not acquired the talents and the skills that they will need for the majority. 'I used to say in Parliament, for example, that people who came in on the all-women shortlists, most of them were absolutely useless. Most people can’t remember who they were.'

As . a result, judges had found themselves ‘failing’ because they were ‘not . able to bear the strain of the judicial process’, she said. She . told the House of Lords: ‘I have a vivid recollection of a woman judge . many years ago who was a very fine pianist.

Hundreds of homeowners will share £1million compensation from Manchester Airport after noise and fumes from a second runway slashed the value of their homes. Nearly 600 homeowners will receive £1,500 each - 11 years after the runway first opened in 2001. The payout marks the end of the long-running legal battle which has seen the airport pay out more than £9million compensation. Payout: Manchester Airport will hand over £1million compensation split between 583 homeowners at the end of an 11-year legal battle . The 583 households in Knutsford and Mobberley who lodged claims will receive the new payout. The airport will also pay the council tax precept, which is levied to fund Knutsford town council and Mobberley parish council, for one year. This will be worth £117,702 in total - and will benefit every household in the area. Six local state schools will also receive a £1,300 one-off payment after the deal was struck. Chancellor George Osborne, whose Tatton constituency covers the area, said the compensation payout was a 'good outcome' for property owners. Airport chiefs had said they would not hand out any more cash because a legal time-limit for claims had passed. Campaigners from the Manchester Airport Environment Network, led by Knutsford resident Jeff Gazzard, and Mr Osborne held talks with airport bosses to try and secure a fresh pay out to those who had not submitted claims before the 2010 deadline. Pollution: Homeowners in Knutsford and Mobberley, which is to the south of Manchester, pictured, have campaigned over the second runway for 11 years . Mr Osborne said: 'Years of hard campaigning have finally paid off. I want to thank local people for their support and Jeff Gazzard for all his work - he has been a star. At last we have a fair deal for local communities.' Mr Gazzard welcomed the compensation settlement - and said it would end a decade of campaigning. 'It’s an acceptable deal,' he added. 'We were totally reliant on the airport’s good will because legal timeframes for compensation had passed so this was a fair solution. 'I don’t think it is tokenistic but some people may be a little disappointed at the amount - they probably wanted a little more. We’ve taken extreme care to get this right and this now draws a line under the second runway issue.' A spokesman for Manchester Airport said: 'The legal process for Runway 2 claims formally concluded in 2010. However, since then, George Osborne MP and Jeff Gazzard have presented us with a convincing case which showed inequity in the legal process. 'We have now agreed with them a final package of benefits as a goodwill payment. 'We hope that this demonstrates our commitment to work with our local communities as a responsible business and finally draws a line under this process.'","583 homeowners will receive £1,500 each because house prices have been hit .

A postdoctoral instructor who was seven months pregnant was struck and killed while crossing the street – but her baby miraculously survived. Police identified the woman as 30-year-old Jennifer J. Young, who taught mathematics at Rice University in Houston and is survived by her distraught husband Gavan. Her child was delivered by emergency C-section and remains in critical condition. Tragedy: Jennifer J. Young, a postdoctoral instructor at Rice University, was struck and killed at an intersection, but her seven-month-old child survived . Scene: She was hit by a grey Acura as she tried to cross near Main and Cambridge streets . Houston police said that Ms Young was crossing near the intersection of Main St and Cambridge around 9:20am, the Houston Chronicle reported. Saved: Her child was saved through an emergency C-section . She was reportedly struck by a grey Acura MDX that was driving down Main, though police said the vehicle had a green light. They also confirmed that she was seven months pregnant. After the accident, Ms Young was rushed to Memorial Hermann hospital, and was pronounced dead. However, doctors managed to save her child, who is currently listed in critical condition. Houston police said the car next to the Acura stopped in the intersection, but the Acura continued on, striking the young woman. They held the driver of the Acura for questioning, but they were later released. The investigation for the case is on-going. Ms Young was a bright postdoctoral student teaching at the Computational and Applied Mathematics department at Rice University. 'It seemed like the stars were perfectly aligned for her,' Rice professor Steve Cox told Chron.com. Mr Cox was the principal investigator . on the grant that brought Ms Young to the university's Computational . and Applied Mathematics Department almost two years ago. Mr Cox said Ms Young's grant application stood out, particularly because of her extraordinary teaching and mentoring experience. 'It's just tragic,' he said. Urgent care: She was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital, where doctors saved her child via emergency C-section; she was pronounced dead . Higher education: Ms Young taught at the Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics at Rice University . The professor's husband, Gavan Young, was too grief-stricken to speak to the press on Wednesday, according to the news website. In September, Ms Young was to begin the last year of a prestigious fellowship at Rice University after completing her doctorate in applied mathematics. She would have been a fully-fledged professor in about a year, having recently accepted a tenure-track position at another university. In a letter to faculty, staff and students, the university's chairman of computational and applied mathematics Matthias Heinkenschloss announced Ms Young's death, describing her as talented and accomplished with a bright future. Ms Young arrived at Rice in 2010 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Delaware and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The academic continued that work at Rice, teaching and participating in mathematics outreach programs with high school students. The bond Ms Young had built with her students brought her some of the best teaching evaluations in the department's history, Mr Heinkenschloss said in the note. Ms Young, who specialized in mathematical biology, also participated in research. She spent significant time establishing a working collaboration with scientists at the Texas Medical Center, where she probably had been the morning of the crash, Mr Cox said. He called her 'a natural academic' and recalled how excited she was when she told him she was pregnant. 'She had this love and belief that one could do it all,' Mr Cox said. 'With no complaints.'","Jennifer J. Young, 30, fatally struck by grey Acura in Houston .

A special education teacher in Texas is being sued after allegations arose that she locked an autistic student in a filing cabinet, pulled another’s hair out, and called her students ‘retarded.’ Julie Gosch taught special needs students at Juan Seguin Elementary School in Fort Bend County, Texas, but was fired earlier this year after reports of her behaviour were leaked. In shocking emails obtained by the Houston Chronicle, Gosch’s alleged behaviour includes telling her students that they were all losers and telling her two aids to ‘accidentally’ hit them, as well as allowing the pupils to eat food that had fallen on the toilet. Abuse: Julie Gosch, a special needs teacher, is being sued after allegedly putting a 9-year-old girl in a filing cabinet (file photo) It was the two aides who turned Gosch, 47, in to the Fort Bend Independent School District officials in January, the Chronicle reported. Police launched an investigation into Gosch, who had never before come under scrutiny for her teaching methods. The lawsuit is filed by two families whose children were allegedly victims of Gosch’s misconduct. It also claims that the special needs students were allowed to eat food that had fallen on the floor of the bathroom, and make fun of students with disabilities. The first family claims that their non-verbal and autistic 9-year-old daughter was placed in a filing cabinet. The other alleges that their 9-year-old daughter was physically assaulted and had bits of her hair pulled out by Gosch. The parents of the girl put in the filing cabinet allege that their daughter became increasingly claustrophobic at home and would begin exposing herself, according to the Chronicle. Learning: Gosch taught special education at Juan Seguin Elementary School in Fort Bend County, Texas . The lawsuit says that the girl’s behaviours are all signs of sexual assault. The former teacher did not respond to calls made by MailOnline requesting comment. Attorney Clint McGuire is representing the two families in the lawsuit, and told the Chronicle that their primary concern is that Gosch will no longer be able to teach. He said that because of their condition, they could be easily preyed upon. He told the paper: ‘When you have kids that don’t speak for themselves, they become an easy target.’ According to state records, Gosch was certified to teach music from Kindergarten to 12th grade, as well as generic special education. The Texas website notes that she is ‘currently under review by the SBEC Professional Discipline Unit.’ It is unclear how much compensation the two families are seeking, but they are asking compensation for damages including mental anguish, physical impairment, and out-of-pocket and medical expenses.","Julie Gosch, 47, sued after being accused of putting autistic girl, 9, in filing cabinet .

Taking a cue from New York City's proposed ban on sugary drinks, one Massachusetts town is looking to pass a similar crackdown to combat obesity and diabetes. Residents of Cambridge may have to sacrifice larger portions of soft drinks in its battle of the bulge, nearly a month after New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg made national headlines with his own proposal. Cambridge Mayor Henrietta Davis submitted the proposal at a city council meeting on Monday night. Scroll down for video . Controversial: A proposed ban on large sugary drinks in both New York City and Cambridge, Massachusetts has started a heated debate . The size limit on the drinks was not mentioned in her resolution, but it’s expected to follow Bloomberg’s limit of 16 ounces. Cambridge Mayor Henrietta Davis told WHDH: 'When people are served these gigantic portions of soda in bottomless cups, sometimes it’s just more than people are able to resist.' Also like Bloomberg’s resolution, the Davis' measure has ignited a heated discussion. Axis Sivitz, 25, of Cambridge, told The Boston Globe that he supports the ban, saying: ‘When faced with a health crisis, you have to do something about it.' Her honour's quest: Cambridge Mayor Henrietta Davis submitted the proposal at a city council meeting on Monday night . Obestity battle: Drinks this large would be eliminated from restaurants in Cambridge, Massachusetts, if Davis' proposed ban goes through . Sophia Talamasm 29, told the paper she’s against Davis’ proposal. She said: ‘Sometimes you need a soda.’ Cambridge is home to Harvard University, where Bloomberg got his MBA degree. Nanny: Mr Bloomberg has been criticized for banning bad foods like a protective nanny . New York City opened the issue for public debate after Bloomberg pitched the crackdown to the city council late last month. While Bloomberg has faced uproar in the Big Apple over the ban, polls show that New Yorkers are mostly split on the issue. The city Board of Health, which is appointed by the mayor, is expected to approve the measure after a three-month comment period. It could take effect as early as March, unless the critics who accuse Bloomberg of instituting a ""nanny state"" can get the courts or state lawmakers to intervene. Last week, the legality of such a crackdown was called into question. It's not just businesses and industry groups that could sue. In theory, any individual affected by the ban could bring a legal challenge. But it wouldn't be enough to simply claim that the ban infringes on personal freedom, said Rick Hills, a New York University law professor specializing in local government law and New York City. And Hills said that opponents would have to do more than argue that the law affects one source of sugar more than others. Courts, he said, have repeatedly ruled that the government can try to eradicate societal ills one step at a time. To go: Large drinks like these at Starbucks and McDonald's could be on their way out in both New York City and Cambridge, Massachusetts if Bloomberg and Davis have their way .

Patients with minor complaints such as colds or dandruff are causing huge backlogs for busy GPs. The NHS figures reveal that one in five visits to a doctor were not needed, meaning delays for those with more pressing needs or the elderly. Other non-urgent appointments apparently booked by patients included those seeking to complain about minor cuts. And of the 51.4million GP visits by patients across England and Wales, more than 20,000 related to travel sickness. 5.2million - almost ten percent of the figure - were for blocked noses, whilst 40,000 went to see their GP for advice about dandruff. Medics have warned people that visiting their GP unnecessarily could lead to a backlog for other patients. Richard Vautrey, Deputy Chair of the BMA's GP Committee told Mail Online: 'It is important that patients visit their GP if they have any concerns about their health. GPs are experts at identifying serious illness even when symptoms appear vague or trivial. Spotting health conditions early on is one of the best ways of ensuring successful long term treatment. 'At the same time, patients do need to make sure they are using services appropriately so that unnecessary workload is not created for an NHS that is already facing increasing levels of demand and shrinking resources.' GPs have also warned previously of the strain they are under caring for seriously ill patients who would previously have been in hospital. Some family doctors claim they have been left ‘exhausted’ by the changes. Family doctors had to deal with 40,000 appointments about dandruff last year . The Government wants patients with cancer, heart problems and other long-term illnesses to remain at home and be checked on by GPs. But family doctors say it is not possible to ‘examine’, ‘investigate’ and ‘prescribe’ drugs for patients with such highly complicated illnesses in a ten-minute slot at the surgery. Dr Chand Nagpual, a North London GP, told the British Medical Association’s annual conference in Bournemouth earlier this year the pressure was ‘physically and emotionally exhausting’. Dr Nagpaul, who is also a senior member of the BMA, said many of his colleagues were ‘exhausted and demoralised'. He quoted the results of a poll of 19,000 GPs that found more than 90 per cent felt stressed.","More than five million trips to GPs last year were made by people with blocked noses .

Her wartime song became synonymous with one of Britain's best loved coastal sights, but now Dame Vera Lynn has been recruited to help save the White Cliffs of Dover for the nation. The 95-year-old singer, who sang of that there would 'bluebirds over the White Cliffs of Dover' in 1942, has backed a campaign to save the stretch of Kent coastline from 'inappropriate management or development'. The £1.2 million appeal to safeguard one of England's most famous natural landmarks has been launched by the National Trust. Under threat: The National Trust's £1.2m campaign to safeguard the White Cliffs of Dover will be its biggest ever coastal fundraiser . The Trust is embarking on its largest ever coastal fundraiser to buy a stretch of the chalk cliffs just less than a mile long on the south coast, so it can be managed to improve public access and boost the habitat for wildlife. The purchase would fill in the missing link in a stretch of coast almost five miles long owned by the National Trust on behalf of the nation, from its visitor centre above Dover port to South Foreland lighthouse. Dame Vera said the 360ft-high cliffs 'should be saved in its entirety' according to The Sun. Fiona Reynolds, director general of the National Trust, said: 'Immortalised in song and literature, the White Cliffs of Dover have become one of the great symbols of our nation. 'We now have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to secure their future for everyone to enjoy. 'If we don't raise the money then the future of the White Cliffs is uncertain and this stretch of coastline might one day be disrupted by inappropriate management or development.' Backing: Dame Vera Lynn has said the White Cliffs of Dover should saved 'in its entirety' The chalk cliffs stretching east from Dover are home to a rich array of wildlife such as the Adonis blue butterfly and peregrine falcons, Kent's only kittiwake, and plants including oxtongue broomrape and sea carrots. They have stood over dramatic moments in English history, including the first arrival of the Romans and the return of British forces rescued from Dunkirk in the Second World War. And they have featured in songs and poetry, most famously the wartime classic (There'll be bluebirds over) the White Cliffs of Dover, sung by Dame Vera Lynn, and Matthew Arnold's poem Dover Beach. Historian and TV presenter Dan Snow is backing the move by the Trust to buy the stretch of land, describing the White Cliffs as 'one of the country's greatest and most iconic landmarks'. 'It's brilliant that they have a chance to secure this important section of the cliffs, forever, for everyone,' he said. The Trust manages the cliffs as chalk grassland, parts of which are grazed by Exmoor ponies to preserve the natural flora and support wildlife such as butterflies. Access is maintained for the public, who visit in their hundreds of thousands each year. Although people are already able walk the cliffs from the visitor centre to the lighthouse, part of the stretch is privately owned and in places arable fields come to the edge of cliffs, leaving just a slither of land for the coastal path. By buying the 1.35km (0.8 mile) piece of the coastal jigsaw, the National Trust would be able to restore the natural habitat, providing more space for species to retreat as the cliffs naturally erode, and connect the Trust's existing areas of land. Robert Sonnen, National Trust countryside ranger, said: 'It's about linking up the fragmented habitats, allowing us to manage them in a more landscape scale, sustainable way.' ● People who want to contribute to the appeal can do so by visiting www.nationaltrust.org.uk/whitecliffsappeal, by texting the code DOVR02 and the amount they wish to donate (eg DOVR02 £5) to 70070 or by calling 0844 800 1895.","Trust's campaign is their biggest ever coastal fundraiser .

The 20-year-old was raped and strangled before her body was dumped in a river in Burgundy. She had arranged to meet a man who had answered her newspaper advert offering private English lessons before she vanished. Now a woman has told police how she remembers her ex-boyfriend returning home one evening in May 1990 with 'scratch marks on his face'. Evidence: Joanna Parrish (left) was found raped . and strangled in a river in 1990.  The new investigation is probing . convicted killer Michel Fourniret (right) and a new suspect named only as TV . The witness, who was living in the same area of Burgundy near the River Yonne, said her former partner had also been carrying a similar denim bag to one Joanna was known to have owned. A second woman who dated the same man ten years later has also told police that he boasted to her of having murdered a young woman in Burgundy in 1990. The suspect - named only by his initials TV - is currently serving a prison sentence for separate offences and had now been quizzed by detectives, the regional L'Yonne newspaper reported. Didier Seban, the French lawyer for Joanna's parents Roger and Pauline Parrish, described the latest development as a 'serious lead'. He told L'Yonne newspaper: 'On the basis of this new evidence, which is still being verified, investigators are following up a serious new lead regarding a man with a long criminal past. 'Joanna's parents, who have often had the impression of being abandoned by the French justice system, have renewed hope of finally seeing a result to the inquiry.' Roger and Pauline Parrish are still fighting for justice, 22 years on . The investigation into the unsolved murder was re-opened on June 6 when detectives agreed to re-examine evidence against a second suspect, convicted serial killer Michel Fourniret. Fourniret, 69, was dubbed the 'Beast of the Ardennes' after he strangled, shot or stabbed seven girls aged between 12 and 21 in remote rural spots in France and Belgium. He was convicted of multiple murders and sentenced to life in prison in 2008. Fourniret had been in the Yonne area of Burgundy when Joanna, from Newnham on Severn, Gloucestershire, was murdered, . But earlier attempts to prosecute him for her murder failed after police were accused of extracting evidence from his wife under duress. Roger Parrish, 68, said after the latest evidence emerged: 'We are very pleased. They said there are now two strands to the investigation. 'One is Michel Fourniret and his ex-wife and there are many questions to be answered about that. The new lead we don't know much about. 'All I know is it's a man who is serving a prison sentence for violent sexual crimes and in the investigations an informant told the police they suspected he was involved in Jo's murder.'","20-year-old beaten, raped and strangled while teaching in France in 1990 .

Philip will chair the Senior Colonels’ Conference at Buckingham Palace and host a dinner for the high-ranking officers in his role as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards. The Duke was discharged from central London’s Edward VII hospital last Saturday quietly celebrating his 91st birthday with family the following day in Windsor. He emerged after a five-night stay looking in good health and nodded when asked by the waiting media if he was feeling better. But he did not attend the Queen’s visit to Nottingham with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Wednesday, and missed other Diamond Jubilee-related events during the week. Although this evening will be a private engagement, Philip will make a public appearance tomorrow when he joins the Queen for the traditional Trooping the Colour ceremony. The couple will ride in a carriage procession to the annual event, held in Horse Guards Parade, Whitehall, which marks the Queen’s official birthday. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman would not comment on the Duke’s health but said: 'The fact he’s attending engagements is an indication he is back to himself and able to carry out engagements.'

A woman who fell in love with planes as a nine-year-old child when she was invited to sit in a cockpit has become one of Britain's youngest women pilots aged just 25. Kate Moran's achievements in a male-dominated industry prove she's got substance and style. Having graduated in Aviation Technology from the University of Leeds, Kate has carved out a career in an industry where fewer than five per cent of pilots are women. Life's ambition: Kate Moran has become one of Britain's youngest female airline pilots after securing a job with Devon-based firm Flybe in an industry with fewer than five percent of pilots are women . Kate, a pilot for Devon-based airline Flybe, said: 'As far back as I can remember, I have always been interested in flying. 'The turning point was when I was able to sit with the pilots in the flight deck. I was nine years old and the captain asked if I wanted to sit there while the plane landed.' From that moment on, Kate was single-minded in her pursuit to become a pilot choosing science and mathematics over the arts - 'any subject geared towards a career in flying'. After graduating from university, Kate struggled to find a job in the midst of the recession. In the hot seat: Kate fell in love with planes as a nine-year-old and graduated in Aviation Technology from the University of Leeds. But after failing to find a job, she turned her attention to flying instead . But she successfully applied to Flight Training Europe (FTE) and attended an aviation school in Spain where she also secured a position on the Flybe mentoring programme. She spent 14 months at flight school getting 800 hours of ground school under her belt and taking on 14 subjects including flight navigation, radio navigation, principals of flight and meteorology. In order to continuing training, every candidate has to get a pass mark of at least 90 per cent in each exam - something Kate achieved. At FTE Kate gained her Commercial Pilot's Licence enabling her to fly a small four-seater, single-engine aircraft. 'I got the aviation bug': Kate is starting her career with £80,000 worth of debt accumulated from paying for the 14-month intensive live-in course at the Spanish flight school and a pilot loan . She then moved on to a six-seater twin engine aircraft and then a Q400. Potential pilots must also gain their instrument rating, to enhance their skills and proficiency to a higher, safer level. Kate said: 'You need to know the mechanics and principals around how the aircraft works - I know more about my aircraft than my car.' She recalled: 'The first time I got control of a Q400 was at Preswick when I had to do six take offs and landings. 'The aircraft was empty of passengers and I had to fly it from Edinburgh to Preswick I did the landings and then we flew back. It's an amazing feeling.' Recently the Mancunian, who moved to Exeter, Devon, after getting a job with Flybe, realised a long-held dream of flying into her home city airport. 'I had this ambition to fly there and I finally got to do that.' she said. 'I'm getting paid to do my hobby - how many people can say that? There has never been a time when I have wanted to do anything else.' It's an expensive hobby. Kate is starting her career with £80,000 worth of debt accumulated from paying for the 14-month intensive live-in course at the Spanish flight school and a pilot loan. She said: 'I guess that money could have been put towards a house and I will to paying it off over a long period. 'However it is all worth it in the end as it setting me up for a lifelong career, so the positives far outweigh the negatives.' As a newly qualified pilot, most of Kate's salary will be eaten up paying for rent and paying off the loan - most loans are payable within seven years. Fortunately, she can expect to be a captain on a Q400 or a first officer on a jet within three years boosting her salary . As with any profession, salaries increase with experience. Figures from October 2011 show that a direct entry captain for Flybe can earn up to £82,000 compared to £81,509 with Easyjet and £65,000 with Emirates. The high debt and comparatively low starting salaries mean it's not a career for the not-quite sure. Kate said: 'I've got the aviation bug. It's a lot of hard work training to become a pilot but it's so rewarding in the end.'",Kate Moran qualifies in industry where only five per cent of pilots are women .

U.S. law enforcement and homeland security personnel face an average of 55 daily encounters with 'known or suspected terrorists' named on government watchlists, U.S. officials told Reuters. The figure - which equals more than 20,000 contacts per year - underscores the growing sweep of the watchlists, which have expanded significantly since a failed Christmas Day 2009 bombing attempt of a U.S. airliner. But officials note that very few of those daily contacts lead to arrests. Civil liberties groups question the use of watchlists, and they have been ridiculed for ensnaring innocent citizens. Scroll down for video . Contact: Government officials say law enforcement and homeland security personnel face an average of 55 daily encounters with 'known or suspected terrorists' each day . U.S. officials said the encounters, which involve airport and border security personnel as well as federal and local law enforcement officers, are reported to the Terrorist Screening Center TSC.L, an interagency unit led by an FBI official based in a tightly guarded building in northern Virginia. At its headquarters, the TSC operates a 24-hour command center, resembling something from a Hollywood thriller, complete with giant wall-screen projections and signs flashing 'SECRET.' Officials said that when a law enforcement or homeland security officer in the field stops a person whose name matches a name in the TSC's databases, the officer is supposed to phone the TSC command center for instructions. Based on information in the databases, the TSC then will advise the officer in the field how to proceed, which could range from releasing the suspect to calling in federal officers as backup. Checkpoint: The Terrorist Screening Center gets about 100 and 150 calls a day, of which an average of 55 involve individuals who turn out to be listed on a federal watchlists . The command center gets between 100 and 150 inquiries a day, of which an average of 55 involve individuals who turn out to be listed on one of the federal watchlists, officials said. Of those calls, about 60 per cent come from federal officers at border or airport security posts; the rest come from local police. 'There are incidents every single day,' said TSC director Timothy Healy. See something, say something? Civil liberties groups question the use of watchlists, and they have been ridiculed for ensnaring innocent citizens . The watchlists include the best known 'no fly list' as well as a 'selectee list' of people who the government thinks should get extra screening or questioning before being allowed to board an airplane.LISTS GET LONGEROfficials acknowledge that the number of names on these lists - and particularly the no-fly list - have grown considerably since Christmas Day 2009. Underwear bomber: Abdulmutallab was listed in a database called TIDE, but not the no-fly list during his failed bomb plot . That was when Nigerian-born militant Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who was listed in a classified database called TIDE, but not the no-fly list, successfully boarded a US-bound aircraft but then failed to detonate a bomb which Yemeni militants had helped him stash in his underpants. Before that incident, the number of names on the no-fly list was around 4,000. U.S. officials said it now contains about 20,000 names while the selectee list contains another 18,000. A new threat to aviation security surfaced earlier this month, in the form of a foiled plot by al-Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate to deploy a more sophisticated 'underwear' bomb. The watchlists have been the subject of controversy - most recently last week when an 18-month-old girl and her parents were taken off a JetBlue flight when the toddler's name appeared on a no-fly security list, apparently the result of a computer glitch. While the U.S. government has instituted measures to enable people to petition for their names to be deleted, officials insist that over time the lists have become more accurate. Watchlisting officials say that airlines maintain their own lists of potentially troublesome passengers; often, they said, when a well-publicized case arises of a prominent or innocent person being denied boarding, it is because the air carrier, rather than the government, misconstrued the identity of someone on its proprietary lists. But Nusrat Choudhury, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said her organization is pursuing legal action on behalf of people who have unjustifiably been restricted from flying. She said redress mechanisms maintained by the government are at best 'ineffective.' Checks and balances: Watchlisting officials say that airlines also maintain their own lists of potentially troublesome passengers . Two or three of the inquiries per day turn out to be people listed on the 'no fly' list, the most restrictive of the watchlists maintained by the TSC. A suspect's name is put on the 'no fly' list if they are deemed by government experts to be a threat to aviation, to be planning an attack or if they are 'operationally capable' and are known to be planning to attend, or to have already attended, a militant training camp. Fewer than 500 of the individuals on the no-fly list are U.S. citizens, officials said.

The blunder happened on the A35 near Dorchester - one of the busiest roads in south west England. The driver simply let little Katie get off and drove away; despite there being no one to help her get inside the school gates. Another parent found the youngster and took her into the school. Katie’s parents, Kris and Helen, are livid that their daughter was left alone by the busy trunk road. Full-time mum Helen, . 45, from nearby Compton Valence, said: 'Anything could have happened to her, it’s such a busy road. I was horrified. 'They had changed the times . so much that Katie was picked up very early in the morning and was . dropped off so early the lady who normally meets her wasn’t there.' Blunder: Six-year-old Katie Dutson was dropped off in a layby near Winterbourne Valley First School (picutred) in Dorchester . She added: 'Her headmistress phoned me to say what had happened and that she had phoned the local council.' The local authority which runs the school bus service has said it is sorry for the error. Katie's dad, photographer Kris, 53, said: 'It was an incredibly dangerous situation. 'She came home from school crying and told us it was really scary. 'When I think of what could have happened . to her it is so upsetting, you hear of so many awful things nowadays . like abductions and accidents. 'We entrusted our child to the bus company and they have let us down big time.' A spokesman for Damory Coaches, which runs the service for Dorset County Council, said the bus timetable and route will be changed so pupils at the school arrive in time to be met by staff. A Dorset County Council spokesman apologised for any distress caused. He added: 'We are working with the bus company so that the child will be dropped off when the school is open.'",Blunder happened on one of the busiest roads in south west England .

Court action: Mr Price and his wife Catherine told Reading Magistrates' Court the noise of excited children screaming was disturbing them . A former chief pilot of Concorde who made a legal bid to silence 'loud' children playing near his millionaire home has had his private prosecution thrown out. Roger Price and his wife became involved in a bitter neighbourhood dispute over noise from a nearby playground which saw them sue the parish council for 'making their lives a misery'. The retired British Airways pilot told a district judge that shrieking children enjoying play facilities erected on a recreation ground next to his million pounds home in Ascot, Berkshire, had spoilt his enjoyment of the upmarket neighbourhood. But despite the former pilot's protestations, District Judge Andrew Vickers threw out the couple's private prosecution today under the Environment Protection Act. Today the wealthy former pilot's woes were compounded when they were asked to pay legal costs of £50,000, before being angrily confronted outside Reading Magistrates Court by banner-waving neighbours calling for their park to be saved. The former pilot claimed the play area – built around 20 yards from his detached house in Ascot, Berkshire – is ‘severely disrupting’ his life. He and his wife, Dr Catherine Bentley-Thomas, 51, fought a private prosecution to try to force Winkfield Parish Council to shut it. The local council spent £150,000 adding play equipment to the village recreation field in May last year, but Mr Price said the park was attracting children from outside the area who are too loud. A total of 13 residents launched the court bid against Winkfield Parish Council, including Sky TV sports presenter Chris Skudder, who also lives near the playground. Mr and Mrs Price now have just 12 weeks to decide whether they want to appeal the decision. 'We are disappointed,' said the 67-year-old as he left Reading Magistrates’ Court. Popular: The playground at the centre of the row, which has had £150,000 spent on it by Winkfield Parish Council, with Mr Price's house visible behind the slide . 'We don’t really see how anyone who listened to all the evidence could think that 250 kids screaming not far from your front garden is not likely to be a noise nuisance. But that is his decision and we accept it.' Earlier this month at Reading Magistrates’ Court he said: ‘The type of noise we have experienced is that of small children screaming and shrieking with excitement.’ He told the court the ‘unpredictable high frequency shrieks’ and the sound of parents calling their children were distracting. ‘My normal life and my ability to enjoy my home and surroundings have been severely disrupted,’ he said. The action is in the name of his wife, a GP. She told the court that the park attracts hundreds of children and parents in the summer but the sound of just one grandfather pushing a child on the swings had been enough to disturb her. Support: The action against the park has been backed by Sky News sports presenter Chris Skudder, pictured . She provided the court with readings taken by a sound consultant that showed the average noise in her garden over a 45-minute period on one afternoon was 57.1 decibels, with peaks of up to 77 decibels from children’s shouts. Mr Price, who worked as a British Airways pilot for 32 years, and his wife have been backed by Sky News sports presenter Chris Skudder, whose house also borders the field. Mr Skudder, who lives with his wife and two children, said the playground had created a ‘living hell’. The residents were accused by barrister for the council Katie Helmore of not wanting ‘children from less affluent areas infiltrating their community’. She pointed to complaints from the residents which included that the park was ‘full of really fat women from Bracknell’ who could not control their children. Other residents, whose homes back on to the park, told the court they supported the playground, which includes water fountains, a sandpit, zipwire and swings. Father of two Alan Weyman said it was a good place to socialise with other parents and it was ‘nice to hear children enjoying themselves’. Chairman of Winkfield Parish Council, Alan Kendall, said after the verdict: 'The council is very pleased with the outcome and hopes the playground can continue to be enjoyed by all of those who have shown support which the council is very grateful for. 'Winkfield Parish Council remains committed to providing first class facilities.'","Former pilot Roger Price had asked for Winkfield Parish Council to pull down play area near his home .

One man was killed and another badly injured after they set themselves alight outside a temple in the Tibetan capital Lhasa on Sunday, in the latest protest over Chinese rule. More than 30 Tibetans have engulfed themselves in fiery protest in the last year, but it's the first time the tiny country's closely tightly guarded capital has been targeted. Chinese authorities have identified the dead man as 19-year-old Tobgye Tseten  and the other man as Dargye, while American sources claim the two men were both waiters at a nearby restaurant. Horror: Onlookers watch as the two men set themselves alight . The protest took place outside the 1,300 year old Jokhang Temple, a sacred place of worship for Tibetans. Free Tibet has reported that the two men hired a room in the Taksham hotel, next to the temple . According to one source, the two men hired a room in Taksham Hotel beside the temple at around 1pm. Exile: Tibetans want the return of the country's spiritual leader, The Dalai Lama . At around 2.15pm they walked out of the hotel towards the temple and made a traditional victory call before setting themselves on fire. There have been at least 34 self-immolations since March of last year to draw attention to China's restrictions on Buddhism and to call for the return from exile of the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. Most have taken place in heavily Tibetan areas of China, but only one had occurred in Tibet itself and none in the capital. Protests have become rare in remote Tibet and Lhasa in particular because of tight police security that has blanketed the area since anti-government riots erupted in Lhasa in 2008. The latest incident occurred in the open-air Barkhor market near the temple in the center of Lhasa, an area popular with Tibetans and tourists alike. Radio Free Asia reported on Monday that Lhasa was under heavy police and paramilitary guard following the immolations and that the situation was very tense. China's official news agency Xinhua blamed the protests on separatists and said the incidents were handled quickly and order restored. 'They were a continuation of the self-immolations in other Tibetan areas and these acts were all aimed at separating Tibet from China,' Xinhua quoted Hao Peng, secretary of the Commission for Political and Legal Affairs of the CPC Tibet Committee, as saying in a statement Sunday. Xinhua said the injured man, who they have named only as Dargye, was in stable condition and able to speak. U.S.-funded radio broadcaster Voice of America said the two men worked at a Lhasa restaurant called Nyima Ling. 'This was the first time it has happened in Lhasa - and right in the middle of Lhasa,' said Tenzin Tsundue, a Tibetan poet and one of the most prominent activists living in India. Protest: The men 'self-immolated' outside the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, one of Tibet's holiest buildings . China says Tibet has always been part of its territory. Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent for centuries . He said it reflects the fact that anger against Chinese rule is not restricted to the areas where most of the self-immolations have occurred - mostly ethnically Tibetan areas outside the legal boundaries of Tibet. 'All over Tibet it's the same emotion, it's the same response' to Beijing's policies, he said. 'We are always in fear of the next self-immolation, and whenever it happens we say prayers. And every time it happens we hope the world is listening."" Two months ago a Tibetan protester set himself on fire in India during a demo against a visit by the Chinese president. Jamphel Yeshi sustained burns to 98 per cent of his body when he sprinted for 50m outside the Indian Parliament building engulfed in flames. He later died. A Tibetan man self-immolates at a protest in India in March . China says Tibet has always been part of its territory, but many Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent for centuries until Chinese troops invaded in the 1950s. Beijing blames the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, for fanning anti-government sentiment and routinely purges monasteries and nunneries, where support for the Dalai Lama and Tibetan independence runs high. Angry and desperate Tibetans have taken to self-immolation in protest, as many as 34 since last March. Last November a 35-year-old nun was captured in a horrifying video after setting herself alight on a Chinese street. And in March a Tibetan man self-immolated in New Delhi, India, to protest a visit by the Chinese president. The centuries-long tradition has become a type of radical political protest and more than 500 have been reported in Western media since the 1960s. But debate rages over the controversial method of protest. Some Buddhists say suicide is violence, and therefore unacceptable, while others see self-sacrifice for a greater cause as legitimate.","One man is dead, the other is in stable condition .

Now researchers believe that a 33-foot sculpture catalogued merely as ‘JE 46278’ actually depicts Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene - the twin babies of Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII. The revelation comes courtesy of Giuseppina Capriotti, an Egyptologist at the Italy's National Research Council. Ancient: The sculpture, which was found in 1918, depicts Cleopatra's twins . Stone-cold truth: The 33-foot sculpture was catalogued merely as 'JE 46278' She described the statue’s unusual looks to Discovery News: ‘It shows two naked children, one male and one female, of identical size standing within the coils of two snakes. Each figure has an arm over the other’s shoulder,‭ ‬while the other hand grasps a serpent.’ She added: ‘Unfortunately the faces are not well preserved, but we can see that the boy has curly hair and a braid on the right side of the head, typical of Egyptian children. The girl’s hair is arranged in a way‬ similar to the so-called ‭m‬elonenfrisur‭ (‬melon coiffure ) an elaborated hairstyle often associated with the Ptolemaic dynasty, and Cleopatra particularly.’ Born in Alexandra in 69BC into a Macedonian Greek dynasty that had ruled Egypt for three centuries, Cleopatra was the last pharaoah of Ancient Egypt, acceding to the throne at just 17 years of age.

He's already ruled out standing for a third term as Mayor of London, sparking speculation he had his sights set on becoming Prime Minister. But Boris Johnson may have hinted that his next political move is even more ambitious than the British premiership - a tilt at becoming President of the United States. During an interview with late night U.S. TV host David Letterman, American-born Boris revealed he qualifies for a pitch at the White House under the constitution. Scroll down to see the video . Larger than life: London Mayor Boris Johnson gesticulates wildly as he appears on The Late Show with David Letterman, broadcast live from New York last night . Scruffy: The jovial politician was in New York to promote his latest book, Johnson¿s Life of London, but took time to talk about his achievements and ambitions as London's top official . He said: ‘As you’ve already pointed out I could be president of the United States, technically speaking.’ Discussing his own American roots, he . said: ‘I was born in New York. A fact I try to conceal from the . electorate of London. It makes me jointly an American citizen. 'This will be broadcast in London and . I wish to make it absolutely clear that my parents were British. I . wanted to be close to my mother and that was where she was. He said he was five when he moved . back to Britain. ‘I didn’t remember so much about New York because we . moved to Washington and Connecticut. I remember America. It is a most . wonderful country.’ The Mayor also used the book tour to promoted the city’s transportation in an appearance with late night show. But at times, eccentric Boris hit an . awkward note as he boasted about London’s hop on, hop-off buses . returning to the capital ‘so you can get drunk and fall off backwards.’ ‘That was banned in the name of safety,’ he said, referring to ‘the wonderful new bus we’ve restored to the streets of London.’ Cracking jokes, he appeared to enjoy baiting the Americans, claiming at one point that he was unlikely to copy a New York ban on giant-sized fizzy drinks because ‘as a city we are not quite as fat, not yet. I have to be honest, we’re not there yet.’ 'How long have you been cutting your own hair?' Veteran talk show host Letterman earned the night's biggest laugh with his wry observation of the London mayor's trademark coiffure . 'London has it all': Mayor Boris made an impassioned vindication of the UK capital as the world's greatest city even, controversially, claiming the U.S. as 'the proudest creation of London' He also elicited a big groan from the . studio audience when he said: ‘I regard America as the proudest creation . of London. It was the ideals of liberty and democracy and habeas corpus . and freedom of speech from 18th century London that were transmitted, . would you not say?’ But Letterman got the biggest laugh of the night when he asked the mayor: ‘How long have you been cutting your own hair?’ ‘I think that was a low blow,’ retorted Johnson. ‘I was beginning to think I'd got . through this more or less unscathed. You even mentioned the book more . than a few times,’ he added, referring to Johnson’s Life of London, his . latest tome he was in New York promoting. Asked if he would run as mayor a third . time, he said: ‘This will be my second term. I regret I said I wouldn’t . run any more. I said that’s it.’ Pressed on whether he would ever be prime minister, he added: ‘I have about as much chance as being reincarnated as an olive.’ American roots: The London mayor was in fact born in New York . ‘Do you think the hair is holding you back?’ joked Letterman. ‘Until you mentioned it tonight, I’d never regarded it as doing that,’ he replied. Dressed in a black suit with . purple tie, the mayor marched onto the set to the tune of Clash’s . ‘London Calling’ on last night and quickly made himself at home, making reference to Samuel Johnson’s famous quote ‘When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life.’ ‘For . any man or woman who is at all intellectual London has it all. My . purpose is to celebrate London, to encourage people to come to the city . and to proclaim the genius of London,’ he explained. ‘The . population is about 7.8million. It’s growing. It’s unlike any other . major city in that its growing. In order to cope you have to put in more . homes, an ever better transportation system.’ Hailing . the success of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, he said to Letterman: ‘You . left out the rain. The rain was a critical ingredient. I heard someone . said it was one of the greatest aquatic triumphs of the British people . since Trafalgar. It was like a kind of version of Dunkirk except with a . much jollier outcome.’ Talk of the Jubilee was an opportunity for another Boris joke to drop like a lead balloon. ‘Well, . I try to get everything sponsored. In this country there’s a very . famous and distinguished banker, Bob Diamond, and I said if he sponsored . it would be called the Diamond jubilee. ‘I’m making that up by the way. He’s a very generous guy Bob Diamond.’ When the audience sounded confused, Letterman said: 'I have to explain a lot of my jokes, too.’ ‘He runs Barclays, which I think has a presence here,’ added Johnson, undeterred. 'Entirely communist scheme': Mr Johnson also took the opportunity to praise his own 'Boris bikes', which now number 6,000 at stations across the centre of London . On the Olympics, he said: ‘Its all going to be fantastic. You’re most welcome to come.’ ‘As I hope people will discover if they come this summer, there has been massive investment in the tube network, which is good because there is a very old system,  a massive new fast across town train system coming in, a wonderful new bus we’ve restored to the streets of London the hop on hop off, so you can get drunk and fall over backwards. That was banned in the name of safety and we’ve now restored that.' Of London’s bicycle transport, he said: ‘It’s an entirely  communist scheme put in by a conservative mayor and it works beautifully. We have more than 6,000 bikes on the streets.’ Just in case anyone was taking him too seriously, Johnson said he was a big fan of New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg. ‘One time he was standing for election and I came here and he was in quite a tough fight and I asked him if it would be at all useful for me to endorse him. ‘He thought about it for a while and he said he’d much prefer it if I’d endorsed his opponent.’","American-born Boris Johnson makes joke that his next political move could be for President of U.S. as he appears on Letterman .

A decorated paramedic who did not bother trying to revive an unconscious 93-year-old woman on Christmas Day has been found guilty of misconduct. Alan Clark MBE decided the pensioner was dead after she stopped breathing even though there was still heart activity. He shunned a colleague’s offer of a defibrillator and took little or no action for more than ten minutes before calling the clinical help desk for advice. Clark eventually asked for his own defibrillator to be fetched, but did not use it and made no efforts to perform CPR before declaring the woman dead. He told a Health Professions Council hearing the woman was already dead when he arrived at the Birchwood Care Home in Ilford, Essex. But a three-man panel rejected his claim and decided that his fitness to practise was impaired due to his misconduct. Clark will now hear his fate at a later date yet to be announced after the panel ran out of time. Student paramedic Corinne Zeiderman, who was on the call on Christmas Day 2010 with Clark, said he did not tell his colleagues what he was doing and just sent her to fetch equipment. ‘We were saying her heart rate was getting slower, but he was on the phone in the doorway and waved his hand, to be quiet, he was not interested and he was busy’, she said. ‘At that point, there were still things we could have done for her. ‘Even if it is not going to get anywhere, it is still worth going through the motions. You never know.’ Ms Zeiderman and a colleague reported Clark to bosses on their return to base at Whipps Cross Ambulance Station in east London. Alan Clark, who has been found guilty of misconduct, had worked at Whipps Cross Ambulance Station in east London pictured above . The HPC panel ruled that he had made no efforts to save the woman and there was no evidence she was dead when Clark arrived. But Clark told the hearing sticking to the guidelines would ‘cramp his style’ in the future, and that patients would lose out. Gillian . Fleming, who chaired the hearing, said: ‘Mr Clark told the panel that . he had fully reflected on the incident and that he is always learning. ‘He explained that he has reviewed his practice and undertaken extensive study. ‘However, he also said that he stands by his actions and he would only act differently with regard to communication with colleagues so they would understand his reasoning.’ Ms Fleming added: ‘What Mr Clark said about how he would approach further events of cardiac arrest did not give confidence that he would operate within the relevant guidelines. ‘This indicates a lack of real insight into this incident and demonstrates that he does not accept the validity of those guidelines.’ Clark, who was given an MBE in 2007 for his work in the ambulance service since 1985, was accused of being an unreliable witness whose story had changed several times. ‘In a number of significant matters, we have found that Mr Clark’s subsequent accounts have both varied between themselves and departed from the events as they are recorded on the day’, Ms Fleming said. Clark offered reasons during the hearing why he failed to attach a heart monitor, opted not to use the defibrillator, or start CPR. He also claimed to have been under stress during the incident because members of the woman’s family were upset. The panel dismissed his excuses and ruled his fitness to practice was impaired because of misconduct. They had earlier dismissed allegations that Clark had simulated resuscitation to appease the family of a dying patient on an earlier occasion, due to lack of evidence.","Alan Clark decided the pensioner was dead even though there was still heart activity .

Several high-ranking officials in New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority are cashing in on overtime and padding their pensions, it has been revealed. Vincent Blackburn, who repairs commuter cars on the system’s Long Island Rail Road, brought home a stunning $135,684.53 in overtime in 2011 alone, the New York Post reported. But Blackburn is only one of 20 MTA employees essentially tripling their incomes at a time when New York City subway riders are told they should expect more fare hikes in the not-too-distant future. Training day: Vincent Blackburn, who repairs commuter cars on the Long Island Rail Road, brought home a stunning $135,684.53 in overtime in 2011 alone . Worker's rights: An obscure labour law called Rule 24 allows some train workers to claim massive amounts of overtime at the repair station in Queens . According to the Post, which obtained the payroll information through the Freedom of Information Act, Blackburn’s initial salary was a respectable $66,539.12. He, as well as several other high-earning MTA workers- manage to earn their sky-high overtime through an antiquated labour loophole known as ‘Rule 24,’ which states that a train repairman must be on premise for all shifts, even if no trains require repair. Blackburn works with other MTA staffers at the Richmond Hill, Queens repair shop repairing LIRR commuter trains. He refused comment to the Post. Because of the labour law, Blackburn managed to earn more than the company’s COO, Robert Foran, who earns $197,532.25 per annum. MTA spokesperson Aaron Donovan confirmed to msnbc.com that Blackburn did indeed bring in more than $100,000 in overtime, and that Rule 24 is an issue they hope to address in the future. He said: ‘Certainly people do earn overtime, but the overall aggregate figure is down,’ adding that overtime pay, especially within the LIRR, had gone down considerably in recent years. Not fare: Commuters have seen several steep increases in LIRR and subway fares, and it's only expected to climb . Final destination: The LIRR serves around 6million commuters on Long Island who need to get into the city . Mr Donovan told the Post: ‘In 2010, . overtime hours were reduced by 12.6 per cent, saving $13.4million, and . remained at that reduced level in 2011.’ But that news may not be enough to sway commuters who have seen extreme fare increases in the past few years – and can expect more next year, and again in 2015. After passing the so-called ‘Doomsday Budget’ in 2009 – which significantly raised fares for the subway, buses, bridges, and tunnels, many commuters thought they couldn't be more financial worry. But in 2010, riders were subjected to fare increases for the third time in three years. In 2008, the monthly unlimited MetroCard was $89. It currently costs $104. Uphill battle: The MTA has had several budget crises in the past few years, and has dealt with ageing cars, track repair, and rising pension costs . In addition, the cost of a single ride is expected to be around $2.50 a ride by 2015, according to an exclusive NBC New York published in March. Because of budget cuts, several lines were scrapped, including the W and V trains, and service was reduced in many stations. The MTA has struggled to meet the ever-increasing demands of New York’s demanding commuter population. It serves more than 14.9million customer with an average weekly ridership of 8.5million on more than 2,000 miles of track. Among its larger undertakings are the long-talked about Second Avenue subway, the extension of the 7 line from Times Square to the West Side, and Grand Central access for LIRR commuters. These projects have all gone well over-budget and surpassed their initial timelines.","Payroll report shows that MTA workers like Vincent Blackburn earned more than $100K in overtime in 2011 .

The battle rages over the estate of the Painter of Light, as his mistress today claimed famed commercial artist Thomas Kinkade left her his mansion and millions of dollars. Mr Kinkade’s mistress, Amy Pinto-Walsh, recently produced a shaky, hand-written will that states she is entitled to his Californian mansion and an additional $10million to start a museum at that location, as well as another $66.3million in original artwork and collected paintings. Kinkade’s wife of 30 years has been fighting Pinto-Walsh in court in a bitter struggle over the painter’s estate. The two are due in court today in what will undoubtedly be the next chapter of an agonizing spat. Scroll down for video . Battle: Thomas Kinkade's girlfriend says that the 'Painter of Light' left her his two estates and an additional $10million in a barely-legible will . Family: The artist's wife Nanette, pictured right with their four daughters, said her husband provided his family with a 'wonderful life' Pinto-Walsh claims the barely-legible will was written by the 54-year-old Kinkade on November 18 of last year and gives her control over his two properties nestled in Monte Sereno, a wealthy neighbourhood in Los Gatos. The document, originally obtained by the San Jose Mercury News, was scribbled on what seems to be a piece of paper from a legal notepad. Entitled: Amy Pinto-Walsh claims the will is Kinkade's and gives her millions of dollars . It reads: ‘I, Thomas Kinkade, being of sound mind and body do hereby bequeath to Amy Pinto Walsh $10,000,000 in cash from my corporate policy.’ He also wrote that Pinto-Walsh should have his two properties on Ridgecrest Avenue ‘for her security'. It is signed and dated November 18, 2011. Mr Kinkade, who died of an accidental Valium and alcohol overdose in April, was dating Pinto-Walsh at the time of his death. He was married to Nanette Kinkade for more than 30 years and the couple had four daughters together. Pinto-Walsh, who was called a gold-digger by the estranged Mrs Kinkade, said after the painter’s death that the two were planning to wed after his divorce was finalised. In April, lawyers portrayed Mr . Kinkade's girlfriend as a ruthless gold digger who is out to 'tear down' the late artist's reputation and do irreparable damage to his family. The . restraining order against Amy Pinto-Walsh claimed she broke a . confidentiality agreement by talking to reporters the morning Mr Kinkade . was found dead and threatened to reveal his business and personal . secrets. The artist's . bodyguard - who drove him around after he was caught drink driving - . said the family had reason to fear Pinto-Walsh because she was prone to . 'impulsive and erratic' behavior and once threatened to 'tear Mr Kinkade . down'. Will and testament: The will was written on notepaper and is barely legible . Struggle: The devout Christian had battled through a divorce and bankruptcy in recent years while also facing needling critics, his brother said . 'Amy was already part of his circle of friends and that really enraged Nanette,' an unnamed source told Radar Online. 'Nanette was furious and humiliated that he not only cheated on her, but moved on so quickly and publicly with her.' She didn't make any attempt to hide . her frustration as she filed a restraining order against his . mistress shortly after his death, wanting to stop her from breaching a confidentiality agreement she signed more than a year ago. It is estimated that one in every 20 homes in American contains a piece an artwork by the 'Painter of Light'. His estate - of which Mrs Kinkade is . the principal trustee - has filed documents with a Santa Clara court . seeking an injunction against Ms Pinto-Walsh, according to Los Gatos . Patch. Painter of light: Mr Kinkade's talent, shown here in Living Waters: Golfer's Paradise, Hole One is a characteristic of his serene style that put roughly one of his paintings in every 20 homes . Success: Mr Kinkade's works were popular, but his battle with alcoholism led him to an arrest for DUI (right) Mr Kinkade died of accidental acute intoxication from alcohol . and an anti-anxiety medication, an autopsy report revealed. The . Santa Clara County Coroner's Office reported Kinkade's cause of death . as 'acute ethanol and Diazepam intoxication' and manner of death as . 'accident,' according to NBC Bay Area. Diazepam is the active ingredient in name-brand drug Valium. Kinkade, whose work captivated . millions of Americans despite the scorn of many art critics, died in . April at his home in Northern California at the age of 54. The coroner’s report also said the painter suffered from ‘hypertensive and atherosclerotic heart disease.’ Father: Mr Kinkade, pictured here drawing his daughter Winsor, was said by his brother to have been cleaning himself up to remain in his children's lives . In layman’s terms, Kinkade had high blood pressure and thickened artery walls in his heart due to high cholesterol. His . brother said that the painter had . battled alcoholism for several years and suffered a relapse before he . died. Patrick Kinkade said . his brother had been burdened in recent years by a separation from his . wife, financial troubles and the low opinion of his work by critics. Thomas Kinkade was arrested for drunk driving in 2010, the same year his company filed for bankruptcy.

Two parents were jailed after pleading guilty to abusing and neglecting their five children, leaving their youngest son starved to the brink of death. Andy and Jessie Meeks, both 25, were each sentenced to seven years yesterday and have lost their parental rights. On April 15 last year, police went to their home in Middletown, Connecticut after reports of a domestic disturbance. They found five children, all under the age of six, in disgusting conditions without food, heat or proper clothing. Abuse: Jessie Meeks and her husband Andy Meeks, both 25, were jailed for seven years in Connecticut for starving their children and leaving them to sleep on soiled mattresses . Officers at the home reported that it stank of urine and the mattresses where the children slept were covered in vomit and feces. Piles of dirty clothes, empty beer cans and dishes lay all over the property, there was no bedding and the heating system had not worked in a long time, according to authorities. The Meeks' youngest child, a five-month-old boy, was so malnourished that he was only the size of a newborn. The baby who was 'minimally responsive' was flown to Connecticut Medical Center along with his two-year-old brother. According to the Middletown Press, a doctor who treated the baby said he was so badly neglected he . may have died within days and the 'officer very likely saved the infant’s . life'. The parents did not contact doctors to find out about their son's condition until three days later. House of horrors: The police had went to the Meek family home in Middletown, Connecticut after reports of a domestic dispute but found their five children starved and beaten . The three older children - two boys, . six and five, and a four-year-old girl - told police that their father . beat them with a paddle and that they only got dinner 'on a few days'. The five-year-old added 'he asked for too much stuff' and his parents would make him garbage and 'stick his face in it'. The little girl said her mother would put hot sauce in her mouth as punishment. A social worker later said an entire box of baby wipes was needed to clean the four-year-old's feet and the children's clothes had to be thrown away because they were so ragged and filthy. While being questioned by police, the only time Jessie Meeks cried was when she was told she would no longer be entitled . to $654 in state aid since her children had been taken away. The Meeks claimed to have been feeding the . baby, who was born prematurely, 8 ounces of oatmeal a day but doctors . said this was not possible given his condition. Critical: The Meeks' five-month-old baby was taken to hospital in Connecticut because police found the child malnourished and barely responsive . Andy Meeks said his children 'have really high metabolisms' and blamed the appalling condition of the house on the fact his wife had depression, abused drugs and drank a lot. The couple pleaded guilty earlier this year to five counts of risk of injury to a minor. At their sentencing, Judge Susan Handy said: 'I don’t know how you could let your children starve and live in their own waste. Two were near death. You are unfit to be a parent.' Both were sentenced to seven years. Andy Meek will serve one year in jail and be on probation for five. His wife will serve two years and a further five on probation. All . the Meek children were taken from the home on the day they were found . by police and placed in state care. They are all now with foster . families.","Jessie and Andy Meeks, both 25, sentenced in Connecticut over abuse .

George Osborne is refusing calls to apologise for saying Ed Balls had ‘questions to answer’ over the bank rate-fixing scandal. Demands for an apology from the Chancellor were even backed by some senior Tories, including his predecessor Lord Lamont, who said Mr Osborne had ‘overplayed his hand’, adding: ‘If there is an allegation Ed Balls was involved, it doesn’t stand up. That is clear.’ Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, a member of the Commons Treasury Committee, triggered fury in the Treasury by saying Mr Osborne had clearly made a mistake and should now say sorry. George Osborne had tried to link the 2008 rate-fixing scandal to his opposite number Mr Balls, who was a key figure in the Labour government at the time. But Mrs Leadsom said evidence to MPs from Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker, who insisted there had been no pressure from Labour ministers to persuade banks to manipulate their rates, had ‘completely squashed’ Mr Osborne’s allegations. Obviously he made a mistake and I think he should apologise,’ she told BBC Radio 4’s The World Tonight. ‘I think it was a very valid discussion at the time about who knew what and it has now been completely squashed by Paul Tucker.’ Labour Treasury spokesman Chris . Leslie described Mr Tucker’s evidence as ‘the final nail in the coffin . of the Tory smear campaign the Chancellor led last week’. Deputy governor Paul Tucker rejected claims Labour ministers, including former City minister Ed Balls asked him to pressure Barclays to lower Libor submissions . But . David Cameron’s spokesman insisted Mr Osborne would not apologise, . saying: ‘The Treasury has been making the position clear that he won’t. He [the Prime Minister] agrees with the Treasury.’ A Treasury source said: ‘Labour protests too much. Can they say that no Labour figure was aware of Libor low-balling? Paul Tucker, pictured, denied he was ever encouraged to 'lean on' Barclays to lower its Libor submissions . ‘Can . they say no Labour figure implicitly or explicitly condoned it in . conversations with the banks? They haven’t been able  to so far.’ Mr Tucker, who is a frontrunner for . the role of Governor when Sir Mervyn King steps down, told MPs this week . a record of a contentious phonecall he had with former Barclays boss . Bob Diamond about Libor gave the 'wrong impression'. Appearing . in front of the Treasury Select Committee, the senior banker said he . had intended to ensure Barclays was not 'inadvertently sending distress . signals' about its financial health at a time when the market viewed the . bank as the next in line for a government bailout. The . deputy governor rejected claims that the then Downing Street chief of . staff Sir Jeremy Heywood, then City minister Ed Balls and former . Treasury minister Baroness Vadera had asked him to pressure Barclays to . lower its Libor submissions. He . expressed concern that the rates for borrowing in US dollars were . falling faster than those in sterling. In one email, Sir Jeremy asked Mr . Tucker if he had heard that Libor is high ‘because Barclays are bidding . it’. However, at no point . do the email exchanges show Sir Jeremy encouraging Mr Tucker to tell .

The regulator said was investigating ‘potentially problematic’ claims on Apple’s website about the iPad’s 4G capabilities in the UK. The UK does not yet have widespread 4G coverage, and the iPad will be incompatible with it when the first networks arrive. The feature is much-hyped by Apple as a selling point for the new tablet. Wall of iPads in London's Covent Garden Apple Store: The UK does not yet have widespread 4G coverage, and the iPad will be incompatible with it when the first networks arrive. The feature is much-hyped by Apple as a selling point for the new tablet . This 4G stands for ‘fourth . generation’, a new kind of signal technology used to receive . the internet on mobile phones. Much of the UK already uses 3G, but demand for 'on the go' data means the networks are overloaded. What will make 4G diffferent? The industry says 4G will allow . mobile internet to run at the . same speed as domestic superfast . broadband. This will allow . users to watch videos more . easily on the go, and could . provide access to those whose . are out of reach of underground . broadband cables.

The iPad’s current 4G configuration means it will . not be able to connect to British and European networks because the . frequencies are different to those used in the US and Canada. Apple has already offered a refund to . all Australian buyers of the new tablet - which has a similarly . incompatible network -  in response to pressure from a consumer . watchdog. The ASA first investigated Apple for misleading’ 4G claims but closed the case informally when the company agreed to change its advertising. It was now investigating new complaints from consumers that suggested the problematic claims were still appearing. Apple has so far declined to comment. However the BBC reported a source at the company saying that no undertaking was given to remove all references to 4G from its site. Apple’s UK site still allows consumers to buy a ‘Wi-Fi + 4G’ version of the iPad - and iPads are still marked as offering 4G. The ASA said in a statement: ‘To confirm, we received 40 complaints about claims for the iPad with Wi-Fi and 4G that appeared on Apple (UK) Ltd’s website. 'Complainants challenged whether the references to 4G were misleading, because they understood that 4G was not currently available in the UK. 'Some of the complainants also challenged the description of the iPad as 4G because they did not believe that the iPad would be compatible with 4G networks when they were introduced in the future.' ‘When we approached Apple with the concerns that had been raised, it stated it had removed references to 4G from the webpage that was subject to the complaints.

Humanity faces a ‘vortex of economic, socio-political and environmental ills’ unless the world’s richest nations tighten their belts and consume less, according to a report. A Royal Society panel has concluded that a ‘tipping point’ has been reached and that the very future of humanity is doubt unless developed nations rethink the way they live. Sir John Sulston, who led the 23-strong group of academics from around the world who produced the report, warned that ‘we are reaching a critical time in the development of humanity on the Earth’ and that continual economic growth ‘is not sustainable’. Double trouble: The Royal Society says that developed nations consume too much and that the world's population is too high . He said: ‘The human world lives in a framework called global economics. We live in a system based on GDP, which drives consumption. it causes people to compete with each other through trade in a way that they all grow. All governments say: “We must grow.” But it’s not sustainable. ‘The strong evidence is that we’re running out of space. We’re collectively affecting the world’s climate. This is due to the still growing human population and our increase in consumption.’ The report highlights the fact that the world’s population passed seven billion recently and that developing countries will be building the equivalent of a city of a million people every five days from now to 2050. Food for thought: Some people eat too much than is good for them, while others starve, says Sir John Sulston . Sir John said: ‘The world now has a very clear choice. We can choose to address the twin issues of population and consumption to rebalance the use of resources to a more egalitarian pattern of consumption. ‘Or we choose to do nothing and to drift into a downward vortex of economic, socio-political and environmental ills, leading to a more unequal and inhospitable future.’ He added that some people in the world are consuming far too much food than is good for them, while others starve.","'Continual economic growth is not sustainable,' said Royal Society panel ."

A once-extinct moth has recolonised large parts of the UK by gaining a foothold in abandoned industrial sites, conservationists said today. The small ranunculus moth disappeared from the UK before the Second World War, but reappeared from Europe in the late Nineties, establishing itself in brownfield sites such as abandoned quarries and spreading along roadside verges. Brownfield sites typically hold plants that the moth's larvae feed on and have proved important for the species' recovery, wildlife charity Butterfly Conservation said. Return: The small ranunculus moth disappeared from the UK before the Second World War but is now back after gaining a foothold on brownfield sites . Old quarries, disused railway lines, gravel pits and spoil tips are also key habitats for threatened and common moths and other wildlife. The six-belted clearwing, a moth which mimics a wasp, also relies on brownfield land, as do rare species such as the four-spotted, the wormwood and the bright wave moths and more common insects such as the elephant hawk-moth. But Butterfly Conservation warned that brownfield sites were under-recorded and threatened by Government policy which favours building on previously-used land rather than greenfield sites. The annual 'moth night', organised by Butterfly Conservation and butterfly, moth and dragonfly journal Atropos, is focusing on the wildlife of brownfield sites with surveys across the UK and efforts to map the return of the small ranunculus.

The Curiosity vehicle, which is the size of a car, is aiming for a deep depression known as Gale Crater.

Engineers have been tackling a fault on the Odyssey satellite and it is no longer in the best observational orbit. Artist's impression of Nasa's Curiosity Rover on the surface of Mars . The team are now in a frantic race to move it back in the next three weeks, or Nasa will lose signal to the rover just as it is about to touch down. Engineers today tried to play down the gaffe, claiming it will not affect the outcome of the landing because Curiosity's descent manoeuvres are all performed automatically. 'Odyssey right now looks like it may not be in the same spot that we'd expected it to be,' said Doug McCuistion, the director of Nasa's Mars exploration programme. 'There may be some changes in real-time communication. We'll let you know as this develops; we still have more work to do. But keep in mind, there is no risk to [Curiosity] landing.

The . results suggest that, should Mars harbor simple organic molecules, . NASA’s prospects for discovering them during Curiosity’s explorations . are better than previously thought, said Alexander Pavlov of the NASA . Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, lead author of the . study. Complex organic molecules could hint more strongly at the possibility of past life on the planet. These molecules, made up of 10 or more carbon atoms, could resemble known building blocks of life such as the amino acids that make up proteins. However, within 2 to 4 inches beneath the surface, the amount of radiation reduces tenfold. Although that’s still extreme, the team reports that simple organic molecules, such as a single formaldehyde molecule, could exist at this depth -- and in some places, specifically young craters, the complex building blocks of life could remain as well. ‘Right . now the challenge is that past Martian landers haven’t seen any organic . material whatsoever,’ Pavlov said. ‘We know that organic molecules have . to be there but we can’t find any of them in the soil.’ Its . assignment is to investigate whether conditions have been favorable for . microbial life and for preserving clues in the rocks about possible . past life.

After numerous retirements, unretirements and a federal indictment, Roger Clemens is returning to baseball - at the tender age of 50. Clemens, who was acquitted of several charges of lying to Congress in June, signed with the Sugar Land Skeeters of the independent Atlantic League on Monday. He is slated to start for the minor league team on Saturday at home against Bridgeport. Still got it? Clemens has not pitched professionally since 2007, during his second stint with the New York Yankees . 'His fastball was clocked at 87 mph; all of his pitches were working,' said Randy Hendricks, Clemens' agent. 'He threw a three-inning simulated game after an extensive workout warm-up.' Clemens and Skeeters manager Gary Gaetti have been talking about this 'for months,' Hendricks said. Gaetti, who's only four years older than Clemens, is also a former major leaguer. Javier Bracamonte, who caught Clemens' workout for the Skeeters, told KRIV: 'He's in such great shape, it's ridiculous. He's the same guy he was before. Facing Congress: Appearing at a deposition on February 13, 2008, Clemens denied he ever took steroids or human growth hormone . Prime: Clemens professional career stretched more than 20 years and four teams - The Red Sox, Blue Jays, Yankees and Astros . 'He is nasty. His split is good. He still has life. He was throwing in the high 80s.' Clemens is expected to appear at a press conference scheduled for . Tuesday morning at Constellation Field in Sugarland to make the signing . official. His return to the mound comes after years of speculation that marred his career. Clemens was accused of using using steroids and HGH during his playing career in the 2007 Mitchell Report on drugs and baseball. Appearing before Congress at a deposition months later, he denied the charge. His denial led lawmakers to pursue perjury charges against him. But in a 'he said, he said' battle with accuser and former trainer Brian McNamee, Clemens triumphed, and was acquitted in June of charges he lied to Congress. Accuser: In a 'he said, he said' battle with former trainer Brian McNamee, left, Clemens triumphed, and was acquitted in June of charges he lied to Congress . He hasn't played for a team since pitching for the Yankees in 2007 at the age of 45. He went 6-6 in 18 games with a 4.18 ERA that season. Clemens had two great seasons with the Astros after he turned 40, going 18-4 with a 2.98 ERA in 2004 to win his record-tying seventh Cy Young Award. He was 13-8 with a career-low 1.87 ERA in 2005. Husband: Clemens walks into court with his wife Debbie in this July 6, 2010 photo . Clemens earned $160million and won 354 games in a 24-year career with the Red Sox, Yankees, Blue Jays and Astros. His 4,672 strikeouts are third-most all-time and he was named to 11 All-Star games. Now he'll see what he has left for the Skeeters, who play in the Atlantic League. He joins a roster that includes former major league pitchers Tim Redding and Scott Kazmir and Jason Lane, a teammate of Clemens' on Houston's 2005 World Series team. It isn't clear how long Clemens will pitch for the Skeeters. Hendricks said: 'This is a one game at a time thing. Let's see how he does on Saturday.' Clemens is set to appear on the Hall of Fame ballot going to voters late this year; if he appeared in a major league game his Hall consideration would be pushed back five years. The Justice Department began an investigation concerning whether Clemens had lied under oath, and in 2010 a grand jury indicted him on two counts of perjury, three counts of making false statements and one count of obstructing Congress when he testified. He was acquitted of all the charges on June 19 after a 10-week trial and has largely stayed out of the public spotlight until now. The signing was first reported by Houston television station KRIV.

Fine weather usually brings a welcome boost for the economy as consumers head outdoors to spend, spend, spend. But record high temperatures in March have left maple syrup producers in the U.S. feeling as flat as a pancake. Warm conditions are being blamed for bad-tasting syrup and a fall in supplies of up to 40 per cent. Sweet or sour? Producers in the U.S. say warm weather has given their maple syrup, usually served with pancakes, a bad taste . Some sugar maple trees, which need freezing temperatures at night to sustain sap production, have dried up early while others have produced syrup with a poor taste. In northeastern parts of the U.S., where nearly all the country's maple syrup is produced, sugarmakers traditionally gather sap during a six-week season from late February to early April before buds appear on the trees. But the 2012 season was cut short by the warmest March since records began in 1895. Alfred Carrier, a sugarmaker in Glover, Vermont, said: 'You take 80 degrees in March by golly it don't help nothing. 'We had quite a lot of off-flavored syrup. 'I don't think you'd want to put it on a pancake.' Feeling the heat: Some sugar maple trees have dried up early while others have produced syrup with a poor taste . Denise Marshall, owner of syrup distributor D&D Sugarwoods in Glover, said trees that did not dry up prematurely ended up producing 'yucky' syrup. 'It was kind of a disaster,' Marshall said. Maple syrup production has been increasing in the U.S. over the past decade as a result of new technology and a rising number of trees in production. It takes about 40 gallons of sap, usually gathered from the tapped trees through plastic tubing using a vacuum system, to yield one gallon of syrup. Short supply: The U.S. is expected to produce 18million pounds of syrup this year, down from 30million pounds in 2011 . Vermont, New York and Maine are the states which produce the most. Syrup unsuitable for the breakfast table is typically sold for industrial purposes such as flavouring chewing tobacco or salad dressing. The U.S. is expected to produce 18million pounds of syrup this year, down from 30million pounds in 2011, according to a crop estimate report by Arthur Coombs of Bascom Maple Farms. Other uses: Syrup unsuitable for the breakfast table is sold for industrial purposes such as flavouring chewing tobacco or salad dressing . Mr Coombs's company, based in Alstead, New Hampshire, is one of the four largest maple processors in the U.S. Mr Coombs said that, despite the shortfall, retail prices have risen by only 5 per cent this year. He said this was because the Federation of Quebec Maple Producers has retained 38million pounds of syrup in reserve from a bumper crop in 2011. Quebec produces about 80 per cent of the world's maple syrup. Scientists said the average March temperature of 51.1F in the U.S. was 8.6 degrees above the 20th-century average for the month.","Hot conditions blamed for 'off-flavoured' taste and sharp fall in production .

The Government has terminated a contract with welfare-to-work firm A4e after deciding that continuing would be 'too great a risk'. However, the company still has 11 contracts with the Government, while the one which was terminated was the smallest it held. Employment minister Chris Grayling said the company’s Mandatory Work Activity contract to help up to 1,000 jobless people in the South-East find work was being ended. The Department for Work and Pensions has been auditing its commercial relationships with A4e after receiving an allegation against the company earlier this year. 'While the team found no evidence of fraud, it identified significant weaknesses in A4e’s internal controls on the Mandatory Work Activity contract in the South-East. Employment minister Chris Grayling said A4e's Mandatory Work Activity contract to help up to 1,000 jobless people in the South-East find work was being ended. Emma Harrison resigned as chairman of A4e in February following a wake of arrests, although she has not given up her 85 per cent shareholding . 'The documentation supporting payments was seriously inadequate, and in a small number the claim was erroneous. There was also a high incidence of non-compliance with other relevant guidance (including A4e’s own processes). 'The process established prior to March fell significantly short of our expectations. As a result, the Department has concluded that continuing with this contract presents too great a risk and we have terminated the Mandatory Work Activity contract with A4e for the South-East. 'Contingency plans are in place to ensure there is continuity of support for participants in the Mandatory Work Activity programme,' said Mr Grayling. A4e is still the subject of a police investigation into allegations of fraud relating to government schemes. A number of people have been arrested by police investigating the company's offices in Slough, Berkshire, and are on bail until dates in late May, June and July. An eighth person was arrested on Monday.  Seven others are on bail until dates in late May, June and July. A4e still holds 11 long-term unemployment contracts with the Government . In the wake of those arrests, Emma Harrison resigned as chairman of A4e in February, although she has not given up her 85 per cent shareholding. A4e held the prime contract for delivery of Mandatory Work Activity in the South-East, covering Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Surrey & Sussex, Thames Valley, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire.` The programme is aimed at helping Jobseeker’s allowance claimants identified as most in need of support. Participation is mandatory, with sanctions against those who fail to take part, or complete a placement. A4e is keeping other contracts it has with the Department for Work and Pensions, including those under the Work Programme, which tackles long-term unemployment. The original allegation against the company suggested that A4e employees may have claimed payments for Mandatory Work Activity (MWA) claimants who had not been placed in work. Investigations were held into every MWA claim from the office in Epsom, Surrey, where the allegation was centred, as well as 20 per cent of all the other A4e claims under the contract. It was established that 97 per cent of payments related to someone taking part in the programme, while the remaining 3 per cent were attributable to inadequate procedures rather than fraud. Emma Harrison's country mansion in Derbyshire. Mrs Harrison was made a CBE in 2010 . Mr Grayling added: 'We have made clear to A4e that we continue to require the highest standards of governance in relation to all their other contracts. 'We are reminding all our other providers of their obligations and our requirements in this regard and, should any further allegations arise, we will examine the evidence thoroughly. 'The Department will reflect on how it can further improve its processes in the light of these audits to address any remaining control risks across all contracts and providers. 'Recent coverage has also prompted complaints about service levels on past employment programmes where, unlike the Work Programme, the emphasis was on activities undertaken rather than on job outcomes. 'While this has not been part of our investigation, the Department is considering what further steps can best ensure that providers meet their minimum standards, and participants are clear about procedures for complaints.' Shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said: 'After eight arrests at A4e, the shambles in DWP contracts is now spreading. We demanded that the Government came clean about these contracts months ago. 'Now we hear they have been forced to cancel a contract vital to helping get people back to work just as Britain has hit a double-dip recession made in Downing Street. 'The Government must now stop hiding performance information about the rest of its giant private sector contracts and publish so that Parliament can see whether public money is being well spent.' Emma Harrison was appointed back-to-work tsar by David Cameron in December 2010. Iain Duncan Smith’s department was told about fraud allegations at Ms Harrison’s company a month before she was appointed. But despite this, the PM still made her the 'families' champion'. Through her taxpayer-backed company A4e, she has banked an £8.6million dividend. Mrs Harrison, 48, who founded A4e more than 20 years ago, is worth an estimated £70million. She lives at Thornbridge Hall, a £7million mansion in Derbyshire, with her husband,Jim, 52, their four children, 11 close friends and their six children. In March, a confidential internal audit report seen by the Daily Mail painted a devastating picture of her firm. It revealed that auditors found evidence of potential fraud or rule-breaking in 13 out of 16 A4e offices they visited three years ago. In some cases, employers said they had never heard of A4e clients to whom they had supposedly given a job. In others, A4e staff were suspected of fabricating evidence in order to claim state payments for finding people work. The revelations raise serious questions about checks at the Department for Work and Pensions which has gone on to hand the firm new contracts worth hundreds of millions of pounds. A4e welcomed the finding that no fraud had been identified, saying that with reviews by the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assembly Governments, this means that the majority of its business has been fully examined by external auditors. Chief executive Andrew Dutton said: 'These findings demonstrate what I have always maintained to be true - that there is no place for fraud at A4e and make it clear that A4e has strong controls around its flagship contract the Work Programme. 'Our immediate task is to further enhance our controls to cement our position as a trusted provider of front line public services. 'The findings also vindicate the hard work our 3,500 staff do - day in, day out. All over the country we’re helping tens of thousands of people into training and work, knowing we have in place robust levels of quality and assurance. 'As a company, I recognise that we haven’t got it right all of the time, but we are committed to taking responsibility for our mistakes and remedying them. 'No other provider has undergone such a thorough and forensic review of its contracts, and the positive outcome speaks for itself - this is huge reassurance for taxpayers and our customers.' A4e said that following the DWP review of its MWA contract, some specific issues were highlighted which related to a period when the company dealt with an unexpected volume of work which exceeded the anticipated monthly contract volume. 'During this time, A4e’s focus was for staff and service partners to ensure customers swiftly found effective work placements. However, in the same period, our administrative processes fell short of our own standards and those required by DWP, and to this end we have accepted that the MWA contract will be terminated.'","Department for Work and Pensions finds no evidence of fraud .

A sadistic loner who went on the rampage after his benefits were cut, battering two men to death with a ‘caveman’s club’ and attacking five others, was jailed for 35 years yesterday. Ali Koc, 30, spent a month stalking parks and woodland in North London pouncing on joggers and dog walkers. He beat them with lumps of wood, head-butted, punched and kicked them after selecting them entirely at random. Sadistic: Ali Koc, left, has been jailed for life for battering Victor Parsons and another pensioner to death using lumps of wood. Koc also attacked five others during a month of random violence . The cannabis addict, who spent his days watching violent films and smoking drugs, embarked on his terrifying campaign after becoming enraged that his Jobseeker’s Allowance had been stopped due to an administrative error. Days later he donned a pair of gloves emblazoned with a skull and crossbones logo and left his home in Hornsey, North London, to go on the prowl for victims. His first, Victor Parsons, 67, died seven weeks after being battered by Koc with a branch shaped like a ‘caveman’s club’ in Alexandra Park. Weeks later, Keith Needell, 84, was savagely beaten with a piece of wood in daylight. The retired quantity surveyor never recovered consciousness and died six months later. Koc also attacked five other strangers aged 29 to 85, including a solicitor and a scientist. Police fear the jobless Turkish immigrant, who lived on benefits and petty crime after his family came to Britain in 1990, may have attacked scores of others during his 26-day rampage in January last year.

Yesterday a judge at Woolwich Crown Court ordered him to serve at least 35 years after heart-rending testimony from his victims’ relatives.

A weak individual that can offer nothing positive to anyone, not even himself.’ Mr Justice Calvert-Smith told Koc the unprovoked attacks illustrated the ‘diverse nature of London’s population and the best and worst of its citizens’.

Members of his family, who claimed he had become mentally unstable after becoming hooked on cannabis, howled in anguish as he was taken from the court. The court heard Koc’s benefits were stopped in December 2010 and he was unable to draw out cash on January 5 last year. He fatally attacked his first victim, Mr Parsons, hours later. He was caught only after he made an abusive 999 phone call to complain about the Department of Work and Pensions and officers investigated other racially abusive calls he had made to the department. One was 30 minutes before he fatally attacked Mr Needell. His criminal record included 18 convictions for assault, burglary, possession of cannabis and possession of a knife. This week he was convicted of two murders and five counts of grievous bodily harm after a month-long trial. Detective Chief Inspector Tim Duffield of the Metropolitan Police said: ‘This was simply violence for violence’s sake.

Authorities have tracked the cell phone of a man accused of stabbing his new wife to death in Illinois last weekend to the Texas-Mexico border, according to an FBI warrant. Arnoldo Jimenez, 30, has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of 26-year-old Estrella Carrera, who was found dead in her bathtub in Burbank last Sunday, just 48 hours after they got married, still wearing her silver sequined party dress. The warrant states that Jimenez used his cell phone on May 12, a day after his wedding, in the Chicago area. He continued using it through southern Illinois, near Memphis, Tennessee, through Arkansas and then into Texas. Tragic: A surveillance image shows Estrella Carrera wearing the silver sequined dress that she was later found in after being stabbed in a bathtub . The phone was tracked to Houston on Sunday, with the last location tracked to Hidalgo, Texas, at 10:45 pm on Sunday, according to the FBI warrant cited by the Chicago Tribune. Hidalgo is located nearly 1,500 miles from the Burbank residence where his wife was found stabbed to death. The warrant also confirms information that Carrera’s family revealed about an emotional call Jimenez made to his sister, allegedly telling her that he had left his wife bleeding after a ‘bad fight.’ Another ‘close associate of Jimenez’ told authorities that Jimenez told him ‘he was leaving the state of Illinois, and if questioned by law enforcement, the associate should tell law enforcement he went to Mexico.’ Jimenez is a Texas native who owns property there in the city of Pharr, according to the warrant. His parents currently live in Mexico, and he also has relatives residing in North Carolina. More than 30 law enforcement agencies had joined federal agents in the search for Jimenez, following up on some 300 tips they have received so far in regards to the case. Newlyweds: Police have launched a manhunt for Arnoldo Jimenez (left) who has been charged with stabbing to death his wife, Estrella Carrera (right), just two days after their wedding . Authorities began looking for Jimenez soon after Carrera's family reported that she failed to pick up her two children, ages two and ten, Saturday as she had arranged. The family had been unable to reach Carrera or Jimenez, so they asked police to check on her at her apartment in the suburb of Burbank. That is when the 26-year-old’s body was found in the bathtub, still clothed in the party dress she also may have worn at her wedding ceremony at Chicago's City Hall. There were no signs of forced entry into Carrera’s apartment, according to investigators. That day, the bride's family received a haunting phone call from a sister of her new husband, who told them he had called her weeping and said that he had left his bride bleeding after a ‘bad fight.’ Slain: Estrella Carrera's family became concerned when the mother of two failed to pick up her children on Sunday . Most of Carrera's family disapproved of her three–year relationship with Jimenez, even though he was the father of her two-year-old son. Jimenez had hit and bruised Carrera in the past, according to Carrera’s older sister, Jazmin. Police also said family members reported incidents of violence while the couple was dating. Jazmin Carrera described Jimenez as ‘very possessive’ and jealous. She said she does not understand why her sister married the 30-year-old in what seemed like a rushed ceremony that the bride had kept secret from almost everyone. Jazmin Carrera received a text message from her sister Friday, inviting her to join them and their friends at a Mexican restaurant and a nightclub to celebrate the nuptials. She chose not to attend. Crime scene: Police who arrived at Carrera's apartment to check up on her discovered her dead in the tub, still wearing her party dress . Timeline: Police believe Carrera was killed shortly after she and Jimenez returned to her apartment in Burbank on Saturday . ‘It was just all of a sudden,’ Jazmin Carrera said. ‘She didn't give us enough notice.’ The pair were last seen around 4am on Saturday morning, according to officials. On Sunday, relatives heard about the phone call from Jimenez's sister, who said that when she tried to call her brother back, he would not pick up, according to Jazmin Carrera. Getaway car: Jimenez was last known to be driving a black 2006 Maserati with Illinois license plate L641441 . According to officials, Jimenez was previously arrested for domestic violence in another city in a case that did not involve Carrera. Police do not know what Jimenez does for a living, although he was last known to be driving a black 2006 Maserati with Illinois license plate L641441. Authorities made a plea to Jimenez to turn himself in ‘for the sake of his family and especially his children,’ Ford said. Investigators do not believe Jimenez is a danger to others, although they say they have no way of knowing his current state of mind.","Estrella Carrera, 26, married on Friday night and was last seen 2am on Saturday morning .

Photographers used balloons and kites to raise cameras before aircrafts were invented. ‘The camera has to be light so it does not get blown about too much. I can walk left and right, but I cannot completely control the camera position from the ground. ‘I need a lot of open space to take the images - that is why windmills are some of my favourite buildings to capture. ‘I have revisited my childhood love of kites. There was a huge craze for kites in the 1970s. ‘Maybe it is something of a middle aged man thing. ‘I started four years ago and have been inspired by other kite photographers. I decided this year that I wanted to get these pictures seen.’ Bill will go on show at All Saints Church, Cambridge, for a week from Saturday.

The wake cold-blooded murder of two Louisiana sheriff's deputies have put a spotlight on a dangerous anti-government movement that has been operating for decades, and flourishing thanks to the internet. Seven people - who appear to be members . of the same family - are suspects in the deadly rampage last week.

The group has been under surveillance for . allegedly making threats to judges and law enforcement officers, using . fake currency and impersonating police and the movement is listed on the FBI's domestic terror watchlist. Tracking sovereign citizens has not been an easy task for federal authorities, as it's hard to say how many members there actually are. Estimates show that hundreds of thousands of Americans follow the group's ideals, and individuals follow their own set of laws. Well-known sovereign citizens include Terry Nichols, who helped plan the Oklahoma City bombing, the agency said in a 2011 brief. The FBI reports that sovereign citizens have armed themselves with illegal weapons in the past, and have resorted to violence when confronted by authority figures. The agency said: 'Although the sovereign-citizen movement does not always rise to violence, its members’… activities…make it a group that should be approached with knowledge and caution.' In a 2010 report, the Southern Poverty Law Center wrote that the group is 'hundreds of thousands of far-right extremists who believe that they - not judges, juries, law enforcement or elected officials - get to decide which laws to obey and which to ignore, and who don't think they should have to pay taxes.'

The German Shepherd's limbs had been ravaged by arthritis and he looked certain to be put down - until a kindhearted charity worker insisted vets could rebuild him. They had the technology and, thanks to the charity's generosity, they had the £12,000 funds. Now, his joints painstakingly reconstructed, all Sam needs is a home. Close shave: Sam shows off his scars and bandages after costly surgery that may well have saved him from being put to sleep . Nicknamed the 'Robo Hobo', Sam was last year diagnosed with multiple orthopaedic problems, including arthritis in both elbow joints. Alison Mills, who runs the Southern Counties German Shepherd Rescue, in Linwood, Hampshire, decided to step in and pay for his operations - shelling out £5,500 for each elbow to be replaced. Now the re-built pooch is looking for a new family after recovering from the surgery. Mrs Mills said: 'A big thank you to everyone who has raised funds for us to make this possible - we really hope that Sam can now go on to live a long and pain-free life. K-9: The homeless German Shepherd's mechanical joints have earned him the nickname 'Robo Hobo' Better, stronger, faster: Sam looks as good as new and is ready to be rehomed . 'Everyone who meets Sam comments on what . a beautiful dog he is, with a calm, tolerant nature, always happy to . see you and play ball. 'Sam is amazing - despite all the pain he must have been in when he first came to the rescue, he still wanted to play ball. 'He did it by throwing the ball to you, so you could throw it back for him.' Sam was found as a stray and came to the charity from the council pound having served his statutory seven days. If the charity had not taken him in he could have been put to sleep. Bionic: Lee Majors stars in The Six Million Dollar Man . He underwent two operations to replace his elbows, one in October last year, and another just under four weeks ago in April. The process has been so costly Mrs Mills claims it is like the 1970s TV series Six Million Dollar Man, starring Lee Majors as the astronaut whose body is rebuilt with state-of-the-art bionic implants after he barely survives a plane crash. Mrs Mills added: 'We are a relatively new rescue run solely by volunteers, who raise funds and give their valuable time. 'Our belief is that once we have taken a dog in, we are committed to providing all the necessary care and treatment a dog needs, only considering euthanasia on medical grounds once every other opportunity has been exhausted.'","Sickly stray Sam was set to be put down at pound .

"By . Julian Gavaghan and Sara Malm . PUBLISHED: . 03:34 EST, 30 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:52 EST, 30 May 2012 . Facing extradition: Julian Assange is now a step closer to being forced out of Britain after the Supreme Court decision to uphold previous rulings . WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange today lost his Supreme Court fight against extradition to Sweden to face sex crime allegations. Lawyers for Assange asked Britain's highest court to block his removal, arguing that the European arrest warrant issued against him was 'invalid and unenforceable'. The Supreme Court judges, who heard the case in February, today announced that they have rejected his challenge. The court dismissed his appeal by a majority of five to two. Assange, who was not present for the hearing because his lawyers said he was stuck in traffic, was given 14 days to consider today's ruling before a final decision on his next step in his legal battle. His team indicated they would reopen the case at the Supreme Court. Today Lord Phillips, president of the court, said the point of law which had to be considered had not been simple to resolve. The Swedish authorities want Assange, 40, to answer accusations of raping one woman and sexually molesting and coercing another in Stockholm in August 2010 while on a visit to give a lecture. Assange, whose WikiLeaks website has published a mass of leaked diplomatic cables that embarrassed several governments and international businesses, says the sex was consensual and the allegations against him are politically motivated. In November 2011, the High Court upheld a ruling by District Judge Howard Riddle - who sat at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court, south London, in February 2011 - that the Australian computer expert should be extradited to face investigation. Scroll down for video . Protest: Defence lawyer Gareth Peirce (third from left) makes a statement to the press outside the Supreme Court in London. The only celebrity to show up was journalist John Pilger, standing behind her . The High Court declared that it would not be unfair or unlawful to extradite Assange. The case has become a cause celebre and . has hearings have previously been attended by celebrities such as Jemima . Khan, film director Ken Loach and former Labour minister Tony Benn. Assange burst into the public consciousness in April 2010 when WikiLeaks released Collateral Murder - video footage of a U.S. air crew shooting Iraqi civilians in 2007. The whistleblower website, which claimed a database of 1.2 million documents within a year of its 2006 launch, regularly hit the headlines in 2010 with a series of leaks. The U.S. Embassy cables, Afghanistan war logs and Iraq war logs, which were drip-fed to the media in 2010, helped raise the profile of Assange. Last year revealed that the site is at risk of closure and is suspending its publishing operations to concentrate on fighting a financial blockade and raising new funds. The stricken website is running on cash reserves after an 'arbitrary and unlawful financial blockade' was imposed by Bank of America, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Western union last December, said Assange. But as the fortunes of WikiLeaks have waned - including criticism by newspapers such as the Guardian who were given initial access to the diplomatic cables - fewer high-profile people are willing to back Assange. The only well-known face to show up today was left-wing journalist John Pilger. During the appeal hearing in February, Assange's QC Dina Rose argued before Lord Phillips, Lord Walker, Lady Hale, Lord Brown, Lord Mance, Lord Kerr and Lord Dyson that the Swedish public prosecutor who signed the arrest warrant could not issue a valid document because she lacked impartiality and independence. Ms Rose QC said his latest appeal . raised the single issue of law as to whether the Swedish public . prosecutor constituted a ‘judicial authority’ capable of issuing a valid . warrant under the provisions of the 2003 Extradition Act. It was common ground that if she did not, there was no legal basis for extradition. Ms . Rose suggested it was obvious that a public prosecutor whose function . it was to investigate and prosecute an individual ‘cannot exercise . judicial authority in relation to that individual’. As . a matter of fundamental legal principle dating back hundreds of years, a . judicial authority had to be impartial and independent both of the . executive and the parties in a case. Clare . Montgomery QC, for the Swedish Prosecution Authority, argued that the . High Court was plainly correct to accept that the term ‘judicial . authority’ had a wide and autonomous meaning, and it was not restricted . in the way described by Ms Rose. Since . the start of the European arrest warrant (EAW) scheme, it had been the . practice of a number of prominent member states to issue EAWs through . public prosecutors. Backing: Supporters of Assange hold a vigil for him in Brisbane, Australia, today while the Supreme Court in London announced its verdict . Protest: Miles Legoullon, six, participates in a vigil for Assange in Brisbane, Australia today . Ms Montgomery argued: ‘There is no conceivable breach of fundamental rights involved in such a process.’ In the majority ruling today, in which Lady Hale and Lord Mance dissented, the court held that an EAW issued by a public prosecutor is a valid warrant issued by a judicial authority within the meaning of the 2003 Act. Afterwards, Ms Rose said an application would be made to reopen the case at the Supreme Court on the basis that the court's majority decision was made on legal points not argued during the appeal. The representative for the two women, lawyer Claes Borgström, told Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet that the outcome was expected, but ‘strongly criticised’ the Surpreme Court for the amount of time the extradition order has taken. Absent: Jemima Khan and film director Ken Loach, who both began showing up to one of Assange's court hearings in December 2012 and each offered £20,000 to assure his bail, were not present at court today . Wanted: Details of Interpol's arrest warrant are provided on its website. He is wanted by police in Sweden . ‘I find it hard to understand why it has taken so long, they’ve had it on their desks since autumn 2010. It has of course gone through all the correct departments, but it has still taken a long time.’ ‘I strongly criticise it, it has had a completely unnecessary impact on my clients.’He said that he has not been able to speak to his clients yet but that he expects them to be relieved. ‘Even though a trial is a very strenuous procedure it has always been their wish that he should be forced to take responsibility for his actions. Anything else would be disgraceful.’","Britain's highest court rules Swedish prosecutors DID have right to issue arrest warrant despite his lawyers' complaint that it was 'invalid'

A retired police officer who . investigated the scene of a baby snatched by a dingo has said he still . has doubts about the case, despite the child's mother being acquitted of . murder and a coroner's ruling in her favour. Frank Morris went . to Uluru the night nine-week-old Azaria Chamberlain disappeared but he . says there must have been some human intervention. Speaking . about the result of the fourth inquest he said: 'If you go to . court enough times, you are bound to get a win sooner or later.' Scroll down for video . Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton said there was nothing she or her then husband, Michael could have done to change people's minds . Azaria went missing from an Outback . campsite near Ayers Rock 32 years ago and the case divided Australia . with half the country believing Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton's account that a dingo or wild dog . took the baby from their tent and the other half saying her parents killed her. There were emotional scenes yesterday . when the verdict was delivered. Azaria’s mother Lindy, now 64, tearfully . embraced her former husband Michael and other family members in the . courtroom. Today she gave a rare interview today in the . northern city of Darwin where Elizabeth Morris, the Northern Territory coroner, ruled in her favour saying she was 'satisfied that the evidence is sufficiently adequate, clear, cogent . and exact and that the evidence excludes all other reasonable . possibilities' than that the baby was taken by one or more dingoes. Lindy Chamberlain and baby Azaria pictured shortly before her disappearance in 1980 . She . said she is writing a book about forgiveness and welcomed approaches . from people who doubted her including one of the jurors who convicted . her of murder. Mrs . Chamberlain-Creighton told Australian Broadcasting Corp: 'I think they . have a huge amount of courage to admit that they were wrong. 'There are still people saying ""I don't care what the evidence was. I've made up my mind and I don't want to listen to sense"".' Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton was convicted in 1982 when it was believed she slit Azaria's throat with a pair of nail scissors. She . was given a life sentence for murder but served just three years in a . Darwin prison before being exonerated and the case was depicted in the . 1988 film A Cry in the Dark. In the 32 years since she cried out . in the night ‘A dingo’s got my baby!’, there have been four inquests and . a government inquiry into nine-week-old Azaria’s death. One . piece of evidence that continues to fuel doubt is the fact that her . baby-grow was found in relatively good condition near a dingo lair in . 1986. The coroner said would have been 'very difficult' for the animal to have removed it, but added that it was possible. Many Australians had doubts about Mrs . Chamberlain-Creighton and her then husband, Michael, when they saw . their cool demeanour on TV shortly after the tragedy. Speaking about that she said there was nothing they could have done to change people's minds. 'It . wouldn't have mattered what we did. If we didn't react exactly the same . as the individual watching us reacted, that individual thought we were . being weird. Beauty spot: Azaria was snatched from her tent at a campsite near Ayers Rock. Her clothing was later found beside a dingo's lair . Trial: Lindy and Michael Chamberlain leave a courthouse in Alice Springs, Australia in February 1982. She was originally jailed for murdering baby Azaria while he was given a suspended sentence . 'So if you smile, that's dreadful; you . should be crying. And if you don't smile you're hard-hearted. And if . you cry all the time, you're a drama queen,' she added. She said Meryl Streep was surprised . that her sense of humour did not match her public persona when the pair . met before the actress played Chamberlain-Creighton in 'A Cry in the . Dark.' Streep said: 'I thought I had it all . down pat, your role, but you've just blown me out of the water in 10 . minutes,' Chamberlain-Creighton told Nine Network. Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton was released in 1986 after . Englishman David Brett fell to his death while climbing Ayers Rock – . known today by its Aboriginal name of Uluru – and landed beside a . matinee jacket that was vital to her defence. She had told police that no dingo saliva had been found on Azaria’s jumpsuit . because the baby was wearing a matinee jacket over the jumpsuit, but no . jacket was found at the time the child disappeared. Ordeal: Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton served six years for her murder before being acquitted in 1988. She had always claimed that a dingo killed their child. A third inquest in 1995 could not . determine the cause of death. Mr Chamberlain, who was convicted of being . an accessory after the fact of murder but later exonerated, then fought . a long legal battle for a fourth inquest. That inquest heard new evidence of dingo attacks, including three fatal attacks on children since the third inquest. Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton, who has two . sons and a daughter who was born shortly after she started her prison . term, has been spat at and abused by members of the public over the . years. Outside court, she said she was . ‘relieved and delighted to come to the end of this saga’ and that the . verdict was ‘such a vindication’ for her and her former husband. She wept when asked what she thought . her Azaria might be like if she had lived – the day before would have . been her 32nd birthday. VIDEO: Emotional.

The number of Britons working after they start collecting their pensions has doubled in nearly 20 years because growing numbers simply cannot afford to retire. A new study has found that 1.4 million pensioners, 12 per cent of the total elderly population, are earning extra money compared to 753,000 in 1993. And it is women who need to earn for longer, with 61 per cent of all these older workers found to be female. The Office for National Statistics say in total more than a third of the 1.4 million are . forced to work full time, as the cost of housing and bills like gas and . electricity go through the roof. Hard up: The number of working pensioners has doubled in 20 years and 61 per cent of them are women . They also say the pensioner population has not grown enough since 1993 to explain the rise. It also appears more older people in London and the South East work than elsewhere, with around 14 per cent in those areas having to get paid employment to support their pensions. In the north east of England and Northern Ireland fewer have to work, around 8 per cent, the figures show. 'The number of people working beyond state pension age has almost doubled,' the ONS said today, adding: 'The number of these workers has risen at a faster rate than the population. 'There may be many factors influencing the decision for more people to work past retirement such as financial pressures, people living longer and wanting to remain active in society and others. 'Those remaining in the labour market work . fewer hours, possibly helped by the financial support of their state . pension and other pension arrangements, which allows them to fit their . work around other engagements,' the ONS said. The research found 32% of the working pensioners were self-employed, double the amount of under-60s. While two out of three employed directly had been working for a business for ten years or more and just carried on after their retirement was due. Around two-thirds of the men worked in jobs classed as higher skilled, . such as property managers, marketing and sales directors, production . managers and chief executives, but almost two-thirds of women . worked in lower skilled jobs.

Three criminals who were caught with £2million worth of party drug meow meow have been jailed for a total of 12 years. Kenneth Warwick, 37, Nicholas Bailey, 27, and Allen Valentine, 51, claimed to be couriers with limited knowledge of the wider operation, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Police connected them with two consignments of the drug, stashed in cardboard boxes and in a duffle bag. Convicted: From left, Allen Valentine, Nicholas Bailey and Kenneth Warwick all claimed to be couriers with little knowledge of the scam . Meow meow, a once-legal high banned in April 2010, was blamed by one user Jordan Ryan after stabbing his parents. All three were involved in a delivery of more than 50 kilos of the drug, worth £1.5m, while Warwick and Valentine were also involved in handling a second consignment of 22.75kg worth up to £680,000. The batch was discovered by police in a car along with another two boxes of the drug, weighing 26.87kg, worth up to £810,000. All three defendants have previous convictions, with Valentine jailed for . five years for conspiracy to supply £1.2m worth of fake Viagra. Warwick was also jailed for six years in 2002 for possession of cocaine . with intent and seven years in 2007 for conspiracy to supply drugs. Jailing Warwick for five years and four months, and Valentine and Bailey each for three years and four months, Judge Neil Sanders said: ‘On any view of this it was very substantial quantity. ‘I’m of the view that Mr Valentine and Mr Bailey’s part was a lesser role. Complex plot: Huge quantities of meow meow was stored in cardboard boxes and transferred between cars . He told Warwick: ‘Your previous convictions are highly material and you committed them while on licence.’ Judge Sanders also ordered the drugs to be forfeited and destroyed. Confiscation proceedings will be held at a later date. Prosecutor Philip Stott said there were two consignments, one involving all three defendants on October 7, 2011, and another on November 24 concerning Warwick and Valentine. Of the first delivery, he said: ‘Covert surveillance observed a meet in the Caledonian Road area of Islington. ‘Mr Bailey was in a car driven by Michael Harry, and Mr Warwick was in a van driven by Mr Valentine.’ Boxes of the drug were transferred from the van to the car before they all left the scene, he said. About 20 minutes later the car, still being driven by Harry, 26, was spotted in Harrow, north-west London. ‘Four cardboard boxes containing packets of white powder were found in the rear seat,’ Mr Stott said. Caught: Boxes of the drug, which can cause dangerous hallucinations, were seized by police . ‘Mr Harry immediately told police it was ‘meow meow’ in the boxes. ‘It contained 50.48kg of white powder, with a wholesale value of £150-£200,000, and a street value of £1m - £1.5m.’ Courier: Michael Harry, 26, was jailed for three years and four months after he was caught driving the car in north-west London . Covert CCTV later observed Valentine arriving at Warwick’s address in Clerkenwell, central London, last November 24. They exchanged a duffle bag containing 22.75kg of meow meow, with a street value of between £450,000 and £680,000. Two hours later, Warwick gave the duffle bag to Enver Ibrahim, whose BMW was stopped at junction 17 of the M5 by offers from Somerset and Avon Police. As well as the duffle bag, they also found two cardboard boxes containing 26.87kg of meow meow, worth up to £680,000, Mr Stott said. Ibrahim, 42, told police he believed the white powder was ketamine and had been paid £300 to collect it. Ibrahim, of north London, and Harry, of Bristol, both admitted acting as drug couriers in the conspiracy. Ibrahim, was jailed for 42 months while Harry was handed three years and four months in separate hearings. Stephen Vullo, defending Warwick, said he got involved in the scheme to pay off a drug debt. ‘He was told to run errands to pay off or at least put off the balance. ‘He was told he was to go and pick up drugs to then store them at his house. ‘The plan was changed, he doesn’t know why, and the drugs were transferred from one place to another.’ Chris Sutton-Mattocks, for Bailey, who spent three years as a soldier for the Royal Anglian Regiment, said his involvement was limited in time and action to one instance and was offered no cash payment. Laurie-Anne Power, defending Valentine, a trained mechanical engineer, added: ‘He describes this as a monumental error of judgement. 'He was a courier and had little knowledge of the wider scale of the operation.’ Valentine, of north-west London; Bailey, of Romford, Essex, and Warwick admitted a single count of conspiracy to supply a class B drug, namely methylmethcathinone, also known as meow meow. An earlier version of this article stated that a user from Durham attempted to rip off his scrotum whilst on the drug.  We are happy to clarify that this is not the case and it was a hoax.","All three defendants have previous convictions .

A school pupil who dyed her hair red has been banned from lessons for a week until the colour ‘settles down’. Teachers took action against Kirsty Crooke's 'extreme' hair colour after she arrived at Buttershaw Business & Enterprise College in West Yorkshire with deep crimson roots. The 14-year-old GCSE student’s furious mother Natalie Bussey, insists the school has overreacted by banishing her daughter to a 'green room' away from other pupils while the colour loses its impact. Too bright: Kirsty Crooke, 14, has been banned from the classroom by teachers until the colour of her dyed red hair 'settled down' Miss Bussey, 36, from nearby Wisbey, claims her daughter’s hair had been dyed for more than a year and it was only when she turned up with the roots re-dyed that staff told her it was too bright. She said: ‘Children should be allowed to express themselves, it’s not a bad colour. ‘I’d . understand if it was blue. I don’t understand why they’ve pulled her . out of a week’s worth of lessons for having her roots done. She should . have been in lessons. I’m livid.’ She added: 'She was depressed because her hair looked greasy when it was brown. Dress code: Kirsty Crook's red hair fell foul of strict rules on uniform at Buttershaw Business & Enterprise College in Bradford . ‘Now she has to be taught in the room where the unruly pupils go and is worried about how she will catch up when she gets back to normal lessons. ‘The school says they have to have natural coloured hair but most of the pupils have died hair and some of the teachers have bright purple hair. ‘The staff should be more worried about teaching children than what colour their hair is.’ Kirsty, who has just started studying for her GCSEs, said: ‘It is a crucial time for me and I am very frustrated. ‘I just want to be back in class but I don't see why I have to change my hair because of school. ‘I dyed it red because it is the only colour which suits my natural one which is dark brown.’ Miss Bussey said her daughter had been told she would have to remain in the green room for a week until her hair colour ‘settled down’. A statement released by the school on behalf of head teacher Richard Hughes after being contacted by Mail Online said: 'We have established very high standards of uniform at BBEC. 'We extend out high standards in uniform to general appearance and take time to reinforce this with our students. 'Our expectations are communicated in the prospectus, in letters to parents and, if required, in our weekly newsletter.  We also welcome discussions with parents about this if the need arises.' According to a notice on the school’s website, staff ‘challenge extreme hair styles and colour – we expect a natural hair colour and smart appearance for school. It adds: ‘The school uniform standards are high. We are responsible for students on their journey to and from school so we also check that our uniform is worn correctly on leaving the school site – we insist on blazers, ties and black shoes being worn and shirts tucked in to support our high standards within the community.’ Uniform consists of a blazer, school tie, plain collared white shirt, black trousers and black shoes. The school has taken similar action against pupils thought to be in breach of the rules.

Free: The corruption case against John Edwards was dropped on Wednesday after a mistrial was declared in the case last month . The remaining charges against former senator John Edwards have been dropped, the U.S. Justice Department said today. A jury in North Carolina acquitted the former presidential candidate last month on one count of accepting illegal campaign contributions. It deadlocked on five other felony counts, resulting in a mistrial on those charges. Edwards was accused of masterminding a . scheme to use $1million in secret payments from two wealthy . political donors to hide mistress Rielle Hunter and their lovechild as . he sought the White House in 2008. A statement issued today said federal prosecutors will not seek to retry Edwards on the five unresolved counts following his trial in Greensboro, North Carolina. Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer, who oversees the Justice Department's criminal division, said . prosecutors knew the case, like all those involving campaign finances, . would be challenging. But he said it is 'our duty to bring hard cases' when warranted. Mr . Breuer said: 'Last month, the government put forward its best case . against Mr. Edwards, and I am proud of the skilled and professional way . in which our prosecutors... conducted this trial.' The Justice Department had spent millions of dollars of taxpayers' money on the prosecution of the former U.S Senator. It was announced yesterday that Edwards' former lover Ms Hunter is set to give a tell-all interview on June 22. She will open up about her affair with the former North Carolina Senator and his . relationship with the couple's four-year-old daughter Quinn. Revelations: John Edwards' former mistress Rielle Hunter is set to speak publicly for the first time on June 22 about their relationship . Rielle . Hunter was not called to give evidence at the corruption trial and she . has not spoken about her affair with Edwards until now. Edwards' lawyers - Abbe Lowell, Allison Van Laningham and Alan W Duncan - said . in a statement that they are pleased with the Government's decision not . to seek a second trial that they believe would have had the same . outcome. It read: 'While . John has repeatedly admitted to his sins, he has also consistently . asserted, as we demonstrated at the trial, that he did not violate any . campaign law nor even imagined that any campaign laws could apply. 'We are very glad that, after living . under this cloud for over three years, John and his family can have . their lives back and enjoy the peace they deserve.' Anticipation: Rielle Hunter, pictured with her and John Edwards' daughter Quinn in January, has written a book about their affair . John Edwards emerged from the court . house on May 31 after the six-week trial saying that he was grateful to all of his children - . including his 'precious Quinn' - the child from his affair with Ms . Hunter. The disgraced senator was . sensationally found not guilty verdict for count three - the charge that . Edwards accepted and received illegal campaign contributions from . Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon. The trial exposed a sordid sex . scandal that unfolded while Edwards' wife Elizabeth was dying of cancer . but prosecutors couldn't convince jurors that he had masterminded a $1 million cover-up of . his affair. Elizabeth Edwards died of cancer in December 2010. John Edwards could have served up to 30 years in prison and $1.5 million in fines if convicted of all charges. Edwards' woes began when he met Ms . Hunter, now 48, when she came to work as a videographer for his 2004 . presidential campaign. The pair started a romantic relationship while . they were on the road. Dressed in a short, printed dress . with . bare legs and wedge heels, she was pictured for the first time since . Edwards' trial last night being interviewed by Chris Cuomo for . ABC's 20/20. The show will air next . Friday, June 22. Ms . Hunter's own personal narrative is as fascinating as the ensuing . campaign scandal. She was a muse for Manhattan’s 90s literary scene and . author of Bright Lights, Big City Jay McInerney based a ‘cocaine-addled, . sexually voracious’ character on Hunter. No return to court: John Edwards speaks outside the courthouse in North Carolina after his trial on May 31 flanked by his daughter Cate Edwards and his parents Wallace and Bobbie . By the time she met Edwards in a New York hotel bar in 2006, she was a convert of new age philosophies and mysticism. She walked up to him, said, 'You’re so hot', and ended the conversation by passing him her business card which read: 'Rielle Hunter: Being is free'. After the pair began their romantic liaison, she fell pregnant and agreed with the plan to have Edwards’ long-time aide Andrew Young claim paternity in an effort to keep Edwards’ political prospects alive. Until now, no one has heard her full version of events as she did not testify during Edwards' trial. The slew of interviews next week are to accompany Ms Hunter's book What Really Happened: John .

Criminals who blight the Olympics will face swift justice under plans to get them in the dock within hours. Prosecutors want to repeat the success of the judicial blitz that followed the August riots last year. Yobs, thieves and fraudsters will find themselves in court within 24 hours as courts extend their hours. Virtual ‘live link’ hearings, in which suspects can appear via a camera in police stations, will fast-track people through the system. No-nonsense: Criminals who commit offences at the London Olympics will find themselves in court within 24 hours under tough new guidelines . The special measures will apply to those accused of ‘Olympics offences’, defined by who they and the victim are and when and where they occur. They will also apply to foreign nationals and could see those convicted handed exclusion orders banning them from Games venues. The unprecedented contingency plans have been drawn up by the Crown Prosecution Service and will cover London, the Thames Valley and Weymouth in Dorset. They will delight ministers who desperately want to speed up the everyday course of justice. But it remains to be seen whether they will be necessary, as some previous major sporting events have led to a drop in crime. Alison Saunders, London’s chief Crown prosecutor, said lawyers will be on call 24 hours a day to assist police. Precedent: Prosecutors want to mirror the swift justice which followed the riots nationwide last summer . She added: ‘Many people who come to the Olympics won’t live here, so it is important that if offences are committed, we act quickly. ‘People who commit offences on Tuesday will be in court on Wednesday ... we are learning the lessons of the summer riots.’ The riots piled pressure on the courts, forcing them to open around the clock to cope with a flood of defendants. Politicians and police were delighted as some cases were completed within hours and heavy sentences handed down, discouraging further crimes. Courts are prepared to open from 8am to 7.30pm, effectively doubling their normal hours. Some courts will also sit on Saturdays, something that already takes place in many areas to deal with Friday night crimes. Virtual courts, in which video conferencing technology is employed, will also cut the number of prison van journeys around the congested capital. Prosecutors expect crimes to include ticket touting, low-level street disorder, pick-pocketing and muggings. Mrs Saunders said it was impossible to predict whether crime rates will rise or fall during the Olympics. Tough stance: Alison Saunders, London's chief Crown prosecutor, said courts will 'act quickly' during the Games . She added: ‘There is no direct comparison. At the Manchester Commonwealth Games, offending levels actually fell, perhaps because people were preoccupied and also because there was a feel-good factor. Offenders who commit crimes during the Olympics may face tough penalties as magistrates take a dim view of the damage to Britain’s reputation. Police fear protest groups may seek to hijack events to broadcast their views to the billions watching on TV worldwide. Organised crime gangs are already reported to be transporting coach loads of Eastern European migrants to work as pickpockets, beggars or prostitutes. Of 138 courts across 11 Crown Court complexes, just over half will be sitting during the 17 days of the Olympic Games. Many will close because of problems of traffic and access and some have listed fewer cases because of the disruption.","Olympic offenders will be in court within 24 hours, prosecutors say .

Rapid decline: Trainee hairdresser Laura Garner (pictured) died in hospital after medical staff twice failed to give her antibiotics ordered by her doctor . A teenager died in hospital after medical staff twice failed to give her antibiotics ordered by her doctor in the 24 hours before her death, an inquest heard yesterday. Laura Garner, 18, died from an acute infection after being admitted to Bradford Royal Infirmary the previous night suffering from abdominal pain. A senior duty doctor recommended the trainee hairdresser be given an antibiotic when she was first admitted. Surgeon Abid Hassan Mohammed Salih returned for his night shift the next day and prescribed another antibiotic when he discovered tests for appendicitis were negative. This second antibiotic drug was to treat a possible urinary infection. But the court heard no-one wrote a prescription for the antibiotic on the first night, despite it being detailed in the medical notes, and although the alternative medication was prescribed on the second night, it was never administered. Mr Salih said: ‘It was normal procedure at the time that one of my junior doctors would deal with the prescribing.’ He admitted: ‘If this had happened today it would have been very different. 'We have different practices now. The doctor who prescribes the medication would also write it up. But that was the way the system operated at that time.’ The surgeon said Laura had showed signs of improvement. He said she seemed ‘fine’ and was ‘smiling’ before being transferred from the acute ward to a recovery ward. They had a conversation and she walked unaided to her bed, he said. 'Very unusual case': Miss Garner, 18, suddenly died just over 24 hours after being admitted to Bradford Royal Infirmary in September 2009, the inquest heard . The inquest in Bradford heard how she suddenly died just over 24 hours after being admitted to the hospital in September 2009. Questions to answer: Miss Garner had an abnormally high heart rate and high temperature, but staff did not increase the frequency of their observations of her, the coroner was told . When she was moved to the new ward . shortly after midnight the crash team were called and 30 minutes of . resuscitation failed to bring her back to life. Her parents Steve and Anne Garner were called at 12.20am at home in Baildon, West Yorkshire, to say that their daughter had died. Breaking down when giving her evidence, Mrs Garner said: ‘I became really upset, I was screaming. 'I just didn’t believe them. How could she be dead? ‘She had died alone, she was by herself.’ A post mortem revealed she died of septicaemia and a bacterial infection of the kidney. John Griffith, a consultant surgeon who was looking after Laura during the day, said he had never seen a case like it. Mr Griffith said: ‘In 12 years of consulting I have never seen a case progress like Laura’s. 'It was very, very unusual and very tragic for everyone involved.’ The teenager had an abnormally high heart rate and high temperature while in hospital, but staff did not increase the frequency of their observations of her. When questioned by coroner Paul Marks, ward manager Angela Hurtault said she couldn’t explain why this was not done. Nine months after Laura’s tragic death her parents launched a legal action against the hospital trust. The hearing continues.","Laura Garner, 18, died from acute infection at Bradford Royal Infirmary .
