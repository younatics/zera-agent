"By . Jessica Jerreat . Accessing the Dark Web, where drugs and weapons can be purchased at the click of a button, just got easier with the launch of a search engine based on Google. Grams, which was launched last week, appears to have modeled itself closely on Google, from the brightly colored logo to the 'I Feel Lucky' search button. Unlike the mainstream search engine however, those wanting to use Grams have to access the Tor browser that provides an extra level of anonymity. Web search: Grams may look like Google but it helps users find drugs and guns . The site works by searching multiple illicit websites such as SilkRoad2, Pandora and The Pirate Market, which are known for providing access to stolen credit cards, fake IDs and drugs. Previously, accessing those sites would have meant knowing the exact URL to type in. 'I noticed on the forums and reddit . people were constantly asking ""where to get product X?"" and ""which . market had product X?"" or ""who had the best product X and was reliable . and not a scam?"",' the creator, who asked to remain anonymous, told Wired. 'I wanted . to make it easy for people to find things they wanted on the ""darknet"" and figure out who was a trustworthy vendor.' Going underground: Grams collects search results for illicit websites, similar to drug site Silk Road which was closed by the FBI last year . When a search request is entered into Grams, it returns a list of results showing the name of the seller, their location, and the price of the product. The site will also help users track down sites that have been closed by agencies such as the FBI, which closed Silk Road - where illegal drugs could allegedly be traded - last year. Other functions of Gram mirror Google, such as space to leave reviews, and the development of an advertising tool to allow sellers to pay for a more prominent listing.","Grams searches several underground sites to provide detailed results .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A person's wealth is a key indicator of the type of cancer they are likely to suffer from, scientists say. U.S. researchers have discovered that certain types of cancers are prevalent in different classes. They say more affluent people are likely to suffer from melanoma, thyroid and testicular cancers. Poorer people, on the other hand, are more likely to be diagnosed with cancers of the larynx, cervix, penis, and liver. Class divide: More affluent people are likely to suffer from skin cancer - including melanoma - thyroid and testicular cancers . And while these people are less likely to be diagnosed with cancer, they are more likely to die from the disease. Dr Francis Boscoe, of the New York State Cancer Registry, said: 'At first glance, the effects seem to cancel one another out. 'When it comes to cancer, the poor are more likely to die of the disease while the affluent are more likely to die with the disease.' The study, published online in the journal CANCER, looked at the richest and poorest neighbourhoods covering over two fifths of the U.S. population. Researchers assigned nearly three million tumours diagnosed between 2005 and 2009 into one of four groupings based on the poverty rate of the residential census at the time of diagnosis. Certain cancers - Kaposi sarcoma and cancers of the larynx, cervix, penis, and liver - were more likely in the poorest neighborhoods, while other cancers - melanoma, thyroid and testis - were more likely in the wealthiest neighborhoods. Dr Boscoe added: 'Our hope is that our paper will illustrate the value and necessity of doing this routinely in the future.' New research: The study found those who were worse off were more prone to suffering liver cancer, as well as forms of the disease affecting the larynx, penis and cervix . Previous research from UCSF found that well-off women are more likely to suffer from skin cancer.  In the United States, more than 90 per cent of the most deadly skin cancers – malignant melanomas – occur in the white population. The researchers found that young women are at highest risk for malignant melanoma if they live in neighbourhoods that are both more well-to-do and sunnier. Other research from The Christie Hospital in Manchester found that middle-class people are significantly more likely to develop breast and skin cancer than the less well off. The researchers suggested that career women delaying having children and exposing themselves more to the sun on foreign holidays are thought to be behind the gap. They added that social deprivation is linked to lung and cervical cancer, as less affluent people are more likely to smoke and miss smear tests.","Researchers at New York State Cancer Registry discovered certain types of cancers are more prevalent in different classes .

"By . James  Nye . and Ashley Collman . Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell held a press conference Tuesday night following a federal indictment on political corruption charges. Authorities announced today that McDonnell and his wife, former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell, illegally accepted luxury clothes, free vacations, large loans and private planes rides from wealthy Richmond businessman Jonnie R Williams . Flanked by his wife, daughter and son-in-law, McDonnell strongly denied the allegations in the press conference, saying he 'did nothing illegal' and will fight the more than 14 charges. He said that federal prosecutors were . 'stretching the law to breaking point' and that if he is convicted, every . politician 'from President Obama on down would have to be charged with . giving tangible benefits to donors'. Scroll down for video . Shooting back: Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell held a press conference Tuesday evening to deny charges of political corruption, supported by his wife Maureen (right) who is also charged, and their daughter and son-in-law . McDonnell did apologize for the 'poor judgement' he used in 'accepting legal gifts and loans'. He says he regrets taking the loans but everything he accepted from Williams has been returned or repaid with interest. 'I come to you as someone who has been falsely and wrongfully accused and whose public service has been wrongfully,'attacked McDonnell said. He stressed that Mr Williams was 'never promised and never received any government benefit of any kind from me or my administration'. Williams, he said, received 'not one penny' of taxpayer money, nor did Star Scientific Inc, the dietary supplement company Williams used to be chief executive of. Not the only one: McDonnell said that if he's convicted then so should every other politician, including President Obama . He said that prosecutors are operating under a 'misguided legal theory' that stipulates that facilitating an introduction, meetings, appearing at a reception or expressing support for a Virginia business 'is a serious federal crime'. But McDonnell said he has faith in the American justice system and believes the courts will rule in his favor. 'I believe the facts and the law are clearly on our sides.' He described the months-long investigation as 'agonizing' and the 'most difficult and unexpected ordeal of my life'. McDonnell ended the press conference by saying that serving as governor was  the 'highest professional honor of my life'. McDonnell and his wife Maureen are due in court Friday morning for a bond hearing. Indicted: Outgoing Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, wait in the old Senate Chambers prior to the inauguration of Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe at the Capitol in Richmond, on Saturday, Jan. 11, 2014 . Bob McDonnell has also been charged with . an additional count of making a false statement to a financial . institution, and Maureen McDonnell is charged with one count of . obstruction of an official proceeding. Acting Assistant Attorney General Raman said in a news release. 'Ensuring that elected officials uphold the public's trust is one of our most critical responsibilities.' One term: Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell gestures as he delivers his State of the Commonwealth address before a joint session of the 2014 General Assembly at the Capitol in Richmond, Virginia on Wednesday, January 8, 2014 . 'Today's charges represent the Justice . Department's continued commitment to rooting out public corruption at . all levels of government,' McDonnell left office earlier this month after four years in the governor's office. Virginia law limits governors to a single term. A federal investigation overshadowed the final months in office for the once-rising star of the Republican Party, with authorities looking into gifts he and his family received from a political donor. In July, McDonnell apologized and . said he had returned more than $120,000 in loans and other gifts from . Johnnie Williams, the CEO of pharmaceutical company Star Scientific. He . insisted that he had done nothing illegal on behalf of Star Scientific . but said he'd do 'things differently today than choices I made a couple . of years ago.' The scandal unfolded around the same . time as a separate politically embarrassing case involving a former . executive mansion chef who was accused of embezzlement and, in turn, . accused McDonnell's children of taking mansion food and supplies for . personal use. The governor later reimbursed the state. Rain: Outgoing Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell (back R) and his wife Maureen sit behind Huma Abedin, aide to Hillary Clinton and wife of former U.S. congressman Anthony Weiner at the start of the swearing-in ceremony of Terry McAuliffe as Virginia's governor . The fallout seeped into the general election, with McDonnell playing a low-key role in support of Republican Ken Cuccinelli, who lost to Democrat Terry McAuliffe. Asked why he hadn't been more visible, McDonnell replied, 'That's a question for the candidate.' McDonnell, 59, is the first governor ever to face criminal charges in Virginia. Gov McDonnell was accused of used the influence of his office to promote Star Scientific's anti-inflammatory supplement, Anatabloc, for Jonnie R. Williams Sr and his company. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen McDonnell, are pictured. McDonnell said in July that his daughter Cailin has returned the $15,000 check she received for her wedding from Jonnie Williams, a major McDonnell campaign donor . Virginia First Lady Maureen McDonnell, left, and her daughter Cailin McDonnell react to their tandem parachute jumps with members of the U.S. Army's Golden Knights at the Dinwiddie County Airport Friday, April 29, 2011 . Jeanine McDonnell, daughter of Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, received a $10,000 engagement check from Williams . They contributed more than $100,000 to McDonnell's political organizations and gave the governor's family personal gifts worth thousands of dollars. Some of the 'luxury items' were said to include cosmetic dentistry work for the mother-of-five, as well as jewelry and a $15,000 Bergdorf Goodman shopping spree for Maureen. The governor made a public apology in July and repaid $50,000 in loans as well as another $70,000 loan made to a small business McDonnell set up with his sister. He then returned what he called 'tangible' gifts his family accepted from Williams. According to a person close to the McDonnells and familiar with the PAC's operations, Maureen had complained to the committee she did not have enough funds to keep up the style she believed a first lady should uphold. This May 5, 2011 photo shows McDonnell campaign donor Jonnie Williams left, and Maureen McDonnell during a reception for a  NASCAR race at the Executive Mansion in Richmond . The family were allegedly struggling after their finances were hit by the real estate market and properties they bought totaling $3.84million lost value. Maureen McDonnell was given a PAC credit card after she made the complaint, according to the source. Indeed, in August, McDonnell announced on his hourm long monthly show on Washington's WTOP radio that he is working with his private legal team to return all gifts still in his family's possession to Williams. Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, however, said he won't return Williams' gifts or reimburse him for their reported $18,000 value because they include vacations, dinners and private jet travel - not things that can be given back. There are some bells you can't un-ring. You can't un-take an airplane flight,' Cuccinelli said. '...I didn't get loans, didn't get cash, didn't get shopping sprees.' Maureen McDonnell spent $6,000 around the time of Bob McDonnell's January 2010 inauguration and complained to the PAC the family did not have enough to finance her first lady wardrobe . Asked why he wouldn't reimburse Williams for the gifts' value, he said because, 'No money changed hands.' Cuccinelli, the Republican nominee to succeed McDonnell as governor, disclosed his gifts from Williams on his required statements of economic interest, although he accepted some of them years before they were reported. Cuccinelli amended four years' worth of financial disclosure reports in April, listing a $3,000 family vacation and a $1,500 catered Thanksgiving dinner at Williams' luxury waterfront villa on Virginia's Smith Mountain Lake among items he had earlier overlooked. McDonnell's gifts from Williams, however, came to light through weeks of news reports, not his own economic interest filings. His gifts were more numerous and more tangible, including a $6,500 Rolex watch inscribed to the '71st governor of Virginia,' the check for 28-year-old daughter Cailin, and a $10,000 engagement check for daughter Jeanine, 32, before her May wedding. Both wedding gifts have already been returned, McDonnell said. Spokesman for the governor and first lady Rich Galen told the Washington Post in July that Maureen McDonnell was borrowing the expensive clothes and they would be donated to charity once her husband's term is complete . 'I am working with my counsel to return gifts that have been given,' McDonnell said. 'My eldest daughter returned her engagement gift and my daughter Cailin has returned her wedding gift, and there are other substantial items that are in the process of being returned, and I'll let you know more when I do.' In July, McDonnell said he had repaid nearly $125,000 in personal and business loans that Williams made, and the governor, through his private legal and public relations team, issued an apology to Virginians. The governor did not disclose either the loan from Williams or gifts from him which candidates and public officeholders are required to file annually broadly sketching out their personal finances. McDonnell, entering the final five months of the single, non-renewable term to which Virginia uniquely limits its governors, defended his decision not to report the gifts, noting that the state's ethics laws compel disclosure only of gifts given directly to officeholders or candidates themselves, not to their immediate families. Iconic:The governor's career began to unfold when a tip to a fraud hotline alleged the head chef at the governor's mansion was stealing food . The McDonnells, both 59 years old, believe they have done nothing illegal and plan to fight the charges in court, they said in separate statements through their lawyers. McDonnell, a Republican, said in July he had repaid $120,000 in loans from Jonnie Williams, a major campaign donor and the founder of Star Scientific. He also apologized for the embarrassment the gifts and loans to him and his family had caused Virginia. Williams resigned as Star Scientific chief executive in December. McDonnell had acknowledged that he and his family received more than $160,000 in gifts and loans from Williams. The gifts from Williams ranged from a $6,500 Rolex watch for McDonnell, to wedding and engagement presents and money for his daughters, and a $15,000 shopping spree for first lady Maureen McDonnell. A spokeswoman for Star Scientific did not immediately return a call requesting comment.","Former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell and his wife were indicted on Tuesday by a federal grand jury and charged with accepting bribes .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Britain's top heart doctor has called for statins to be sold over the counter, saying that not taking them is a ‘disaster’. Sir Magdi Yacoub told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that everyone over 40 should take the cholesterol-lowering drugs daily. His call comes after claims that statins caused harmful side effects in 20 per cent of users were withdrawn by their authors after articles appeared in the British Medical Journal. The UK's top heart surgeon, Sir Magdi Yacoub, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that everyone over 40 should take cholesterol-lowering drugs daily . Sir Magdi, who was awarded an honour of merit in the most recent new year's honours list, said: ‘Not to take statins is a disaster. 'The risk benefit ratio is massively in favour. 'Doctors don’t even have to prescribe them, there is a move that people can buy them themselves.’ The leading medical journal overstated the dangers of taking statins and said the drugs cause side effects in one in five patients. It is feared the articles could discourage patients from taking the life-saving medicines, which are prescribed to millions in the UK. The journal recently blamed internal and external reviewers for failing to pick up the mistakes and pledged an independent investigation to determine whether the articles should be retracted completely. Prof. Sir Magdi Yacoub (second right) with his wife Lady Marianne Yacoub (second left) and daughters Sophie (left) and Lisa (rigt) after receiving his knighthood at Buckingham Palace in 1991 . The UK is the top prescriber of statins in Europe, and second only to Australia in the developed world. More than a million prescriptions for the cholesterol-busting drugs are written each week in England, compared with a few thousand in 1981. Doctors used to prescribe statins only to patients with a 30 per cent risk of a heart attack within the next decade, but this was cut to a 20 per cent risk in 2005. Under guidance being proposed, the threshold would be lowered to 10 per cent.","Sir Magdi Yacoub called for drug to be sold over the counter .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . After spring break, California teacher Gary Sconce will return to teach as her true self, Karen Adell Scot. The Yosemite High School 24-year science and multimedia teacher told family in April that she 'felt like a female trapped in a male body,' The Fresno Bee reports. She has since undergone hormone replacement therapy. Scot, 56, told the paper that her gender dysphoria made her feel trapped. 'It’s like getting out of dark solitary confinement in prison where you never saw the light,' she said. 'You can’t believe that you actually are free ... People say it’s like a mental illness but it’s not ... It’s being your authentic self after being a fake you.' 'I knew I was a girl from my first self-aware thoughts,' she said, 'and I tried desperately each morning to wake up each morning as a female small child and it never worked.' California science and multimedia teacher Gary Sconce will return to teach after spring break as her true self, Karen Adell Scot . On March 19, Yosemite Unified School District Superintendent James Sargent wrote to parents of children at the high school, telling them that from April 22 onward, Sconce will be known as Ms. Karen Adell Scott, the paper reports. The letter quotes California Education Code 220, which says that no person shall be subjected to discrimination on the basis of gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation. Scot told the paper that she will not be 'pushing any social agenda' on her students and will continue to 'run a conservative and disciplined class.' She also said she chose the name Karen Adell because it's what her mother would have named her had she been born with a female body. Scot reportedly tried a variety of activities to convince herself of her masculinity, including college football, joining the military, becoming a sheriff's deputy, and teaching martial arts . Scot has been the recipient of multiple teaching awards and accolades and is a 30-year teaching veteran . In a letter to her colleagues, Scot wrote 'Consider: I have lost my marriage of 35 years to a magnificent, brilliant woman, am going to lose my house, and am spending (money) on serious and painful physical changes – including both medical and psychological services,' the paper reports. 'I have been shunned by those who used to be my friends, have been shunned by family, have had people try to cast demons out of me, have left my church of nearly 30 years, and have been scorned and laughed at by those who had for decades said they were my friends. Who would choose that?' Yosemite High School Principal Randy Seals told The Sierra Star that the school is working hard to make sure the transition goes smoothly and that inappropriate behavior will not be condoned. Scot reportedly tried a variety of activities to convince herself of her masculinity, including college football, joining the military, becoming a sheriff's deputy, and teaching martial arts, according to the paper. Scot has received multiple awards for teaching and has been a Who's Who in America's Schools teacher over ten times. She has also coached California state champions for Science Fair, Science Olympiad, and Odyssey of the Mind, the Star adds. Scot is currently going through a divorce after 35 years of marriage to a 'magnificent, brilliant woman' and plans to legally change her name to Karen once it is complete.","After spring break, Yosemite High School teacher Gary Sconce will return to teach as Karen Adell Scot .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Toronto mother who had received a shocking anonymous letter last week urging her to have her 13-year-old autistic son euthanized has issued a forceful response, highlighting the importance of tolerance. Karla Begley and her family were left reeling after receiving a disturbing, hate-filled missive from a neighbor in Newcastle, Canada, informing her that the noise her special needs son, Max, was making while playing outside terrified her 'normal' children. On Wednesday, Miss Begley, whose . 15-year-old son, Jack, is also on the autistic spectrum, and she herself . is wheelchair-bound due to multiple sclerosis, gave an interview to a blog about special needs children called Love That Max to address the controversy in a constructive way. Eloquent answer: Karla Begley, pictured here . with her son Max in 2010, took to a blog about special needs children to . deliver a response to a vile letter a neighbor had sent her complaining . about the boy's sounds . Words of wisdom: Mrs Begley (left) urged people to be more understanding towards special needs children like her son (right), whom she called a blessing . ‘I will not stoop to an insulting . level,’ she said. ‘What I have to say is about tolerance, . acceptance and respect for kids with special needs.’ Begley . addressed the noise complaints cited in the callous letter she had . received, saying that all children make noise, not just ones with . special needs. In the case of her son, the sounds he emits is the only . way he can express himself. ‘If . Max's sounds bother someone, I'd hope that person would let us know in a . respectful way,’ Begley said. ‘Give us a chance to handle it instead . of being cowardly about it.’ The . 44-year-old mother went on to say that she prefers when people openly . address her son’s disability, like kids in the neighborhood who come up . to her and ask why Max talks ‘funny.’ ‘The . parents are embarrassed. But if the mom isn't going to talk properly to . a child, or teach him that kids with autism are not contagious, I . will!’ she told the blog. ‘It's important to help kids understand . and not be fearful from a young age. ‘I'll . tell children, ""He has autism and he has trouble with speech, but you . can say 'hi' to him."" And then I'll have Max say 'hi' back and it's OK. I'd rather kids ask than grow up to be the sort of people who write . nasty letters about autism!’ The . mother further explained that just because her son cannot express . himself in words like most people, or take part in activities like other . children his age, he still understands everything and enjoys life. Nothing good to say: An anonymous neighborhood mother wrote this letter to the grandmother of a severely autistic teen in Newcastle, Canada . Sadness and anger: Max's mother Karla Begley was in tears as she read the hateful letter directed at her son . ‘People with special needs are people first. They have every right others do,’ she argued. ‘Instead of glares, I wish people would give smiles. Instead of anger toward parents, I wish people would be more understanding. ‘Trust me, if there's behavior ruining someone else's day, it's ruining mine and I want to deal with it!’ In the disgusting missive the Begleys had received, the cowardly author called Max a useless burden to his family. But his mother has insisted that in fact her son has been a blessing to her. ‘I think I'm lucky: How many mothers still have their 13-year-old son wanting to sit on the couch, have mommy time and cuddles, and not be afraid to show love and affection?’ Karla Begley said. The mother added that while her son’s future is uncertain due to his disability, she and the rest of the family are unfazed by the possibility that Max may never have a wife or a job. ‘Everyone has a place in the world,’ she said in her eloquent response. ‘Some people are meant to hold big jobs. Some people make you happy and smile.’ During the summer, 13-year-old Max spends his mornings with his grandmother Brenda Millson in Newcastle. She . says she was shaking after receiving a letter August 16 from an anonymous . neighbor complaining that the noise Max makes outside is 'DREADFUL!' and that it 'scares the hell out of my normal children!' Mrs Millson shared the whole letter with CityNewsToronto. The woman's anonymous letter went beyond the offensive noise complaint into even more repugnant territory, writing that Max is a 'hindrance'. 'Who . the hell is going to care for him? No employer will ever hire him, no . normal girl is going to marry/love him and you are not going to live . forever!' Then she recommended something truly atrocious. 'Personally, . they should take whatever non retarded body parts he possesses and . donate it to science. What the hell else good is he to anyone!' 'Do the right thing and move or euthanize him! Either way, we are ALL better off.' 'Who says that about a child?' Max's mother Karla Begley asked City News. She started to cry as she explained that her secondary progressive multiple sclerosis keeps her from walking and running with her son. 13-year-old Max was diagnosed with severe autism when he was two and he spends his summer mornings at his grandmother's house, usually playing in the backyard . On his side: The neighborhood came out in support of Max after hearing about the abhorrent letter . Since learning about the letter, neighbors of Max's grandmother have come out in a public display of support for the boy in an attempt to out the letter's author. Max's father is worried that the letter might lead to violence against his son. 'A person that's that crazy or demented who would fabricate something like that...it leads me to believe that they're very dangerous,' Jim Begley said, 'and right now I'm scared for my son's safety. If the writer is identified, Max's family plans to press charges.","Karla Begley, 44, was interviewed by a blog about special needs children .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Portuguese designer has created a contraption which she says can detect cancer using trained bees. The bees are placed in a glass chamber which the patient exhales from. If the bees fly into a secondary chamber, then that means the bees have detected the disease, according to Susana Soares. A Portuguese designer has developed a device for detecting cancer using trained bees . Miss Soares, who presented her Bee's project at Dutch Design Week, in Eindhoven last month, said: 'Trained bees only rush into the smaller chamber if they detect the odour on the patient's breath that they have been trained to target. 'The bees can be trained within 10 minutes.' Scientists have discovered that honey bees have an excellent sense of smell which is better than a sniffer dog. Bees can be trained to detect bombs and one company called Insectinel is training 'sniffer bees' to work in counter-terrorist operations. If the bees fly into the secondary chamber, the designer says that means they have detected cancer . A bee is trained by exposing it to certain odours before feeding them a solution of water and sugar. The bees then remember the smell for the rest of their lives if they are always rewarded with sugar. The glass object has a big chamber and a small chamber where the bees go if they detect the disease. Research carried out by scientists has suggested that bees can accurately diagnose diseases such as tuberculosis, lung and skin cancer as well as diabetes.","The bees are placed in a glass chamber which the patient exhales from .

"By . Wills Robinson . A schoolboy plotting to carry out a ‘new Columbine’ school massacre asked his teacher which gun he would prefer to be shot with, a court heard yesterday. The 16-year-old neo-Nazi fanatic is said to have made the chilling threat as he plotted to bomb two schools, a university, mosque, cinema and council buildings in his hometown of Loughborough. The boy questioned his teachers about guns and researched firearms on the internet while at school, the Old Bailey heard. Now 17, he was arrested in February . for carrying a machete. When officers searched his home they discovered . an arsenal including home-made bombs, as well as knives and guns. The teenager, whose identity is hidden in this artistic drawing, idolised Hitler and former EDL leader Tommy Robinson, a court has been told . Yesterday, pupils and teachers from his secondary school told how the . pupil, who cannot be named because of his age, was openly discussing . mass killings. A science teacher recalled him asking about guns and . added: ‘He asked me which gun I would prefer to be shot with. He is . aware I am a chemistry teacher, and he was also keen to ask questions . about explosives and chemicals.’ Prosecutor Max Hill said the . accused, who has Asperger’s syndrome, had a book called Spree Killers . about massacres at schools and colleges in the UK and U.S. Mrs Hill said in the months before his arrest the boy became increasingly anti-social and racist. Jurors were also told the teenager boasted of attending an EDL rally in Leicester in February 2012. Prosecutor Max Hill QC said the defendant used Facebook’s private messaging service to discuss his targets with a friend. In the week before his arrest in February, the boy wrote on Facebook Chat: 'I think I want to do it next April,' the court heard. The jury have already been shown amateur videos showing the teenager and his two friends, also unnamed, testing petrol bombs made out of wine bottles, white spirit and lighter spirit, and socks or rags as the fuse. Among 11,000 Facebook Chat messages, the teenager also discussed creating 'smoke-nades' with ping- pong balls and making 'acid-filled condoms' with a friend, the jury was told. Mr Hill said: 'We suggest this material, from the mouths or keyboards of these young men themselves, gives the defendant away. 'Young he may be, sometimes less than entirely coherent he may be, but there are aspects of these Facebook chats which cannot be explained away as schoolyard banter.' Mr Hill showed jurors a selection of newspaper clipping found, including a report of a 16-year-old boy who planned a killing spree. He added: 'You can see the level of interest in atrocities, both domestic and foreign’, he said. In legal arguments Max Hill QC (left), prosecuting, said told the jury that if they believe the suspect was planning a massacre then they should find him guilty. Ali Bajwa QC (right), the defence barrister during the trial of a 17-year-old accused of planning a 'Columbine-style massacre' ‘There is gunman kills 17 in church outrage, gunman kills dad, lad, 16, in massacre of kids plot - the list goes on. ‘You might find that quite chilling in the context of this case.’ The teenager and two other 17-year-old boys have already pleaded guilty to two charges of possessing petrol bombs and component parts of pipe bombs for the use of explosive devices. A former classmate of the defendant, who cannot be identified, said his behaviour became 'uncontrollable at school' and began racially . abusing other pupils. In a police interview played to the . jury at the Old Bailey, the teenager said he first met the alleged . terror plotter in September 2011 when he seemed 'a nice, decent guy'. 'Through the year he started acting up,' he said. Targets were alleged to include Loughborough University and five other sites in the area . 'He said he supported types of terrorist groups like the IRA, EDL (English Defence League), and was quite racist as well. 'I . didn’t think he was the right person to be hanging around with and I . stopped talking to him.' The boy, who is a prosecution witness in the . trial, said he reported the defendant after he started using racist . language towards his Asian friends in May last year. 'He was saying I wasn’t British because my family wasn’t born here,' he told police. 'I heard him under his breath call me a P*ki a few times. 'I was told he was quite a big racist and said offensive things to teachers. He was uncontrollable. 'Once I heard that I thought he’s not . the type of person I need.' In one incident the defendant became 'wound . up' when he was accidentally tripped by a pupil, the witness said. 'He started getting really mad, raging at this person,' the boy said. 'He started calling him names and taunting him. People started getting really sick of him.' Distanced himself: A former friend of the defendant told the jury he started to racially abuse pupils . The teacher said he had to issue regular reprimands to the teenager over his behaviour in class because of his bullying, and regular stream of racist remarks. He said Columbine was one of the attacks the teen pointed out, adding: ‘He was encouraging me to look at the firearms, making a judgement whether it was a good gun. ‘He mentioned people that had carried out the attacks and referred to those people as not bad people.’ The teacher said the teenager was constantly disruptive in class, pushing other pupils around and abusing those who refused to do what he wanted. ‘He took pleasure in disruption and failed to get the point that qualification was a necessary part of growing up throughout the year’, he said. ‘I was not able to make him truly appreciate the value of education. ‘There were many incidents of defiance, and incidents of racial abuse, it has to be said. ‘With the incidents of racism, they were tirades of long drawn-out and frankly painful to listen to episodes of him going on about different people different religions and different orientations.’ He said the race hate began in October 2011, when the boy was just 15, ranting against Jewish people, Germans, and Muslims. ‘He seemed to believe people of the Muslim religion did not have a place in this country because of their religion’, he said. ‘With Jews, there didn’t seems to be a particular individual or someone singled out, this was just a blanket hatred of people who took that religion.’ He also said the defendant bullied one pupil because of German heritage. The boy, now 17, is accused of stockpiling weapons, explosives, and a crossbow in preparation for a planned a killing spree in April next year. He had a large Nazi Swastika flag hung on the wall in his bedroom, alongside a poster of Heath Ledger as the Joker, and also had a custom-made knife with a Swastika on the handle. The defendant, who has Asperger’s syndrome, denies a charge of possessing items for the purpose, preparation and instigation of an act of terrorism. The boy also denies one count of possessing a document or record containing information likely to be useful for a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, and a further count of possessing explosives in the form of component parts of IEDs. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Seventeen-year old said he would 'take some Muslims down' on Facebook .

"By . Paul Bentley . and Jonny Paul . A German clothing brand favoured by neo-Nazis has caused horror by opening a branch yards from the office of the UK’s Chief Rabbi. Thor Steinar, which is notoriously worn by right-wing thugs, has been banned in the German Bundestag and many of the country’s football stadiums for its links to neo-Nazism. But in a move described as ‘deliberately provocative,’ the first British store opened a fortnight ago in North Finchley, in the heart of the Jewish community. Thor Steinar, a German clothing brand favoured by neo-Nazis has caused horror by opening a branch yards from the office of the UK's Chief Rabbi . Jewish and Muslim residents, charities and community leaders yesterday called for the shop to be boycotted amid fears it will attract racist thugs to the area . The Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis is based a few doors away, as is the Islamic Association of North London, a mosque which serves the large local Muslim population. Jewish and Muslim residents, charities and community leaders yesterday called for the shop to be boycotted amid fears it will attract racist thugs to the area. Residents walking past said the store, manned by a heavily tattooed Slovakian man, was ‘scary,’ ‘confrontational’ and ‘offensive’, while charities described its opening as a ‘disgrace’. Thor Steinar, which is notoriously worn by right-wing thugs, has been banned in the German Bundestag and many of the country¿s football stadiums for its links to neo-Nazism . Store owner Zsolt Mogyorodi insisted: 'I'm really upset about this. I have lots of black people friends. I've got lots of Indian friends. I'm not Nazi. I'm not racist' Thor Steinar has attracted huge amounts of controversy since it was launched in Germany in 2002. Its original logo featured runes placed together to look like the insignia of the SS under Adolf Hitler. In 2012, it named a new German store Brevik, which critics claimed was in honour of right-wing Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik. While it uses the Norwegian flag and other Nordic symbols on its products, Norway has long sought to distance itself from the German brand. Wearing its products is banned in the German parliament and state assemblies in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Saxony. The nearby local mosque on the High Road in North Finchley which is just down the road from the Viking Thor Shop . The office of the UK¿s Chief Rabbi just a few yards away from the new shop . Many of the country’s football clubs have also barred fans from wearing the clothing to games and online retailer Amazon refuses to sell its products. In North Finchley, the brand is being sold exclusively in a store called Viking ThorShop, which opened two weeks ago. The office of the Chief Rabbi is a few doors down on the same road and the Islamic Association mosque is about 100 metres away. A war memorial, dedicated to local men who lost their lives fighting in the Second World War, is also moments away. The store, which is surrounded by Asian-owned shops and Afghan and Persian restaurants, has been discussed on British neo-Nazi websites, with one person writing: ‘I hate north London. It’s full of Jews.’ A man wears a t-shirt of the label Thor Steinar, during a demonstration of several hundred neo-Nazis in Germany . Mother-of-two Danielle Benson, 51, an interior designer who has lived in the area for 23 years, visited the store on Sunday. ‘I found it quite scary. The shop was manned by a heavy-accented guy with a shaved head and lots of tattoos. ‘I find it extremely confrontational and offensive that they have opened in an area where so many cultures and ethnic minorities intermix.’ Surveyor Ben Glickman, 43, from North Finchley, said: ‘it is disgraceful that this store has opened in a such a prominent Jewish area of London, and with so many other ethnic minorities that make up the area. It is a deliberately provocative act.’ ‘As a result of the store being advertised on a neo-Nazi website, it is likely also that it would attract far-right hooligans to the area. This is extremely worrying.’ Masood Afzali, who owns a Persian food shop across the road, said: ‘It is very worrying for all of us. These people are hating the Jews and anyone different. This is an area with all different people living together. We don’t need this here.’ ‘I’m . really upset about this. I have lots of black people friends. I’ve got . lots of Indian friends. I’m not Nazi. I’m not racist' Store owner Zsolt Mogyorodi . Chief Rabbi Mirvis was yesterday travelling abroad ahead of the Jewish festival of Passover, which started on Monday night. A spokesman for the Community Security Trust, which provides security for Jewish people and public figures in Britain, said: ‘This is a multi-cultural area with very few problems from racism and neo-Nazism and the like. ‘This shop is not welcome here and the sooner it moves on the better.’ Yad Vashem-UK Foundation was established to ensure the horrors of the Holocaust are never forgotten. Trustee Ashley Rogoff said: ‘One of the tasks we set ourselves is to monitor and act when we identify an event that glorifies and supports the far right or neo-Nazism. The firm did have a store called Brevik, named after the Norwegian town, in Hamburg but it shut in 2008 . ‘Such an issue has now arisen with the opening of the Thor Steiner shop in North Finchley. ‘Its original logo is linked to the insignia of the Schutzstaffel, which perhaps says it all. This is a very worrying development.’ Alan Aziz, ceo of the UK Zionist Federation added: ‘It is a disgrace that someone is allowed to sell these items in the UK that glorify the worst atrocity in our history. This is banned in Germany so why is it legal here?’ Store owner Zsolt Mogyorodi insisted he was not racist. He said he chose to open the store in North Finchley because there are lots of Eastern European people living nearby who like the brand. ‘I’m really upset about this. I have lots of black people friends. I’ve got lots of Indian friends. I’m not Nazi. I’m not racist. ‘It is just stupid things they write on websites.’","Thor Steinar, which is notoriously worn .

"By . Associated Press . Thousands of runners are preparing to take part in the Boston Marathon today amid tightened security following the double bombings at last year's race that killed three people and injured 260. A higher police presence, runners using clear plastic bags for their belongings, and fans near the finish line being encouraged to leave strollers and backpacks behind are just a few of the tightened security measures. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said although there have been no specific threats against the race 'we're not taking that as a sign to sort of stand down'. About 36,000 . runners have registered for the race - the second-largest field in its . history, many of them coming to show support for the event and the city . that was shocked by the attack on its signature sporting event. Thousands of runners are preparing to take part in the Boston Marathon today amid tightened security following the double bombings at last year's race that killed three people and injured 260 . Race organizers expanded the field from its recent cap of 27,000 to make room for more than 5,000 runners who were still on the course at the time of the explosions . Race . organizers expanded the field from its recent cap of 27,000 to make . room for more than 5,000 runners who were still on the course at the . time of the explosions, for friends and relatives of the victims and for . those who made the case that they were 'profoundly impacted' by the . attack. For . years, state and local officials have conducted a 'tabletop exercise' before the Boston Marathon, a meeting that allows them to study a map of . the 26.2-mile course and plan for emergencies that could arise during . the race. So . many new people needed to attend the session this year that they moved . it from the state's emergency bunker in Framingham to the a convention . center in the city. One million people are expected to line the route in a show of defiance and to honor the victims and survivors of the attacks which killed three people and wounded more than 260. A large crowd gathers to pose for photos at the Boston Marathon finish line, one day before the race . The . crowd grew from what usually is about 100 to more than 450, according . to Boston Athletic Association executive director Tom Grilk, who is in . charge of organizing the race. 'Whether . you have a small group or a big group, the spirit is the same,' he said . this month in an interview at the athletic association's office, about . two blocks from the finish line. 'And that is: How do we get our event . done well?' For the 118th edition of the world's oldest annual marathon, security along the course will be tighter than ever. 'There'll be considerably more police . presence,' Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said on CBS' 'Face the . Nation' on Sunday. 'But we also don't want to have it, you know, kind of . a race through a militarized zone. So it's about striking a balance, . and I think we have struck that balance.' More . than 100 cameras have been installed along the route in Boston, and 50 . or so 'observation points' will be set up around the finish line 'to . monitor the crowd,' the Boston Athletic Association said. Lelisa . Desisa of Ethiopia and Kenya's Rita Jeptoo, who crossed the finish line . on Boylston Street about three hours before the explosions, will return . to defend their championships. People have their photo take at the finish line of the Boston Marathon yesterday . Desisa returned to Boston last fall to donate his first-place medal to the city as a gesture of support. Jeptoo, who also won the race in 2006, said she is hoping for a third victory - and one she can enjoy. 'It was very difficult to be happy. People were injured and children died,' she said of last year's marathon. 'If I'm going to win again, I hope I can be happier and to show people, like I was supposed to last year.' Yesterday marathon . runners were blessed at an emotional church service that celebrated . Easter and remembered the victims, while heightened security measures, . including bag checks, were in place at marathon events. 'It's . different, coming back,' said Gisele Goldstein, 55, of Germantown, . Tenn., who planned to run her 12th Boston Marathon this year. 'It's not . just me-there's a sadness.' Her friend Nanette . Farris, 46, of Memphis, added that people were surprised she wanted to . return for her second Boston Marathon. The doubters were all . non-runners, however-the runners she knew felt differently. 'If . you're a runner, you want to show them-no one's going to take that away . from us,' Farris said. 'Once this occurred, everyone wanted to qualify . for Boston.' Last year two pressure cooker bombs were detonated near the finish line, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others . Still, there have been tense . moments - such as when an alarm went off on Friday, during the Runners' Expo at the Hynes Convention Center. People were spooked, Goldstein . said, even though it turned out to have been a test. Ricardo . Corral, 53, of New York, who planned to race in the hand-cycle division . of the wheelchair race on Monday-his eighth marathon-said he was . reassured by the heightened security. 'We are not nervous,' he said. 'We know the police will be here to protect people.' Corral . added that it was especially important to him and his teammates to . return this year, to support Boston and each other. 'As the signs say, . `Boston Strong,'"" he said. 'That's why we come back.' Only hours after the bombings, people were pleading for an entry into the . 2014 Boston Marathon. For months the calls and emails continued, runners . begging for an opportunity to cross the finish line on Boylston Street . and convinced it would ease at least some of their grief. 'They'd . say, `I'm not a qualified runner; I don't think I ever will be. I . train. I run. I could do it. But because of what happened last year, I . need to run,'' Boston Athletic Association executive director Tom Grilk . said last week. Runners and guests receive containers for their Boston Marathon pre-race dinner at Boston City Hall . Wellesley College student Tiffany Liao, of San Marino, Calif., center, serves a pasta dish during a Boston Marathon pre-race dinner . 'It might have been because . they were present at the finish, or they knew somebody who was working . or was affected. They might have been somebody who lives in Haverhill, . Mass., and they were watching the race and it hit `em hard. That was . true for a lot of people. 'And we received some of these communications and we thought, `What do we do?'' The . B.A.A. had already expanded this year's field to include more than . 5,000 runners who were stranded on the course when the two explosions . killed three and wounded 264 others. A few extra invitations were . sprinkled among the first-responders and the victims, or their families; . others went to charities and the towns along the route; some who said . they were personally touched by the tragedy were already given bibs. But . organizers felt they might still be missing people, people who perhaps . didn't think their trauma was worthy amid all the lost limbs and . physical scars. So, in November, they announced that about 500 bibs . would be available for those 'personally and profoundly impacted by the . events of April 15, 2013.' In 250-word essays . submitted over the website, 1,199 would-be runners made their case. Almost 600 had the connection the B.A.A. was looking for. 'The . anger, guilt and heartbreak I still feel today will never go away,' wrote Kate Plourd, who was in the medical tent, dehydrated and vowing . never to run Boston again, when she heard the announcements: 'Explosions . at the finish line. Casualties. Dismemberments. Prepare yourself to . treat the victims.' 'Running the 2014 Boston . Marathon will help me heal my mind,' she said in the essay that landed . her bib No. 28115.

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Sarah Dean . In denial? Minister for Immigration Scott Morrison has refused to confirm claims by refugee activists that a boat carrying Tamil asylum seekers is in trouble . Immigration Minister Scott Morrison is refusing to confirm the existence of a boat carrying 153 Tamil asylum seekers, including apparently sick children, 170 nautical miles off Christmas Island. The boat is likely to have run out of oil and is stranded in high seas, refugee advocates say, but Mr Morrison claims there are no significant incidents at sea to report. The West Australian is reporting a second boat has been intercepted by Australian Customs vessel Triton near Christmas Island. Opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles said he had heard the second boat, carrying 50 asylum seekers, had departed from Java. Refugee activists said on Saturday the larger 21m boat which left from India on June 13 had sprung an oil leak and was expected to run out by lunch time on Saturday. 'We are experiencing huge waves and very bad conditions,' a man claiming to be aboard the boat told Fairfax Media via satellite phone on Saturday. 'We are very afraid and at threat. We have only three litres of water left. We can only manage for today, and tomorrow we will have nothing to drink.' This photo shows a group of asylum seekers arriving on Christmas Island, on December 6, 2013 . A second boat has reportedly been intercepted by Australian Customs vessel Triton (pictured) near Christmas Island . Two children on board - one aged three months, the other two years, were sick with vomiting, fever and headaches, he said. 'The wind is increasing. It is a very difficult situation.' There are thought to be 32 women and 37 children on the vessel. If it reaches Christmas Island it will be the first asylum-seeker boat to reach Australian shores in six months. Mr Morrison would not confirm if there was a boat, if it was in Australian waters or if the government was taking any action. 'No boat has arrived,' he told reporters in Melbourne. The minister said the government's border protection policies had not changed and that he would not comment on reports relating to Operation Sovereign Borders unless a significant event was involved. 'I am advised that I have no such report to provide to you today,' he said. Where they could end up: A temporary detention centre on Christmas Island . If the boat reaches Christmas Island it will be the first asylum-seeker boat to reach Australian shores in six months . Mr Marles said Mr Morrison's response was 'a complete farce'. 'He's very happy to beat his chest on the good days, but is silent on the bad,' he told reporters in Melbourne. Mr Marles said he had no doubt Australian customs and the navy would do their job and provide assistance when it become necessary. But Mr Morrison was reaching new lows by not commenting on what actions are being taken just because it was 'inconvenient for his political scoreboard'. Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said Mr Morrison's attitude to the problem was 'cavalier and dismissive'. Christmas Island is a territory of Australia in the Indian Ocean. From the late 1980s and early 1990s, boats carrying asylum seekers, mainly departing from Indonesia, began landing on the island . 'We don't want to see the government waiting until it's too late,' he said. Australian Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said turning the boat back to India was not an option. 'If the Prime Minister intends on creating a diplomatic row with India by attempting to turn the boat back, he needs to be up front about that,' Ms Hanson-Young said in a statement on Saturday. 'After nearly two weeks on board this boat these people will be extremely traumatised and in need of care. 'We should be offering this to them.'

"Britain’s last surviving Dambuster Johnny Johnson has gone into battle to try and win recognition for the men involved in the raid. Men from the famous Dambuster raid have been given a simple clasp for their heroism, instead of a medal in recognition for their mission striking at the heart of industrial Germany. Former Squadron Leader Johnson, now 91, is now calling for a proper medal for the aircrews involved. Britain's last surviving Dambuster Johnny Johnson has gone into battle to try and win recognition for the men involved in the raid . He told the Telegraph: ‘A medal was produced for the Arctic [convoy] survivors. If a medal is good enough for them it’s good enough for us. ‘We deserve a medal not a clasp.’ Mr Johnson, who flew 50 missions during his 22 years service was the bomb aimer on the night of May 17, 1943, as part of Operation Chastise to cripple the Nazi war effort. He dropped the bomb on Sorpe dam and was awarded a raft of medals including the Distinguished Flying Medal for his part in the daring 617 Squadron raid. A portrait in honour of him will be unveiled later this month in London. Last year Mr Johnson leant his support to a £1million appeal to help maintain a memorial to the men of Bomber Command. The £7.5million bronze memorial in . London's Green Park was unveiled by the Queen in June 2012 in tribute to . the 55,573 men who died while serving in Bomber Command during the . Second World War. Almost half of the unit's 125,000 men did not come home while 8,400 were wounded and 10,000 taken prisoner.

I . wasn’t sure people would be interested. 'I’m . asked how it feels to be the last British Dambuster. Well, excuse the . language, I feel bloody lucky. I was in the right crew, in the right . place at the right time and I feel honoured and privileged to have been . able to take part.

He dropped the bomb on Sorpe dam and was awarded a raft of medals including the Distinguished Flying Medal for his part in the daring 'Dambuster' Squadron raid . The heroics of that night were immortalised in the 1955 film The Dambusters, starring Richard Todd and Michael Redgrave as Bomber Command head Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris and Barnes Wallis respectively . He retired from the Royal Air Force in 1962 and became a junior school teacher. He . and his late wife Gwyn have three children, eight grandchildren and 16 . great-grandchildren from their 62-year marriage. Gwyn, who served as a . WRAF radio operator, died in 2005. The squadron was assembled by Wing Commander Guy Gibson with only 11 weeks to prepare for their mission. They . were not told that they would be bombing the Ruhr Valley until six . hours before the raid began, following weeks of practice over Peak . District reservoirs. On the night of May 16, the 19 . Lancasters carrying 113 crewmen took off in three waves along two . different routes to bomb the dams. Gibson attacked first at the Möhne at 12.28am, but five bombs were dropped before it was breached. The . first wave’s three remaining aircraft with bombs then attacked the Eder . which finally collapsed at 1.52am. Aircraft from the other two waves . bombed the Sorpe but it remained intact. Sqn .

Arctic convoy veteran Eddie Grenfell, 93, with his Arctic Star medal, pictured in March 2013 . Last year, after a hard fought campaign, Second World War veterans of the Arctic Convoy missions were finally honoured. The government had previously refused to provide recognition of the sailors' bravery in keeping supply lines open to the Eastern Front, because the conflict was too long ago. Thousands of vessels massed in Loch Ewe before embarking on the treacherous 1,600-mile journey past the enemy-held shores of Norway, through the Barents Sea to the frozen wastes of Murmansk and Archangel. The convoys carried four million tons of cargo including tanks, planes, fuel and food to help the Russia slow Germany's advances on the Eastern front. More than 66,000 Royal Navy sailors and merchant seamen took part. In total, 87 merchant ships and 18 British warships were sunk. But the Cold War meant it was politically difficult to give the survivors a medal for assisting the Soviet Union. When the war ended those on the convoys were awarded the Atlantic Star - even though that was a separate campaign 800 miles away. But last year Prime Minister David Cameron ordered the Arctic Star medals amid concerns many veterans would die before they were awarded. He admitted he was 'righting a wrong'.","Men from the famous 617 squadron who took part in the Dambusters raid were given simple clasp for heroism .

"By . Mark Prigg . For fans of sci-fi films, it may look strangely familiar. British car firm Lotus has unveiled its first ever motorcycle - and looks a lot like the famous Light cycle from the film Tron. In fact, Lotus worked with the designer of the Tron bike on the project. The C-01 is the first Lotus motorcycle - although the car firm will let someone else produce it . The C-01 will be available in a range of special Lotus colour schemes, and customers lucky enough to buy them can even design their own . Lotus has not yet revealed the top speed or the price of the bike. However, it has released some specs: . 2-cylinder 4-stroke engine1,195cc200 HP6-gear jaw-type shift transmission . Ride height:        90 mmHeight of seat:        710 mmFuel tank capacity:        10.5lDry weight:        181 kg . 'Following two years of careful planning and intense development, Kodewa is delighted to announce that the prototype of the world’s first motorcycle to bear the legendary Lotus marque is now road registered and ready for action,' the firm said. However, Lotus will not be making the bike itself, instead granting German firm Kodewa a license to produce it. 'The C-01 combines ample power via a V-twin engine with a distinctive body designed by Daniel Simon integrating carbon fibre, titanium and aerospace quality steel,' the firm said. Just 100 of the bikes will be made in a range of special designs reflecting the most iconic Lotus colour schemes, and customers can even design their own. The C-01 was designed by Daniel Simon, who also designed the Tron Lightcycle . Production of the bike has already begun - even though Lotus has not yet revealed how much it will cost . Designer Daniel Simon also worked with Disney to design the Tron Light cycle in the hit film. A former designer for Bugatti Automobiles, he also designed the ‘Bubbleship’ used by Tom Cruise in the recent Universal sci-fi hit ‘Oblivion’. The German is also responsible for the black and gold livery of the Lotus LMP2 sports cars. 'The design process of the C-01 was a labour of love, there were many challenges, ensuring that the bike not only touches your visual senses with its timeless blend of classic appeal and modern execution, but that is safe and ergonomically sound was critical to me,' he said. 'We have worked hard to create a motorcycle with very distinctive features such as a clean main body, an extremely low side profile, a bold stance, a unique air intake, logical partline solutions and clean graphics.' The original idea to create the C-01 came from Kodewa’s Dr Colin Kolles. Speaking about the project he said: 'We set out to create a bike that isn’t just great to ride but also represents a piece of art in motion. ust 100 of the bikes will be made in a range of special designs . The bike was designed to be 'truly jaw dropping' 'Over the years I have seen my fair share of style over substance, what this bike brings to the market is a unique combination of both: state of the art technology with a truly jaw-dropping aesthetic.' Günther Holzer, CEO of Holzer Group said: 'I was one of the first people to ride it and I have to say I was very impressed. 'Together we have found that delicate balance between raw, aggressive power and breath-taking handling. 'The team has created something very special, it looks incredible, it sounds fantastic but above all, the ride is sensational. I’m very happy.' The bike combines carbon fibre, titanium and aerospace quality steel . The machine has a 2-cylinder 4-stroke engine .","Lotus worked with the designer of the famous Tron lightcycle from the hit film .

"By . Guy Adams . and Michael Seamark . A leading child abuse charity yesterday demanded that three senior Labour figures apologise for their ‘inexcusable’ support of a vile paedophile group. Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, her husband, home affairs spokesman Jack Dromey and former Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt were key figures in the National Council for Civil Liberties when it forged extraordinary links with the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange. The trio refuse to comment on the NCCL’s activities or apologise for the organisation’s support for PIE, which openly campaigned to legalise child sex. Power couple: MPs Jack Dromey and Harriet . Harman, who married in 1982, rose from the NCCL to the highest echelons . of the Labour party . Commenting on this paper’s investigation into the Labour trio’s links with PIE, media expert Roy Greenslade, a former editor of the Daily Mirror, said yesterday: ‘I’m with the Mail on this. 'On the basis of the paper’s evidence, I think Harman, Dromey and Hewitt do need to address this matter seriously.’ Greenslade wrote in his blog for the Left-leaning Guardian newspaper: ‘It isn’t good enough to say the world was different then (as some have been suggesting in relation to the recent crop of historic sex abuse court cases), because there has never been a time when it has been all right to advocate sex with a child.’ High profile: Former Health Minister Patricia Hewitt now enjoys a lucrative £160,000 a year part-time job working for BT after she retired from Parliament . And Peter Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC), said: ‘An apology is the very least they could do. 'Many, many children were abused by Paedophile Information Exchange members and staff. ‘And many other abusers were encouraged in their crimes by the propaganda put about by that thoroughly disgusting organisation. 'Despite this fact, Harman, Hewitt and Dromey’s NCCL legitimised the PIE, and acted as apologists for it during the 1970s and 1980s. 'And that really is inexcusable, whatever social norms or values were current at the time.’ The Mail investigation has revealed shocking links between the Labour figures and PIE, a group of predatory paedophiles calling for the age of consent to be cut to just four. Politicians last night put more pressure on Miss Harman, Mr Dromey and Miss Hewitt to come clean about their links with PIE. Tory MP Alun Cairns, a member of the panel of senior MPs advising David Cameron on policy, said: ‘It’s hard to understand why there has been no response. ‘These are very serious allegations, and a full and frank statement is now needed, otherwise this worrying situation could drag on, which is in the interests of no one.’ Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe added: ‘They should apologise. I am in no doubt that what they did at the time was because there may have been a different mindset, but they should at least acknowledge that. ‘These views are utterly appalling, and that is what most of us thought in the 1970s. ‘I remember the controversy at the time when the PIE affiliated to the NCCL. It’s not as if people thought it was OK in the 1970s. Big players: Harriet Harman once legal officer of the NCCL, now Labour . Deputy Leader and husband Jack Dromey, right, a Left-wing firebrand, now . a shadow minister . ‘The Labour Party have been critical of the Catholic Church and the BBC, so why are they not being critical of their own?’ Tory MP Sir Paul Beresford, who has campaigned to tighten the law on child pornography, said: ‘I just find it absolutely extraordinary. Patricia Hewitt: General Secretary of the NCCL, later Labour minister under Tony Blair and MP for Leicester West . Either they didn’t know or didn’t find out, but if they did know it  is appalling. I think an explanation is due.’ Police are investigating the paedophile group as part of Operation Fernbridge, launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile affair, with one source saying there is evidence that PIE members were abusing children ‘on an industrial scale’. The Home Office is also carrying out a ‘thorough, independent investigation’ into shocking claims that the Labour government of the 1970s may have helped finance the group. The Mail investigation discovered that during the 1970s and 80s, Miss Hewitt described PIE in glowing terms as ‘a campaigning/counselling group for adults attracted to children’. The NCCL lobbied Parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten – if the child consented and ‘understood the nature of the act’. It also called for incest to be legalised in what one MP dubbed a ‘Lolita’s charter’. Miss Hewitt was general secretary of the NCCL from 1974-83, Miss Harman was a newly qualified solicitor when she became its legal officer in 1978 until 1982, when she entered Parliament. Mr Dromey sat on the NCCL executive committee from 1970-79. The Mail repeatedly sent detailed questions to the trio about their links to PIE and whether they regretted supporting such a vile group. Neither Miss Hewitt nor Mr Dromey replied. A spokesman for Miss Harman said: ‘This story is untrue and ridiculous.’","Harriet Harman, Jack Dromey and Patricia Hewitt held senior positions at National Council for Civil Liberties before rising to top of the Labour party .

Yet the first desktop computer to come with a mouse is expected to cost far more than the latest tablet and could fetch an eye watering £25,000 ($42,000) at auction. Launched just over 30 years ago, the rare Apple Lisa 1 came with the iconic hardware and was the brainchild of Apple founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Taking the mickey?

It was hailed as the most important development in personal computing on its launch in 1983 but despite its ground-breaking technology, the machine was a commercial failure, and consequently more valuable today. The machine was flawed with temperamental disk drives and cost a whopping $10,000 - the equivalent of $24,000 or £14,000 pounds today.

Just a year after its launch, it had been superseded by a better and cheaper model and Apple even offered Lisa 1 owners a refund and free upgrade. The returned computers were destroyed and it is thought less than 100 still exist. Compared to modern computers, Lisa's capabilities were minute, boasting a 5MHz processor and just one megabyte of RAM.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Millionaire chef Rick Stein has blamed the stress of the restaurant industry for making him 'fall out of love' with his first wife and have a five-year affair with a pretty blonde 20 years his junior. His first wife Jill still helps run the 66-year-old's empire - but once came to blows with her husband's publicist Sarah Burns, slapping the pair of them outside one of his restaurants in Padstow, Cornwall. He has now been married to Sarah for two years. In a revealing interview today he lays the blame on himself and his 'bloody demanding' restaurants. 'We kind of fell out of love': Rick Stein with his first wife Jill, left, and his new bride, his publicist Sarah Burns . Rick Stein is in fact full of insecurities, regularly suffers crises of confidence and has dreams about working in a kitchen and being unable to get the food out, he has said as he releases a new memoir . He told The Times' Magazine: 'The business was eating us alive. What happened had nothing to do with Jill. It's more to do with the nature of the restaurant business - it's just so bloody demanding. 'It takes over your life and our lives didn't exist outside it. The more successful we got, we had to keep the restaurant going all year and then we didn't go away on our holidays. We didn't have a life outside the business and we kind of fell out of love. 'I'd never [been unfaithful] before and I certainly won't do it again, that's for sure. I'm just so happy now. Nobody looks back at those times with anything but slight gloom, right? Obviously, it's not great for the person who has been left, but it's not great for you either.' He and Jill had been married for more than 20 years when in 1997, then 50, the chef began an affair with his pretty blonde Australian publicist Sarah Burns, two decades his junior. Despite Sarah being on the other side of the world he kept the affair secret from Jill for five years - and she only found out when she discovered a heap of international phone bills. Rick and Jill opened the Seafood Restaurant on the site of their former nightclub in Padstow, Cornwall . The chef's empire - including 19 cookery books and several restaurants - is worth an estimated £35 million . But the father-of-three did not leave Jill straight away - he dithered, a victim of what he describes as his own crippling insecurity. He and Sarah, who was also married with two children when they met, fought and he returned to Jill, begging to be taken back. She refused and he went back to Sarah. They married two years ago. Rick and Jill at the opening of their fish and chip shop in Padstow in 2004 - she still helps run the firm . He told the Daily Mail earlier this year: ‘I know it’s not possible, but I just want everyone to like me. But it’s not possible because you can’t help do things that p*** people off, so you might as well not bother. 'Sarah’s brilliant — she’s so bossy, she’s really fierce, but I like that. She takes me in hand.' The chef revealed to The Times' Magazine that when he is alone in Padstow he will visit his own pub three times a week with old friends - though only for an hour at a time, he insisted. His claim on Padstow is not a random one - it is more than 30 years since he opened his nightclub with Jill, which he said had fights every weekend and 'the paving slabs were very absorbent, so it was really difficult to get the blood off.' He holds no ill will to his first wife despite their long history, including the infamous slapping in 2008 outside one of his four restaurants in Padstow, Cornwall (known to locals as Padstein). In fact, the pair still attend board meetings together and swap e-mails about his empire, which includes 19 cookery books, an estimated £35 million and a head chef's post in a restaurant in New South Wales, Australia. 'I certainly would have preferred if . that hadn’t happened, I can tell you,' he told the Mail earlier this year. 'I . remember at the time saying to Jill: “That was a very silly thing to . do.” But emotions were very high. It was bloody tough. It was horrid. 'Thank goodness, time moves on. Twice now, both Sarah and Jill have been . in the same restaurant at the same time and it’s been fine and nobody’s . been slapped!' 'We’d both put so much effort into building up the business that it was just too important to us not to [continue running it together].’ Rick Stein's autobiography Under a Mackerel Sky (Ebury Press, £20) is out now. Rick Stein is also a TV star - but when alone in Padstow he visits his own pub three times a week, he said .","TV star, 66, told The Times' Magazine he 'kind of fell out of love' with Jill .

"By . Martyn Ziegler, Press Association . 'Expect the unexpected': that is the advice security experts have handed out to the Brazilian authorities ahead of the 2014 World Cup. The tournament begins on June 12 and the South American nation is bracing itself to deal with the threat of terrorism, hooliganism, violent protests and muggings. An estimated 600,000 foreign nationals are expected to arrive between June and July for the month-long football extravaganza, and that has provided a raft of extra concerns to security forces. Threat: There are serious terrorist fears in World Cup stadia, like the Arena Amazonia in Manaus (pictured) Terrorism: Palestinian insurgents (left) tarnished the 1972 Munich Olympics, leading to armed guards (right) Disaster: Security forces fear a repeat of the bombings that struck the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in Brazil . The first and perhaps most important issue is that of the threat of terrorism. World Cups in the past have escaped being the target of terrorist attacks but the Olympic Games - at Atlanta 1996 and Munich 1972 - have shown that major sporting tournaments are susceptible to this threat. Foreign visitors will also need to be protected from the widely publicised epidemic of muggings that has been sweeping through Brazilian cities. It will take just one high-profile serious crime for the whole tournament to be tarnished. Theft: Favelas in Brazil, like this one in Sao Paulo, are notorious for muggings and visitors could be susceptible . Security services are already expecting a repeat of last year's public protests which targeted the Confederations Cup - but this time they will likely be on a much larger and more embarrassing scale. Add to that the violent clashes that have occurred in recent months between police and gangs in the favelas, and Brazil's police and army will have to show total restraint. The eyes of the world will be watching them for any evidence of over-reaction or brutality. Danger: Stars like Brazilian Neymar (left) and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo will need protecting from terrorism . Finally, the so-called 'English disease' of hooliganism is a very real threat - but it is unlikely to be an England-related problem this time. Experts believe organised hooligan gangs from Argentina may travel to Brazil and clash with local fans, who have something of a reputation themselves. There have even been warnings that Argentinian gangs may target English supporters due to ill feeling over the Falkland islands. From England, a team of six uniformed officers will travel to Brazil to give advice and be present at matches. Brazilian authorities will also make 2,377 England fans with football banning orders surrender their passports. Protest: Violent clashes have taken place in Brasilia (above) and other Brazilian cities just before the World Cup . Discontent: FIFA's decision to host the tournament in a nation with huge poverty has caused resentment . Police presence: Armed security forces will be at the World Cup, like they have been in Brasilia during protests . Brazil announced in February it would boost the number of security officers from 100,000 to 170,000, across the 12 host cities, with the armed forces also on standby. Of these, 20,000 will be stewards trained to work inside the 12 stadiums. The United States has been heavily involved in planning to deal with the terrorism threat, with input from the FBI and the CIA. There will be counter-terrorism units stationed near each venue while two unmanned drones, bought from Israel, will patrol the skies. Dr Peter Tarlow, a security expert specialising in the impact of crime and terrorism on the tourism industry, said on www.elsevier.com: 'Brazil has traditionally never been a place of terrorism. 'With the coming of the World Cup, however, international problems now land on Brazil's doorstep. 'This means that Brazil has not only to deal with a high crime rate but also the potential for an act of terrorism.'","Brazilian authorities expect 600,000 foreign nationals during tournament .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Even though Becky Tully loves her three boys with all her heart, she had always craved a baby girl who she could dress up, style and spoil like a real princess. So when doctors told Mrs Tully that she could not have any more children, the 38-year-old was devastated about giving up her dream. But the former care home worker soon found comfort - in five life-like plastic dolls. Becky Tully, 38, from south London, who has three sons, adopted five life-like dolls after she was told she could not have any more children. The babies - Emma, James, Max, Sophie and Connor - are treated as part of the family . Now their doting 'mother' has spent £17,000 buying the silicone models - known as reborn dolls - their own cots, dummies and stylish wardrobes to make them part of the family. Mrs Tully said: 'The boys thought it was a bit strange at first, but once they knew how happy their mummy was, they didn’t mind.' Mrs Tully, from south London, already had three sons  - Joshua, 20, Jack, 17, and Jacob, 11 - when she had to undergo a hysterectomy in 2009, after developing endometriosis and liver disease. The mother-of-three - who had to give up her job in a residential care home because of her illness - became so unwell that her husband Andrew, 40, became her full-time carer. As well as being house-bound for months on end, Mrs Tully was heartbroken that she would never have the chance to mother a young girl. But Mrs Tully's life was completely changed one year later, when she saw a documentary on TV about the reborn dolls. The silicone dummies are hand-picked by would-be mothers for . their realistic weight and soft feel, although they lack the sounds and . smells of a real baby. Just days later, Mrs Tully had ordered Sophie - who she even designed with matching brown hair, so she would look like part of the family. Mrs Tully, pictured here with one of her babies Max, has now spent £17,000 on clothes, accessories and prams to make the five children her own. She says she often scrimps and saves to ensure her babies - who have more than 500 outfits between them - never have to wear the same outfit twice . She said: 'I . spent £840 on Sophie with the care home wages I had left, but it was . worth it - I fell in love with her straight away. These babies are so . unique and precious. 'I ordered Sophie from an online reborn artist and paid for her over nine months in instalments. 'Waiting for her to arrive almost felt like a real pregnancy - it was so exciting. 'I wanted her to look like she could be a part of the family, and her dark brown hair matched mine exactly.' Sophie, pictured left, was the first doll to be adopted by Mrs Tully in 2010. She loved Sophie so much that she went on to adopt four more babies, including Emma, pictured right . Reborn doll Max is one of the five babies who is treated as children by Mrs Tully. The babies have their nappies changed, sleep in a cot in her room and are taken out on day trips with the family . Connor, pictured left, and James, pictued right, are showered with lavish gifts and never wear the same outfit twice . Sophie was the start of a new-found love for Mrs Tully. In the following year, Mrs Tully bought another four dolls - Emma, James, Max and Connor - who she started showering with lavish gifts. She changed their nappies, gave them dummies and put a cot in her bedroom for the babies to sleep in. She even spent more than £5,000 on clothes for the dolls, as well as £500 on shoes, ensuring they never had to wear the same outfit twice. Mrs Tully loves shopping for her the dolls' outfits at GAP, Next, George at ASDA and Mothercare and has spent £5,000 on clothes alone for the babies . The reborns have more than 500 outfits between them and Mrs Tully loves shopping . for the clothes at GAP, Next, George at ASDA and Mothercare. Dolls - £8,000 . Clothes - £5,000 . Shoes - £500 . Cots, cribs and prams - £1,000 . Baby accessories - £2,000 . Hair accessories and hats - £500 . Mrs Tully says she scrimps and saves to pay for new outfits for reborns, sacrificing treats for herself to spoil the children. She says: 'I’ve taken the babies to Bluewater Shopping Centre, and I’ll often treat them to a day out at our local wildlife park. 'Me . and Andrew take them out shopping together and, although he was . embarrassed at first, now he’s more than happy to take over Daddy-duty . and hold their pram. 'He knows how happy they make me and when my oldest son moves out, he’s going to help me turn the spare room into a nursery.' Mrs Tully’s reborns are so realistic that shop assistants often can’t believe she’s cradling a fake baby. Mrs Tully says the bill for the dolls' shoes comes to more than £500. She also spent £500 on hair accessories and hats, as well as £2,000 on what she described as 'baby accessories' She said: 'I love going to Claire’s Accessories to buy pretty hair slides and accessories to style the girls' hair. 'One day the shop assistant was cooing over Sophie, and couldn’t believe it when I revealed she wasn’t a real baby.' For Mrs Tully, her new 'children' have brought her the happiness she never thought she would feel. 'Sometimes . I will hear people talking about the dolls, questioning whether they’re . fake or not, but it doesn’t bother me, they make me happy. 'I love my boys so much, but I desperately wanted a little girl so I could style her hair and pick out pretty dresses' 'I was heartbroken when I had to give up work, and then to make matters worse, my dream of having another child was also in tatters. 'Andrew had to give up his job as a lorry driver to look after me. Now he’s my full-time carer. 'I love my boys so much, but I desperately wanted a little girl so I could style her hair and pick out pretty dresses.' Mrs Tully said the rest of her family have also learned to love the dolls. She said: 'Andrew doesn’t mind sharing our bedroom with the dolls, and I’ve even taught my youngest son how to care for them too. 'He knows how to hold their tiny heads properly, and will put them to bed for me. 'I’ve brought three prams, two moses baskets, a swinging crib and play gyms for the babies to use.' The reborn addict hopes to expand her brood and has recently ordered her most expensive baby yet, Evie Margaret, priced at £900. Mrs Tully said: 'I said I wouldn’t buy any more dolls, but I couldn’t resist Evie, she was too cute. 'Evie will have new outfits for special occasions, and just like the other babies, she won’t leave my side. 'I know I’ve spent a lot, but Andrew supports my spending because these babies have changed my life. 'Some people might think it’s strange, but it’s only the same as men being obsessed with cars - instead my obsession is reborn babies. 'My health condition does get me down and these babies have brought me so much happiness. 'Nothing can ever replace the love I have for my real kids, but I still love my vinyl brood, and I’ll keep making a special home for them.'","Becky Tully, from London, had a hysterectomy in 2009 due to ill-health .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A Californian company has made a sci-fi dream a reality, by creating a hub to control all smart devices found in the home, potentially saving people time and energy expended on menial tasks. Ivee’s Sleek is essentially a HAL for the home that lets users control internet-connected devices from a single place, much like the HAL 9000 computer imagined by Arthur C Clarke in his Space Odyssey series. More than 60 years later, engineers have created the device, which uses artificial intelligence to read a user’s voice – much like Apple’s Siri – to control a host of hi-tech home devices. Scroll down for video . The Ivee Sleek uses artificial intelligence to read a user's voice - much like Apple's Siri - to control a host of hi-tech home devices . Ivee's Sleek is connected to a home Wi-Fi network and users can add gadgets connected to the internet via a web dashboard. The device, which costs $229 (£144), claims to be the first Wi-Fi voice-activated assistant for the home, which helps individuals manage and control their devices, as well as set reminders. The company said: 'Our goal is to create a simpler and more natural way of interfacing with the internet and your smart home.' To give the hub a command, a user must first say 'hello Ivee' and the device will then listen for verbal clues when a person starts to talk - turning their words into actions. A beam-forming microphone array cancels ambient noise and makes it possible for a person to talk to Ivee from up to 15 feet away. When the hub hears a voice command, it sends an audio file to AT&T¿s  ¿Watson¿ language-processing server, which converts the signal to text. The Sleek then scans for keywords to work out the action it should perform .

If they ask the machine to 'clean up,' it can contact a smart vacuum cleaner to carry out the desired action (pictured) The hub is designed to be placed near a bed as it also functions as an alarm clock and displays live content, such as the weather, stocks and news. It also reads bedtime stories and can play relaxing noises until an individual falls asleep.

A Taliban bullet fired from half a mile away killed a soldier by 'pure fluke', an inquest has been told. Kingsman Dave Shaw, 23, was shot on January 14 last year while on patrol supporting Afghan police in Lashkar Gah, capital of Afghanistan’s notorious Helmand Province. Investigators were told the bullet that killed Kingsman Shaw, who was from Barrow in Cumbria, had already 'reached the end of its trajectory, with the coroner describing his death as 'terrible luck'. Kingsman Shaw was killed shortly after his patrol arrived at Pupalzy Shak, a fortified checkpoint surrounded by large walls designed to withstand a direct hit from rocket propelled grenades. The British troops had been at the checkpoint around one hour and 40 minutes when Taliban snipers opened fire from farmland to the north west. The court heard how Kingsman Shaw was struck by a bullet that had 'reached the end of its trajectory' and dipped over the northern wall of the 160 square foot checkpoint. South Cumbria coroner Ian Smith said: 'To say this is bad luck is an understatement, it is terrible.' Major Mark McLellan, commanding officer of the patrol, told the court his men had arrived at the checkpoint at around 7.30am, and had seen no signs of enemy activity. Mr Smith asked: 'In due course did the prevailing conditions outside change; did something happen?' Kingsman Shaw was hit at a distance of half a mile by the fluke bullet . Afghanistan death: Kingsman Dave Shaw was on patrol in Lashkar Gah (pictured), the capital of Helmand Province, when he was shot. He was killed shortly after his patrol arrived at the fortified checkpoint at Pupalzy Shak . Major McLellan replied: 'Yes, there was firing. A short burst of arms went over my head. I gave the order to 'stand to' and everyone got their kit on. Then a second burst came through.' The court heard within one or two seconds of firing Kingsman Shaw and his colleague Sergeant Mark Stevens had both been hit. He said: 'I saw Sergeant Stevens had been hit in the back. At that point I saw Kingsman Shaw put his hand up to his neck, and then the sergeant grabbed him and applied pressure.' Major McLellan described the arc of the shot as 'pure fluke' and said there was no way a bullet could have penetrated the walls of the compound. The court heard that although Kingsman Shaw had removed his 25kg body armour after entering the checkpoint - a choice down to the individual soldier - it still would not have stopped the bullet. Sergeant Stevens, whose body armour saved him from serious injury, said that after reeling under the impact of the bullet he saw Kingsman Shaw was in severe trouble. Fluke: Investigators were told the bullet that killed Kingsman Shaw, whose funeral was held in Barrow, Cumbria (pictured), had already reached the end of its trajectory and dipped over a wall . He said: 'Kingsman Shaw was staring at me and he was pointing at his neck. 'I realised he had been hit and I grabbed him and applied pressure straight away. Then he was taken to the ground... The medic reacted straight away.' Army medic Lance Corporal Rachel Hughes broke down in tears as she told of her attempts to save Kingsman Shaw's life. She said: 'One minute we were standing around chatting and then we were under fire. I reached around to grab my body armour and I saw David cupping his neck with his left hand. 'I blinked for a second and that’s when the Sergeant took him to the ground.' Lance Corporal Hughes told the court how she applied pressure to stop the bleeding and administered a clotting agent. She said Kingsman Shaw lost consciousness and stopped breathing twice before being 'brought back' with CPR. After giving evidence Lance Corporal  Hughes was thanked by Kingsman Shaw’s sister, Sarah. A report by forensic pathologist Dr Nicholas Alexander, read by Mr Smith, said: 'He died despite heroic attempts to save his life. It is a testament to his physical fitness and to the care he received that he survived as long as he did.' Popular: Kingsman Dave Shaw (second from right) pictured with friends at his home in Barrow, Cumbria . Dr Alexander stated the cause of death was cerebral infarction, caused by a gunshot wound to the neck. Kingsman Shaw was airlifted to Camp Bastion after around 25 minutes, before being flown to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, where he died the following day. Following the inquest Sergeant Stevens, 35, from Lancaster, said: 'He was passionate about his job, and he was a good lad. He was always one of the boys.' Major McLellan said: 'He was a real character, and he had reached the point where other soldiers were starting to look up to him.' Kingsman Shaw's dad David said: 'His colleagues reacted as you would expect, completely professionally. 'Hearing what happens brings home how unlucky it was. There was nothing anyone could have done.' Sarah Shaw said: 'It is nice to know there is no-one to blame. The care he received gave us the chance to say goodbye.' The inquest continues.","Kingsman Dave Shaw, 23, was killed in Afghanistan on January 14 last year .

"By . Becky Evans . Helen Fielding says the death of her father made her realise that life has many 'twists and turns' Author Helen Fielding said her latest Bridget Jones Diary reflects how real life does not always have happy endings. Millions of Bridget Jones fans were shocked this week when it was revealed that Mark Darcy has been killed off in the book, Mad About The Boy. But Fielding says the death of her father in a car crash made her realise that life has many 'twists and turns'. She said: 'It's like the keys of a piano isn't it? There are white notes and black notes. 'And there's a tragicomic element in my writing; the happy ending is just where you choose to end a book. 'Life, with all its twists and turns, carries on beyond it.' Fifteen years after the last instalment, the unlucky-in-love protagonist is now 51, and a single parent bringing up two children after barrister Darcy died. Fielding told British Vogue that her outlook on life changed after the death of her father when she was 24. She said: 'It was horrible and shocking and made me very aware that life is complicated and precarious.' Despite Bridget's tragedy, the author says the character's new life shows how women in their 50s are full of vitality and still want to look good and go out on dates. Bridget is dating a 29-year-old called Roxter and is still worrying about her weight and how much she drinks. Helen Fielding said the new Bridget Jones's Diary reflects that life does not always have happy endings. Bridget (played by Renee Zellweger in the film adaptations) is a single mother after Mark Darcy (played by Colin Firth) dies . Fielding was interviewed in Vogue . She said: 'Women of my age are still dating, having sex and looking great. 'A woman's sell-by date is getting later and later, and quite right, too.' Fielding, who has always denied that the . books are autobiographical, is herself a 55-year-old single . mother-of-two who ended her relationship with television executive Kevin . Curran in 2009. She said the book reflects how 'hard motherhood can feel sometimes.' She added: 'Nobody's life is perfect and today, more than ever, I think women are under a huge pressure to be something, achieve something, look like something. 'We are all constantly constructing a facade.' Heralding the arrival of 'chick lit', Bridget Jones's Diary started life as a newspaper column in 1995.

"By . Rob Cooper . Unsolved murder: Melanie Hall, 25, vanished after leaving a nightclub in Bath in June 1996. Her remains were found by the roadside in 2009 . Detectives investigating the murder of Melanie Hall said today that a piece of blue rope and an old Volkswagen Golf they recently recovered could help them finally solve the case. Miss Hall, 25, vanished after leaving a nightclub in Bath, Somerset, in 1996 where she had apparently had a row with her boyfriend. Her remains were found dumped in a bin bag by the side of the M5 near Bristol in 2009. Police said today they have received 'significant' new clues which may provide a breakthrough in the murder investigation. Four years ago workmen discovered parts of Miss Hall's skeleton, including arm and leg bones, her pelvis and her skull next to the northbound slip road at junction 14 of the M5 near Thornbury in Gloucestershire, nearly 30 miles from where she vanished. Police recently recovered an A-reg mark 1 Volkswagen Golf GTi cabriolet which is being examined by forensic officers. Detective Superintendent Mike . Courtiour, leading the murder inquiry, said: 'Over the past four years . we have received information, intelligence and names that we have taken . seriously, researched and thoroughly investigated. 'We have recently received information concerning the origin of the blue rope that was used to tie up Melanie’s body. 'It . is significant information and we are actively working on that line of . inquiry. We are working with forensic scientists in relation to the rope . and the circumstances of where that particular length of rope came . from. 'Also, we have recently found and recovered a car that may be relevant to events in 1996 when Melanie disappeared. Discovery: Melanie Hall's remains were found by the roadside four years ago by workmen next to the northbound northbound entry slip road of junction 14 of the M5 near Bristol . Body find: Police work on the M5 slip road in 2009 after Miss Hall's remains were found. Detectives said today that they have recently made a significant breakthrough in the murder case . 'It . is a white, A-registered, mark 1 Volkswagen Golf GTi cabriolet which is . currently being examined by forensic scientists. At this stage we do . not know if it is connected with the case, but it is a very interesting . and possibly significant line of inquiry. 'If . anyone has any information about the circumstances of Melanie’s . disappearance and her murder or can connect that car to what happened to . her in 1996, please contact us and tell us what you know.' Miss Hall, who worked at Royal United . Hospital in Bath, vanished after a night out at Cadillacs nightclub in . Walcot Street, Bath, in June 1996. Probe: Avon and Somerset Police Detective Inspector Mike Courtier speaks to the press at Junction 14 of the M5 after the remains of Melanie Hall were found at the roadside in 2009 . Anguish: Melanie's parents Steve and Pat Hall who today said police on't give up until they have caught their daughter's killer . Graduate: Miss Hall was a clerical worker at the Royal United Hospital in Bath when she vanished in 1996 . A post mortem examination on the clerical worker's remains revealed she had been battered to death with a blunt instrument and suffered a fractured skull, cheek and jaw. At the time the remains were discovered, Melanie's father Steve said he needed to know how his 'vibrant' daughter became a 'bag of bones'. In 2003 police arrested two men in connection with Miss Hall's disappearance but they were released without charge after police searched buildings and a field near Bath. Shortly after Miss Hall's remains were discovered, a man turned himself in to police in Greater Manchester, but he was ruled out after undergoing psychiatric tests. In 2010 police arrested a 38-year-old man on suspicion of murder but he was subsequently released. The fresh appeal by detectives has been welcomed by Miss Hall’s family, who issued a plea for anyone with information to come forward. Her elder sister Dominique said: 'We have always been hopeful that someone would be brought to justice and that we would find out the details of what happened to Melanie. 'It won’t make the future any different - there will never be closure for our family - but it would be a great consolation if someone would search their conscience and come forward to police with that vital information we need.' Discovery: A white VW Golf GTI Mk1 cabriolet similar to the one which police have recovered in their search for the killer of Melanie Hall . Disappearance: Cadillacs nightclub in Bath, Somerset, in June 1996 where Melanie Hall was last seen before she vanished in 1996 . Clue: Blue rope like this was used to tie up the black bin bags that Melanie Halls' remains were found in . Body find: Melanie Hall (right) disappeared in 1996 and her remains were found at the roadside in 2009 . Melanie Hall's father Steve said he and his wife Pat have kept their daughter's ashes in a box by their fireplace since she finally 'returned home'. He said Pat clung onto the remains after the funeral and cremation four years ago and has refused to scatter them. Steve, 69, said: 'I had assumed we would scatter them somewhere, but Pat has never brought herself to do that and I don't think she ever will. 'She has finally got her child back and Melanie sits in a box by the fireplace. To Pat she is safe, she is home.' Steve, a former director and chairman of Bath City Football Club, said he has dealt with his grief by 'reinventing' himself after she went missing. He became heavily involved with Bath City FC and started a new career as an artist. But he has also struggled to see his wife Pat, 68, deal with the loss of their daughter. He said he had not realised exactly how difficult she had found it until Melanie's body was discovered. Appeal: Melanie's parents Steve and Pat Hall appear at a press conference in Bath four years ago after her remains were found by the M5 . The family's focus now is on finally seeing those responsible for her death brought to justice. Steve said today that the family were pleased police had made progress with their investigation and had seized a car. 'This is very positive news. Gradually the pieces of the jigsaw are being put together to bring Melanie’s killer or killers to justice,' he added. 'We always knew it would take a long time, but these new developments appear very encouraging. 'It’s time for whoever has information about Melanie’s murder to come forward and bring this to an end - because it will come to an end eventually. The police won’t give up until they get a result.' Mr Courtiour said officers from Avon and Somerset police were determined to solve the case. 'Bringing Melanie Hall’s killer or killers to justice remains one of our highest priorities,' he said. 'On this fourth anniversary of the discovery of her body, I can stress that the investigation is very much active. It has been, and continues to be, one of the most detailed and thorough murder investigations in the force’s history.'","Melanie Hall vanished after leaving a nightclub in Bath, Somerset, in 1996 .

"By . Associated Press . He is now so much a part of the nation's social fabric that it's hard to comprehend a time when Muhammad Ali was more reviled than revered. Barely past the opening credits of a new documentary about Ali, though, we get a glimpse of how many Americans felt about him during a tumultuous time in the country's history. 'I find nothing amusing or interesting or tolerable about this man,' television host David Susskind said, nearly spitting his words out in a 1968 broadcast as Ali looked on. 'He's a disgrace to his country, his race, and what he laughably describes as his profession.' Scroll down for video . Trials: A new film tells the story of how Muhammad Ali, seen during a training session on September 28, 1974 in Kinshasa, Zaire, was once reviled by the nation . Controversy: In 28 Feb 1966, right, heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali testifies before the Illinois State Athletic Commission that he was sorry for protesting after being reclassified 1-A by his draft board but he refused to flatly apologize for 'unpatriotic' remarks he had made . The scene in 'The Trials of Muhammad Ali' - now playing in selected theaters - is then juxtaposed with one of President George W. Bush giving Ali the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005. From draft-dodging pariah to hero, Ali's long and sometimes painful journey was finally complete. For those who didn't live in the time and are only faintly aware of the tale, it is a remarkable one. For those who grew up in the era and know well Ali's impact on a country just beginning to come to terms with race relations, it's a refresher course, complete with clips of Ali at his bombastic - and to some, scary - best. 'I don't have to be what you want me to be,' Ali is shown telling reporters the morning after his first fight with Sonny Liston in 1964, when he announced to the world he was a follower of the Nation of Islam. Boxing fans were already wary of his involvement with the Black Muslim movement, but he became a pariah to even more when he refused induction to the Army at the height of the Vietnam War as a conscientious objector, famously saying, 'I ain't got no quarrel with the Viet Cong.' Disgrace: 'I find nothing amusing or interesting or tolerable about this man,' television host David Susskind said, nearly spitting his words out in a 1968 broadcast as Ali, pictured left 10 years later, looked on . Banned from boxing and facing five years in prison, he spent three prime fighting years on the sideline while the courts debated what to do with him. Once the heavyweight champion of the world, he became a speaker on college campuses to make a living and keep his cause before the public. 'You're talking about a man being hit with the war situation and taking a stand along with his involvement with the Nation of Islam. It was new turf,' said Khalilah Camacho-Ali, his wife at the time, who is interviewed in the film. 'He was comfortable making his decisions, but the thing that was hard to bear was whether he would fight again. It didn't look like a hopeful battle.' Transformation: 'The Trials of Muhammad Ali' - now playing in selected theaters - then shows President George W. Bush giving Ali, pictured in 1974, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 . Ali would eventually win the battle, and go on to not only regain the heavyweight title but become the most famous athlete of his time. The U.S. Supreme Court finally took up his case and reversed his conviction on a technicality in 1971 in a decision that surprised some considering the tenor of the times. The decision itself is also the subject of a drama that airs Saturday night on HBO. 'Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight' uses actors including Christopher Plummer, Ed Begley, Jr. and Peter Gerety to play Supreme Court justices, but Ali himself is taken from the clips of the era at his oratorical best. 'Why tell his story when he tells it himself?' said Shawn Slovo, the movie's writer. But tell a story the HBO movie does, though some liberties are taken for entertainment's sake. Among them are the justices being shown at one point gathering in the basement of the Supreme Court building to watch sex movies for a case before them on pornography, and a clerk smoking marijuana in a court bathroom. It's surprisingly engrossing, though, for a movie that revolves almost entirely around the legal process. At the center of it is a clerk for Justice John Harlan II, who convinces him to switch his vote so that Ali's conviction would be overturned on a technicality and he would not have to go to prison. The movie and the documentary aren't related except that they both feature Ali. They do, however, share funny clips from when Ali - complete with big Afro and beard - is shown singing in the 1969 Broadway musical 'Buck White.' Anger: Ali, pictured in 2006, angered the nation when he refused induction to the Army at the height of the Vietnam War as a conscientious objector, famously saying, 'I ain't got no quarrel with the Viet Cong' A man had to make a living, but Ali's days as an actor were numbered when the play closed after seven performances. Camacho-Ali, who was married to Ali from 1967-77, said she never gave up hope during her husband's dark period that he would be allowed to fight again, though Ali himself had his doubts. 'My frame of mind was more positive than his was and it helped keep him afloat,' she said. 'The best thing for Ali at the time was to keep him focused on his family life. That's all we had to work with.' Camacho-Ali hasn't seen her former husband - now married to his fourth wife, Lonnie - since they both attended Joe Frazier's funeral in 2011. But she still feels protective of Ali, with whom she had four children, and believes the documentary is a way of educating people to the times they lived in and what they went through. 'I'm tired of people giving the wrong information,' she said. 'You're talking about one of the most famous people in recent history. The facts should be correct.'","Barely past the opening credits of a new documentary about Ali, we get a glimpse of how he was once more reviled than revered .

"By . Richard  Shears . More underwater vehicles may be used in the search for the wreckage of MH370 after a high-tech robotic submarine was forced to return to the surface by the bone-crushing water pressure close to the ocean floor. The search area proved too deep for the U.S. Navy's Bluefin-21 autonomous underwater vehicle, which was sent down some 2000km north west of Perth to begin scouring the seabed for the missing Boeing 777 after no possible black box pings were detected for six days. But just six hours into its planned 16-hour mission on the sea bed, it exceeded its maximum depth limit of 4.5km and its built-in safety feature automatically returned it to the surface. Scroll down for video . Out of its depth: The U.S. Navy's robotic submarine  Bluefin-21 is hauled aboard the  Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Shield. The search area for MH370 is proving too deep for it to operate, so other vessels may now be deployed . Australian Navy ships HMAS Success, left, and HMAS Toowoomba, right, flank United States Navy Ship Cesar Chavez as they conduct a Replenishment at Sea exercise in the southern Indian Ocean during the hunt for MH370 . Australian Navy ships HMAS Perth, left, and Success, right, receive fuel and stores from the Cesar Chavez. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott raised hopes last week when he said authorities were 'very confident' the four strong underwater signals that were detected were from the black boxes on Flight MH370 . Now Angus Houston, the search co-ordinator, has said larger vessels may be required because some parts of the ocean floor are inaccessible to the deep water probe. He said the possibility of more vessels is 'being looked at as we speak' during a press conference. Meanwhile, the data Bluefin-21 had collected was analysed but . nothing of interest was found, the U.S. Navy said in a statement. Search . crews were hoping to send it back under water today, if weather . conditions permit. The autonomous underwater vehicle was . due to scour the Ocean floor for 16 hours - but it was brought back up . after just six hours because it had reached and then exceeded its . maximum operational depth of 4.5km. Any lower and the water pressure could have caused major damage to the mini submarine. 'Its built-in safety feature returned it to the surface,' the joint search committee said in a statement. Authorities knew that any possible wreckage from Flight 370 would likely be lying at the limit of the Bluefin's dive capabilities. Deeper diving submersibles have been evaluated, but none is yet available to help. The Bluefin was programmed to hover 30 . meters over the seafloor as it moved through the search area, but ended . up reaching its maximum depth, triggering the safety feature that . returned it to the surface, the U.S. Navy said. It wasn't damaged and is being reprogrammed to account for the inconsistencies in the seafloor's depth. Sailors aboard the Australian Navy ship HMAS Success man a rope line during the refuelling and Replenishment at Sea operation with United States Navy Ship (USNS) Cesar Chavez . A Royal Australian Air Force AP-3C Orion aircraft flies past the British naval ship HMS Echo in the southern Indian Ocean as they continue to search for missing  MH370 . Pushed to the limits: technician work on the Bluefin21 robotic submarine. A safety mechanism forced it to return to the surface just six hours into the planned 16 hour search . Bluefin 21 was programmed to hover 30 meters over the seafloor as it moved through the search area, but ended up reaching its maximum depth, triggering the safety feature that returned it to the surface, the U.S. Navy said . A . safety margin would have been included in the sub's program to protect . the device from harm if it went a bit deeper than its 4,500-meter limit, . said Stefan Williams, a professor of marine robotics at the University . of Sydney. He said: 'Maybe some areas where they are doing the survey are a little bit deeper than they are expecting. 'They . may not have very reliable prior data for the area, so they have a . general idea. But there may be some variability on the sea floor that . they also can't see from the surface.' Meanwhile, officials were . investigating an oil slick about 5.5km from the area where the last . underwater sounds were detected, said Angus Houston, the head of a joint . agency coordinating the search off Australia's west coast. Crews . have collected an oil sample and are sending it back to Perth in . western Australia for analysis, a process that will take several days. Mr . Houston said it does not appear to be from any of the ships in the . area, but cautioned against jumping to conclusions about its source. The . Bluefin can create a three-dimensional sonar map of any debris on the . ocean floor. But the search in this area is more challenging because the . seabed is covered in silt that could potentially cover part of the . plane. A United States Navy Boeing P-8 Poseidon takes off from Perth International airport as part of a search to locate missing Malaysia Airways Flight MH370 . An AP-3C Orion returns to RAAF Base Pearce after a day of searching an area in the Indian Ocean for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 . 'Encouraging': A total of four signals, matching those of a black box flight recorder, have now been detected by the Australian ship Ocean Shield in the search for flight MH370 . Retired Air Chief Marshal and head of the Australia agency coordinating the search for MH370, Angus Houston, addresses the media . 'What they're . going to have to be looking for is contrast between hard objects, like . bits of a fuselage, and that silty bottom,' Mr Williams said. 'With . the types of sonars they are using, if stuff is sitting up on top of . the silt, say a wing was there, you could likely see that ... but small . items might sink down into the silt and be covered and then it's going . to be a lot more challenging.' The . search moved below the surface after crews picked up a series of . underwater sounds over the past two weeks that were consistent with . signals from an aircraft's black boxes, which record flight data and . cockpit conversations. The . devices emit 'pings' so they can be more easily found, but their . batteries only last about a month and are now believed to be dead. Australian . Prime Minister Tony Abbott raised hopes last week when he said . authorities were 'very confident' the four strong underwater signals . that were detected were from the black boxes on Flight 370, which . disappeared March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to . Beijing with 239 people on board, mostly Chinese. But . Houston warned that while the signals are a promising lead, the public . needs to be realistic about the challenges facing search crews in the . extremely remote, deep patch of ocean. 'I . would caution you against raising hopes that the deployment of the . autonomous underwater vehicle will result in the detection of the . aircraft wreckage,' Houston said Monday. 'It may not.' More signals: A handout image released by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) shows the search area in the Indian Ocean, West of Australia, where  15 planes and 14 ships are scouring a 75,423 square km area of ocean for the wreckage of flight MH370 more than a month after it disappeared . A map from AMSA shows where pinger contacts have been recorded in the search for flight MH370 . The . submarine takes 24 hours to complete each mission: two hours to dive to . the bottom, 16 hours to search the seafloor, two hours to return to the . surface, and four hours to download the data. The . black boxes could contain the key to unraveling the mystery of what . happened to Flight 370. Investigators believe the plane went down in the . southern Indian Ocean based on a flight path calculated from its . contacts with a satellite and an analysis of its speed and fuel . capacity. But they still don't know why. On . Tuesday, Malaysia's defense minister, Hishamuddin Hussein, pledged to . reveal the full contents of the black boxes, if they are ever found. 'It's about finding out the truth,' he told reporters in Kuala Lumpur. 'There is no question of it not being released.' Up . to 11 planes and as many ships were on Tuesday scouring a 62,000 square . kilometer patch of ocean about 2,200km northwest of Perth, hunting for . any floating debris. But . the weeks-long surface search was expected to end in the next two days. Officials haven't found a single piece of debris confirmed to be from . the plane, and Houston said the chances that any would be found have . 'greatly diminished.'","Search area proving too deep for Bluefin 21 robotic submarine .

"By . Paul Bentley . Mead is making an unlikely comeback thanks to a surge of interest among trendy youngsters in the medieval brew . It was a favoured tipple for characters in Beowulf and Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales. And now mead is making an unlikely comeback thanks to a surge of interest among trendy youngsters in the medieval brew. The honey-based drink romanticised in Norse legend and medieval tales is being sold increasingly to supermarkets and restaurants, brewers have said. There has been a huge spike in demand in the past six months, after the drink became fashionable in America, where there are now almost 250 meaderies. In the UK, mead brewers in Cornwall  are now selling about 50,000 litres of mead a year and a new London-based producer makes 2,500 bottles a month, with capacity for double that amount. It is thought young drinkers have led the trend, with the drink being used in cocktails and sauces at top restaurants. It follows the rise of craft beer, now a common sight in pubs across the country. Sarah Thompson, the director of Lurgashall Winery in West Sussex, said that mead was previously an ‘underground drink, popular with medieval re-enactment groups, pagans, and students’. ‘But we’ve seen a big difference in attitude in the past six months. It’s one of the last drinks to have its comeback, after cider and gin. But it’s coming,’ she added. Sophie Fenton runs Cornish Mead with her brother, Matthew Leiworthy. ‘We’re trying to start a new trend for using mead to make cocktails. It’s finding a new, younger market,’ she said. It is thought young drinkers have led the trend, with the drink being used in cocktails and sauces at top restaurants . Mead is referenced frequently in medieval literature, having been a popular drink at the time at weddings and special occasions. It dates back to pagan times, when the bride and groom would drink mead for a month after their wedding. The tradition was the origin for the term ‘honeymoon’. The drink was available in Tudor times, with monasteries creating it as a by-product of beekeeping, but when the monasteries  were dissolved by King Henry VIII in the 16th century, mead largely disappeared. In recent years, however, the brew has been reintroduced by top chefs including Britain's Simon Rogan at the L’Enclume restaurant in Cartmel, Cumbria, and Fera at Claridge’s in Mayfair – and René Redzepi, the chef at Noma restaurant in Denmark, rated as the best in the world. Tom Gosnell started brewing Gosnells London Mead in Peckham, south London, at the end of last year. He now produces the drink for restaurants in London and as far as Edinburgh. While mead was traditionally very alcoholic, with a content of about 16 or 17 per cent, Mr Gosnell’s is 5.8 per cent and made using Spanish blossom honey. ‘I wanted a modern twist; something that was easier to drink and more accessible,’ he told The Independent on Sunday. Chet Sharma, the head of research and development at Simon Rogan’s L’Enclume, said the restaurant makes a modern mead based on elderflower. ‘The only difference between mead and beer is they use malt as their sugar source instead of honey. Why can’t there be as much diversity in mead as there is in craft beer?’ he said. Legend has it that mead is a powerful . aphrodisiac, enhancing virility and fertility - an unfortunate . side-effect considering it is thought first to have been drunk in the UK . and Ireland by monks. It . was most likely discovered by accident, with thirsty men drinking . rainwater from a beehive, unaware that fermentation will have occurred . and that they would become intoxicated. The . term ‘honeymoon’ refers to the pagan tradition for brides and grooms to . drink mead, made from honey, at their wedding and for a month . afterwards. The drink has . been described in books for centuries. More recently, it was the . alcoholic beverage of choice for many in the Harry Potter series and . almost killed Ron Weasley, when he drank a glass of oak-matured mead, . which had been poisoned. Chaucer’s . Canterbury Tales referenced mead as a drink for urban lovers. In the . Miller’s Tale, Chaucer (right) wrote: ‘He sent her sweetened wine and . well-spiced ale and waffles piping hot out of the fire, and, she being . town-bred, mead for her desire.’ Mead’s . chief ingredient is honey but modern versions play with the flavour, . adding elderflower, dried fruit and a range of unusual herbs and spices. In . ancient Greece, mead was called Ambrosia or Nectar and was said to be . the drink of the gods, descended from heaven as dew before being . gathered by bees. The drink . was brewed with herbs and spices to treat a number of illnesses and . became known as Metheglin, from the Welsh word ‘medcyglin’, meaning . medicine. When mixed with the borage or starflower herb it was used on . hypochondriacs.","Huge spike in demand in past six months after drink became fashionable in USA .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Victim: Gerardo I. Hernandez was shot and killed by a gunman at the Los Angeles International Airport on Friday . The name of the TSA agent who was killed in the Los Angeles airport shooting has been revealed just hours after the rampage. Gerardo Hernandez was identified as the 39-year-old victim of Friday morning's attack. Friends and family have begun paying their respects to the slain public servant, saying that he was a loving husband and caring father who enjoyed spending his free time with his two children. Hernanez's cousin told friends on Facebook that he was destroyed by his death. A different family friend told MailOnline that she had known Hernandez's wife for years. The woman said that Hernandez had worked at Los Angeles International Airport for three years before his death on Friday. The Wrap has identified the victim's wife as Ana Machuca, the marketing budget manager for Warner Brothers. 'It’s devastating because he was such a great guy. All he talked about was his family,' Hernandez's friend Kevin Maxwell told NBC Los Angeles. The slain agent was a father of two- as Maxwell said that Hernandez was 'very proud' of his son and 'spoke profoundly' of his daughter. Family: Hernandez, seen in the center with a mustache, was the father of two children and is married . Family man: Hernandez, seen here with his wife Ana and other family members, was rushed to the hospital but doctors said that his injuries were too severe for him to be rescued as he did not have a pulse . A doctor at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center told NBC News that Hernandez was one of two shooting victims who were taken to the hospital, but there was no chance of his survival. A round of shots broke into fragments inside his torso and caused chest injuries while setting off debilitating internal bleeding. 'We made every effort to stop the bleeding and get the heart to beat on his own,' Dr David Plurad told the news station. He was the first TSA agent ever to be killed at an airport while working for the government. 'No . words can explain the horror that we experienced today when a shooter . took the life of a member of our family and injured two TSA officers at . Los Angeles International Airport,' TSA administrator John Pistole wrote . in a letter. 'Sadly, . today marks the first incident where a TSA officer was killed in the . line of duty. We can take some comfort knowing that the two injured . officers are recovering from their wounds.' City officials have ordered several tributes be paid to Hernandez across Los Angeles, as the flags at all government-owned buildings in the area will be flown at half mast. The LAPD chief has also mandated that all police officers wear black bands on their police badges in his honor. Hernandez . died at the hands of shooter Paul Anthony Ciancia, a 23-year-old man . who walked into Los Angeles International airport and walked to the . security checkpoint where TSA agents examined traveler's passports and . boarding passes before allowing them into the terminal. Tragic: A TSA agent is comforted after the shooting outside of Terminal 1. The only confirmed fatality was a TSA agent, who has now been identified as Gerardo Hernandez (not pictured) Securing the scene: Police found a note near Ciancia's bag at the airport where he wrote about his anti-government leanings and signed it with a reference to a well-known conspiracy theory . Reports from the scene describe how Ciancia calmly removed a semi-automatic weapon from the bag that he had with him and started shooting. He is believed to have targeted TSA . agents specifically, using their bright blue uniforms as a way to . distinguish them from the traveling masses. When . that was not enough to help him decide whether or not to shoot, Ciancia . asked individuals if they were members of the Transportation Security . Administration. Traveler Leon Saryan who spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper about how he feels the gunman was clearly targeting TSA agents. 'I . was just getting ready to pick up my shoes and belt and pick up my . other stuff... (when) people hit the ground and then started to run,' Mr . Saryan told CNN. Targets: Multiple witnesses recounted how he asked them if they worked for TSA, and when they said they did not he just continued walking. (This is not believed to be Hernandez, but another victim) Chaos: A police officer answers questions as three of the terminals were closed immediately after the shooting. Airport police helped shoot the gunman, hitting him multiple times but not killing him . He said that while he was going to get his shoes taht were waiting on the conveyer belt, a uniformed TSA agent 'grabbed the shoes and the two of us started running down the corridor towards the gate. This agent got hit it seemed to be a grazing wound.' At that point the agent kept running and seemed fine because the bullet hit him in the shoulder as Mr Saryan huddled in the corner- right when the gunman came up to him. '(Suspect Paul Ciancia) looked at me and said ""TSA?"" I just shook my head and he kept going,' Mr Saryan told Anderson Cooper. 'It was kind of hard to see his expression. I was more focused on the weapon. 'If I had a TSA uniform I wouldn't be here talking to you.'","Gerardo Hernandez, 39, identified as the slain TSA agent .

"By . Sophie Borland . Andy Burnham, the former Secretary of Health, was reportedly furious that the report on substandard care  at Basildon and Thurrock hospital in Essex came out . Labour tried to block the publication of a devastating report into appalling hospital neglect before the last election. Ministers told the Care Quality Commission not to release its verdict on Basildon and Thurrock hospital in Essex, where patients were dying from poor care. Inspectors found blood on curtains and chairs and catheters left on the floor at the flagship foundation hospital. Death rates in A&E were a third above average. But hours before the CQC was due to publish the report in November 2009, the Department of Health told the watchdog to stop. Newly-released emails show that the then Health Secretary Andy Burnham was furious when the report was later made public amid massive media coverage. They also show officials were asked to ‘spin’ a major NHS report, again in the run-up to the 2010 election. The revelation puts further pressure on Mr Burnham, who is widely tipped to lose his job as Labour health spokesman in an imminent reshuffle. He has been accused of failing to act over a number of failing hospitals – most notably Mid Staffordshire, where hundreds died of neglect. The emails were obtained from the CQC by Tory MP Steve Barclay under freedom of information rules. The commission was due to publish its ‘state of care report’ into hospitals and care homes in February 2010, three months before the election. Yet an email sent round by a senior CQC boss following a meeting with one of Mr Burnham’s junior ministers instructs them that, ‘given the political environment’, the report should be ‘largely positive’. The memo, sent in January 2010, urges staff to ‘be careful about language’ and ensure it is ‘hard-hitting without presenting critical data’. Inspectors found blood on curtains and chairs and catheters left on the floor at Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals . The message from Martin Marshall, the CQC’s director of clinical quality, to Jill Finney, the deputy chief executive and Cynthia Bower, the chief executive, concludes: ‘It is really important that we get the tone absolutely right.’ Another email – from Finney to Bower – refers to ‘anxieties’ about the publication of the report into Basildon hospital. It says ‘the secretary of state was furious’ when the report – despite the block on it – was spotted on a government website by journalists. Mr Barclay, MP for North East Cambridgeshire and member of the Commons public accounts committee, said: ‘Mr Burnham’s position is now untenable. The longer he stays in post the more discredited his party’s position is on the NHS. Mr Burnham is widely tipped to lose his job as Labour health spokesman in an imminent reshuffle . Mr Bunham has been accused of failing to act over a number of failing hospitals ¿ most notably Mid Staffordshire, where hundreds died of neglect . ‘He is furious when bad news comes out and his officials are saying whatever you do don’t put anything bad in the press. His reputation is seriously damaged.’ Julie Bailey, who set up the campaign group Cure the NHS after her mother Bella died at Mid Staffordshire, said: ‘The whole culture within Labour was to keep problems hidden. That’s why we lost so many lives. Unless we address this culture we’ll just lose more people.’ Tory Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘The care of NHS patients is too important for political meddling.’ Earlier this week he announced the CQC would become entirely independent of the Department of Health in the hope that it will be more critical of how the NHS is run. Tory Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: 'The care of NHS patients is too important for political meddling' Eleven hospital trusts were put into special measures after a major investigation by the NHS’s medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh uncovered ‘deep-rooted’ failings. Experts estimated that thousands of patients had needlessly died at these trusts over the past decade. Professor Sir Brian Jarman, a world expert on hospital mortality, sent Mr Burnham a list of trusts where the death rates had been very high for several years but it was ignored. Sir Brian said health ministers had presided over a ‘denial machine’ designed to prevent criticism of the NHS. But a Labour spokesman said: ‘This is the latest stage of an on-going Conservative Party smear campaign against the last Labour government. These old, unfounded allegations have already been answered in full. ‘No evidence has ever been produced to suggest anything other than that ministers acted properly at all times. The facts show that ministers did the precise opposite of what is alleged. ‘When problems at Basildon and Thurrock hospital first emerged, Andy Burnham made a full statement to Parliament and ordered an in-depth investigation of every hospital in England to be completed before the general election. Action was also taken to improve the internal running of the CQC. ‘On Basildon, a CQC press officer briefed the media without authorisation and before the Department of Health was officially notified. This was a breach of established practice and left the Department unable to respond properly to the many enquiries it was receiving, from public and press, following reports on rolling news programmes.’ Miss Finney, along with Miss Bower, was accused of conspiring to cover up a separate report into poor care at a maternity unit – both deny the allegations. A third employee, Anna Jefferson, has now been cleared of wrongdoing in the case.","MPs tried to cover up damning report over death rates at hospital .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Hannah Anderson and her father are in negotiations with NBC over a documentary about the California teenager's kidnapping ordeal, in a deal that could earn the family $100,000. The network, which had an exclusive interview with Hannah after her dramatic rescue from a family friend-turned kidnapper who killed her mother and brother, has confirmed it is in talks about a show. Although the network didn't pay the 16-year-old for an interview she did in August, she could expect a substantial sum for future work with a production company connected to NBC. Scroll down for video . Deal: NBC is said to be negotiating a deal with Hannah Anderson for a documentary about her abduction . Sources told the Washington Post that Hannah . and her father Brett 'could receive more than $100,000 for their cooperation in the making of a documentary or some other nonfiction program'. The new head of NBC, Deborah Turness, hailed the exclusive interviews with Hannah as a 'major coup' after the teenager was featured on Today, Nightly News and Dateline NBC. On Tuesday, the network announced it was in negotiations with the family to create a longer program about Hannah's abduction by James Lee DiMaggio Jr. It hit back at claims that it was using 'check book journalism' and confirmed that neither Hannah or her father had been paid for the interviews in August and October. Network spokesman Ali Zelenko told the the Post: 'NBC News never pays for interviews.' The proposed project however will be created by Peacock Productions, and the Andersons would be compensated for use of 'footage and personal material', according to Vanity Fair. Interest: Hannah with her father Brett Anderson. The 16-year-old's kidnap caught the nation's attention . Hannah's public accounts of her abduction have been the focus of intense public scrutiny. The teenager was drugged and zip tied by DiMaggio, and spent a week in the wilderness with him after he killed her mother and eight-year-old brother Ethan, and set fire to the house they were in on August 4. Her version of events have been described as suspicious by some people, including criminal profiler Chelsea Hoffman who has already released a book about the abduction called The River of No Return: On the Trail of Hannah Anderson and Jim DiMaggio.","NBC in talks with family to create show about 16-year-old's ordeal .

"By . Louise Atkinson . The routine is one that millions of women will recognise; you step out of the shower, dry yourself with a towel, then blast your armpits with a spray of super-strong, all-action, perfume-steeped, heavily marketed anti-perspirant deodorant. Leaving the house without it would be akin to stepping outside naked. Au Naturel: Heather Edwards prefers to sweat as nature intended . But not Heather Edwards. This 47-year-old beauty therapist from Oxfordshire hasn’t worn deodorant for seven years. Her armpits are washed and shaved and treated to a light dousing with essential oils, but that is it. She prefers to sweat as nature intended. And before anyone assumes Heather reeks, she is quick to point out that she hasn’t had a single complaint in all the years she has avoided the chemicals. Heather, who runs her own salon, is among a growing number of people who dare to leave their armpits unsprayed. Actress Cameron Diaz said last month she hasn’t worn anti- perspirant for 20 years. Actors Matthew McConaughey and Bradley Cooper claim never to spray their underarms. Cooper says the body ‘self-cleans’, relying on showers, sometimes several times a day, to keep him fresh and odour-free. Diaz told her interviewer: ‘Anti-perspirant is really bad for you. Let it go and just trim your armpit hair so it doesn’t hold on to the scent. You’re stinky because you use anti-perspirant. It keeps all the stink in.’ Heather decided to change her lifestyle when her husband Stuart coughed and spluttered as she sprayed the heavily scented fumes one morning. ‘It occurred to me that applying a thick layer of chemicals to my body every morning might be something I should — and could — avoid,’ she says. In recent years, some scientists have raised concerns about some underarm products. They fear that chemicals called parabens and aluminium residues that block the pores to reduce sweating could be absorbed through the delicate skin under the arm — particularly after shaving the area — and trigger cancerous changes in breast tissue. The anti-spray crew: Actress Cameron Diaz hasn't worn anti-perspirant for 20 years, and actor Bradley Cooper has vowed never to spray his underarms . While cancer charities are adamant there’s no strong evidence that either deodorants or anti-perspirants increase the risk of breast cancer, women are concerned. ‘I thought it can’t be healthy to have all those chemicals so close to sensitive breast tissue. I really hated the idea of clogging my pores with artificial gunk,’ says Heather. ‘It wasn’t easy giving up deodorant. My job means I can get quite hot at times, and I can’t afford for my clients to think I smell. ‘I did notice I was slightly sweatier under the arms at first, but I was really fastidious about keeping my armpits clean and hair-free. The UK's deodorant and body spray market is valued at £459 million . ‘As far as I could tell, I didn’t smell and so far I’ve not had any complaints.’ At first, Heather used a crystal deodorant stick (around £5 in health stores), which you wet and apply. Fans claim the crystal residues and natural mineral salts inhibit growth of smell-inducing bacteria. She then switched to an essential oil spray from Neal’s Yard Remedies (£8), which does not contain aluminium or preservatives, but claims to keep levels of  pong-causing bacteria down. ‘It smells divine and I’m confident it works with my body, not against it,’ she says. Cameron Diaz’s theory about anti-perspirant being the cause of body odour may not be backed by science, but it is true that human sweat isn’t inherently smelly — it is almost odourless. Any bad smell comes as bacteria break down proteins in the sweat into smaller molecules of acid. We have sweat glands all over our body (2.6 million of them), but sweat that smells is produced only by certain glands (apocrine glands) in the groin, armpits, lip and scalp, and develop at puberty. Feeling cool: Despite getting hot at work, Heather didn't smell . Dr Marie-Helene Marion, a consultant neurologist and sweat expert at St George’s Hospital in London, explains there are two chemical processes at work in most products. Deodorants, which spread a layer of antibacterial chemicals on the skin to inhibit the bacterial action, and anti- perspirants, which contain chemicals — usually aluminium salts — to reduce sweating by blocking sweat ducts. But some people might not need to use anti-perspirant at all. Research studies have shown as many as one in 50 people could carry a mutated gene that means their armpits simply don’t smell. People with the gene (called ABCC11) are missing a certain chemical in their armpits that odour-causing bacteria feed on. The only way to know you’ve got the no-smell gene is to check your ear wax. If it’s dry, white and flaky rather than the normal dark and sticky, you might be an ABCC11 carrier. Or YOU could always just stop using your anti-perspirant and see what happens. Sarah Newson, 36, from Northumberland, did. The mother of two stopped buying underarm products five years ago. ‘I was doing a lot of exercise — running and gym classes,’ she says. ‘I didn’t always remember to take my anti-perspirant to the gym and as the weeks went by it seemed superfluous anyway, as I was only ever a few hours away from my next session and my next shower.’ When she started a family, she found she didn’t need to use anti-perspirant at all. ‘I can be more relaxed because I’m at home with the children, not in an office where I might have to worry about whether or not I smell, but I’m pretty sure I don’t smell,’ she says. Whether most of us are brave enough to put the theory to the test is another matter.","Cameron Diaz hasn't worn anti-perspirant for 20 years .

"By . Wills Robinson . A record number of starfish are dying as a result of a disease which wastes away their arms and turns them into 'goo'. The sea creatures are falling victim to the mystery condition which causes white lesions to grow along their limbs, before they disintegrate. It has wiped out 95 per cent of the animals in some tide pools along the West Coast of America and scientists are struggling to find a way to stop the spike in deaths, because they do not know what is causing the deadly epidemic. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Wasting disease: The star fish's arms disintegrate after white lesions have spread over their limbs . In August, marine biologist Jonathan Martin noticed dead starfish, which looked like their arms had been chopped off, while he was scuba-diving. He swam along the water bed, analysing the disintegrated sea stars, before filming their wasting bodies and posting the video on Facebook. Dead starfish, with missing arms, have since turned up along the coast of the United States from Alaska down to Southern California, and scientists believe sea creatures as far south as Mexico could be at risk. Pete Raimondi, chairman of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, told CBS News: 'What's happening? We don't know yet. We think it's bacterial. 'We also know that it can move between species. They get a wound and the bacteria will just kind of eat the species away.' In the past, researchers have linked sea star wasting disease outbreaks to rising ocean temperatures. Decapitated: The condition causes the sea creatures to look as though their limbs have been chopped off . The largest number of deaths occurred along the coast of Southern California from 1983-1984, during an El Nino year, where the temperature of the Pacific Ocean increases. 'We're not having an El Nino year this year. That's what's really troublesome about this,' Raimondi added. Until researchers can properly map the outbreak, Mr Raimondi added, it will be difficult to determine the cause, or an underlying link between the regional outbreaks. So far, the disease has killed 95 . percent of certain species in some tide pools. The overall population . numbers in the millions, but Mr Ramondi said it was troubling to see such a . large percentage die off in an individual tide pool. Expansion: There has been an infestation of jellyfish in oceans around the world causing an increase in the number of people being stung on holiday . As sea stars die out, many ecosystems of other animals will also be affected with the population of . creatures like mussels expanding. Now marine biologists are trying to find out the root causes of the mystery disease, so researchers can start to determine how to control the outbreak. While star fish are decreasing in numbers, scientists around the world are reporting a boom in the number of jellyfish, resulting in more tourists being stung while on holiday. In Hawaii there it has been reported that between 800 or 1,000 people have been stung in a day, while in Spain or Florida, up to half a million people have been affected during a spike in the population. The massive increase in numbers has reportedly caused the deaths of thousands of farmed salmon in Ireland and caused a nuclear plant in Sweden to temporarily shut down. Dr. Lisa-Ann Gershwin, who has recently written a book on jellyfish blooms, told CNN the increasing activity was because of overfishing and changing water temperatures.","Condition makes sea creatures look like their limbs have been chopped off .

"By . Ted Thornhill . An American missionary jailed in North Korea for more than a year has appeared before cameras to make a dramatic appeal to the U.S. government to do its best to secure his release. Kenneth Bae made the comments at what he called a press conference held at his own request. He was under guard during the appearance. It is not unusual for prisoners in North Korea to say after their release that they spoke in similar situations under duress. Wearing a gray cap and inmate's uniform with the number 103 on his chest, Bae spoke in Korean during the brief appearance, which was attended by The Associated Press and a few other foreign media in Pyongyang. Scroll down for video . American missionary Kenneth Bae, right, leaves after speaking to reporters at Pyongyang Friendship Hospital in Pyongyang . Happier times: A 2011 family photo of Kenneth Bae . ‘I believe that my problem can be solved by close cooperation and agreement between the American government and the government of this country,’ he said. Bae, the longest-serving American detainee in North Korea in recent years, expressed hope that the U.S. government will do its best to secure his release. He said he has not been treated badly in confinement. Bae was arrested in November 2012 while leading a tour group and accused of crimes against the state before being sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. He was moved to a hospital last summer in poor health. His appearance came weeks after North Korea freed an elderly American veteran of the Korean War who had been held for weeks for alleged crimes during the 1950-53 war. State media said 85-year-old Merrill Newman was released because he apologized for his wrongdoing and that authorities also considered his age and medical conditions. Newman said after his release that a videotaped confession was given involuntarily and under duress, although he was generally treated well. North Korea has detained at least seven Americans since 2009. They were eventually deported or released without serving out their terms, some after prominent Americans such as former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter traveled to Pyongyang. A senior U.S. envoy had planned to visit North Korea in late August to discuss Bae's release, but Pyongyang withdrew its invitation at the last minute, accusing the United States of hostility. Analysts said North Korea was apparently trying to gain leverage in a long-running international standoff over its nuclear weapons program. ‘We shouldn't take Kenneth Bae's comments merely as his own,’ said Kim Jin Moo, a North Korea expert at the state-run Korea Institute for Defense Analyses in Seoul. ‘The reason why North Korea had Kenneth Bae make this statement ... is that they want Washington to reach out to them.’ ‘Bae's comments are an appeal to Washington to actively persuade Pyongyang to release him,’ Kim said. Bae was arrested in November 2012 while leading a tour group and accused of crimes against the state . Other foreign analysts say North Korea wants better ties with Seoul and Washington as a way to win foreign aid and investment to boost its struggling economy. Earlier this month, Bae's detention was in the news after former basketball star Dennis Rodman traveled to Pyongyang with other retired NBA players for an exhibition game marking the birthday of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. In an interview with CNN while in Pyongyang, Rodman made comments implying Bae was at fault. Rodman, who has been criticized for not using his ties with Kim to help secure Bae's freedom, later apologized. He claimed alcohol was one of the reasons for his bizarre outburst about his fellow American citizen. The controversial former basketball player is now staying at a treatment centre in New Jersey to try and curb his long-standing addiction to alcohol. A source told TMZ he entered the facility a few days ago after returning from his much criticized trip to the insular communist country. The insider added the former Chicago Bulls star is 'beyond exhausted and overwhelmed' and will receive care for 30 days. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (center), next to his wife Ri Sol-ju (left), talking to Dennis Rodman (right), while watching a basketball game between North Korean players and former NBA players at Pyongyang Indoor Stadium. Rodman has come under fire for suggesting Bae's plight in the communist state was his own fault . Bae was born in South Korea and immigrated to the United States in 1985 with his parents and sister. He was allowed to call home on December 29 because of the holidays, according to his sister, Terri Chung. That was the first time his three children from an earlier marriage had spoken to him, she said. He has two children in Arizona and another in Hawaii, ages 17, 22 and 23, Chung said. Before his arrest, Bae lived in China for seven years with his wife and stepdaughter. He ran a tour business and led 18 trips to North Korea, Chung said.","Kenneth Bae was arrested in November 2012 while leading a tour group .

A leading German think-tank has warned that a . euro exit by Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy would cost the world £14trillion and trigger the worst recession ever known. Given . that the UK's national debt is £1.4trillion, the size of the cut in . global GDP is truly colossal and would create suffering on a scale never . before seen. A Greek euro exit alone would be manageable, but . must be avoided to forestall a domino effect, said Economic research . group Prognos in a study commissioned by the Bertelsmann Foundation. The . researchers didn't just calculate the losses of creditors who had lent . money to the crisis-hit nations, they included the likely impact of a . euro collapse on economic growth in the 42 most important industrial and . emerging economies constituting 90 per cent of the global economy. 'In . their overall assessment, the authors of the study come to the . conclusion that an isolated exit of Greece and an insolvency of this . euro-zone country might well be something that the EU could cope with . from a merely economic point of view,' the Bertelsmann Foundation said. 'At . the same time, however, it is extremely difficult to assess if and to . what extent this might trigger a wave of further euro-zone exits in . Europe's south. 'If so, the implications for the global economy could be . devastating.' The country is clinging to solvency with the help of two massive international bailouts worth a total 240billion euros. To secure them, it committed to drastic spending cuts, tax hikes and reforms, aimed to cure years of profligate government spending. But while significantly reducing budget deficits, the measures accelerated a recession that after five years is closer to a depression. The protests in Greece come as German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for stronger central powers to intervene when EU member states break budget rules. Speaking ahead of a summit at Brussels, she rebuffed demands for the quick creation of a pan-European bank supervisor. In a speech to the lower house of parliament, Mrs Merkel put herself on a collision course with French Socialist President Francois Hollande and others, who are reluctant to cede sovereignty over fiscal policy and want the European Central Bank (ECB) to get new watchdog powers by the end of the year. Voicing support Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble's idea of a European 'currency commissioner', she said: 'We are of the opinion - and I speak for the whole German government on this - that we could go a step further by giving Europe real rights of intervention in national budgets.' On banking supervision, she said . quality must come before speed, reiterating her view that rushing to . meet a January 2013 target date for giving the ECB new powers was a . recipe for disaster. Mrs Merkel also made clear that . funnelling aid directly to European banks from the bloc's new rescue . mechanism, the ESM, could not happen until the new supervisory body was . fully operational. The urgency of the situation is clear . - by the end of next year, the Greek economy is expected to have shrunk . by about a quarter from 2008 levels. And with one in four workers out . of a job, Greece has the worst unemployment rate in the 27-nation . European Union.

Mrs Merkel today called for stronger central powers to intervene when EU member states break budget rules . China's . economic growth tumbled to the lowest in more than three years in the . latest quarter, but retail sales and investment improved in a possible . sign a painful slump might be stabilising. The world's . second-largest economy grew 7.4 per cent in the three months ending in . September, data showed today. That was down from the previous . quarter's 7.6 per cent and the lowest since the first quarter of 2009. Retail . sales rose 14.4 per cent, a small acceleration over the first half of . the year, and investment in industrial assets and some other indicators . also showed small improvements. Sheng . Laiyun, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said: 'Judging from the third quarter . figures, we can see a clear sign of steady economic growth. 'There is a smaller margin of decline and some major . indicators have been growing faster.' Analysts expect China's . economic growth to rebound late this year or early next year but say a . recovery is likely to be too weak to drive global growth without . improvement in the U.S. and Europe. 'In general, we're going from bad to worse,' said 85-year-old pensioner Giorgos Ierodimos. 'Salaries are being reduced, pensions are being reduced, everything is getting more expensive, from food to health care to hospitals, medicines, everything. So how will people live? How will we live?' The country's four-month-old coalition government is negotiating a new austerity package with debt inspectors from the EU, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Central Bank (ECB). The idea is to save 11billion euros in spending - largely on pensions and health care - and raise an extra 2.5billion euros through taxes. After more than a month-and-a-half of arguing, a deal seems close. On Wednesday, the EU, IMF and ECB troika said there was agreement on 'most of the core measures needed to restore the momentum of reform' and that the rest of the issues should be resolved in coming days. Athens hopes to get the next loan installment around mid-November, shortly after which it will run out of cash. That would probably force Greece to default on its mountain of debt and potentially abandon the 17-strong eurozone. Unions say the cost of securing the money is too high. Ilias Iliopoulos, secretary-general of the ADEDY civil servant union, said: 'What people can shoulder new measures, when approximately 70 per cent of it is caught between poverty and destitution? It is absolutely impossible. 'On the noteworthy day of the summit in Brussels, we want to tell the leaders of the European Union ""That's enough. We can't take any more."" 'This is not worthy of Europe. It is a policy of exploitation, of profiteers and loan sharks.'","Anti-austerity protests turn violent again as masked anarchists fight police .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Pricey and prickly: Fashionable African pygmy hedgehogs can cost up to £200 . Worried animal charities are being swamped by African pygmy hedgehogs that have been abandoned by their owners. The fashionable pets cost up to £200 and owners often post photographs on social media sites Instagram or Twitter of them peeking out of the top of handbags. But the RSPCA and hedgehog rescue centres say they are being inundated after owners tire of the breed’s ‘cuteness’. They blame websites for fuelling a rise in sales, and say people do not know enough about how to care for the animals before they buy them. Some creatures have been handed in with their spikes missing after being infested with mites. Charities are now demanding a ban on the sale of live animals online. Philip Mansbridge, chief executive of the charity Care For The Wild, pointed the finger at social media sites and said: ‘People are being led on by the cuteness factor and the status of having something they can post pictures of.’ Since 2013, the National Exotic Hedgehog Rescue Service has taken in 89 discarded pygmies, which are a cross between the Algerian and white-bellied breeds. They are bred in captivity and are smaller than those found in the countryside.","African pygmy hedgehogs are being ditched by bored owners .

"By . Jack Doyle . Assistant Chief Constable Jon Boutcher, pictured, said he was convinced that 'crime isn't down' and had instead shifted online . The much-heralded falls in crime over the past decade may not be real, a senior officer has admitted. Assistant Chief Constable Jon Boutcher, the national policing spokesman on surveillance, said he was convinced that ‘crime isn’t down’ and had instead shifted online. He said criminals were simply carrying out different offences that were not being combated by police forces. He also made a damning assessment of the police’s ability to tackle cyber-crime, such as internet card fraud and online scams. Mr Boutcher said: ‘Everyone tells me crime is down and we are very good in the police at the moment. ‘I am convinced that crime isn’t down – it is just being done in a  completely different way.’ The Hertfordshire officer added that the police force had been slow to formulate strategies to combat cyber-crime, with the College of Policing, the professional body for law enforcement, issuing guidelines only this year. Official statistics show that overall crime has more than halved in the past 20 years – from 19million in 1995 to eight million offences in the year to September 2013. It is the lowest estimate since records began. Experts praised Mr Boutcher, who  made his comments at a security and policing conference, for his admission, and warned of a growing ‘complacency’ around crime. The Assistant Chief Constable said police had been slow to formulate strategies to combat cyber crime - with the College of Policing only issuing guidelines last year (library image) Peter Cuthbertson, director of the . Centre for Crime Prevention said: ‘This is a brave admission. There is a . continuing danger of complacency about crime in general and online . crime especially. ‘Police . need to move faster in tackling online crime. It is a growing problem . that requires expertise and persistence from police and tough sentencing . from the courts.’ The most recent falls in crime have come despite spending on police budgets being slashed. It means that since its peak in 2009, the number of officers has fallen by nearly 16,000 to just over 128,000. Experts say online fraud often goes unreported, as do other cyber-offences that did not exist a decade ago. A new national fraud centre has reported a 60 per cent increase in fraud offences since March 2008. But with the huge increases, criminologists say today’s figures were likely to underestimate the true scale of the problem. Nigel Williams, a statistician at the Civitas think-tank, said earlier this year: ‘For all the reporting improvements, everyone involved in deleting endless junk emails or scanning statements for unfamiliar transactions is aware of the long, forked tail of attempted and undiscovered fraud.’","Assistant Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said crime is not falling .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Queens-based graffiti artist was found dead on the tracks of a Brooklyn subway station this week after being electrocuted by the third rail. Jason Wulf, 42, may have been 'tagging', or writing one's name in a stylized way, before he died, according to a friend. Wulf was found just before 10pm on Wednesday at the 25th Street Station in Sunset Park. He was reportedly alone when police arrived. MTA said it is investigating his death. Jason Wulf, pictured here with his fiancee, was found on Wednesday dead on the train tracks at a Brooklyn subway station . Jason Wulf was a prominent graffiti artiest based in Queens. This picture is of one of his works spray painted on a New York subway car . The picture shows Wulf's 'tag', or personal signature and style - 'DG' - on a train car, most likely in New York . Wulf may have been on his way from Brooklyn home to Queens, where he lived with his fiancée and their dog, the New York Post reported. Friends of Wulf have been paying homage to the graffiti artist by spray painting his tag initials - 'DG' - in the subway station on the R line where he died, the paper said. Police officers were dispatched to the station to keep the taggers away, driving well wishers to pay their respects on other stations and on mailboxes. It's unclear what Jason Wulf, shown here in an undated photo on Instagram, was doing before he died, but a friend said he was likely 'tagging' Friends rapidly raised $10,000 from 92 people at giveforward.com to pay for his funeral. A wake will be held at Seneca Chapels followed by a funeral service at St Matthias Church in Ridgewood, Queens, on Monday. His casket will be white so that it can be covered in graffiti. Wulf has been painting subway cars and buildings since 1985 and the founder of 'New Wave Crew.'. 'His tags, his throw ups, his fill-ins, his pieces, his canvasses - were all dope,' Bucky Turco wrote on animalnewyork.com. 'His canvasses were technically on par with those found in the world’s most prestigious art institutions.' A friend of Wulf's, June Lang, 37, of Maspeth, Queens, called his death 'very sad.' 'It’s devastating,' Lang said. 'He had a talent that nobody had. It was more than tagging to him. It was an art. It was beautiful. He would do side walls for businesses. He didn’t just do the trains; he did everything.' Beloved by friends, Wulf and his artistry also got him in trouble with the law. A police source said he had been arrested 13 times since 2008, including this past February for criminal mischief, graffiti and trespassing, the Post reported.

However, it's not clear whether they are genuine monks or imposters out to make a quick buck. According to the New York Times, a number of Buddhists have confronted the men with questions about the religion but they simply walk away. The NYPD have stepped in on occasion when the monks have become aggressive, the Times reports. At least nine people claiming to be monks have been arrested this year on charges of aggressive begging or unlicensed vending. According to the Times, they offer the tourist the amulet and perhaps a bracelet but if the donation isn't enough, they'll angrily demand $20 or more.

They've now become so prolific that they've inspired a Fake Monks in New York City Facebook page to record their movements. The Times followed one apparent monk as he left Times Square at the end of a day's soliciting and walked into a public rest room where he got changed into street clothes and then went to share a jug of red wine with a friend. While begging is an accepted ritual in the Buddhist faith, doing so aggressively is unheard of as is selling amulets or bracelets.","At least nine people claiming to be monks have been arrested this year in New York on charges of aggressive begging or unlicensed vending .

"By . Duncan Gardham . A British jihadi who went to  Syria plotted to launch a major terrorist atrocity after returning to the UK, The Mail on Sunday can reveal today. The Muslim fanatic is suspected of planning a murderous gun and bomb attack in London on the orders of a terrorist ‘mastermind’ he met while in the Middle East. Security sources claim it could have been the most serious terrorist strike since the bombings in London on July 7, 2005, which killed 52 people and injured hundreds more. However, the plot was foiled and the man was detained at gunpoint in the capital. Capital at risk: The unnamed man's planned attack could have been the most serious terrorist strike since the bombings in London on July 7, 2005, sources say . The news comes as security at British airports is being stepped up amid claims that terrorists are intent on smuggling bombs that cannot be detected by scanners on to aircraft travelling between the UK and the United States. The explosives, which have no metals parts, could be concealed in clothes, and the technology is already thought to have reached Britons fighting in Syria and Iraq. A number of British jihadis have also posted chilling messages online promising to use their ‘terror skills’ if they make it back to Britain. Others say they will return only once the black flag of Islam is flying over Downing Street. David Cameron has warned that British jihadis coming back to the UK after fighting in Syria and Iraq are ‘the most serious threat to Britain’s security there is today’. Now The Mail on Sunday has learned at least one such plot has already been detected and foiled. A security source said: ‘This could have been the most serious case since 7/7 if we had not stopped it. It perfectly illustrates the fears we have had about Syria for some time.’ Tension: Security at British airports is being stepped up amid claims that terrorists are intent on smuggling bombs that cannot be detected by scanners . Investigators believe that after the suspect travelled from the UK to Syria, he met a shadowy Islamist mastermind with designs on attacking the West, who encouraged him to plan an atrocity. Security Service officials suspect that he returned to London with substantial amounts of cash and set about using it to buy weapons and bomb-making equipment. He remained in contact with his controller in Syria – a terrorist  kingpin thought to have established links to other would-be terrorists in Britain and Europe. The suspect joined up with another extremist, and security officials were sufficiently concerned by intelligence that they launched an emergency operation to arrest them in London at gunpoint. Further details of the investigation cannot be disclosed at this time, but MI5 is understood to believe it stopped an important attack, illustrating the dangers posed by the  anarchy in Syria and Iraq. Although it has not been publicly acknowledged, The Mail on Sunday understands the Prime Minister was briefed on the plot by the security services before making his comments to the Commons last month. Mr Cameron was responding to the recent fighting by the Al Qaeda-inspired terror group Isis, which is active in Syria and Iraq. ‘As well as trying to take territory, . Isis is  planning to attack in the UK,’ he said. Sir Peter Fahy, in . charge of counter-terrorism strategy for the Association of Chief Police . Officers, has said that 500 Britons have travelled to Syria and Iraq – a . higher estimate than the 400 claimed by Foreign Secretary William . Hague. Security officials estimate that about two-thirds of those have already returned. Conflict: Reyaad Khan, left, Nasser Muthana, centre, and Abdul Raqib Amin in the recruitment video for Isis . Last month three Britons appeared in an Isis video aiming to recruit more extremists to join the escalating bloodshed in Syria and Iraq. Those featured were Reyaad Khan, 20, medical student Nasser Muthana, 20, both from Cardiff, and Abdul Raqib Amin, from Aberdeen. Muthana’s brother Aseel, 17, is also  in Syria, and has spoken of his willingness to die for his cause. Experts have long feared the consequences of a ‘blowback’ attack when jihadis – radicalised and trained abroad – return to the UK to commit attacks. Dozens of Britons are thought to have died fighting in a three-way civil war between radical Islamist groups such as Isis, the more moderate Free Syrian Army, and President Assad’s government forces. An increasing number of young Britons have been arrested upon their return from Syria and accused of preparing acts of terrorism or receiving terrorist training. Experts say Syria has become a ‘cauldron that is drawing in foreign fighters at a unparalleled rate’. But today is the first time a direct threat to attack UK targets can be disclosed. Raffaello Pantucci, of security think-tank the Royal United Services Institute, said: ‘Every other battlefield that has drawn British or other foreign fighters in like this has created a subsequent terrorist problem back home. ‘It was only a matter of time before we started to see plots coming back from Syria. The key question has been to what degree these have been directed from the battlefield by groups such as Isis.’ Britain is not the only country threatened by blowback attacks. Last month, Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, who returned from Syria to Belgium, was arrested, suspected of having killed three people in a shooting at Brussels’ Jewish Museum. The Government is planning to introduce new measures to prosecute those who plan and train for terrorism abroad. Lord Carlile, the Government’s former counter- terrorism adviser, said revelations of the London plot made the case for the reintroduction of control orders more pressing.","Unnamed British man suspected of planning attack on London .

"The tragic tale of how the First World War's last victim died from his wounds 47 years after his brother was killed in the same conflict, it has emerged. Jack and Walter Satterthwaite fought alongside one another on the Western Front until Jack was shot and killed in battle in April 1916. His older brother Walter carried on in the trenches but was invalided out of the army after being severely wounded in the right leg a year later. Walter Satterthwaite, left, was World War One's final victim after he died of blood loss following surgery to amputate his crippled leg in 1963. His brother, Jack, right was shot dead on the Western Front in April 1916 . Brian Satterthwaite has loaned his grand father Walter's medals to an exhibition on the First World War . Jack Satterthwaite, circled, left Letchworth station in Hertfordshire for France with the Territorials before his older brother Walter joined up . Although his limb was rendered permanently immobile he recovered to lead a normal life until he went into hospital due to increasing pain from his wartime wound. He underwent surgery to amputate his left leg but died from severe blood loss and became the last casualty of the Great War. His grandson, Brian Satterthwaite, has cherished a box of medals and photographs relating to the two brothers for years. He has now made them available for an exhibition due to be held to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of the war in August. Organisers of the event have digitally colourised one of the photos which show Sergeant Jack Satterthwaite and his platoon setting off for war at Letchworth train station, Hertfordshire. The remarkable image shows the 20 men in their green uniforms holding their rifles on a sunny summer's day. Jack Satterthwaite was killed in action in April 1916 and buried in France. His brother Walter was wounded the following year and invalided out of the army . Dan Hill, who is behind the Herts at War exhibition, said: 'Sadly, a family losing two sons in the war was not altogether uncommon. 'But the ordeal that the Satterthwaites endured at the time and the impact of the Great War so many years after the event serve to highlight the legacy of the conflict. 'With the centenary of the Great War fast approaching we are proud to share this story and feel that every previously unknown story that is told is a success for those who believe in the importance of remembrance and the preservation of our wartime history.' Jack, who was born in 1891, worked for a printers and joined the local Territorial Army before the outbreak of war in 1914. He was found to be a highly capable soldier, promoted to platoon sergeant and led men from his home town of Letchworth in the Hertfordshire Regiment in France. One of his duties was to regularly write home to thank the residents of Letchworth for sending the men gifts. Then in November 1915 older brother Walter joined his comrades on the Western Front and Jack found himself in command of his sibling. On April 17, 1916 Jack was shot in the chest during fighting at Festubert in north west France and died of his wounds in hospital five days later aged 25. His devastated parents, James and Alice, lived in daily fear for their other son Walter who remained fighting in France. He won the Military Medal for bravery in the field before he was severely wounded in the right knee in 1917. After leaving the army he was given a specially adapted motorised bicycle that allowed him to travel around, albeit with his immobile leg stretched out in front of him. Brian Satterthwaite said he gave the medals to the exhibition because he wanted to 'help others learn about the Great War' Jack Satterthwaite, circled, led his platoon for almost two years until he was shot dead in France in April 1916 . Tragically, 47 years after receiving the wound, Walter had to have it amputated, a procedure that led to his in 1963 aged 75. His grandson Brian said: 'My grandfather never really spoke about the war or his brother, who died in France. 'My great uncle's death must have been very hard for the family but their view was ""what's done is done"". It was a very different time back then. 'He was very well known in the Letchworth area because of this bicycle he had and people used to say ""there's a war hero going by"". 'Because I was the oldest son, my family gave me my grandfathers' medals and also the medals of my great uncle. 'I have kept them all in a box in the wardrobe. If anything happened to me the medals would probably be sold off. 'I wanted the collection to go somewhere it could do some good and help others learn about the Great War which is why I have given them to the exhibition.'","Walter Satterthwaite joined his brother Jack on the Western Front in 1915 .

Credit: Sanchez's Chile may have lost on penalties to Brazil and exited the World Cup, but his performances in the tournament only enhanced his value . STADIUM . Arsenal may have the more futuristic home these days but most observers would accept Anfield remains the most febrile stadium in English football, reserving that unrivalled din for the special occasions, even if it is not what it once was on a weekly basis. The sign in the tunnel tells the players ‘This Is Anfield’ but on those special European nights, they need no reminder, as the pillars and rafters of this famous stadium shake and the songs, chants and banners cascade down from all sides. Long overdue development plans are set to take place in the near future to expand the stadium towards a 60,000 all-seater capacity. In the corporate complex that is the Emirates Stadium, you can often be left feeling impressed by the infrastructure but cold by the atmosphere and it may continue to be that way as long as prices remain high, altering the demographic and cutting off the supply to the every-day football fan.

Champions of England: Arsene Wenger and Tony Adams show off the Premier League trophy in 1998 . MANAGER . Despite the nine-year trophy drought, Arsene Wenger retains an aura that will attract talent to the Emirates Stadium. Arsenal may have fallen behind their rivals but they maintained the aesthetic beauty that so characterised the performances of Wenger’s finest teams and this is recognised on the continent. Footballers know that they will invariably improve under the parental qualities of Wenger, who has three Premier League titles and FA Cups on his CV in English football. In Brendan Rodgers, however, Wenger has competition. The Northern Irishman has emerged as one of Europe’s brightest minds, working under Jose Mourinho, and altering the landscape of British football by transporting Catalonia into South Wales at Swansea before restoring Liverpool into a title-challenging force with tactical intelligence and motivational methods. This summer, as Rodgers is tasking with rebuilding his squad as Luis Suarez heads out of the exit door, will go some way to indicating the strength of his powers of persuasion, with high-end stars a necessity to replace the troublesome Uruguayan.

The Arsenal Twitter feed has just under 4million followers, compared to Liverpool attracting just 2.86m. Evidently, Arsenal’s global reach has been amplified by success in the 1990’s and the early part of the 2000’s, during the explosion of globalisation as the North London club tapped into the commercial opportunities available. Liverpool remain a huge attraction, particularly in the Middle East and Malaysia but Arsene Wenger’s Invincibles captured the imagination in the Far East, and the club eclipsed Manchester United as the most popular in China, according to surveys earlier this year. Arsenal’s domestic support may not compare to Liverpool’s more visceral, passionate following but the commercial incentives available to Sanchez may be greater if he is to be based in London.

As with all elite clubs these days, both Liverpool and Arsenal boast immaculate, top-of-the-range facilities, from gymnasiums and specifically designed synthetic pitches to swimming pools and high-end rehabilitation rooms. While Liverpool’s training base has been there since the days of Bill Shankly, Arsenal’s was only developed in the late 1990’s, on the specific request of Wenger, who was determined to elevate standards at Arsenal. Partially funded by the proceeds of Nicolas Anelka’s transfer to Real Madrid, Arsenal invested millions in a brand new plush training centre at London Colney, even being used by the England national team on several occasions.

Headquarters: Liverpool are put through their paces at Melwood . CHANCE OF SUCCESS . Liverpool are without a league title for 24 years, since the days when it was simply called Division One before the Premier League swept into town. Arsenal had gone nine years without a single trophy before their FA Cup success in May. The odds of silverware do not seem too favourable at either destination but both these clubs may feel that the last campaign could act as a kick-start for something special to take place. Nonetheless, with Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea all strengthening in the transfer market, it would represent a major surprise if either Liverpool or Arsenal emerged as title winners next season, while European success would appear to be some way off for both sides.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . More than 160 Iraqi criminals held in British jails are to be sent back to Baghdad. The government is on the verge of agreeing a deal for them to complete their sentences in their home country, despite the country being on the brink of civil war. The extraordinary plan is being pursued despite repeated attacks on jails in Iraq by insurgents in the Al-Qaeda inspired Islamic State uprising. The infamous Abu Ghraib prison, west of Baghdad, was shut in April amid fears it could be stormed by Sunni insurgents as part of the extremist uprising . A key aim of the Islamic State - also known as Isis - has been to free Sunni prisoners from government jails. On June 10 militants stormed Mosul and released as many as 1,000 prisoners from the city's prison. Days later, dozens of people were killed in fighting when the notorious Abu Ghraib prison and Taji prison, both in Baghdad, came under attack. As part of talks about a prison transfer deal, the British government has warned Iraqi government about the need to protect any Britons held in its jails if the situation deteriorates as a result of the militant uprising. David Cameron promised four years ago to take action to reduce the number of foreign nationals clogging up our jails. But little significant progress has been made in bringing the down the number, which stood at 10,130 at the end of last year. Volunteers have joined the Iraqi Army to fight against predominantly Sunni militants from the radical Islamic State group, responsible for storming jails across Iraq . The coalition has sought to strike deals with foreign governments to send criminals home to serve out their sentences. Since 2010 prisoner transfer agreements have been sealed with several countries, including Nigeria, Albania, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Ministers insist they are ‘determined’ to agree more, but rarely give details before they have been finalised. However, prisons minister Jeremy Wright has revealed talks with Iraq are close to a conclusion. Latest figures show that at the end of 2013 there were 163 Iraqi inmates in jails in England and Wales, of which 151 were Muslim. Mr Wright said: 'The negotiation of a prisoner transfer agreement between the United Kingdom and Iraq is at an advanced stage. ‘Officials at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office are in discussion with the Iraqi authorities and we hope to finalise the agreement at the earliest possible opportunity,' he said in response to a parliamentary question . ‘Once in place British nationals imprisoned in Iraq and Iraqi nationals imprisoned here, will be able to serve their sentences in their own country.’ But he acknowledged that the threat of violence and unrest in Iraq remains a concern in Whitehall. ‘Given the security situation in Iraq, we have reminded the Iraqi Government of its important duty of care for foreign nationals held in its prisons and have asked for urgent advice on their contingency planning,’ he said. The infamous Abu Ghraib jail west of Baghdad, scene of allegations of abuse by US soldiers in 2004, was handed over to Iraqi authorities in 2006. But last year there was a major prison break, in which some 500 inmates were said to have escaped, and in April the site - known as Baghdad Central Prison - was temporarily closed over fears it could be stormed by Sunni insurgents. At the end of 2013 there were 10,130 foreign nationals held in prisons in England and Wales, with most from Poland, Ireland, Jamaica and Pakistan . The threat posed by Islamic militants in ISIS, which has seized large areas of Iraq, will raise doubts about the authorities’ ability to guarantee the security of prisons, and the safety of inmates. But the UK government remains determined to bring down the number of foreign prisoners before the election. The prisoner transfer agreement with Albania was struck last year to 'free up space in prisons here and reduce the cost to the British taxpayer’. It was the first major bilateral prisoner transfer agreement with a country outside the European Union. There are 275 Albanian nationals in in prisons in England and Wales, including three women. The agreement with Nigeria was signed in January and the first transfers are expected by the end of the year. Latest figures show there are 414 Nigerian men and 55 women in prison here. Mr Wright added: ‘Whereas this Government has begun to reduce the foreign national population in prison since 2010, between 1997 and 2010, the number of foreign nationals in our prisons more than doubled.’","Negotiations between London and Baghdad 'at an advanced stage'

"By . Jason Groves . Labour has given its blessing to a walkout by thousands of teachers this week, despite warnings that it will ‘inflict real harm’ on children and their parents. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt refused three times yesterday to condemn the planned National Union of Teachers strike on Thursday, which is expected to bring chaos to thousands of schools. The strike is backed by Labour’s three biggest donors – the Unite, Unison and GMB unions – which are planning  co-ordinated walkouts. Tristram Hunt refused three times to condemn the planned National Union of Teachers strike on Thursday, which is expected to bring chaos to thousands of schools. Pictured: Defiant teachers marching last October . Mr Hunt faced criticism from the unions earlier this year for crossing a university picket line to deliver a lecture. But yesterday he refused to offer any support to teachers wishing to cross picket lines on Thursday to teach their pupils. Mr Hunt said the long-running dispute over pay and pensions was the result of a ‘political failure’. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the ‘incendiary language’ of Education Secretary Michael Gove was partly to blame for provoking  the walkout. And he repeatedly refused to condemn the strikes: ‘My message is that we have an independent system of trade unions. 'It’s not up to me to tell trade . unionists what to do.’ Mr Gove called on Mr Hunt to issue a ‘clear and . unambiguous’ statement urging teachers to work on Thursday. He said: ‘The thing that really . worried me is that he was not clear about the need for teachers to be in . the classroom and not striking on Thursday. ‘No teacher should be on strike – he should be encouraging teachers who want to work.’ The clash came as the Conservatives . revealed plans to force union bosses to re-ballot their members each . year during long-running disputes. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude . said it was unacceptable that the NUT is able to threaten chaos at . thousands of schools based on a ballot held almost two years ago. Tristram Mr Hunt faced criticism from the unions earlier this year for crossing a university picket line to deliver a lecture . The NUT mandate dates back to a ballot held between June and September 2012. Although strike action was backed by 82.5 per cent of those who voted, the turnout was just 27 per cent. The Tories are examining plans to require a minimum 50 per cent turnout threshold on ballots before a strike is deemed legal. Senior Conservatives have been pushing for the move for some time, but it has been blocked by Nick Clegg and will now form part of the next Tory manifesto. Mr Maude said the introduction of minimum turnout thresholds was now a ‘live issue’. He added: ‘We should also be looking at whether there should be some rule that a mandate falls after a certain time.’ Just 20 per cent of union members voted in some of the ballots. Mr Maude said it was ‘a sign of a great lack of self-confidence that [the NUT] aren’t willing to ask for a fresh mandate for action’. The move will infuriate trade unionists who claim existing strike laws already make ballots expensive and difficult to carry out.","Tristram Hunt refused three times to condemn planned strike on Thursday .

"By . Richard Spillett . and Neil Sears . A tycoon ordered by a judge to hand his ex-wife £2 million has failed to pay up, claiming she is jealous of his relationship with a Ukrainian 12 years his junior. Paul Grundy, 50, was said to have ‘recklessly’ splashed out a fortune on a playboy lifestyle and watched with ‘contempt’ as former wife Jennifer Francis, 48, ‘descends into poverty’. She claimed the businessman – who lives on Dubai’s luxurious Palm Island – has been driving a Lamborghini Gallardo and spending thousands at Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Harvey Nichols and Yves Saint Laurent, frittering away £60,000 on ‘luxury goods’ last year alone. Paul Grundy (left) has been ordered to pay his . wife Jennifer Francis (right) a £2million divorce settlement or face six . weeks in jail after the High Court heard he was living a lavish . lifestyle while she struggled financially . Mr Grundy has been told he will be jailed if he fails to pay his ex-wife, a former teacher, within three months. But last night he accused her of being bitter over his relationship with blonde Ukrainian Asya Riabko. The 38-year-old has started using his surname, but Mr Grundy said their wedding is on hold until he has resolved the dispute. ‘If . I want to spend £1,000 in Harvey Nichols I’m not going to ask her [Miss . Francis’s] permission,’ he said. ‘My Lamborghini was sold over 18 . months ago and I spend more than £40,000 a year on our son’s attendance . at the top private school in England, which Jenny put him into, and lots . of my shopping is for our son or Asya.’ The court heard Mr Grundy (right) lived a lavish lifestyle in Dubai, visiting racetracks and spending thousands in expensive boutiques after divorcing his wife of seven years . He said he suspected Miss . Francis’s claims about his ‘reckless’ spending were due to jealousy, adding: ‘I’m now engaged to a Ukrainian girl who’s 38 –  and Jenny . doesn’t like it. But she has not communicated with me directly for seven . years. ‘She’s already had more than £1.6 million out of me and it’s . impossible for me to get £2 million immediately because the business is . in dire straits. ‘She lives in a five-bedroom house while I’m living in a two-bedroom flat, although it is on Palm Island in Dubai … . ‘All . I want to so is settle this thing by getting time to pay the . money … the judge doesn’t seem to understand how business works in the . Middle East.’ Mr Grundy and his former wife met in the late 1990s and . lived in Pudsey, West Yorkshire. The couple moved to Dubai (pictured) and made huge amounts of money from Mr Grundy's fencing business. But the High Court has heard their fortunes varied wildly after they split in 2009 and divorced in 2012 . They married in 2002 and moved to Dubai, where he launched a lucrative business providing fencing for construction sites. The . couple bought a six-bedroom house with a swimming pool, a holiday home . in France and a luxury flat in Miami. They were divorced in 2009. According . to Miss Francis – a mother of two boys, one from a previous marriage – . she has since descended into poverty, renting accommodation in Oakhill, . Somerset, while her ex-husband has lived the high life. In 2012 Mr . Grundy was assessed as having £2.5 million available – and was told to . pay a £2 million lump sum and £300,000 in legal costs. He has failed to . do so, claiming he does not have the funds to hand. A judge at London's High Court has now ordered that Mr Grundy pay the divorce settlement or go to jail . But Miss .

"By . Liz Hull . Grace Dures, 14, was bitten in her shoulder during a school trip at Alton Towers theme park . Police are investigating after a girl of 14 was bitten in her shoulder in a Luis Suarez-style attack during a school trip. Grace Dures was left crying in pain, with blood pouring down her back, after being assaulted at the Alton Towers theme park, Staffordshire, last week. The youngster had been waiting for the park’s Nemesis Sub Terra ride to begin when she accidentally bumped into a middle-aged man. Although Grace apologised immediately, he started swearing and, when the lights dimmed for the ride, she felt him sink his teeth into her right shoulder. Grace, a pupil at Deyes High School, Maghull, Merseyside, broke down in tears and reported the assault to her teachers. They took her for treatment at the park’s medical centre before reporting it to management. Last night her father, Gary Dures, 45, said: ‘Grace has been left totally traumatised. ‘He has broken the skin and left a terrible bite mark on her shoulder. She was crying and there was blood pouring down her back. It’s really nasty and Grace has been left very upset and worried about it. ‘This whole thing about Luis Suarez has been in the papers and on everyone’s mind, it seems a bit of a coincidence that kids have started biting teachers in the playground and now this has happened to Grace. It’s just vicious and beyond me how an adult could do something like that to a child.’ The attack happened at around 4.30pm on Thursday as Grace and a friend waited for the Nemesis Sub Terra – one of the park’s newest rides – just before boarding the coach home. Many of Grace’s friends had gone on the log flume, but she and another friend had decided they did not want to be wet on the journey, so opted to go on Nemesis Sub Terra instead. The ride involves around 40 people being lowered into an underground cave with the unhatched egg of an alien creature. Actors usher riders into seats, which then free-fall 20ft. Grace Dures was bitten by the man while she queued for a ride at Alton Towers (pictured) in Staffordshire . Special effects and lighting then simulate the egg hatching and the creature attacking – much of which takes place in pitch darkness. Police last night said they would be reviewing CCTV footage from the park to see if they could identify Grace’s attacker. Mr Dures said he and his wife, Nicola, 40, were worried the bite could have left their daughter with a potentially harmful disease. The couple, who have four children, have already taken Grace to see her GP, but she will have to undergo months of tests before she knows if she is in the clear. ‘We’re trying not to worry Grace too much because she has been so stressed out about it,’ Mr Dures added. ‘But she’s been to the doctor and has got to have all sorts of tests for hepatitis and HIV. ‘We just want this man caught so we can make sure he’s not a druggie or anything. To be bitten by someone you don’t know is one of the dirtiest things. He left a really nasty bite mark on her shoulder. We’re just worried about the consequences.’ Uruguayan Luis Suarez was banned from football for four months after biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder during their World Cup match last month. Luis Suarez was found to have bitten Italy's Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder (left) during their World Cup game. Concerns have now been raised the striker's method of biting is being copied by others. It was the third time the Liverpool FC striker had bitten another player during a match and lead to widespread condemnation. Just hours later it was reported that a seven-year-old boy, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, had copied the Anfield idol by biting another pupil in the playground. Impressionable Harvey Eaglen told teachers at Poplars Primary Community School that “professional footballers do it”. Inspector Kevin Treacy, spokesman for Staffordshire police, confirmed the force had received a complaint and were investigating. ‘Officers will be reviewing CCTV evidence from the park to try and identify the offender,’ he added. He is described as a white male aged 30 to 40-years-old. Anyone with information should contact 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800555111, quoting incident 430.","Grace Dures left bleeding profusely and crying in pain after she was bitten .

"By . John Stevens And Alan Roden . Scottish pensioners gain nearly £500-a-year by Scotland remaining in the Union, a study has found. The report by Gordon Brown reveals that retired Scots receive a better share of pensions and benefits than the rest of the UK. The former Labour Prime Minister argues that Scotland gets £9.6billion in pensions and old-age benefits annually, which is £500million more than the amount it would get if money was divided on the size on of its population. A study by Gordon Brown has revealed that retired Scots receive a better share of pensions and benefits than the rest of the UK . His intervention comes as a separate report by MPs warns that Alex Salmond’s proposal for workers to retire earlier in Scotland than in the rest of the UK was ‘almost entirely uncosted’. The study by the Scottish Affairs committee also accuses the Nationalist administration of ‘failing to acknowledge the costs and complexities of disentangling Scottish claimants from the UK welfare system’, and failing to explain how it would pay for shortfalls in public sector pension schemes. It will brand the SNP’s pensions policy as the ‘biggest mis-selling scandal in history’. Mr Salmond and his ministers have vowed to consider raising the state retirement age to 66 in a separate Scotland, rather than 67 as planned by the UK Government, because a lower life expectancy means pensioners receive between £10,000 and £11,000 less on average. Westminster has previously calculated that by 2030 the cost of such a policy would be as much as £800million-a-year with as many as 30,000 fewer people in work. Alex Salmond wants Scots to retire at 66 because they have a lower life expectancy than those in the rest of the UK . SNP ministers have also promised a state pension rise linked to whichever is highest - average wages, inflation, or 2.5 per cent. This so-called ‘triple lock’ will cost no more than the UK Government’s commitment to increase the state pension in line with earnings, they claim. But calculations by a major accountancy firms found that adopting the policy in an independent Scotland would cost £148million in 2019, rising to £272million in 2025. Scotland’s pensioner population is expected to rise from 1.04million in 2010 to 1.49million in 2066. But the working age population is only expected to increase from 3.3million to 3.6million. That will create a ‘dependency ratio’ of 2.41 workers for every pensioner, compared to 2.64 in other parts of the UK. Mr Salmond’s proposed solution is to lift restrictions on non-EU immigration if he wins the referendum, with net migration levels of 24,000-a-year – equivalent to a city the size of Edinburgh in around 20 years. But the committee’s report states: ‘Migration requires careful management, especially for its effects on public services, such as schools. Even the highest estimates of likely additional migration which we have seen… would be very challenging indeed to manage; and yet these levels are still not enough to address the affordability problems in relation to old age pensions which are thrown up by separation.’","Retired Scots receive a better share of pensions and benefits than the rest of the UK .

"By . Natalie Trombetta . and Alanah Eriksen . Updated: . 09:44 EST, 31 December 2011 . Russell Brand has said that he still 'adores' his wife Katy Perry despite filing for divorce from her yesterday after just 14 months of marriage. In a sentimental statement he informed that the couple were ending their marriage, but said he hoped that they would remain friends. It came as the 36-year-old comedian stepped out looking downcast without his wedding ring on in London yesterday. It's over: Russell Brand, pictured yesterday in London without his wedding ring, has filed for divorce from his wife Katy Perry . 'Irreconcilable differences': The 36-year-old visited a friend in North London while his legal team filed court documents in Los Angeles . Brand said in his . statement: 'Sadly, Katy and I are ending our marriage. I'll always . adore her and I know we'll remain friends.' His legal team filed court documents at the Superior Court in Los Angeles yesterday citing 'irreconcilable differences.' The divorce documents, which refer to . Perry by her give name Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson, show there are . 'community property assets,' suggesting there may not be a pre-nuptial . agreement in place. It does not list a date of separation. Signs of trouble: Katy Perry spent Christmas in Hawaii where she was pictured swimming in the sea . Holidays: Meanwhile, Russell Brand was across the Atlantic on Christmas Day where he was pictured here with charity swimmers on Coverack Beach in Cornwall . Perry is yet to comment on the split . and there is some speculation she was blind-sided by Brand's official . move to end their marriage. It has also been said that Brand didn't approve of her partying lifestyle and new claims suggest that he told her to 'tone it down'. The recovered drug and sex addict is said to have disapproved strongly . of her benders – such as a long day-into-night party in Rio earlier this . year. He also never apparently liked her . friends such as the fun-loving singer Rihanna. The pair sparked rumours of trouble . after celebrating Christmas 7,000 miles apart - he spent the festive day . in Cornwall while the Teenage Dream singer, 27, was with friends in . Hawaii. Official: The legal document refers to the singer by her given name, Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson . Perry was not wearing her wedding ring either when she was photographed frolicking in the surf on December 25. Last public appearance: The pair attended a benefit for the David Lynch Foundation in Los Angeles on December 3 . The couple's split comes just four weeks after Brand declared his relationship was going strong. He told Ellen DeGeneres on December 2: 'I'm really happily . married. I’m married to Katy. Perpetually, until death do us part was . the pledge. I’m still alive.' In November, Perry told the same TV host that that she 'would love to have children' with Brand. She . said: 'I think that's one of the reasons you get married, especially to . the person that you marry. You think: ""That person is going to be a . good partner, a good parent.''' Asked if she wanted a big family, Perry added: 'If it doesn't hurt the first time I'll keep popping them out.' But there was clearly trouble brewing when the pair decided to spend Christmas apart, allegedly after a huge row. A source was quoted as telling Us Weekly magazine: 'They had a massive fight. She was like, ""F*** you. I'm going to do my own thing."" Meanwhile the insider said that Russell replied: 'Fine, f*** you too.' The . couple had planned Christmas together and Perry was expected to jet her family in a private plane over to the UK to . celebrate. In November, Brand's mother Barbara . had tweeted she was looking forward to spending the festive season with . her son and daughter-in-law. She wrote on Twitter: 'Spoke to Russell and Katy, they are so happy, it's lovely. We will all be together for Christmas.' The California-born star began dating . the British comedian in 2009 after she famously threw a bottle at his . head at an MTV Music Awards party. He proposed just four months later on New Year's Eve and they were married in October last year. Lavish wedding: Katy flashed up pictures from her big day  while performing Not Like The Movies at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles in February . Their lavish ceremony at a five-star resort in India included two elephants, acrobats and jugglers. Brand was once notorious in England as a hard-partying bachelor and self-confessed sex addict. He later had a spiritual awakening and got sober after years of heroin and alcohol abuse. He insisted he'd reformed his wild ways before settling down with Perry. 'I think I was ready for it,' he . said. 'If you're wild, like a wild animal, marriage won't contain you. I . think that's how a lot of people get into trouble.' Brand will next appear in the Eighties musical film, Rock Of Ages, alongside Tom Cruise. Perry, who has spent much of the year on tour, recently released the new single The One That Got Away. The track is currently number three on the US charts. If it reaches number one, it will be her sixth chart-topping single from her Teenage Dream album, surpassing the record set by Michael Jackson's Bad.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The manager of an upscale eatery in Atlanta, Georgia, kicked a four-year-old boy out at lunchtime because his sleeveless Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles t-shirt violated the dress code. Lewis Roberts and his family went to the Tavern at Phipps Plaza for lunch, but they never made it to their table. The hostess told them Lewis's t-shirt did not comply with their 'gentlemen's dress code' and therefore he would have to leave. Turtle power: Lewis Roberts loves his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles t-shirt, but it got him kicked out of an Atlanta restaurant . Lunch rush: Lewis's aunt Keri Smith said being kicked out of the busy restaurant at lunchtime was embarrassing . The little boy had chosen his own outfit that day and was particularly proud of his green t-shirt, reports WXIA. The family asked to speak to the manager of the restaurant, sure that the hostess must be mistaken, but the manager agreed with the hostess. She explained that even though Lewis is only four years old, the dresscode applies to 'gentlemen of all ages' and they were again asked to leave the premises. 'If we would have thought for a minute that he was inappropriately dressed, we would have gone to a different restaurant to save the embarrassment,' Lewis's aunt Keri Smith told WXIA. The station contacted the restaurant for comment and initially received none, however, upper management has now made a statement. Dress code: Men are not allowed to wear sleeveless shirts at the Tavern, but the sign says nothing about four-year-old boys . According to WXIA, manager Amber Stewart said the rule, which stipulates no sleeveless shirts, applies to men only, and not women or children. 'It was an embarrassing misunderstanding on our part. She's a manager in training who had a gross misunderstanding of our policy. We apologize and are reaching out to the family,' she said. The family says that having spoken to the restaurant and accepted their apology, they plan to return to the restaurant. It's highly likely the Tavern will experience some turtle power in the near future.","Atlanta restaurant kicked four-year-old Lewis Roberts out because of his t-shirt .

"By . Brendan Carlin In London And Simon Murphy In Croatia . The Tory MEPs were entertained by the world-renowned cellist Ana Rucner . Tory MEPs were accused of hypocrisy last night after spending tens of thousands of pounds of  taxpayers’ money on a week-long junket to the popular holiday destination of Croatia. It comes after they campaigned  to cut wasteful spending by the EU in last month’s European elections. Fourteen Tory MEPs – some accompanied by spouses – spent an estimated £30,000 on flights, rooms at a five-star hotel and sumptuous local cuisine. The group even included two politicians who lost their seats in last month’s European elections. Astonishingly, the trip took place before the new European Parliament has even met following the elections. Last night, UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: ‘Tory MEPs are dripping with hypocrisy. They may criticise the EU’s waste of taxpayers’ money by press release, but in reality no one does it better than they do. It’s outrageous.’ Officially, the purpose of the trip was to hold ‘study days’ with fellow right-of-centre MEPs in the European Conservatives and Reformists group to develop priorities for reforming the EU. The Tory contingent included its former European Parliament leader Martin Callanan and Marta Andreasen, both of whom lost their seats last month. Korcula in Croatia where Tory MEPs spent £30,000 on a junket . North West MEP Sir Robert Atkins, 68, who is standing down at the end of this month, was also on the trip. Syed Kamall, 47, the Tories’ new Brussels group leader and head of the ECR, was also present. Fellow MEPs Timothy Kirkhope, Geoffrey Van Orden and Ashley Fox all took their wives, while Anthea McIntyre attended with her husband. Other MEPs on the trip were David Campbell Bannerman, Jacqueline Foster, Richard Ashworth, Emma McClarkin, Ian Duncan and Vicky Ford. An estimated six Tory group officials were also present. The five-day jaunt started on Monday when the politicians checked into the Hilton Imperial hotel in Dubrovnik, where rooms cost £200 a night. One of the highlights was a trip to the pretty island of Korcula. Six of  the MEPs were ferried there by privately hired boats, before enjoying lunch at a hotel. Earlier in the week, the MEPs dined at a restaurant outside Dubrovnik where they were served champagne, before tucking into £19.50 meat platters and £23 home-smoked trout. And on Tuesday, the MEPs – who earn around £80,000 a year, £13,000 more than their Westminster counterparts – enjoyed a private performance by internationally acclaimed cellist Ana Rucner. Asked by The Mail on Sunday to justify the trip, the Tories said they had been invited there by fellow ECR MEP Ruza Tomasic who has a home on Korcula, and insisted it was a working trip. But when challenged some refused to discuss it, while others were prepared to defend the trip. East of England MEP Mr Campbell Bannerman, 54, said: ‘It’s very important to cement the ECR group and the UK delegation.’ But challenged that the Korcula day trip looked like a holiday, he admitted: ‘There’s an element of that.’ Miss Andreasen, 59, a former UKIP MEP, said that it was a ‘sign  of friendliness’ to organise the event away from Brussels. Nigel Farage and Marta Andreasen celebrate both being elected as UKIP MEPs in the European Parliamentary Election for the south east in 2009 . But Vicky Ford and fellow East of England MEP Geoffrey Van Orden, refused to discuss the trip. A Tory ECR spokesman defended the visit, saying the MEPs had been ‘able to gain a better understanding of the political situation in Croatia, including issues that affect the UK’. The spokesman said the MEPs’ accommodation was funded by their daily £243 allowance when on official business. He insisted that hotel and travel costs for spouses ‘were paid by spouses themselves’. And he defended defeated MEPs being present, saying they remained members of the Parliament until it reconvened next month.","Group included two politicians who lost their seats in last month’s elections .

"By . Daniel Martin . George Osborne has urged northern cities to adopt Boris Johnson-style elected mayors – just two years after thousands of voters said they did not want them. The Chancellor offered cities ‘serious devolution of powers and budgets’ if they agree to vest authority in directly elected figure like the Mayor of London. The pledge comes despite the fact that voters in 2012 across the north delivered the government a humiliating blow by throwing out plans for elected mayors. George Osborne has urged northern cities to adopt Boris Johnson-style elected mayors - just two years after thousands of voters said they did not want them . Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Newcastle, Bradford and Wakefield all rejected the idea in referendums. In Manchester yesterday Mr Osborne said he is ready to offer a bigger carrot in terms of local decision-making power to tempt the cities to reconsider. His offer came as he set out his vision of an economic ‘powerhouse’ in the north of England, with a high-speed rail link between Manchester and Leeds. The Chancellor said the combined economic and creative energies of northern cities could compete on a global scale. Bringing the cities of the north together could create a second ‘global city’ for the UK, which would be not a rival but a ‘brother in arms’ for London as they fight to grow Britain’s share in the world economy, he said. But he set no timescale on the high-speed rail line – dubbed HS3 – or give any indication about its route. Mr Osborne said there was a ‘strong case’ for more elected mayors who could drive growth and development in northern cities. Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Newcastle, Bradford and Wakefield all rejected the idea to have mayors - similar to London - in referendums . ‘A true powerhouse requires true power,’ he said. ‘So today I am … starting the conversation about serious devolution of powers and budgets for any city that wants to move to a new model of city government – and have an elected mayor.’ Mr Osborne said the northern cities should consider the value to London of having a strong and globally-recognised city leader in Boris Johnson – ‘the haircut that is recognised all over the world’. ‘Wales has its own parliament, and can pass its own laws. The economies of Manchester and Leeds are each individually bigger than Wales. But they don’t have a single leader who can speak for the whole area.’ The Chancellor’s vision of a high speed rail link was praised by Labour figures in the north last night – but attacked by Shadow chancellor Ed Balls. The mayor of Liverpool welcomed the Chancellor’s ‘bold step’, while the leader of Leeds council, Keith Wakefield, said: ‘I’m delighted George Osborne appears to be listening to the leaders of northern cities and accepting the role our cities have to play in the national economy.’ But Mr Balls said: ‘The Tories scrapped Labour’s successful regional development agencies, failed to implement Lord Heseltine’s growth report and are planning to cut infrastructure investment next year.’ Lord Prescott said that much of Mr Osborne’s vision echoed the Northern Way initiative, which he launched in 2004 to drive growth across the region. ‘This is more about northern votes than northern growth,’ he said Lord Prescott.","Made plea despite Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Newcastle, Bradford and Wakefield all rejected the idea in referendums .

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . Three former UK ambassadors to the Middle East will tomorrow join calls for Tony Blair to be removed from his role as Middle East peace envoy. Signatories to an open letter, led by Mr Blair's former ambassador to Iran Sir Richard Dalton, describe his achievements in the region as ‘negligible’, criticise his money-making activities and accuse him of trying to ‘absolve himself’ of responsibility for the crisis in Iraq. Other former diplomats to sign the letter are Oliver Miles, Britain’s ambassador to Libya when diplomatic relations were severed after the killing of WPC Yvonne Fletcher, and Christopher Long, ambassador to Egypt between 1992 and 1995. Step down: Three former UK ambassadors to the Middle East will tomorrow join calls for Tony Blair to be removed as Middle East peace envoy . Tony Blair is under pressure to stand down as Middle East peace envoy over his continued support for military action in the region . Other signatories include former London mayor Ken Livingstone, former Conservative prisons minister Crispin Blunt, the human rights barrister Michael Mansfield QC and the former Liberal Democrat peer Lady Tonge, who resigned her party's whip in 2012 over anti-Israel remarks. The letter has been organised by the makers of Respect MP George Galloway's film The Killing of Tony Blair. It has been timed for this week’s seventh anniversary of Mr Blair’s appointment as envoy on the Middle East to the ‘quartet’ of the UN, the EU, Russia and the US. The letter is addressed to John Kerry, the US secretary of state; Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister; Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general; and Cathy Ashton, the EU's self-styled ‘foreign minister’. It argues that Mr Blair’s 2003 invasion of Iraq is to blame for the rise of ‘fundamentalist terrorism in a land where none existed previously’ and he should be removed from his position. The letter says: ‘We, like many, are appalled by Iraq's descent into a sectarian conflict that threatens its very existence as a nation, as well as the security of its neighbours. We are also dismayed, however, at Tony Blair's recent attempts to absolve himself of any responsibility for the current crisis by isolating it from the legacy of the Iraq war.’ It alleges that Mr Blair ‘misled the British people’ by suggesting Saddam Hussein had links to al-Qaeda. ‘In the wake of recent events it is a cruel irony for the people of Iraq that perhaps the invasion's most enduring legacy has been the rise of fundamentalist terrorism in a land where none existed previously. We believe that Mr Blair, as a vociferous advocate of the invasion, must accept a degree of responsibility for its consequences,’ it adds. Criticising the former prime minister’s business interests, the letter alleges that his ‘conduct in his private pursuits also calls into question his suitability for the role’. Mr Blair has faced criticism for a lack of transparency in the way he organises his personal finances. The letter accuses him of ‘blurring the lines between his public position as envoy and his private roles at Tony Blair Associates and the investment bank JPMorgan Chase.’ Mr Miles said: ‘Tony Blair is the wrong man in the wrong job. The wrong man because he is identified with the war in Iraq; criticism has concentrated on his misreading of intelligence and his lies, but equally important was his failure to plan for the peace, with the result we see today. The wrong job because patching up the Palestine economy sounds good but avoids the real issue, the repression and misery of the occupation; that is what the quartet should tackle. Seven years on it's time to blow the whistle.’ Former top diplomat Sir Richard Dalton is one of the signatories of the letter . Mr Blunt said: ‘It's time to end Tony Blair's personal calvary as quartet envoy following his disastrous statesmanship in office on the Middle East. His role as envoy was neutered politically almost as soon as it began, and is now a distraction from the increasingly desperate need for a comprehensive peace deal.’ The letter adds to growing calls for Mr Blair to stand down. Last week former foreign secretary Lord Owen criticised Mr Blair for his claims that the 2003 invasion was not a factor in the current unrest in Iraq. ‘Tony Blair should no longer be allowed to speak for the EU on the Middle East and someone else found for helping Palestine without his past record and crusading messianic fervour,’ he said. A spokeswoman for Mr Blair said: ‘These are all people viscerally opposed to Tony Blair with absolutely no credibility in relation to him whatsoever. ‘Their attack is neither surprising nor newsworthy. They include the alliance of hard right and hard left views which he has fought against all his political life. Of course he completely disagrees with them over the Middle East. He believes passionately in the two State solution but also believes that can only be achieved by a negotiation with Israel. ‘The truth, and anybody who knows anything about the situation in respect of Palestine knows this, is that transformational change is impossible unless it goes hand in hand with a political process. There was hope that this could progress with the recent US led talks which were underpinned by a hugely ambitious economic plan spearheaded by Mr Blair.’ Of the criticism of Mr Blair's business interests, she added: ‘Mr Blair has done no work for JP Morgan in the Middle East – he is the chair of their International Advisory Council – where he provides advice on global political issues.’ Mr Blair’s allies also pointed out that Mr Miles had criticised the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war on the basis that two of its members ‘are Jewish’. People are being urged to support the call for Mr Blair to be removed by signing a petition here .","Three former UK ambassadors to Middle East sign open letter against Blair .

The CentreForum tank has collated information from a wide range of government and health services to produce a report on the health of the nation. Residents in the London Borough of Harrow have reported the lowest levels of mental health issues, compared with Middlesbrough where residents on Teesside are three times more likely to have a psychiatric illness. People living in the south of England report the lowest levels of happiness according to the new report despite having the lowest levels of mental illness . However, people living 40 miles up the A19 in Newcastle are four times more likely to die prematurely from a mental health issue compared with people on the Isle of Wight. Despite this, the researchers have found that people in London, Bedford, Milton Keynes, Brighton and Kent are among the unhappiest in the country. According to the researchers mental ill health costs UK employers an estimated £30 billion a year where the highest rates of working days lost is in the City of London. Holly Taggart of CentreForum said: 'This . is the first ever mental health-specific Atlas of Variation. It focuses . on unwarranted – or preventable – variations in the mental health and . wellbeing of England's population, exposing huge differences in people's . circumstances and access to services. 'One of the most concerning . findings is that people with serious mental illnesses have significantly . higher rates of premature mortality.' Paul Burstow MP, pictured said the report 'will challenge health professionals in those parts of the country which are far off the game' Ms Taggart said young people in Middlesbrough are five times more likely not to be in education, training or employment compared with those in Harrow. She said that Teesside residents were three times more likely to have a long term mental illness than those living in the London borough. 'If you have a . serious mental illness and live in Newcastle upon Tyne, you are four . times more likely to die prematurely than if you have a serious mental . health problem but lived in the Isle of Wight.' The report found that almost nine per cent of people in Stoke on Trent felt worthless compared with just three per cent in Hampshire. Paul Burstow MP who chaired a mental health commission established by CentreForum told the Sunday Times: 'This report will challenge health professionals in those parts of the country which are so far off the game when it comes to delivering anything like a decent mental health service.'","Londoners are among the least happy people in the country .

"Turf was exchanged for surf as polo players battled it out on the Cornish coastline during the Veuve Cliquot Polo on the Beach  tournament. Now . in its eighth year, the annual tournament takes place on Cornwall's most popular surfing beaches at Watergate Bay and is one of only a handful of polo matches to be played on sand. Organisers say the aim of the event is to bring the game to a wider audience and blend its glamour with the raw beauty of Cornwall. Spectators sipped champagne and listened to DJ sets from duo Billon as the game was played. A modern twist on the equestrian sport traditionally played on grass, the rules of beach polo are slightly different, with adaptations largely due to the smaller size of the ground. The full game is played over four chukkas. The first three chukkas are seven-and-a-half minutes long and the last chukka is played for seven minutes, unless there is a draw in which case a knock out chukka is played.  The clock does not stop when the ball goes out of play - in beach polo the clock is only stopped when a foul has been committed.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Millions of rail passengers are to be offered free superfast wifi access on the busiest commuter routes. A fine imposed on Network Rail for missing punctuality targets will be used to equip trains into London, Manchester, Brighton, Portsmouth, Bedford and Leeds with mobile broadband. Ministers say they want to help commuters fed-up with signals dropping out and encourage more people to travel by train because they can work at the same time. Ministers hope more people will choose to travel by train because they will able to work using high speed broadband acccess . Internet access on the rail network remains patchy, with people on some of the most popular routes forced to rely on their mobile phone signal to check emails, browse the internet or catch up on Facebook and Twitter. The Department for Transport said the £90million investment would ‘radically improve’ broadband access on the railways. Ministers are using money from a fine due to be imposed on Network Rail by the Office of Rail Regulation for missing punctuality targets. The project will begin immediately, and it is hoped to complete before the end of an upgrade of tracks by 2017. Train carriages will be fitted out with new wifi equipment, with the promise of ‘seamless mobile broadband connections’. Internet speeds and bandwidth will be similar to what people expect off the railways and at least 10 times better than services that they currently experience today, officials claim. The £90million investment will come from a fine imposed on Network Rail for failing to meet punctuality targets . Key routes due to benefit include routes into London from Bedford, Brighton, Kent and Portsmouth as well as services into Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield. Crucially, the government expects access will be free, in contrast to other lines where passengers are charged by the hour. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘We all know how frustrating it can be to have our phonecalls and internet use constantly disrupted by poor signal while travelling on trains. At the moment it happens too often. ‘Passengers expect and deserve better and with these plans, that is what they’ll get.’ The project is expected to cost £90million, and it will be the first time a fine from Network Rail has been used to directly improve services for passengers in this way. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said too often passengers have journeys disrupted by poor phone and web acess . Lib Dem transport minister Baroness Kramer said: 'The coalition government is working hard to build a stronger economy and fairer society. 'Today's announcement that we are providing free wifi on trains means people can more easily work and keep up with friends while on journeys. 'As well as steps we have already taken to make train travel as affordable and efficient as possible we hope free wifi will encourage even more people to make the greener choice and travel by train.’","£90million to be used to provide broadband access on the railways .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . The entire South Devon hamlet of Bantham is going on the market on Friday, complete with beach, boathouses, golf course and pub. All 728 acres have been owned by the same family for generations, and will have an asking price of £10million. The sleepy settlement - which has one pub and and a village shop - was bought up by a military commander in 1922, and most residents rent their properties. Scenic: The view over Bantham, a sleepy hamlet which is on sale for £10million . And now - thanks to a dispute over a food van - its 21 homes and other properties will go on the market to the highest bidder. When Gillian Goddard - one of the estate's five directors - allowed a 'gastrobus' to sell food and drink to visitors, she was deluged by complaints from locals attacking her act of 'commercialisation'. This, according to The Times, caused her to change her mind about bequeathing the estate to the visitors, and she amended her will to demand the village be put on the market. Picturesque: The view over the bay from Bantham in South Devon . Unspoilt: The Bantham cliffs, which could soon be sold off to developers . She died in November, triggering the sale, which is being run by estate agents Strutt and Parker. If no single buyer emerges, they intend to split the village into six separate lots. The prospect of a new landlord has alarmed residents - many of whom rent their homes. Rod Seymour, the landlord of the Sloop Inn pub in the hamlet, said: 'The same families have lived here for generations. We came here five years ago and since then only one property has been sold.' Another said: 'People are nervous, of course they are. We’re worried that someone from London will see an ‘opportunity’.

Samuel Eto'o toppled Manchester United with his first Chelsea hat-trick, leaving manager Jose Mourinho to claim the champions cannot expect to defend the title from so far adrift. Eto’o scored three times in 32 minutes at Stamford Bridge before Javier Hernandez pulled back a late goal for United, who finished the game with 10 men after Nemanja Vidic was dismissed late on. David Moyes’s side are now 14 points behind leaders Arsenal, 13 behind Manchester City and 12 points off Chelsea. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Moyes and Mourinho discuss Chelsea 3-1 Manchester United . Hat full: Samuel Eto'o scored a hat-trick for Chelsea to help them defeat Manchester United . ‘I don’t think David will be upset if I say the reality,’ said Mourinho. ‘It is a 14-point difference, and 13 and 12. Can they recover to one of these teams? They can. But to three of them? It needs three teams to almost collapse.’ Moyes promised that United would refuse to surrender the title. He confessed he had hoped to be better placed at this stage of his debut Old Trafford season but rejected the notion of a crisis. ‘That’s your word, not mine,’ he said. ‘What we won’t do is throw in the towel until we can’t get there. The job is to try to finish first. I was hoping to win more and be competing a bit more than we’ve been but that will come.’ Moyes did not complain about Vidic’s red card, for a crude challenge on Eden Hazard, and Danny Welbeck’s claim for a penalty in the first half, after a tackle by Cesar Azpilicueta. ‘It would have been a soft one,’ said Moyes, who accepted Rafael had been fortunate to escape a red card for a reckless tackle on Gary Cahill. Belief: David Moyes believes his United team can still win the Premier League . ‘Vidic wasn’t a sending off but I’ve seen Rafa’s and that could have been one,’ he said.

The only blemish for Chelsea was a . knee injury to Fernando Torres, who insisted on carrying on because all . substitutes were used. ‘It . is the lateral ligaments in his knee and it will be weeks,’ said . Mourinho.  ‘It’s a pity for Nando but it’s time for Demba Ba. It is his . chance.’ Moyes always knew succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson, who enjoyed 26 years of success at Old Trafford, would not be easy.

"By . James Chapman . Feckless absent fathers should be put to work ‘in chains’ to repay the State for the cost of bringing up their children, a Conservative MP said yesterday. David Davies told MPs that it was ‘outrageous’ that some young men got women pregnant before leaving them to bring up their babies on their own on benefits. He made his demand in a Commons debate in which Labour launched more attacks on the Government’s attempt to cut the vast housing benefit bill. Outspoken: Tory MP David Davies said feckless fathers should be locked in chains and made to work to pay for the children they abandoned . Labour work and pensions spokesman . Rachel Reeves, calling for a vote on the Coalition’s reform of the spare . room subsidy – branded the ‘bedroom tax’ by Labour – said vulnerable . people were being unfairly targeted. But . Mr Davies, the MP for Monmouth, said he had met a woman bringing up . four grandchildren and that the children’s mother was going to lose out . on housing benefit because she was not their main carer. Mr Davies said the women essentially wanted ‘two large houses’ in which to look after the same children. ‘I . think it is absolutely outrageous that so many young men in our society . feel they can go out, get women pregnant, allow them to have children, . make them bring them up by themselves, very often on benefits, and then . disappear,’ he said. ‘I . hope that the ministers will take note of this and get hold of some of . these feckless fathers, drag them off, make them work, put them in . chains if necessary, make them work and make them pay back society for . the cost of bringing up the children they chose to bring into this . world.’ Stephen Pound, . the Northern Ireland spokesman for Labour, said the reform was ‘beyond . disgrace’ and revealed his brother, who has kidney failure, faces losing . his home of 20 years. Miss . Reeves said a Labour government would scrap the reform. ‘If I am . Secretary of State in 2015 this will be the first thing I will do – . reverse this unfair and pernicious tax,’ she said. She . criticised Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith for missing . the debate to attend a conference in Paris on youth employment. David Davis, who is definitely not David TC Davies . David Davies is probably best known for not being David Davis. The Welsh politician is frequently confused with his near-namesake (inset), who lost out to David Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005. As a result he uses his middle initials TC in Parliament, earning the nickname ‘Top Cat’. Mr Davies, the Monmouth MP, has never reached the Tory frontline, at odds with the leadership on many issues. The fluent Welsh-speaking was born in London and grew up in Newport, working for British Steel and the Territorial Army before travelling around Australia where he picked tobacco and ran a nightclub. He ran a campaign against the Welsh Assembly being set up, but then stood for election to it and became the only Tory to win a constituency seat. The Special Constable was elected as MP for Monmouth in 2005, and has called for Britain to leave the EU, expressed doubts about climate change and argued people who come to Britain should learn English and be fit to work. In 2010 he accused the Labour party of trying to smear him as a ‘Nazi’. Last year he insisted he is not homophobic – because he once fought a gay boxer with the nickname the Pink Pounder. He had claimed that parents hoped for heterosexual children because they wanted grandchildren. But . Mr Duncan Smith, writing on the ConservativeHome  website, said: ‘We’ve . ended the thoroughly unfair subsidy that saw the taxpayer forking out . for almost one million spare  bedrooms in the social rented sector.’ He . said that 54 per cent of the public agreed that people of working age . who lived in social housing should receive less housing benefit if they . had more bedrooms than they needed. Under . the reform, working-age claimants with extra bedrooms are having their . housing benefit cut by 14 per cent for the first excess bedroom and 25 . per cent for two or more bedrooms. Pensioners are protected and those who cannot move or cannot afford the extra cost can apply for discretionary payments. The Government estimates the reform will cost the average affected household £14 a week, saving £500million a year.","Monmouth MP says men who father children should pay for upbringing .

"By . Katy Winter . A British couple has been taking part in an extraordinary romantic adventure over the last two years, travelling the world and experiencing a traditional wedding in every country they visit. Alex Pelling and Lisa Gant, from Manchester, left their life in the UK in 2011 to start afresh in Australia, identifying the very best places in the world to get married along the way. In the two years they have been on the road so far they have participated in more than three dozen wedding ceremonies in over 50 countries. The couple after their traditional Guatemalan wedding which took place on the terrace of a hotel with stunning views of the three volcanoes. The Xaman lit a fire of cigars, rose petals and candles and made offerings to the Gods and held the ceremony in Mayan . The beautiful Villa de Leyva was the location for this traditional Colombian farmer style wedding. Lisa arrived at on a donkey and they had a sheep as a guest 'as it is tradition' After a traditional Mayan service in Quintana Roo, Mexico, the couple had an underwater photography session . A map of Alex and Lisa's extrodinary journey around the globe . Their blog has had more than a million views, and their Facebook page has more than 37,000 followers, as they experience the wonderful variety of cultures and traditions around the world. The couple had been friends for eight years when they began dating in 2008. In 2011, after four years living together, Alex and Lisa made the brave decision to uproot their lives and follow their dream to relocate in Australia. The couple rented out their house and sold Alex’s motor repair business as well as their possessions to get funding for their trip. A million-dollar yacht, a canoe chapel and, you guessed it... a wedding! Lisa and Alex's Bora Bora nuptials . This wedding was held at Mitad del Mundo (the middle of the world) in Ecuador, where artist Cristobal Ortega held the ceremony. The highlight, say the couple, was being blessed with smoke by the entire congregation . A Texan ranch wedding held in a stunning location Las Brisas Farm. The entire wedding was made completely from reclaimed materials and covered in fairy lights. The couple clambered on hay bales and Alex even lassoed his bride! A truly traditional Tahitian tying of the knot! The wedding took place in a Tiki village on the island of Moorea . The wedding in Utila, Honduras, took place at a magical wonderland all created by one man. Glass marbles, coloured stones and pottery, even cutlery adorns every surface making the place sparkle in the amazing sunlight . A wedding in Portugal which included a tour of Lisbon by tram, motorbike and sidecar. The wedding was held on the highest point in Lisbon overlooking the stunning city . While dismantling their lives in the UK, the couple decided to travel the world on their way to Australia and look for a place to get married. The idea slowly transformed into finding the best place in the world to wed, by trying each one out, embracing the local marriage cultures and traditions as much as possible in every location. Their aim was to find the most exceptional and unique wedding locations possible, blogging about their experiences so others could better chose where to tie the knot themselves. Introducing themselves on their blog the couple say: 'We are Lisa and Alex, a couple in love, who, on failing to find the answer to the all important question; ‘Where can we get married’, decided to have a wedding ceremony in every country we visit in search of the perfect place to tie the knot! ‘On an adventure of a lifetime, we are going to drive (and ship) around the globe in our 27-year-old camper van Peggy exchanging vows in the most unusual and unique wedding locations we can find. The couple's topless Embera tribe wedding in Embera, Panam,a saw them adorned with ink and traditional beads . The incredible ceremony at the 'Centre of the World' in Quito, Ecuador . Lisa throws her bouquet after the couple's Ecuadorian nuptials . The wedding in the Toledo Villages of Belize was conducted with the help of the TEA Belize, a volunteer organisation who helps the local villagers see some of the benefits and profits of eco-tourism . After the wedding Seattle, which took place in the Pike Place Market. Alex and Lisa are the second couple to marry at the market . At the Chappelle St Agnes Vineyard in Quebec. 'We stumbled upon the amazing European-inspired vineyard, complete with chapel and heart shaped lake, while on a wine tour' ‘Not wanting to drag a ‘White wedding’ around the World, we decided to try our hardest to embrace the culture and local traditions of each place we visit. ‘We want to experience the difference in every ceremony and find out what it is that makes the bringing of two people together, such a worldwide tradition, and of course let YOU know!’ Now on wedding 54, the couple have documented their nuptials, which have ranged from an ancient Pagan ritual in Lithuania to a ceremony aboard a multi-million dollar yacht and a drive-through wedding in Vegas. The pair even had a topless Embera tribe wedding in Embera, Panama where they were painted with traditional tribal tattoo designs and beads. Their experiences have been supported by local experts including shamans, Zulu chiefs, pastors, vicars, rabbis and even a Voodoo priestess, not to mention an army of wedding photographers and dedicated wedding professionals who have donated their time and skills to Alex and Lisa’s quest. Lisa and Alex's pagan wedding in Lithuania . Their Turkish wedding was in two parts: first, the couple took part in a A henna ceremony before marrying on a boat against a backdrop of ancient tombs . A vintage-style English wedding that was held in Didsbury just before the couple started their journey - they flew to Canada the very next day . The El Salvador wedding took place at sunset on the beach . Wedding on horseback! The couple married in Banff, Alberta, Canada at  Warner's stables. It was Lisa's first ever time on a horse and Alex wore a cowboy outfit on their big day . The wedding in Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica was held in crashed plane with a mysterious history overlooking the coast of the beautiful country . After their wedding in Chile.

"By . Peter Allen . and Kieran Corcoran . Francois Hollande today spoke for the first time about the health of his grief-stricken ex-partner, after confirming that he 'doesn't want' another first lady in the Elysée palace. The French president has also been encouraged by his advisers to begin a 'bachelor presidency' as Valerie Trierweiler, 48, ends her eight-day stay in hospital prompted by claims of an affair between Mr Hollande and film actress Julie Gayet, 41. His new commitment to the single life, reported in the French press, came as he made a solo official visit to the Dutch royal family. Scroll down for video . France's President Francois Hollande raises a toast with Netherlands' King Willem-Alexander toasts at the royal palace Noordeinde in The Hague this afternoon . Netherlands' King Willem-Alexander (left) and Queen Maxima (right) welcome France's President Francois Hollande upon his arrival . Mr Hollande said Ms Trierweiler was . having a rest but otherwise ‘doing better, while making plans to kick her . out of the Elysée Palace for good. According to sources close to the president, who spoke to news magazine L'Express, he has been advised to usher in 'a bachelor presidency', which would be 'an element of modernisation for the role of president'. Meanwhile French TV station Itélé reported that Mr Hollande told a group of journalists: 'I do not want there to be first lady in the future at the Elysée.' During his visit to the Netherlands, Mr Hollande pointedly referred to the first lady by her full name. Asked . directly at a press conference if Ms Trierweiler was still his first . lady, Mr Hollande said: ‘Thank you for your question. Valerie . Trierweiler is doing better and is now resting at La Lanterne. I have . nothing to add.’ La . Lanterne is the massively luxurious presidential retreat in . Versailles, where Ms Trierweiler arrived in a police-escorted limousine. According to Paris Match – where Ms Trierweiler still works as a columnist – she is a broken woman. Mr . Hollande only visited her for half-an-hour when she was in hospital, . and, according to the glossy magazine she is ‘devastated and humiliated’ and ‘perhaps at the end of a journey.’ The pair pose for photos inside Palace Noordeinde, in The Hague .

Gayet, 41. However one . of Mr Hollande’s aides confirmed yesterday that his relationship with . 48-year-old Miss Trierweiler was ‘over’. Mr . Hollande is expected to publicise a decision about Miss Trierweiler’s . future before he leaves for a scheduled visit to the USA in February. Francois Hollande, an avowed left winger who . ‘dislikes the rich’, was set to visit his estranged first lady Valerie . Trierweiler to ‘discuss their future’ in one of the most opulent homes . in Europe . Meanwhile . Miss Trierweiler made her first direct public comment about the scandal . on Saturday, tweeting: ‘Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all . those who have sent messages of support wishing me a speedy recovery. Very touched.’ While . Miss Trierweiler has indicated she is prepared to forgive and forget . following revelations of his affair with an actress, her furious uncle . Florent Massonneau said: ‘I think the fact my niece is being cuckolded . is disgraceful. Her situation gives us a lot of pain.’ It came as a new poll revealed that 77 per cent of  French people are ‘dissatisfied’ with Hollande’s presidency. Today such figures were expected to rise, as the growing crisis was set to be played out in La Lanterne. Built for the bodyguard of the pre-Revolutionary monarch Louis XVI, it has long been viewed by the left as a symbol of unacceptable wealth and privilege. Valerie Trierweiler left hospital in Paris on Saturday after reportedly overdosing on sleeping pills, and is now 'resting' at the president's country house in Versailles . As well as a heated swimming pool, tennis court and manicured gardens, it contains one of the best wine cellars in France, and its own manicured gardens . As well as a heated swimming pool, tennis court and manicured gardens, it contains one of the best wine cellars in France, and its own manicured gardens. Despite having her own flat in Paris, Ms Trierweiler, 48, was driven to the the magnificent presidential home on Saturday afternoon after spending eight days in a private hospital room suffering from stress. It was caused by hearing claims about Mr Hollande’s secret two year affair with the film and TV actress Julie Gayet, 41. As Ms Gayet remained in hiding, a  source close to the president confirmed that he ‘planned to see’ Ms Trierweiler today, and that he and the first lady would be ‘discussing their future’. Mr Hollande only saw Ms Trierweiler once in hospital, and even then only after she had been at the Pitie-Salpetriere for more than a week. President Hollande has been accused of having an affair with 41-year-old actress Julie Gayet . The leader is due to reveal whether Ms Trierweiler will continue in her role as the First Lady next month . Ms Trierweiler is desperately trying to hang on to her role, despite clear indications that Mr Hollande wants to make Ms Gayet his first lady. In an attempt to drum up public support, Ms Trierweiler took to Twitter on Saturday night to write: ‘Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all those who sent messages of support ... very touched’. Her words were met with an avalanche of ridicule, with people describing her as everything from ‘the Rottweiler’ to the new Marie-Antoinette, after the high-living wife of Louis XVI who was eventually guillotined. A new Ifop/idd poll in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper reveals 37 per cent of France is ‘very discontented’ with Hollande’s presidency, and 40 per cent are simply ‘discontented’. Mr Hollande visited his political heartland of Correze, in central France, on Saturday, but again refused to answer questions about who his real first lady was. Instead Bernard Combes, the Socialist mayor of Combes – a job Mr Hollande had for seven years – said: ‘France's political situation requires all of the president's attention and all of his time, so obviously it would be best for everyone if he can resolve the problems in his personal life under good conditions.’ The French President greeted constituents in Tulle as the scandal surrounding his alleged infidelities continues .

"By . John Drayton . Will Brazil win the World Cup without Neymar? Brazil awoke from a night celebrating their side's progress to the World Cup semi-finals to the bitter realistation that they will be without their best player Neymar for the rest of the tournament. The World Cup poster boy has been ruled out for at least four weeks with a broken vertebrae following a tackle from Juan Camilo Zuniga during his side's 2-1 quarter-final victory over Colombia on Friday. Brazilian sports paper Lance! featured the headline 'Play for him' in an attempt to encourage Brazil's players that they can still realise the dream of winning the World Cup in their home country without a player that has largely carried them thus far. Scroll down for video... Play for him! Brazil sports newspapers react to losing their poster boy for the rest of the tournament . The dream is over? Neymar writhes in agony after breaking a vertebrae during Brazil's 2-1 win over Colombia . Inside the paper, journalist Mauro Betting remembers past great players including Hungary's Ferenc Puskas (1954) and Franco Baresi of Italy (1994), who were forced out of World Cups through injury - while examining the alternatives left to coach Luis Felipe Scolari.In Folha de Sao Paulo, 'Brazil reach the semi-final, but Neymar is out of the Cup' offers a bleak reminder to the country - although one of Brazil's most revered journalists Juca Kfouri, stayed positive about Brazil's World Cup hopes. 'It was Brazil's best performance of the World Cup...and things could get even better, even without Neymar, who will be missed, really missed. But Neymar is only one player, and he isn't Messi, much less Pelé. And without Pelé, we won the World Cup in 1962,' he wrote. Write caption here . Villian: Colombia defender Juan Camilo Zuniga has been largely blamed for Neymar's injury . Elsewhere, Correio Brazilienese runs with the headline 'The pain that stopped our joy' accompanied by a picture of Neymar writhing on the ground in agony.And, Extra takes a more embittered angle with the headline 'Cowardice takes Neymar from the Cup'. This anger was shared by many Brazilian journalists including legendary broadcaster Galvao Bueno from Brazil's biggest network Globo who said: 'It was malicious... a deliberate attack on football and art.' Brazil's frustrations have largely been directed at Zuniga, the player responsible for the robust foul, and Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo for failing to offer the 22-year-old more protection. 'I'm devastated that Neymar is out of the World Cup. It was a ridiculous foul that wasn't even punished. The only thing that was punished was talent. What a pity,' wrote journalist and TV presenter Fatima Bernardes. Reaction: O Estado de Sao Paulo states the obvious, while the incident appears to have been missed by Agora . Figure of hate: Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo was given stick for not offering Neymar more protection . Speaking on SpoTV, Fabio Cannavaro agreed that Zuniga was to blame. 'I'm a little more cynical,' he said. 'Neymar isn't transparent. He came from behind with his knee up.'However, Brazil's 1970 World Cup winner Carlos Alberto Torres had his doubts over Colombian defender Zuniga's intent. 'For me, it was an accident. He tried to break up the play. It's the kind of challenge you see all the time,' he said.Meanwhile, Band TV's firebrand sports presenter, Milton Neves raged: 'This Spanish referee was like the Spanish team at this World Cup: a joke'.","Brazil striker Neymar has been ruled out for rest of the World Cup .

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . Kevin Pietersen has used the occasion of the star-studded Lord’s bicentenary match to claim he would love to play for England again, insisting ‘cricket’s never been the issue’ and pointing out that he is yet to retire from the game. Six months after being sacked by the ECB following a breakdown in trust between him and senior figures in the England dressing-room, Pietersen will line up for Shane Warne’s Rest of the World team against an MCC side led by Sachin Tendulkar in a game to commemorate 200 years of cricket’s most famous club at Lord’s on Saturday. As a cast list of current and recently retired cricketing stars assembled at the home of cricket on Friday, Pietersen began by posting a picture on Instagram. Looking to the future: Kevin Pietersen still hopes to play for England again one day . Short form: Pietersen has predominantly been playing T20 cricket of late . All smiles: Pietersen at Lord's on Friday with Shane Warne ahead of the MCC 200-year celebration match . ‘My space reserved in the Lord’s . dressing room,’ he wrote. ‘Clothes ready! So excited about tomorrow. I . didn’t think I’d have this opportunity to play in front of a full house . at Lord’s again. I still do hope that things change and I play for . England here again. Time will tell...’ If . it was possible to dismiss that as an off-the-cuff piece of . wistfulness, then Pietersen later reiterated his desire to resume an . international career that most observers believe came to an end . following the Sydney Test in January. Since . then, Pietersen has agreed a severance package with the ECB, embarked . on a new life as a Twenty20 freelancer, and begun a newspaper column in . which his thoughts on Alastair Cook’s struggling side have trodden a . fine line between constructive criticism and thinly veiled . schadenfreude. In another . move unlikely to endear him to Cook, Pietersen attended the recent . Lord’s Test against Sri Lanka alongside Piers Morgan, who has dubbed the . England captain ‘a repulsive little weasel’. Primed: Pietersen shared this image of his shirt and message on Instagram . The . kindest interpretation is that a rapprochement could be tricky. And . yet, with a high-profile five-Test series against India beginning on . Wednesday, Pietersen claims he has not given up hope of mending the . various bridges that have been burned over the last few months. ‘I’d . love to play for England again,’ he said in the Lord’s Long Room. ‘I’ve . still got hope.’ Asked how he thought this might come about, he . replied: ‘I’ve got a phone in my pocket. I’ve got a pretty good resumé. It’s not the cricket. It’s fine.’ Did . he really think he might add to his 104 Test caps? ‘I don’t think it . might happen. I live in hope every day. I’m 34, I’m young. I can still . play. I’ve got a good resumé. If things change one day, I’ll gladly . accept the opportunity, because I love playing for England. If I didn’t . love it, I’d have retired. But I haven’t retired.’ When . it was put to Pietersen that the parting of the ways between him and . England appeared to be final, he replied: ‘Not from me. I’d love to play . again. Short on form: Pietersen refused to be drawn on whether Alastair Cook should step down as captain . Disaster: England were beaten in every form of the game by Sri Lanka on their recent tour . ‘I never lost . interest when I played for England. Every single day I wanted to . improve. I had ambitions, I had goals. They’re still there. I probably . needed a couple of months out with my knee, for sure. But that seems to . have got back working OK. It’s just a case of hoping the phone rings one . day.’ Would he consider . playing four-day cricket for Surrey in a bid to prove his readiness for a . shock return to the Test team? ‘No. Cricket’s never been the issue. I’ve played 104 Test matches, I’ve got enough runs.’ Pietersen . was heartened by the reception he received from fellow-diners at a . special meal on Thursday evening at Lord’s. ‘I sat next to one of the . MCC officials, and they said: “Wow, that was amazing.” I know the . support has been incredible since January.’ But . the likelihood is that the man hailed by Warne as an ‘absolute . matchwinner, a superstar and a wonderful player’ really has represented . England for the last time. There . was a moment of self-depreciation when Pietersen described himself as . ‘the genuine out-and-out clubbie, playing once a week’. The . sadness is this isn’t too far from the truth. Barring one of the most . improbable U-turns in the history of cricket, Pietersen’s appearance on . Saturday could be his last in this country outside the confines of the . domestic game. Don’t expect him to go out with a whimper.","Pietersen says he still hasn't given up on international cricket .

Yuvraj was the star of the show in the RoW innings, making 132 in 134 balls from number five. The Indian batsman produced the significant knock that eluded Gilchrist (29), Virender Sehwag (22) and Kevin Pietersen (10) but had steady support from Paul Collingwood (40) and Peter Siddle (33 not out).

Collingwood later removed Lara (23) and Dravid (nought) with successive balls, but Finch did not relent as he wowed the fans with his clean-hitting.

"By . Joe Ridge . Follow @@JoeRidge87 . Former England coach Andy Flower has leapt to the defence of Alastair Cook's captaincy ahead of the upcoming Test series against India. Cook, who captains England's Test and one-day sides, has endured a torrid 2014 with an Ashes whitewash preceding recent series defeats by Sri Lanka in both formats. The 29-year-old has also struggled badly with the bat but Flower, who resigned in January after the Ashes, has told the Sunday Telegraph that Cook is still the right man for the job. Under fire: Cook (cenrte) looks dejected after England somehow contrived to lose to Sri Lanka . Old allies: Cook and Flower watch on as England prepare for the ill-fated 2013-14 Ashes campaign . Flower said: 'It seems to be forgotten, and people should not forget, that this is a young man, a 29-year-old man, who has done some extraordinary things for his country. 'He has scored the most Test centuries for his country – that in itself is an amazing achievement, and he's got so much more left to give.' Cook's captaincy had started so promisingly with England recording their first Test series win in India for 17 years back in December 2012. He flourished with the bat on the subcontinent and positive results continued into 2013 with the Essex man guiding England to a 3-0 Ashes win over Australia last summer before it all turned sour. The main criticism labelled at Cook by the likes of Shane Warne is a perceived lack of tactical awareness and cricketing nous in the field, but Flower cited the win in India as evidence to the contrary. Found out: Mitchell Johnson celebrates clean-bowling Cook at Adelaide in December . Moving on: Flower opted to resign in the wake of the Ashes defeat after four-and-a-half years in the job . He said: 'He's led the side to an astounding Test victory in India, against the odds, and in the main on pitches which England have traditionally struggled on, and tactically he was excellent in India. If he hadn't been, we would not have won.' The five-Test series against the Indians starts at Trent Bridge on Thursday and Flower urged the English public to get behind Cook and his struggling side as they look to stop the rot. Flower said: 'He is an outstanding cricketer and we, the English public, should be proud of having Alastair Cook as one of our own, leading the Test side. They should not be duped into thinking otherwise by those that have the platform to shout loudest. They should make their own judgment about a fine, proud Englishman leading the England cricket team.'

"Judd Trump saw off home favourite Neil Robertson in the Australian Goldfields Open final on Sunday to secure his fourth ranking title. Trump claimed the 75,000 US Dollars (£43,700) prize in Bendigo after wrapping up a 9-5 win. The 24-year-old Englishman kept his opponent at bay having gone into the final session 5-3 ahead from the opening one. Success Down Under: Judd Trump beat home favourite Neil Robertson 9-5 in Bendigo to claim the Australian Goldfields Open, the fourth ranking tournament of his career . It comes just over two months on from Trump’s World Championship quarter-final defeat to Robertson, who was looking here to win his home tournament for the first time and keep up the momentum following his victory in the recent Wuxi Classic. Sunday’s first six frames were shared, with Trump making the bigger breaks of 50 and 71 before runs of 55 and 114 gave him the last two of the earlier session. He began the second session by clearing from blue to black to secure a 6-3 advantage and then frames 10 and - with 101, his eighth century of the tournament - 11 also went his way. Defeated: Neil Robertson, who beat Trump at the World Championships earlier in the year, was unable to come back from 5-3 down in the final session . Robertson rallied well, dominating frame 12 and also taking the next with a 109 break to further reduce the deficit. But the 32-year-old Melbourne-born cueman could not make the most of his chances in the 14th and Trump potted the final blue to clinch victory. Trump, quoted by www.worldsnooker.com, said: 'I played well throughout the week, although today was quite cagey. 'Even at 8-3 ahead I knew he was capable of winning six frames in a row - he did that against me at the World Championship. He started to go for his shots and they were going in, so I was a bit nervy because if it had gone 8-6 then the pressure would have been on me. 'The difference today was that I was nicking the tight frames. I was happy to be 5-3 ahead at the end of the first session, then I won an important first frame in the evening session.'","Englishman won 9-5 in Bendigo final to claim £43,700 prize purse .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Whether you prefer an early night and rise the crack of dawn - or stay up late and lie in half the day - could depend on your genes, according to new research. Experts believe our genetic make-up determines exactly whether we are early or late risers - dubbed larks and owls. Neurogeneticist Dr Louis Ptacek, of University of California, says understanding a person’s chronotype - the time of day they function best - can help us live more healthily. Whether you're an early riser or a late sleeper may be down to genetics, experts say (library image) Dr Ptacek told the BBC: ‘Whether we like it or not, our parents are telling us when to go to bed - based on the genes that they gave us.’ We all have internal circadian clocks - our master clock is made up of thousands of nerve cells in a wing-shaped structure located in the hypothalamus, at the base of the brain. The hypothalamus controls all kinds of bodily functions, from releasing hormones to regulating our temperature and water intake. This internal clock is reset every day by light. People who get up early are dubbed 'larks' and late sleepers 'owls' in the research by scientists at University of California . You might expect that since the earth’s day lasts 24 hours, everyone’s clocks would run to a similar schedule. But they don’t. That’s why there are larks and owls. Families of extreme owls, with Familial Delayed Sleep Phase syndrome, were found to have a different mutation in the same genes. Rick Neubig, a professor of pharmacology in Michigan, said he is an extreme lark. ‘People I communicated with in Europe will always notice that they get emails from me very early in the morning. The other thing I like a lot which fits in with the early mornings is that I’m a fairly serious bird watcher. ‘It’s much easier for me than other people to get up and see the birds at dawn.’ He said his early starts run in the family. ‘My mother would always drag us out of bed at 4 in the morning to go on vacation, and my daughter works out early in the morning.’ Dr Louis Ptacek, who is studying families like Rick’s that have Familial Advanced Sleep Phase syndrome, said he started researching sleep patterns after his colleague Dr Chris Jones met a 69-year-old who was worried about waking up very early. Dr Ptacek said: ‘We recognised this was a strong genetic trait. We found the mutated gene resided near the end of chromosome 2.’ Prof Derk-Jan Dijk, Head of the University of Surrey’s Sleep Research Centre, said: ‘If you have a fast clock you like to do things early, and if you have a slow clock you like to do things late.’","Experts at University of California say sleeping habits are down to genetics .

"By . Chris Brooke . The era of high-speed broadband technology is making the smart television a must-have in the modern home. But an expert warned yesterday that connecting TVs to the internet will inevitably bring an unwanted intruder into the house – the computer virus. With more and more films being downloaded from the internet to the household television and ‘catch-up’ TV channels becoming increasingly popular, he believes infection from viruses is only a matter of time. Risk: An expert warned yesterday that connecting smart TVs to the internet could bring an unwanted intruder into the house ¿ the computer virus . A cyber attack on smart TVs could cause pandemonium among viewers, particularly if it coincided with a World Cup penalty shootout, a primetime drama or the results of Strictly Come Dancing. Eugene Kaspersky, co-founder and chief executive of Russia’s Kaspersky Lab, the world’s fourth largest computer anti-virus group, said that mobile phones and then TVs are the next gadgets likely to be targeted by criminals spreading viruses worldwide. He said his company – which receives 315,000 suspicious activity reports a day – has yet to discover a virus penetrating a television. Televisions could soon be infected by computer viruses, one of the world's top technology security experts has warned . But he warned: ‘The threats will . diversify to mobile phones and to the home environment, such as through . televisions, which are now connected to the internet. There are millions . of attacks a year on Microsoft Windows, thousands on mobile phones, . mostly on Android, and dozens on Apple’s iOS.’ Mr Kaspersky said ‘all . the systems are vulnerable’ and added: ‘Technically it is possible to . infect millions of devices. It will happen. It’s just a question of . time. What’s the difference between a TV and a computer? A bigger screen . and a remote control. ‘It has Android inside and memory chips and . internet connections. That’s all.’ Inevitably, the consumer will be . forced to buy more virus protection software to tackle the threat of . cyber invasion and the industry is gearing up to cash in. Eugene Kaspersky, is co-founder and chief executive of Russia's Kaspersky Lab, the world's fourth largest computer antivirus group. He said threats will spread to the 'home environment' and televisions as internet connections make technology more vulnerable . At the . start of last year, 13 per cent of the British population owned a smart . TV, which connects to the internet using integrated technology or a . set-top box. But that figure is likely to have increased significantly since then with the rise of ‘catch-up’ TV. Last May a survey found that 50 per cent of British consumers liked the idea of accessing online content through televisions. Around 100million households in Western Europe and the US are predicted to have at least one internet-linked TV by 2016.","Eugene Kaspersky co-founder of world’s fourth largest antivirus group .

Battle lines: A barricade erected on Arkhitektora Horodetskoho Street to protect Maidan Square occupants from riot police attacks . As night fell, there was an uneasy tension amid freezing temperatures and snow showers after huge police reinforcements were moved into the city by Yanukovych's government. One nationalist politician warned that Russian special services were infiltrating protest groups 'with the aim of organising mass disorder', so giving the authorities an excuse for a ruthless crackdown. 'They are already on the territory of Ukraine,' warned Svoboda Party leader Oleh Tiahnybok. However, officers among the riot police insisted: 'We are here to keep order, we are not going to apply force.' One special services policeman said referring to Yanukovych: 'We don't want to be here ourselves and are just standing because of this monster. It's just an order. ' Even as the authoritarian leader staged a show of force on Kiev's snowy streets, Yanukovych announced that he would sit down with three former Ukrainian presidents in a compromise bid. Resolute: Pro-European Union activists get ready to defend their tent camp on the Independence Square in Kiev, Ukraine, today as protests continue for a third week . Tensions: Pro Europe opposition activists  armed with improvised weapons prepare for a police assault inside city hall in Kiev . The U.S. warned the authoritarian leader against a bloody crackdown, stressing the world was 'watching' while the EU will Tuesday sent foreign policy chief Baroness Catherine  Ashton to Ukraine. President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso said he had urged Yanukovych 'not to use force against people who are demonstrating peacefully, to respect fully their freedom.' He said: 'Those young people in the streets of Ukraine in freezing temperatures are writing the new narrative for Europe.' Tensions had been mounting all days as hundreds of riot police flooded into Kiev city centre in what anti-protesters feared was a precursor to an imminent brutal crackdown on dissent. The Ukrainian capital has been brought to a standstill for a third week by rebels angered by President Yanukovych's decision to shelve a treaty with the European Union in order to focus on ties with Moscow. Protesters, armed with improvised weapons, had ignored a court order demanding they leave Kiev's city hall.

Blockade: Riot police block the road next to Pro-European Union activists gathered on the Independence Square in Kiev . They set up makeshift barricades in the streets to hold off any advances by security forces. The protesters have been galvanised after police violently dispersed some of the demonstrators. Sunday's demonstration by hundreds of . thousands was the largest since the 2004 pro-democracy Orange Revolution . protests that annulled Mr Yanukovych's presidential victory due to . voting fraud. In a surprise . move, Mr Yanukovych announced that he would meet three former Ukrainian . presidents on Tuesday to discuss a way out of the crisis that has . paralysed the country. The political stand-off has been aggravated by Ukraine's deteriorating finances. Gifts: An activist tries to give food to riot police officers preparing to block the Independence Square in KIev, Ukraine today . The economy has been in recession for . more than a year, and the government is in desperate need of foreign . funding to avoid a default. As talks stalled with the International Monetary Fund, Mr Yanukovych has sought a bailout loan from Russia. Some protesters left the city . building, fearing a violent police raid, but dozens of more radical . activists barricaded themselves inside. They were armed with planks, metal rods and bottles of sunflower oil, hoping to make riot police slip if they advanced. 'We won't let anybody into the building,' said Vasyl Khlopotaruk, one of the organisers. 'But we hope there isn't bloodshed.' Reinforcements: Soldiers of Ukrainian Interior forces make line near of barricade which was built by protesters to block the way to the Independence Square in Kiev . Ready for action: Riot police officers look through their bus window while waiting to block Pro-European Union activists gathered at the Independence Square in Kiev . Opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk called for calm, telling several thousand protesters on Independence Square that police were ordered not to storm the building but to blockade the protest camp to deplete it of food and other amenities. 'I am turning to all Ukrainians: You must all go to the heart of the Maidan,' he said. Some activists approached police lines, urging officers to come over to their side and even offering them food. As tensions mounted, Mr Yanukovych announced he would meet Ukraine's three former presidents to discuss the situation.

"By . Emily Crane . Charmaine Webster is Australia's invisible woman. The married mother of three can't get herself a driver's licence, a passport or even a fulltime job because her parents failed to register her birth 40 years ago. Mrs Webster, 40, has been locked in a fierce battle with government agencies to be recognised as an Australian citizen ever since she tried to get her licence when she turned 17. Charmaine Webster, 40, has been locked in a fierce battle with government agencies to be recognised as an Australian citizen ever since she tried to get her licence when she turned 17 . But now the Brisbane resident has hit a brick wall and is quickly running out of strength. 'I feel like a freak who doesn't belong anywhere,' Mrs Webster told MailOnline. 'I can't get a licence or passport. I can't even get my own packages delivered to the post office or join a library. I can't do anything that you need to show ID for.' Mrs Webster doesn't even know where she was born because her parents Rexford and Jennifer Black, who were always on the run from police, would strangely never tell her. She is the youngest of five siblings, all of whom can provide a birth certificate. 'I don't care if they found me, gave birth to me or plucked me from the cabbage patch. It's a crime not to register a birth… they committed that crime but I'm being punished,' Mrs Webster said. 'My birthday was never celebrated as a child. Maybe I'm somebody else entirely but I can't get (the government) to investigate it.' Mrs Webster doesn't even know where she was born because her parents would strangely never tell her . Mrs Webster has lived in Queensland since she was 12 but she has early memories of living in Western Australia when she was about three. She lost contact with her parents when she moved out at 16 and has managed to get by since by finding loopholes in government legislation. She's had a tax file number and Medicare card since she was a teenager because you only needed to fill out a form at the post office back then and she has paid taxes from previous jobs and been on the electoral roll for 20-odd years. Mrs Webster married her husband Cameron in 2001 with the help of a friend who happened to be a Justice of the Peace. Charmaine and her husband Cameron live in Brisbane with their children Melissa, Stephen and Tarsha now aged 24, 18 and 15 . She registered for university online and completed a degree in human services at Griffith University in 2011, but it was only when she graduated and was offered a job that things became complicated. 'I couldn't work there without a birth certificate. I would have been working on Christmas Island as a counsellor. Ironically, if I was a boat person I would get more assistance,' she said. 'I have begged the Department of Immigration to help me like they would someone who came here illegally but they won't.' Mrs Webster has contacted every state and territory in Australia for records of her birth but they have all wiped their hands of her. She married her husband Cameron in 2001 with the help of a friend who happened to be a Justice of the Peace .

"By . Emily Crane . A teenage rugby player has died after suffering head injuries when he was knocked out during a match in New Zealand on Saturday. Triplet Jordan Kemp, 17, was taken to hospital via helicopter after the incident during a game in Whangarei, north of Auckland. He was put in an induced coma at the rugby grounds suffering from suspected bleeding on the brain, but died on Sunday afternoon at Auckland City Hospital. Tragedy: Jordan Kemp has died after suffering head injuries during a rugby match in New Zealand on Saturday . He collapsed after a suspected head clash during a game between his club the Otamatea Hawks and the Old Boys Marist. His sister Crishla posted updates on Jordan's condition when he was put on life support on Saturday night following surgery. 'They don't think he's gana make it over night. but my brother is fighter and has to make it he has to!!!!' she wrote. 'He's the other half of me and god only knows the plan he has for my brother but don't take him from us now!' Jordan, pictured here with his sisters Michaela and Crishla, was put in an induced coma at the rugby grounds suffering from suspected bleeding on the brain . Crishla, who was in the helicopter with Jordan when he was airlifted to hospital, posted an emotional tribute on Sunday afternoon saying that he had died at 3.45pm. 'The moment god took you from me... is the moment he took apart of me too,' she said. 'In the end your with us in spirit my bro I know you'll always be watching over us and I love you soooooo much you have no idea my bro save a spot for me up in heaven for me.' The teenager had been cleared to play five weeks ago after suffering a serious head injury at the start of the season, the Northern Advocate reports. Kevin Robinson, the president of Jordan's club Otamatea, was at the game and witnessed the teenager falling to the ground before getting back up on his feet. The teenager had been cleared to play five weeks ago after suffering a serious head injury at the start of the season . 'He fell down but then got up and staggered around before falling over again,' he said. 'He was looked after immediately and the game was called off.' Mr Robinson was also by Jordan's side when he was knocked out by a knee to the head several weeks ago. He had been 'blue-carded' at the start of the season - a system that gives referees the option to order concussed players off the field for three weeks - and had four weeks off from playing. 'That was awful. It was not nice to see,' Mr Robinson said, adding that Jordan had made a full recovery after the first hit.

"By . Mark Prigg . DNA testing is taking a bite out of the Bigfoot legend. After scientists analysed more than 30 hair samples reportedly left behind by Bigfoot and similar mythical beasts like the Himalayan Yeti, they found all of them came from more mundane creatures like bears, wolves, cows and raccoons. In 2012, researchers at Oxford University and the Lausanne Museum of Zoology issued an open call asking museums, scientists and Bigfoot aficionados to share any samples they thought were from the legendary ape-like creatures. Bigfoot - or just a cow? Oxford University genetics professor Bryan Sykes with a DNA sample taken from  hair  from a Himalayan animal.  His team analyzed more than 30 hair samples reportedly left behind by Bigfoot and other related beasts like Yeti and almasty, they found all of them came from more mundane animals like bears, wolves, cows and raccoons. Sykes and colleagues tested 36 hair samples from Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Russia and the U.S. using DNA sequencing and all of them matched DNA from known animals. Most were from bears, but there were also hairs from a Malaysian tapir, horses, porcupine, deer, sheep, and a human. 'I thought there was about a 5 percent chance of finding a sample from a Neanderthal or (a Yeti),' said Bryan Sykes of Oxford University, who led the research, the first peer-reviewed study of Bigfoot, Yeti and other 'anomalous primates.' The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Sykes and colleagues tested 36 hair samples from Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Russia and the U.S. using DNA sequencing and all of them matched DNA from known animals. Most were from bears, but there were also hairs from a Malaysian tapir, horses, porcupine, deer, sheep, and a human. While Sykes said they didn't find any proof of Bigfoot-related creatures, he acknowledged their paper doesn't prove they don't exist. 'The fact that none of these samples turned out to be (a Yeti) doesn't mean the next one won't,' he said. The scientists did find two samples from ancient polar bears in the Himalayas, who are not known to live there. That suggests there could be a new or hybrid bear species out there, Sykes said. Others said proving that Bigfoot is real requires significantly more than a mere hair sample. Researchers say they have not ruled out ever finding bigfoot - and say there may well be undiscovered bear species out there . 'I would want visual or physical proof, like a body part, on top of the DNA evidence,' said Todd Disotell, a professor of anthropology at New York University. He warned Bigfoot enthusiasts not to make assumptions when they find weird things in the forest. 'Every mammal in the forest leaves hair and poop behind and that's what we've found,' he said. 'Just not the big guy himself.' Some experts said that if Bigfoot existed, there would be a lot more to find than just a few errant hairs. 'Those who believe in the Yeti, Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster need basic instruction in sex,' said Stuart Pimm, an ecologist at Duke University, in an email. 'Each Yeti has two parents, four grandparents and so on,' he said. 'There should have been herds of (Yetis),' he wrote. 'Where were they hiding''","Oxford University tested 36 hair samples from Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Russia and the US .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Esa’s comet-chasing Rosetta spacecraft is nearing the most important stage of its mission as it prepares to become the first probe to orbit a comet. It is now just 27,000 miles (43,000 km) away from Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with its arrival scheduled in the coming weeks. And by 6 August controllers at Esa hope that Rosetta will have entered orbit, while a few months later it will unleash the Philae lander onto the surface - the first such landing ever attempted. Esa’s Rosetta spacecraft is now within 27,000 miles (43,000 kilometres) of its comet target. In this series of images, taken by Rosetta’s scientific imaging system Osiris in late June, the Comet 67P can be seen to be rotating, giving the first tantalising hints of its shape. It completes one rotation in just over 12 hours . ‘Rosetta completed the fifth in a series of ten rendezvous manoeuvres required to ensure the spacecraft’s arrival at the comet on 6 August,’ said Esa in a blog post announcing the spacecraft’s close approach. Rosetta, . named after a block of stone that helped archeologists decipher ancient . Egyptian hieroglyphs, will seek to help scientists unlock the . composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and . evolution of our solar system. The . probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five . times, picking up energy from Earth and Mars to line it up with its . final destination: Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. For . the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out . towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space . hibernation. Rosetta will enter orbit around the comet in August, before putting its Philae lander onto the comet’s . surface in November. While in orbit it will perform extensive analysis of the comet's composition, which will provide us with an insight into the history of the solar system and discover the origin of comets. Rosetta is firing its thrusters to cut by almost two thirds the speed with which it's hurtling towards the comet. The agency says Wednesday's burn is the first of four before Rosetta comes within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of the comet in early August, beyond the orbit of Mars. The final rendezvous requires two more precision maneuvers. The probe, launched a decade ago, will spend time observing 67P before dropping a lander onto its icy surface in November. The comet is about 2.5 miles (four km) long and orbits the Sun every six-and-a-half years. Once at the comet Rosetta will follow it on its journey around the sun, performing extensive studies of the coma and the surface. And . in November it will release the Philae . lander, which if successful will be the first vehicle ever to land on a . comet. The spacecraft's speed will be slowed in order to remain in orbit, bringing it to roughly about walking pace relative to the comet. The Rosetta spacecraft launched in 2004 on a mission to study comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (artist's illustration shown). It will rendezvous with the comet later this month before entering orbit in August, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet . In November of this year the Philae lander will be sent to touch down on the surface of the comet (artist's illustration shown), which will be the first landing ever performed on a comet. Here, harpoons will be fired into the surface to keep it anchored while it studies its surroundings . The comet is heading towards the sun, so as it nears the star it will begin to melt more. Even . though it is still more than 370 million miles (600 million kilometres) from the sun - more than four times the distance between Earth and sun - . its surface has already started to warm, causing its ices to turn to . gas and escape from its rock-ice nucleus. As the gas escapes, it also carries a cloud of tiny dust particles out into space, which slowly expands to create the coma. The . warming will continue as the comet moves closer to the sun and activity . rises, and pressure from the solar wind will eventually cause some of . the material to stream out into a long tail. This will give Rosetta some fascinating opportunities to observe the comet's emissions and find out more about its composition. Rosetta and the comet will be closest to the sun in August 2015, when they will be between the orbits of Earth and Mars. On 25 Feb 2007 The Rosetta spacecraft returned this stunning image of Mars as it flew past the red planet on its way to the comet. The picture was taken by an imaging instrument on the Philae lander at a distance of 620 miles (1,000 kilometres). Below the solar array an area close to the Syrtis region is visible on the planet's disk .","Esa's Rosetta spacecraft is getting ready to rendezvous with its target .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A 4,000-year-old burial chamber containing human remains, chariots and an armchair, has been unearthed by archaeologists in Georgia. The Early Bronze Age discovery provides evidence of the rich burials traditions of the nomadic people from the Eurasian steppes. During this time, the nomads were thought to be interacting with the region’s farming communities near the south Caucasus, leading to some individuals being given special status and elaborate burials. A 4,000-year-old burial containing human remains, chariots and an armchair, has been unearthed by archaeologists in Georgia. Pictured here are two of the wheels from one of the two chariots found . The burial chamber was found within a 12 metre (39-foot) high mound called a kurgan near the municipality of Lagodekhi in the south of the country. Within the chamber were a variety of treasures, including two chariots, ornamented clay and wooden pots, flint arrowheads, carnelian and amber beads, an armchair and 23 golden artefacts. Remains of seven ancient humans – three within the chariot - were scattered, and researchers believe they may have been disturbed by a robbery. Among the treasures was this necklace which signals the wealth and status of those buried alongside it . The burial chamber was found within a  39ft (12 metre)  high mound called a kurgan. Pictured is its roof . The chamber included seven skeletons, ornamented clay and wooden pots, flint arrowheads, an armchair and 23 golden artefacts. Pictured are partially-unearthed artefacts found in the chamber . From around 3400 BC to 2000 BC, cattle and sheep raising led to economic stability in early Georgia. The local chieftains appear to have been men of wealth and immense power. Their burial mounds, such as the latest discovery, have yielded finely wrought vessels in gold and silver. A number of these are engraved with ritual scenes suggesting Middle Eastern cult influence. At the end of the 3rd millennium BC, there is evidence of considerable economic development and increased commerce among the tribes. In western Georgia, the unique Colchian culture developed between 1800 and 700 BC. In eastern Georgia the Kurgan culture of Trialeti reached its zenith around 1500 BC. ‘The burial was robbed twice but as it became obvious the robbery took place after the falling the roofing down that partially saved the grave goods,’ said Zurab Makharadze, head of the Centre of Archaeology at the Georgian National Museum. One of the skeletons belonged to that of a chief and others should be the members of his family, sacrificed slaves or servants, according to a report in LiveScience. The burial dates back to a time before domesticated horses appeared in the area, however researchers believe the chariots would have been pulled by oxen. The wooden armchair symbolises the power that individuals like the chief, according to Mr Makharadze. ‘The process of restoration of the artefacts obtained from the kurgan is in progress at the moment,’ he added. ‘During this process a row of interesting information is revealed like the fact that the bones of the dead people were kept in honey that is an indication to balsaming.’ Mr Makharadze is hopeful that further investigation will reveal a great deal more about Early Bronze Age people in this area.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Got a pair of old trainers you think are rubbish? They’ve got nothing on these, which literally are made of garbage found out and about. The bizarre footwear might at first look like they were crafted from high-end materials, but closer inspection reveals their trashy beginnings. The project called ‘Everything you buy is rubbish’ used waste found on UK shores such as the Thames to make the attire. Scroll down for video . Charles Duffy, William Gubbins and Billy Turvey created shoes made from rubbish (pictured) to highlight our waste culture. They say the exercise was a satirical look at how often we throw away things such as old shoes in favour of getting a new pair, where once we would buy products that were long-lasting and reliable . The purpose of the creation was to show how plastic is having a negative effect on our environment. Scientists claim that a ‘green’ biofuel made from waste coffee grounds could power vehicles on our roads. Researchers at the University of Bath said  waste coffee grounds could be a sustainable fuel source for powering vehicles. Around 22lbs (10kg) of leftover grounds, generated by the average coffee shop, produces around two litres of the biofuel. The scientists believe that if this were scaled up nationally, popular high street coffee shops such as Starbucks, Café Nero and Costa Coffee could soon be rivalling oil giants like Shell, BP and Esso. London students Charles Duffy, William Gubbins and Billy Turvey devised the idea together to highlight our waste culture. ‘Whether dumped in a landfill or washed up on the shoreline, everything that you buy will inevitably end up as rubbish,’ they write. ‘With the development of plastic came a utopian promise - that this revolutionary material would change our lives. ‘It has now become so materially ingrained in our lives and environment that it’s becoming increasingly indistinguishable and inseparable from nature. ‘We made these shoes completely out of rubbish we trawled from UK shorelines as a satirical communication tool to convey the direct correlation between waste and consumerism, and the disposability of contemporary products. The multi-coloured shoes were made from trash found on UK shores including the Thames. 'With the development of plastic came a utopian promise - that this revolutionary material would change our lives,' the team said. But they say this has been for the worse, with plastic waste now found everyhwere . The team also made satirical posters to highlight some of the effects of waste and show how they made the shoes. Using twists on popular slogans such as Nike's 'Just do it' the team explained how the trainers are 'a product of your consumption' and representative the negative effect we are having on our environment . The team says the humble shoe is a prime example of the ‘out of sight and out of mind’ legacy of the modern consumer. They say shoes were once hand crafted items that were not only durable but repairable, but now people discard them as soon as they become slightly damaged. And shoes are now so mass produced that it is becoming common to throw them away regularly and get a new pair, rather than getting an existing pair fixed. ‘After you've finished with them they're just another (two) piece(s) of rubbish that are likely to still be around long after your own body has decomposed; we're all leaving behind ourselves a rubbish legacy,' they write. 'We made these shoes completely out of rubbish we trawled from UK shorelines as a satirical communication tool to convey the direct correlation between waste and consumerism, and the disposability of contemporary products,' said the team. There's no news if they have plans for more such clothing in future, though . The team adds that modern culture dictates that people often buy new clothing to maintain their appearance, but it is at the detriment of the environment. ‘We reflect an image of ourselves through our clothing,' they say. ‘The first of our clothing to show signs of damage is footwear. ‘In the eyes of the consumer, a superficial blemish or a shift in the latest trend is all that’s needed to warrant a new purchase. ‘Contemporary footwear spends barely a fraction of its life hugging a foot. ‘For the majority of its life it is rubbish. ‘Whether in a landfill or washed up on a shoreline, the synthetics within the shoes - in addition to the plethora of plastic we discard - will take centuries to break down.'","Three London students have created shoes made from plastic waste .

"By . Cary Cooper, Sports Psychologist . Louis van Gaal is a very wily man. As soon as he made the decision to send on Tim Krul, the Costa Rican players would have started to think ‘this is unusual’ and wonder why he did it. It would have been different had first-choice goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen limped off injured, but to make a change like that would have started to get them thinking Krul must be really good at saving penalties.

They would have begun to consider they need to be really careful when they are taking their spot kicks. It’s not easy when you’re under pressure, when you’re under stress. And in a World Cup that pressure is intensified. Partly that is about the billions watching around the world, but for those taking the penalty it is what their country will think - what their relatives and friends will think. They don’t want to let them down, that’s what hits them. Van Gaal making such a surprising change just before such a high-stress event would have made it much worse for the Costa Ricans. They would have something else to think about. It would play on their minds. It was a clever move. The Costa Ricans would not have known that Krul had only saved two of his last 20 penalties before the shootout. They would never have seen a substitution like this happen before, so they would be thinking it was because he is there to save penalties.

"By . Catherine Ostler . Sicily exists in a freeze-frame hybrid of Visconti’s The Leopard (fading aristocracy, crumbling palaces) and the dissolute glamour of The Godfather — well, it does for me. This intensely romantic island contains the history of three millennia and glories in its extravagant culture and food, its vast ruins, glorious churches, showy bunches of basil and big gnarled lemons. As there are also golden beaches and brioscio (that’s ice cream served in a brioche), I’m hoping that with three children in tow, aged 11, nine and seven, this will be a family holiday that tames the tiny barbarians and invigorates their parents. Superb Sicily: An aerial view shows the Trapani district and San Vito Lo Capo, with Monte Cofano in background . The Leopard is set on the less touristy, wilder, west side of the island, where we are headed, arriving 90 minutes later up a bumpy track at our villa, Corte del Sole. A single-storey farm building converted into an airy, high-ceilinged, three-bathroom house, it’s spacious yet cosy. A pool sparkles at the end of a lush lawn. It is chlorine-free (there are some baby frogs in it at one point; the children want to keep one as a pet) and around it there is an atmospheric hide-and-seek garden full of giant cobwebby cacti and prickly pears. It’s quiet and isolated, overlooking vineyards, wild flower meadows and olive groves all the way across a tideless sea to the distant Egadi Islands. The children could happily spend all week right here, playing something called ‘Marco Polo’ in the pool, reading by the unlit stone fire on the huge sofas (I imagine it could be blissful in winter, too, remote and snug) and playing bridge (their granny has got them addicted) at the outside table in the shade where we eat. But I have other ideas. Ten minutes away is the local town of Trapani, a blowsy beauty, which looks part-spaghetti Western set, part baroque fantasy. It’s low built, with lots of decorative stonework, and seemingly more churches than people. Fun for the whole family: Catherine, with her son and two daughters . Here we have the first brioscio, a calorie bomb of sugary, bread deliciousness the size of a small child’s head. From there, we get a cable car (a hit with the children) up the mountainside to Erice, from where you can see across the salt pans out to the glittery sea. We potter up and down hot cobbled streets, past snoozing dogs, to its finest pastry shop, the Pasticceria Maria Grammatico. It was set up by an orphan, raised by nuns, who taught the 500-year-old convent the art of pastry making. We sit in the shaded garden, among pots of geraniums, eating almond biscuits in paper cups and ice-cool  lemon granita. Crystalline waters: San Vito Lo Capo beach is a must visit on the north west side of the island . Extra treats arrive for the children and the ‘piccolo’, as the smallest child becomes known, is growing accustomed to a cheek pinch from sentimental waiters. As a rule, Sicilians don’t speak English, but their warmth is palpable. Of course we must go to a beach, and San Vito Lo Capo on the north-west tip is a perfect golden arc of sand with a mountain at one end and transparent turquoise sea to swim in. Its backdrop is a laidback, sand-swept town with a strong African Arabic influence. The church was an Arab fortress, though today there are monks praying in white robes. The food at Gna’ Sara, serves the local speciality — fish couscous, which comes with a spicy red sauce. We find it very hard to leave San Vito: my son is building ‘Mount Etna’ in the sand, while the eldest reads and the youngest is pretending to be a dog digging for a bone. Western Sicily has some of the most beautiful Greek ruins in the world. The site of Segesta, less than half an hour from our house, was originally an Elymian city (the people who inhabited Western Sicily before anyone else arrived), and contains a near-perfect Doric temple on top of a hill covered with poppies and yellow daisies. Picturesque: The salt flats between Trapani and Marsala are punctuated by two old windmills . Up the hill are the remains of the old city and its jewel, an amphitheatre with a panoramic view from the top of Mount Barbaro. It looks deceptively small; its smooth marble seats, now occupied by a few weeds and the odd lizard, once sat 4,000 in an intimate semi-circle. The children can’t resist hopping around on stage; the acoustics are still powerful. ‘Friends, Romans, countrymen . . .’ declares the eldest . . . what’s a few centuries out when you get this far back. The next day we are at Segesta’s mortal rival of a city, Selinunte, on the coast. Here there is a well-preserved network of temples. One lies just as it has fallen; huge pillars scattered in blocks like immense Lego. Once it was a gleaming stone colony with thousands of inhabitants; you can sense still how prosperous it must have been. At dusk, it is almost empty, and a wonderful place for the children to play make-believe. On day four, there is a revolt. Though they have ‘loved it all’ the barbarians, annoyingly backed up by my husband, think I have over-played the culture card. They try to hide my list and declare a ‘villa day’. They will be padding around the cool stone floors and reading in the sun or on the admittedly very comfortable four poster in the girls’ bedroom. The youngest has just discarded armbands so is desperate to practise her widths in the shallow end. After a short walk to the local shop, we have a picnic lunch, made in the well-stocked, open-plan kitchen; creamy cheeses, mortadella, tomato salad. That night a chef (booked through Think Sicily) comes to cook us supper, and the children, amazingly, eat tuna carpaccio, swordfish, and less amazingly, cannoli, the local speciality of ricotta in sweet fried dough. Cobbled streets: Catherine and her family enjoyed pottering around the mountaintop town of Erice . Enough lounging around. The next day I’ve seen off the mutiny and we are out again, at the salt pans on the flat plains leading to the sea; those strange, pale expanses of water and salt, punctuated by old windmills that separate the two. Piles of salt lie in small mountains by the road, with tiles on top to keep them dry. We take a short boat trip from the pans to the ancient island of Mozia, one of four islands in the Stagnone lagoon off the west coast. Here lie the remains of another lost civilisation: a Phoenician city from the 8th century BC, centuries before the Greeks arrived. A Sicilian-British heir to the Marsala wine fortune excavated the island and turned his villa into an archaeological museum. There are pots and lamps and tiny gold jewellery, while its treasure, ‘the youth of Mozia’, a sophisticated Greek marble statue of a young boy has just been returned from the Getty Museum. Mozia is hot, historic and incredibly pretty. Like the rest of the family, I fell totally in love with it — and with Sicily and its vigorous, grubby elegance, and barely felt we’d taken the first layer off the brioche.

"By . Beci Wood . New York is the city that never sleeps – and seemingly never stops working too. The rise of smartphones and tablets has helped people to work on the go. But now a new report from Ikea has revealed they like to work when they go too. The Swedish furniture giant has published a new study called Life At Home which looks at the morning habits of residents in Berlin, London, Moscow, Mumbai, New York, Shanghai and Stockholm. On the go: The Ikea survey revealed New Yorkers are most likely to use their smartphones when they first wake up - including on the loo . It spoke to around 1,000 respondents in each city, aged between 18 to 60. And it has emerged 17 per cent of workoholic New Yorkers admit they conduct their business in the bathroom. While, according to the survey, Londoners wish they were having sex . while only eight per actually do in the morning. But 14 per cent of . residents make time to pray once a week. The report says: 'Traditional room functions are long gone, and we seem to do whatever, wherever and whenever - something which our new digital savviness allows. 'New Yorkers have no issue conducting their business where other business is traditionally done.' Wakey wakey! Londoners are more likely to start the day with prayer than any other city . Sweden surprisingly matches New York in multi-tasking while on the toilet while the remainder of the cities surveyed average around 10 per cent. But in contrast to Sweden's liberal reputation, sex is low down on their agenda early on in the day. Interestingly it's Mumbai who comes out on top in terms of intimacy and bedroom habits. An impressive 13 per cent of Mumbaikars get regular nookie in the mornings. And unsurprisingly 63 per cent of locals revealing they feel most happy and calm early on in the day. These figures are in stark contrast to every other country surveyed, with Moscow and Paris emerging as the most stressed. Shanghai is the least touchy-feely city with one in four people say they are never affectionate with their partner. At a whopping 70 pages long the report goes into A LOT of detail. New York: . 50 per cent of people crave morning sex but only nine . per cent actually do. Desperate to get to the office less than half of . New York eats breakfast. But nearly half of all New Yorkers who make the . time for breakfast do so with a smartphone or computer in hand. London: . Praying . is more common in London than any other European city, with 14 per cent . of all Londoners doing it at least once a week on weekday mornings. Londoners have emerged as being rather slow in the mornings with a majority rising at 7am or later. But 59 . per cent wish they had more time for sex, citing cuddling in bed with . their loved one as important but only eight per cent starting their day . with sex. Paris: . It's second only . to Moscow in terms of how much stress its citizens feel about how they . look. And while we usually think of Parisians oozing with confidence, . it’s emerges they are least confident about their appearance than any . other city. Stressed out: Parisians are the least confident about their appearance in the morning, says the survey . Mumbai: . 13 per cent of them admit to getting jiggy regularly before they go to work. 63 per cent are their happiest in the morning, with many say . they feel 'calm and peaceful'. Moscow: . 40 per cent of Moscow's women feel that the morning is their most anxious time of the day. Worried . about their appearance, women say an extensive beauty regime is very . important. 71 per cent declare weekday morning makeup a must, compared . to just over half among all other surveyed women. Berlin: . 42 . per cent of them consider themselves as evening people so have no issue . in pressing snooze more than once. Berliners are also more relaxed . about how they look: only 13 per cent feel nervous about their . appearance when they leave home. Shanghai: . The . Chinese capital doesn’t rate high in the sex and cuddling questions in .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . George Osborne today rejected pleas from refusenik Tory Cabinet ministers for another round of cuts to welfare to raise £11.5billion for 2015-16. The Chancellor insisted tax rises and benefits cuts have raised enough money already, and warned other departments will not be let 'off the hook' by complaining about which areas are not being targeted again. It came as Mr Osborne announced he has reached agreement with seven government departments on making extra cuts of up to 10 per cent, he ruled out returning to the welfare budget for more. Chancellor George Osborne, who today addressed workers at the Port Of Liverpool during a visit to mark the start of the dredging of the River Mersey Estuary, has reached agreement on £1billion in cuts with seven government departments . Senior Tory ministers including Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson have resisted some cuts to their budgets, arguing benefits could be reduced further to protect the military and flood defences. But Mr Osborne said major savings were already being made to benefits, and he would not let other ministers ‘off the hook’. The Chancellor is understood to be delighted that seven departments have already signed off savings of up to 10 per cent, including Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles who were reported to be resisting cuts. A Treasury source said: 'We are impress by Eric and Chris. Clearly these are ministers who have put their money where their mouth is and are very serious about making sure every penny of taxpayers' money is spent effectively.' The Chancellor warned ministers resisting cuts of up to 10 per cent that he would not go back to the benefits budget to raise money . George Osborne has reached agreement with seven of 24 departments on making savings of up to 10 per cent for 2015-16. But . they are relatively small in comparison to the big spending ministries . like business (£13.8billion), education (£53.8billion) and defence . (£24.5billion) (All figures are budget totals for 2014-15) However, Mr Osborne has made clear to . other ministers yet to settle cuts will that he will not be diverted by . calls for more benefits cuts. The benefits cap, announced last year . limiting increases in working age benefits to one per cent, is already . due to raise £3.4billion in 2015-16. Mr Osborne said: 'We are cutting welfare and we’re cutting welfare for the future as well. ‘We’re going to make sure that no family that stays at home on benefits gets more than the average family going out to work and we’re also making sure that welfare bills don’t go up faster than wages, so there are big savings in welfare. ‘But I would also say that’s not an excuse to let Whitehall off the hook. ‘We’ve also got to make savings there so we can fix our economy, bring that deficit down and spend on the things people want us to spend on like the NHS, like the infrastructure that’s going to create jobs in the future.’ Several Tory ministers have called for deeper cuts to benefits to help balance the books. The under-25s would be barred from receiving housing benefit and families would only receive state help for their first two children under plans outlined by David Cameron last year, but rejected by the Liberal Democrats. Nick Clegg's party has argued any further benefits cuts have to start with targeting handouts like the winter fuel allowance and free TV licence for very wealthy pensioners. Business Secretary Vince Cable made clear that Liberal Democrats will resist further welfare cuts targeted at the poor, telling Sky News: 'Simply taking more off people at the bottom end of the scale is not the right way to proceed. 'The Liberal Democrats have said if we are going to look at entitlements, it's got to be people at the top that we start with.' Deal: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers are among seven ministers to agree cuts of up to 10 per cent to their budgets . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith today denied claims he had offered more benefits cuts to spare the armed forces and police. Counter-terror budgets could be protected from cuts in the wake of the brutal killing of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich last week. Chancellor George Osborne vowed he would not do anything to endanger Britain's security at home or abroad. The Ministry of Defence and the Home Office are among departments told to find up to 10 per cent savings. Mr Osborne was asked whether he could protect the budget for counter-terrorism. He told BBC1's Breakfast: ‘We've been able to protect it in the past and I'm not going to do anything which is going to endanger the security of this country at home or abroad or the fight against terrorism, but that doesn't mean that you can't take a vast institution like the Home Office and look for savings.’ David Cameron's official spokesman told reporters the Prime Minister agreed with Mr Osborne's comments, but declined to confirm whether this amounted to a guarantee that the anti-terror budget would escape the axe. The Daily Telegraph today reported . that Mr Duncan Smith has personally contacted the Defence and Home . Secretaries with an offer to cut the welfare bill by another £3 billion . each year to protect spending on the armed forces and police. But a spokeswoman for Mr Duncan Smith . said: 'Iain has not had any special discussions about protecting the . defence or security budgets. These measures were on the table at the . time of the Autumn Statement.' Next month Mr Osborne will set out . departmental budgets for 2015-16, the financial year which spans the . general election due in May 2015. Under . the spending review Mr Osborne needs to find £11.5billion in savings . for 2015-16. At the Budget he announced £1.5billion had already been . found. Today he revealed he has now found £1billion from the first seven departments to agree their share of the cuts. They . include the Ministry of Justice, Foreign Office, Department for . Communities and Local Government, Department for Energy and Climate . Change, the Northern Ireland Office, the Treasury and the Cabinet . Office. However, it does not include big spending ministries like the Home Office or Ministry of Defence. In the wake of the brutal killing of . Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich last week, the police, armed forces and . security services have stepped up their opposition to further cuts. Defence . Secretary Philip Hammond argued in March that there was a ‘body of . opinion within cabinet who believes that we have to look at the welfare . budget again’. However, Mr Osborne ruled it out while insisting national security will be protected. ‘The key thing is to make sure we maintain our ability to defend ourselves at home and abroad, and of course that's an absolute priority for us. ‘That doesn't mean you can't find savings in the way these big departments operate, including the Ministry of Defence.’ Risk: Environment ministers have warned the Treasury that extra cuts could leave flood defences vulnerable . Resistance: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has warned more cuts to his budget could threaten flood defences while Defence Secretary Philip Hammond called for more welfare cuts to protect the armed forces . A defence source said Mr Hammond had . agreed 'further genuine efficiency savings can be achieved' in his . ministry and work was continuing with the Treasury and Cabinet Office. 'This . follows a decision by the Prime Minister, a few months ago, that the . Cabinet Secretary should lead a review into what further efficiencies . could be made at the MoD without affecting frontline capability,' the . source added. Downing Street today rejected the idea of the wholesale sell-off of the courts service. One money-saving option being drawn . up for Justice Secretary Chris Grayling would involve the privatisation . of courts in England and Wales. Court . buildings and staff would be transferred into the private sector, with . the potential to save £1billion-a-year, The Times reported. But David Cameron's officials spokesman insisted the focus was finding savings was on cutting 'back office' costs. 'There aren't proposals for the wholesale privatisation of the courts service,' he added. 'We have been very clear that any future changes must maintain the provision of justice as a core responsibility of the state.' 'That piece of work is expected to finish soon. Once this review is complete, MoD will be in a position to make a Spending Review submission to the Treasury.' The Ministry of Justice, which has a . budget of £6.8billion for 2014-15, is the biggest to agree cuts of 10 . per cent for the following year. But Mr Osborne insisted the 10 per cent savings announced today did not include courts privatisation. He told the BBC's Today programme: ‘These plans do not involve the privatisation of the criminal justice system. ‘They . do propose things like making sure we use much less paper. I discovered . as part of this process the Crown Prosecution Service prints one . million pieces of paper every day. In an age of the internet and emails, . that surely isn't necessary. ‘But . we are also making reforms to youth justice to make sure we can hold . youngsters in detention without the very substantial costs at the . moment.’ Paul Johnson, director of the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, warned more cuts lie ahead for Mr Osborne. ‘The bad news for him and, actually, for whoever wins the next election is he’s got a whole bunch of additional spending cuts pencilled in for the years after 2015-16 which is the only year that this Spending Review is looking at. ‘It’s looking at it now because departments are going to need some sense of how much they’re going to have to spend in 2015 and, of course, that financial year starts just before the next election.’ He warned that unprotected departments like the Home Office and Defra will have been hit by cuts of around 30 per cent over six years while areas like health and pensions have survived unscathed. Labour's shadow financial secretary Chris Leslie said: 'This is a spending review David Cameron and George Osborne never wanted or expected to happen. 'They said their plan would balance the books by the next election, but their failure on growth and jobs means the deficit is now set to be over £90 billion in 2015. That's why the Chancellor is now asking for even more spending cuts, with most big departments yet to reach agreement.'","Seven of 24 departments agree new round of cuts for 2015-16 .

"By . Julian Robinson . This is the heart stopping moment a toddler appears to dangle from the fifth floor balcony of a high rise building in Brazil – while his mother was reportedly asleep inside. Crowds screamed 50ft below as the boy, thought to be about three years old, appeared to cling to the ledge of an apartment block in Vila Velha, a town on the country’s east coast. It was later claimed that the child’s mother was asleep inside at the time, oblivious to her son’s plight. Scroll down for video . The three-year-old appeared to be clinging on to the fifth floor balcony of a block of flats in Brazil . The drama, which lasted more than a minute, was caught on film as onlookers desperately cried out, Ninemsn reports. One man positioned himself under the balcony as rescuers dashed to the youngster’s aid. A waiter working opposite told Brazilian website Midia Con News that customers were ‘crying at the sight’ before he ran out to help. Perilous: The youngster appears to be holding on to the outside of the balcony on a ledge as people screamed down below . Other residents in the block watch look up as the drama unfolded in the coastal town of Vila Velha on Brazil's east coast .

Eventually he was rescued by Bruno Teixeira who told Midia Con News that the boy’s mother was asleep in the apartment the whole time. Mr Teixeira said: 'When we saw the boy hanging we ran without looking. The child was eventually rescued by a man who said the youngster's mother was asleep in the flat . 'When we arrived at the apartment the room door was open and the balcony was closed. (The boy's) mother was asleep. She should be more responsible with her son's life.' Despite his ordeal, the youngster was said to have escaped injury.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Ditch the helmets for flat caps and switch bright jackets for a grey cardigans to blend in with the locals and avoid scaring the sheep - this is a Yorkshire man's video advice to the Tour de France riders when the grand race begins in July. Alistaire MacGregor's tongue-in-cheek video for those joining British hopes Chris Froome, Mark Cavendish and Bradley Wiggins for the opening three stages of Le Tour in Britain has gone viral with its broad-ranging advice extending to pies and peas, livestock, the weather and the best-suited footwear for traversing wet roads - it's clogs, by the way. The video saw 10,000 hits in its first few hours of posting on YouTube and has soared over 60,000 views, attracting attention from around the world. Scroll down for video . Acclimatising: Tour de France champion Chris Froome (centre front) has been training in Yorkshire, where the famous race begins in July . Too shiny!: On Yorkshire local Alistaire MacGregor's tongue-in-cheek viral video advice, Le Tour's yellow jersey and the riders' helmets could scare the sheep in the area . Baa-reakaway group: Thousands of spectators are expected to join the sheep as the elite cyclists contest the opening stages of the sport's premier race . Stage 1:  Saturday, July 5, Leeds to Harrogate . Stage 2: Sunday, July 6, York to Sheffield . Stage 3: Monday, July 7, Cambridge to London . Alistaire, from Holmfirth in West Yorkshire, says he was inspired to make the video after seeing an elderly man attempting to push a rusty bike up one of the Tour's climbs. 'The bike must have weighed more than a car, with all this heavy gear on,' he said. 'I just thought what a difference in technology now where they all have carbon frames. 'It made me smile and consider how hardy Yorkshire folk are. Nothing phases us, and it's going to be fantastic up here when the Tour de France arrives next month. 'I jotted down a few ideas and mixed in a few jokes about Yorkshire attitudes.' The video features figures from Norah Batty to Chris Froome among a series of great Yorkshire landscapes, as Alistaire speaks with a dubious Yorkshire accent over a hearty soundtrack. He can cheekily be heard telling the cyclists set to race that they 'need to know one thing - we don't like bright colours as it scares the sheep' and so asks them to 'pop on brown or grey cardies over your top while you're cycling around'. Local headdress: Helmets will look out of place in Yorkshire, so blend in with a customary flat cap . Kitted out: Britain's Mark Cavendish is not just a top cyclist but also a world class cardigan wearer . On the four-minute video, he also comments that having heard people are coming from south of Sheffield, he also suggests spectators wear a 'heavy duty donkey-jacket' as it can get a 'bit blowy'. MacGregor politely asks that the last cyclist in the group 'shuts the gate behind them to keep the sheep in, as they don't want them getting off everywhere'. He also suggests riders leave their 'shiny, strange looking' helmets off the road in favour of a flat cap and that the king of the mountain classification may have to change it's name as there was . only one King in Yorkshire, England cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott. Alistaire, a tennis coach, also had an ulterior motive for the video to promote his Tour de France camp site, The Camp on Holme Moss, which he's set up for visitors during the race's British sojourn. He said: 'There's a lot of people charging a lot of money for camping during the Tour de France which I thought was very unfair. Royalty: There's only one king of Yorkshire, says MacGregor, and that's cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott . Mountain stage: MacGregor was inspired to make the video by an elderly man pushing a bike up Holme Moss . 'Everyone was moaning on Facebook so I got in contact with a local farmer and set up a proper camp site really close so people can walk up there. 'We've had hundreds of people book in to stay and we're by far the biggest campsite in the area now. Even the BBC are planning to stay here, I'm told.' Alistaire is expecting spectators from as far afield as the US to stay at The Camp on Holme Moss and the video's done his marketing no harm. 'Everyone seems to love it,' said Alistaire. 'It shows how amazing the Tour de France is going to be. 'There's a few coming from America, and also people from France and Spain, so we're expecting a great atmosphere. 'We're all very excited.' And a final bit of advice from Alistaire - 'Don't forget wellies!'","Yorkshire local's advice video to Tour de France riders goes viral .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An inmate in a New York jail costs just as much as four years' tuition at an Ivy League college according to a new report. The city's annual cost per inmate was $167,731 last year or $460 per day. The Department of Corrections (DOC) blames much of the expense on the running costs of the city's most notorious lockup, Rikers Island which is literally an island unto itself. Expensive inmates: Inmates file out of the prison bakery at Rikers Island, the notorious jail blamed for New York City's high annual inmate costs. Last year they spent $167,731 ($460 per day) on each inmate . Martin Horn, who in 2009 resigned as the city's correction commissioner, noted that hundreds of millions of dollars are spent a year to run the 400-acre island in the East River next to the runways of LaGuardia Airport that has 10 jail facilities, thousands of staff and its own power plant and bakery. He said: 'Other cities don't have Rikers Island.' The city's Independent Budget Office annual figure of $167,731 - which equates to about $460 per day for the 12,287 average daily New York City inmates last year - was based on about $2 billion in total operating expenses for the DOC, which included salaries and benefits for staff, judgments and claims as well as debt service for jail construction and repairs. But there are particularly expensive costs associated with Rikers. Rikers Island: The 400-acre compound is in the East River next to the runways of LaGuardia Airport and has 10 jail facilities, thousands of staff and its own power plant and bakery . The . department says it spends $30.3 million annually alone on . transportation costs, running three bus services that usher inmates to . and from court throughout the five boroughs, staff from a central . parking lot to Rikers jails and visitors to and around the island. There were 261,158 inmates delivered to court last year. A . way to bring down the costs, Horn has long said, would be to replace . Rikers Island with more robust jails next door to courthouses. But his . attempts to do that failed in part because of political opposition from . residential areas near courthouses in Brooklyn, Manhattan and elsewhere. He said of the budget figure: ‘My . point is: Have you seen a whole lot of outcry on this? Why doesn't . anything happen? Because nobody cares.’ ‘That's the reason we have Rikers Island. We want these guys put away out of public view.’ New York's annual costs dwarf the . annual per-inmate costs in other big cities. Los Angeles spent $128.94 a . day, or $47,063 a year, for 17,400 inmates in fiscal year 2011-12, its . sheriff's office said. Doing time: The Department of Corrections says that the jail's transport alone costs $30.3 million annually . The cost of college: The city's cost per inmate at jails such as Rikers Island (left) cost nearly as much as four years tuition at an Ivy League university such as Harvard (right) Chicago . spent $145 a day, or $52,925 a year, for 13,200 inmates in 2010, the . most recent figures available from that county's sheriff's office. Those . costs included debt-service and fringe benefits.Experts . note that New York's high annual price tag is deceiving because it . reflects considerable pensions and salary responsibilities, debt service . and the expensive fixed costs. The DOC says 86 per cent of its operating costs go for staff wages. New . York's system differs from other cities in some other costly ways - it . employs 9,000 relatively well-paid, unionised correction officers, for . example, and is required by law to provide certain services to inmates, . including high quality medical care within 24 hours of incarceration. Nick . Freudenberg, a public health professor at Hunter College, said the . latest city figures show that declining incarceration rates have not . translated into cost savings. In . 2001, when the city had 14,490 inmates, the full cost of incarcerating . one inmate at Rikers Island for a year was $92,500, or about $122,155 . adjusted for today's dollars - that means the city spent $45,576 more in . 2012 than it did 11 years ago. No worries: Martin Horn, who in 2009 resigned as the city's correction commissioner, says that so much money is spent on the 400-acre jail because 'nobody cares' Prof Freudenberg said: ‘To my mind, the main policy question is: How could we be spending this money better? What would be a better return on that investment?’ Another contributing factor to the inmate price tag is the length of stay for prisoners in New York's criminal justice system. Some inmates have waited years in city jails to see trial. The DOC said in 2012 that the average length of stay for detainees was 53 days and 38.6 days for sentenced inmates. Michael Jacobson, a former commissioner of the city's Department of Correction and probation who serves as director of the CUNY Institute for State and Local Governance, said: ‘Not only is that a miscarriage of justice, it affects your operations. ‘You want to save big money? Take a quarter out just by improving the process they go through when they're in the system.’","Inmates at New York City's jails cost $167,731 every year ($460 per day)

Dee Dee Kay, director of sales at the lodge, told MailOnline the signs were designed by Dennis Brandon, who works as a consultant for the lodge's parent company. 'It is a 5 minute drive up the side of Sugarloaf Mountain [to the hotel],' Kay said. 'There are several switchbacks and for some a bit of an adventure. The signs provide a conversation piece and give our guests a chuckle.' Kay said there are no signs inside the hotel, but that the sign with the large mosquito is available for sale in magnet form. 'The [road sign] collection has been added to each year,' Joe Merrill, the hotel's general manager, told CNN. 'The ideas [for the signs] now come out of different peoples' minds.'

"By . Snejana Farberov . An elementary school teacher from Florida was arrested after police say they discovered nude photos of her on a cell phone belonging to a 17-year-old boy. Lesley Brown, 45, a married mother from Largo, Florida, was caught entering a unisex bathroom inside the Highland Recreation Center with a teenage boy Monday, according to police. Witnesses said the pair stayed inside the restroom for 10 minutes behind a closed door, raising suspicions of inappropriate behavior. 'Bad teacher': Fourth-grade teacher Lesley Brown, 45 (pictured left in mugshot) has been charged with transmission of material harmful to minors for allegedly sending lewd photos and texts to a 17-year-old boy . Caught in the act: Police were called to the Highland Recreation Center after Brown was spotted going into a unisex bathroom with the teen and staying there for 10 minutes . Police officers who were called to the scene questioned Brown and the teen, who both told them the 17-year-old was acting as the woman's workout partner and spotter, the station Fox 13 reported. Brown and her young companion insisted that nothing had happened between them in the bathroom, but Brown was issued a trespass warning by gym staffers. Later that night, however, investigators obtained naked pictures of the married elementary school teacher from the teenager's phone, as well as X-rated text messages from her. Mrs Brown was taken into custody Tuesday and charged with felony transmission of material harmful to minors. She was released from jail this morning after posting $5,000 bond. Gym rat: The woman told police officers that she works out at the gym three times a week and that the teen was her workout partner .

"By . Richard Kay . The husband of the headmistress at a . leading boarding school has been banned from teaching after striking up . an inappropriate relationship with a teenage pupil. Dr John Triffitt – who is now divorced . from his wife Jayne – exchanged ‘personal’ text messages, emails and . phone calls with the ‘highly vulnerable’ girl when she was not yet 16. He did not teach full time at . Woldingham School but gave extra tuition to outstanding pupils at the . £27,000-a-year establishment in Surrey whose old girls include Great . Gatsby actress Carey Mulligan, 28, and former Tory MP Louise Mensch, 41. The husband of Jayne Triffitt (pictured right), the headmistress of Woldingham School, has been banned from teaching after engaging in a relationship with a pupil. Carey Mulligan (left) was a pupil at the school . Dr Triffitt, 54, was found guilty of ‘unacceptable professional conduct’ by the Government’s Teaching Agency. He and his ex-wife jointly own a . holiday home at Truro in Cornwall, and Dr Triffitt is understood to have . moved back to the area in recent months. His relationship with a pupil at . Woldingham happened some four years ago but the school, which is set in . 700 acres near Oxted, said yesterday that an allegation concerning Dr . Triffitt was brought to its attention only in May 2011. Educational authorities investigated . and ruled last December after a professional conduct hearing that Dr . Triffitt will never be allowed to teach again. A panel of the Teaching . Agency told in a report how he ‘engaged in an inappropriate relationship . with a vulnerable student which exploited his position of trust’. The girl – now thought to be studying . at university – is said to have ‘confided and discussed a number of . highly personal matters with Dr Triffitt’ and they soon began exchanging . emails as they began an ‘increasingly co-dependent’ relationship. The panel felt that the girl – named only as Student A – was a highly vulnerable and susceptible individual. The £27,000-a-year Woldingham School is set in 700 acres and was founded in 1842 . The hearing was told: ‘Dr Triffitt . also kept a diary towards the end of their relationship to record his . feelings towards the student – he would then give the diary to the . student. There were also occasions when they would meet alone.’ The panel said: ‘We have noted that the acts alleged, whilst unacceptable, have not been subject to criminal prosecution. ‘We have noted that during the . relevant time he was under significant stress and he has presented . evidence to show that he was the subject of psychiatric concerns – he . admitted himself to hospital. Whilst his previously unblemished career . does act as mitigation for him, we are concerned that his extensive . experience did not prevent him from engaging in such highly . inappropriate behaviour.’ The report concluded: ‘Dr John . Triffitt is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in . any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or . children’s home in England. ‘Furthermore, in view of the . seriousness of the allegation found proved against him... Dr John . Triffitt shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of his . eligibility to teach.’ Former pupils include The Great Gatsby star Carey Mulligan (left) and ex-Tory MP Louise Mensch (right) Mrs Triffitt, who was appointed to her . post in 2007, declined to comment yesterday at the red-brick cottage in . the Woldingham School grounds where she lives with her two children. However the highly-rated school said . in a statement: ‘In May 2011 an allegation was brought to the school’s . attention concerning a member of staff at the school, Dr John Triffitt. The day the  allegation was received, Dr Triffitt left the school and . resigned from his post shortly afterwards. The school adhered strictly . to safeguarding procedures and immediately contacted the child . protection authorities for them to investigate the matter. During the 18 . months of the inquiry the school notified the relevant professional . authorities and co-operated fully with investigations into the matter up . to and including its conclusion. ‘On 4 December 2012, the Teaching . Agency considered the matter and found Dr Triffitt guilty of . unacceptable professional conduct and conduct that may bring the . profession into disrepute. The Teaching Agency recommended that Dr . Triffitt be prohibited from teaching indefinitely. The Prohibition Order . is published on their website. As the Teaching Agency website makes . clear the Prohibition Order was made without naming the school or the . student involved. ‘This was done in order to protect the . welfare of the girl concerned. A young person’s welfare could be . impacted adversely by unnecessary speculation or further publication.’","Dr John Triffitt, 54, sent texts and e-mails to girl who was under 16 .

"By . Leon Watson . The Vatican has recognised a supposed miracle attributed to Paul VI and will beatify the late Italian pope in October, which would leave him one step from sainthood, a Vatican source said today. Paul VI reigned between 1963 and 1978 and presided over key reforms from the Second Vatican Council. During his reign, he also survived an assassination attempt at Manila airport in 1970 by a Bolivian surrealist painter. Miracles do happen: President John F Kennedy meeting Pope Paul VI in Vatican City on his tour of Europe in 1963 . Pope Paul VI and Raul Francisco Primatesta shake hands in this file photo during a private audience in Vatican City in 1973 . The Italian news agency ANSA reported that the apparent miracle identified by the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints was the healing of an unborn baby from an otherwise incurable illness. ANSA said the beatification could occur on October 19. Two late popes, John Paul II and John XXIII, were given full sainthood in a Vatican ceremony last month. Catholic Church procedures require one miracle attributed for beatification, which confers the status of 'blessed' on the person in question, and two miracles for canonisation to join the ranks of saints. Pope Francis, flanked by Swiss Guards Commander Daniel Rudolf Anrig, greets new Swiss Guards the day before their swearing-in ceremony, as he arrives to meet them in the Clementine hall at the Vatican yesterday . Pope Francis passes by a tapestry depicting late Pope John Paul II as he leaves at the end of his weekly general audience, at the Vatican . The tapestry showing Pope John XXIII during the canonisation mass of Popes John XXIII and John Paul II on St Peter's at the Vatican . Paul VI was praised for his efforts to seek closer ties with other Christian denominations but his 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae was controversial for spelling out a ban on all forms of artificial contraception. The application for beatification was begun in 1993. One million people fill St Peter's Square to witness Pope Francis and retired Benedict XVI make saints of John XXIII and John Paul II last month . The Vatican's detailed process for . making a saint usually starts in the diocese where the candidate lived . or died. A postulator — essentially the cheerleader spearheading the . project — gathers testimony and documentation to build the case and . presents the report to the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of . Saints. If the congregation's experts agree the candidate lived a . virtuous life, the case is forwarded to the pope who signs a decree . attesting to the candidate's 'heroic virtues.' Over . time, the postulator may come across information that someone was . miraculously healed by praying to the candidate. If, upon further . investigation, the cure cannot be medically explained, the case is . presented to the congregation as the possible miracle needed for . beatification. Panels of doctors, theologians, bishops and cardinals . must certify that the cure was instantaneous, complete and lasting — and . was due to the intercession of the sainthood candidate. If convinced, . the congregation sends the case to the pope who signs a decree saying . the candidate can be beatified. A second miracle is needed for . canonization. Beatification . allows for veneration of the candidate locally, say in a particular . diocese or country. Canonization allows for veneration throughout the . universal church. Martyrs, . or people who were killed for their faith, get a free pass and can be . beatified without a miracle. A miracle is needed, however, for martyrs . to be canonized.","Paul VI reigned between 1963 and 1978 and presided over key reforms .

"By . Judy Cogan . A glamorous British fashion designer and former model who triumphed over breast cancer and a double mastectomy has appeared topless in a courageous photoshoot. Claire Farwell, 45, a mother-of-two from Devonshire, England beat the disease, which affects one in 8 women in the UK, and decided to proudly reveal her post-operation body, scars and all. She was inspired by the Scar Project, a 126-page book containing 50 portraits of young breast cancer survivors, shot by fashion photographer David Jay. Brave: Claire in one of the topless photos she modelled for in 2012 - two years after her double mastectomy . 'He took these amazing documentary type photographs, but I felt it was so sad. Some were crying,’ she explains. 'While it’s a beautiful project, I didn't want that, I wanted to say ""here I am!"" I wanted to do a shoot about how I feel as a person, not what I look like. In 2012 Claire bravely agreed to appear in a series of black and white photos - shot by renowned photographer Byron Atienza. 'I realised I did not for one second feel any less of a woman from having my breasts taken away,’ she said. ‘I feel even more of a woman today than ever! 'I don't look (at the photos) and say, ‘I wish I had a nipple’. I don't have nipples and I’ve got used to looking like a Barbie doll.' Despite the pain and heartbreak she suffered during her battle with breast cancer, Claire is adamant it has changed her life for the better. Not missed: Claire says she doesn't miss having nipples and is relieved to be in remission . Support: Claire, who now lives in Los Angeles, with her husband and two small daughters . Today, the former fashion model – who lived and worked with Naomi Campbell in Paris in the 80s - runs her own fashion label while juggling life as a mother and wife. She took part in in campaigns alongside . Claudia Schiffer and Naomi Campbell for Gianfranco Ferrè, Nivea and Speedo, . and appeared in French Elle and Vogue. But despite her stylish background, the idea for her own label didn't come about until October 2011, when, while still in remission, Claire organised a fund raising event to raise money for breast cancer charities. 'I said, ""let’s put on a party! Let’s make money for breast cancer."" So I threw an event for 300 people, and thought it made sense to do a fashion show.’ But when she didn’t like what local designers had to offer, she took matters into her own hands. With no formal design training, Claire made 24 dresses by hand, which appeared on the catwalk and were then sold at auction. She adds: ‘People told me, ""you need to do this full time!"" so I did!’ In 2012 Claire Farwell London was launched – described on the website as ‘elegant, comfortable and unique designs with a British accent.’ Heyday: Claire poses with Naomi Campbell in an 80s editorial shoot in French Elle . Looking good: Since winning her fight with breast cancer, Claire has gone on to become a successful designer . Important: Claire says her topless shoot post breast cancer is the most important she's ever done . 'It’s for the practical, cheeky and classy woman, who lives life and tells her story through fashion,' explains Claire. 'My label featured in Nolcha Fashion Week – part of New York Fashion Week last year – that never would have happened if I hadn’t fought cancer and won. 'Breast cancer gave me this creativity, and now I’m building a brand I’m so passionate about.' An online store is to come next and Hollywood celebrities such as Eva Longoria and Carrie Keagan have been spotted in her designs. But it has been a long and rocky journey for Claire since being diagnosed with breast cancer in November of 2009 aged 40. 'I had been feeling really, really tired, so I decided to go to the doctors for a check-up,' she remembers. 'I’ve always been healthy, so I knew by the way I was feeling that something was wrong.' Tests confirmed that her Vitamin D levels were dangerously low - a common symptom of cancer. Claire has a mammogram in December of 2009, and shortly afterwards, results from a biopsy confirmed she had breast cancer. ‘I remember the moment they told me,’ she adds. ‘I was in a clothes store, naked, complaining that I couldn’t wear a beautiful, low backed top, because I’d have to wear a bra. And then the doctor rang. You drop everything when the doctor calls.’ Doctors insisted on a lumpectomy to determine whether the cancer had spread. The results were unclear, so Claire had the mastectomy. 'I had the choice to have a single mastectomy,' she said. 'But I opted for the double mastectomy. For me I don't want to worry psychologically about the other one.' Despite enduring a five-hour operation to remove her breasts in February 2010, she opted to have reconstructive surgery just two months later. Positive: Claire, pictured with husband Gus (left) and in her modelling days, says she feels very lucky . 'My husband and I would joke: “How big shall we go?” You have to see the humour, otherwise what’s the point? I have no feeling in my nipples at all, that's a shame. I don't have any nipples. 'When the doctors asked, “do you want to keep your nipples?” I joked, 'How on earth will I do Playboy!” And then I thought, why the hell wouldn't I be able to do Playboy—if I wanted? Why shouldn’t I stand there with my boobs out and say ""I feel incredible""!' 'I had cancer the size of a golf ball, and I got through it, with a joke and a smile. And I couldn’t have got through it without my husband and girls.' Claire now lives in Los Angeles, California with her husband Gus, 36, a former American football player turned opera singer and their daughters Devon, seven, and Avalon, six. ‘I chose not to hide myself from my girls. You just come to realise it won’t be like you were before and you move forward. 'I feel so positive today,’ she adds. ‘If I’d have waited a year to get the mastectomy, I’d probably be dead. 'There are women younger than me who have died because they weren’t as lucky. Cancer makes you realise that you need to be yourself, be the woman that you want to be. I’m so proud of my photos, the most important photographs of my career.'

"By . Travelmail Reporter . An inventive new lookout on the shores of Loch Voil is allowing tourists to hideaway in the Highlands. The new structure in Scotland’s Trossachs National Park appears to blend into its environment thanks to the clever use of mirrored walls. The wood-framed pavilion frames various views of the loch and surrounding countryside, which is reflected by the stainless steel mirrors, creating a unique surface that changes with the weather. Now you see it, now you don't: Clever use of mirrored walls allows the lookout to blend into its environment . A two-seat beach on one side of the tiny structure allows visitors to sit and admire views over Loch Voil and Loch Doine. On the other side is a smaller seat for one, along with a window that lets people peer out to the loch. The building is the brainchild of architecture students Angus Ritchie and Daniel Tyler, who designed the lookout as part of their thesis at Strathclyde University. Perfect spot: The lookout is located close to Loch Voil in the Trossachs National Park . Blending into its environment: The new lookout is easy for walkers to miss . The duo received funding from the Scottish government for the project, which cost £5,000. The lookout's frame was made using thermally-treated African hardwood and was assembled off-site and lifted into place using a digger. The mirrored walls were then added to reflect the ever-changing scenery and give visitors several different perspectives on their environment. Interactive space: A sign beside the lookout encourages visitors to 'please enjoy me!' Time to reflect: The structure features wooden benches on each side so visitors can admire the view . Daniel Tyler told architecture and design magazine Dezeen: ‘The idea was to use a concept design from a first year room-with-a-view project selected by the national park at their final review. ‘Angus and I took that concept and developed and realised the resulting Lookout. The main concept taken from the first year design was the mirrored material, which the national park was particularity keen on, and framing of three views.’ The lookout is likely to prove popular with walkers eager to take a break from hiking in the stunning national park - as long as they can find it that is!","The inventive structure has been built on the shores of Loch Voil .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Hillary Clinton has not yet finished her latest book which will play an important role in her expected presidential race. 'It’s a bit of a struggle to get it done...She is not necessarily a natural writer,' one anonymous friend told The Washington Post. Another reason she is reportedly having trouble completing the book about her time as Secretary of State is the fact that she is well aware of the backlash that will come from Republicans. Some of Mitt Romney's former aides have already formed a group with a team dedicated to countering any claims she makes in the book, which does not yet have a release date but is expected sometime this summer. Tense moment: The killing of Osama bin Laden (pictured) and the Arab Spring are two of the main accomplishments that are expected to be included in her book, which will be published sometime this summer . Her advance payment for the book has not been released, but her first memoir, which was also published by Simon & Schuster, netted her $8million in 2000. Republican operative Tim Miller is one of the two heads of the group, America Rising, and he said that Mrs Clinton is going to have trouble defining her time in office. 'The challenge for her with this book is to highlight a tangible accomplishment that voters can identify,' Mr Miller told the paper. Other Republicans have also helped that effort, as they have been trashing her time at state- particularly over the handling of the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi- largely because she is the unabashed frontrunner for the Democrats in 2016, and likely because early polls show that there is no current Republican candidate who could beat her. Critical: One of the most hotly-anticipated portions of the book will come when she describes how she and the Obama administration handled the attack on the American consulate in Libya . Under scrutiny: Republicans have already made an opposition team to 'correct' any assertions she makes about Benghazi and other hot-button issues in her upcoming book . 'It’s almost becoming a kind of conventional wisdom that there were minimal accomplishments,' one unidentified friend of Clinton's told The Washington Post, showing what damage the Republican offensive is doing to her legacy. The knocks against Mrs Clinton and her time as the head of the State Department comes in contrast to the high praise she was being given this time last year as she left the post, which was then taken over by John Kerry. Her popularity was at an all-time high when she left the State Department but now that Mr Kerry is in office, he is the one earning praise for his work on issues like Iranian sanctions. Though his supporters admitted that much of his success was based on the groundwork that she laid out during her term, they are still allegedly concerned that her book will take the spotlight away from Kerry and back to her. Building relationships: Mrs Clinton, who visited 112 countries as Secretary of State, made inroads at many including in Myanmar where she met with pro-democracy opposition leader Aung San Sulu Kyi (pictured in December 2011) That said, most Democrats are on her side in the matter, as her loyal band of defenders have created their own group of researchers and fact-checkers to debunk any claims that the Republicans make about alleged falsehoods in her book. Others said that she dedicated much of her time in December and January to writing the book- with the help of speechwriters Dan Schwerin and Ted Widmer and research assistant Ethan Gelber. Her other close advisors, like Huma Abedin, Maggie Williams and Melanne Verveer, are all thought to be working as sounding boards as well, The Post reported. 'She’s very animated about it,' former congresswoman Ellen Tauscher said of Mrs Clinton's book. 'This is the first time in a very long time that she gets to talk about important, weighty things as she thinks of them, unencumbered by the responsibilities of office or serving in the administration. 'It’s almost like this is Hillary unencumbered.'","Clinton is writing a book about her time as Secretary of State .

"By . Chris Pleasance . More than 80 survivors of the Asiana Airlines plane crash filed a lawsuit against aircraft manufacturer Boeing on Friday. In the complaint the survivors allege that because parts of the plane's equipment were faulty or wrongly installed, the pilots had little warning of their low airspeed. Three people were killed when the aeroplane, carrying 307 people on a flight from South Korea to San Francisco, clipped a seawall and crashed on July 6. More than 80 survivors of the Asiana plane crash in July last year have field a lawsuit against Boeing . The survivors allege that because parts of the plane's equipment were faulty or badly installed the pilots had little warning of their low airspeed . Monica Kelly, an attorney for Chicago-based Ribbeck Law Chartered, told CNN on Saturday: 'We are asking for damages to be paid to the passengers and asking the court to hold Boeing partially liable.' The lawsuit says that Boeing knew, or should have known, its 777 passenger jet did not have adequate auto-throttle control or low airspeed warning systems, according to the Chicago Tribune newspaper. Around 180 were injured in the crash, and more than 80 are now claiming compensation for 'pain and suffering, disability, mental anguish, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, medical treatment, loss of income, and medical expenses'. The lawsuit is claiming damages for 'pain and suffering, disability, mental anguish, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, medical treatment, loss of income, and medical expenses' The survivors launched a legal campaign in the immediate aftermath of the crash, filing a petition for discovery - a move meant to preserve evidence. At the time, law firm Ribbeck said it was considering adding Asiana and certain parts manufacturers to the lawsuit, but Friday's filing named only Boeing. The lawsuit was filed at Cook County Superior Court, Illinois. Boeing could not be contacted for comment and the cause of the crash is still being investigated. Last week harrowing and never-before-seen footage from the frantic aftermath revealed that firefighters tragically did not realize that a 16-year-old victim was still alive - and ran her over twice 15 minutes later. Video from a camera mounted on a San Francisco firetruck shows at least two emergency workers alerting vehicles to go around Chinese student Ye Meng Yuan as she lay on the ground by the stricken aircraft. Boeing is still investigating the cause of the crash and was unavailable for comment earlier today . The first responders believed she was dead and did not check her vital signs. Miss Yuan was one of three Chinese teenagers who died; the second died during the crash and another later in the hospital. Her parents have filed a claim against the city of San Francisco, saying rescuers were reckless and poorly trained. In their claim, attorneys representing Yuan's parents name 37 specific airport, fire and police department employees, saying they and others 'breached their duty of care'. They do not specify damages. The San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) does not comment on pending lawsuits.","More than 80 survivors of the Asiana Airlines plane crash are suing Boeing .

"By . Emma Thomas . Study: Academics say children could be refusing to eat their greens because of a survival instinct . Children who don't eat their vegetables may be using their inherited survival instinct, a study has shown. Dr Annie Wertz and Dr Karen Wynn, both psychologists at America's Yale University, wrote the study on how children behave around plants. The academics studied toddlers playing with different objects and realised youngsters didn't pick up natural things, like plants, as much as they played with plastic or metal objects. At the Infant Cognition Center at Yale University, 47 eight to 18-month-old children were observed and the psychologists who put them in front of two real plants, two realistic-looking artificial plants, and two other objects. The children in the experiment showed a 'striking reluctance' to touch plants, the doctors noted. They believe this behaviour is progammed into children from birth to avoid them being harmed or poisoned by flowers or plants. 'This behavioral strategy would protect infants from the dangers posed by plants by decreasing the likelihood of ingesting plant toxins (by either consuming plant parts or ingesting toxins rubbed off on their hands from damaged plant parts), or incurring injuries from plants’ physi cal defenses (e.g., fine hairs, thorns, or noxious oils).' The study says. The same findings can translate to the frustrations many parents face when trying to get their toddlers to eat fruit and vegetables, the psychologists say. Explaining the findings, the report says: 'In modern Western circumstances, plants are often peripheral to daily life. They may be encountered only in well-manicured lawns and parks, or as already-harvested fruits and vegetables in the grocery store. 'Throughout human evolution, plants have been essential to human existence. 'Yet, for all of these benefits, plants have always posed very real dangers.' Academics: Dr Annie Wertz (left) and Dr Karen Wynn (right) carried out the study . The study says that defence and survival mechanisms, teaching humans not to grab dangerous plants, could be why children are reluctant to eat leafy, green vegetables. 'Plants produce toxins as defenses against predators that can be harmful, or even deadly, if ingested,' the paper continues, 'The costs associated with plant defenses have shaped the physiology and behavior of many non-human animal species.' However, the built-in reluctance could be changed, they said. 'The current results suggest that human infants, like other non-human animals, possess strategies for mitigating the ancestrally recurrent dangers posed by plants. 'We suspect that this initial avoidance may be a default strategy that can be overturned by social information indicating that a given plant is safe to eat or use for some other purpose. 'We are not suggesting that infants are actively afraid of plants. Rather we propose that once infants identify an object as a plant, they deploy a behavioral strategy of inhibited manual exploration, which serves to help protect them from plants’ potential dangers.'

"By . Sarah Bridge . Wedding guests can breathe a sigh of relief - no more sitting through endless wedding photos and a four-hour long video of the big day. But instead they might find themselves having to lip-sync along to romantic hits such as 'Perfect Day' and 'I've had the time of my life' while in their wedding finery. Welcome to 'marryoke' - the latest must-have for couple planning their Big Day. It's marriage - plus karaoke. Scroll down for video . David and Paula McGuigan sang along to the Oasis track She's Electric for their wedding marryoke video . The bride, groom and their loved ones all get to star in their very own pop video by miming along to their favourite track. The footage is then cleverly interwoven with video of all the traditional features of the happy day, from the groom waiting at the altar for his bride, to the wedding ceremony and onto the reception afterwards. It's supposed to be the happiest day of your life, so there's no wonder that newly-weds have always wanted to have a permanent record of the day. But marryoke is certainly a step up from a formal photo on the steps of the church. 'There has been a real shift in wedding's recently,' says marryoke maker Billy May. 'People are constantly looking for something that's unique so there's a real competitive element going on. People search for something different at their weddings, whether it's with the flowers, or the cake, the wedding favours or the video. There's also a social media element where people want to upload photos and videos of the day on Facebook or YouTube.' Ready for her close-up: bride Nuala poses for her marryoke video before marrying Doug Watson . Husband and wife team Billy and Katie May set up their company Marryokes.com three years ago having made a wedding video for some friends as a present. It got 50,000 hits when they uploaded it onto YouTube and they realised that they were onto something. A few months later they made a couple of marryoke videos for music producer Paul Higgins and his wife Clodagh McGeary and, aided by the appearance of One Direction, got more than two million hits. The couple, based in Northern Ireland, now spend their time travelling off to exotic locations such as Italy, Thailand, New York and Sri Lanka. Husband and wife marryoke team Billy and Katie May say they work hard to make each video special . 'There are all kinds of crazy things at weddings nowaways,' says Billy. 'We've seen elephants, magicians, helicopters, secret singers - all sorts.' The Mays will be at a wedding from make-up and hair styling at the very beginning of the day to dancing until the early hours. As well as doing marryokes they also make traditional 40-minute wedding videos and a three-minute highlights package. 'People are becoming less bothered about recording the speeches and the vows and are more interested in putting the highlights package on Facebook,' says Billy. As for the songs, people tend to stay away from the traditionally romantic tunes in favour of high-energy pop songs, including Black Eyed Peas I Gotta Feeling and Queen's Don't Stop Me Now.","Traditional wedding videos being shunned in favour of three-minute pop videos which can be easily shared on Facebook and YouTube .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Killed: Eileen Brown, 60, died after a vein in her hip was severed by surgical screws in a botched operation . A grandmother bled to death after a surgeon cut into a vein during a botched hip replacement operation. Eileen Brown, 60, was having a second hip replacement at Basildon Hospital in Essex, but after surgical screws drilled into her bones severed a vein and left her bleeding internally. Surgeons were left defending the decision to use screws in the operation at all - rather than surgical cement, which could have eliminated the risk, an inquest heard. Mrs Brown was especially vulnerable, the inquest was told, as she suffered from brittle bones and osteoporosis. At five feet tall and weighing around nine stone, she also had a slight frame. Mrs Brown's brother and two sons are now considering legal action after a coroner in Chelmsford ruled that the operation killed her. Doctors could have decided to use quick-drying cement to replace her hip, which was itself a replacement from a 2010 operation which had fractured. But orthopaedic locum consultant Dr Amgad Nakhla opted to widen the socket of her hip and drill through the bones, which left it at risk of breaking. The court heard this fractured her hip in several places. Some of the screws – up to 35mm long - to hold the hip in place ended up passing through both sides of bone before a vein was ruptured. Medics tried to repair the tear, but she lost ‘a significant amount’ of blood and later died. Pathologist Dr Martin Goddard said she was given around six litres of blood in a bid to keep her alive. He gave the cause of death as a haemorrhage caused by the ruptured vein. Existing heart disease may also have impacted her chances of survival. Dr Graham Keene, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, told the inquest that the proportion of operations which use screws as opposed to cement is around 50-50. But, he added, for a patient with softer bones or osteoporosis it is more difficult to use the uncemented procedure and there was a greater risk of fractures. He said: ‘It appears the first inserted socket was loose and did not fit well when screwed in place. It was removed and the socket was drilled up and a larger one put in and in that process a fracture was noticed.’ He said the use of a 55cm socket for someone so small concerned him and may have left ‘the external shell of her pelvis very thin.’ Operation: Mrs Brown was undergoing the surgery at Basildon University Hospital . Dr Keene described how a metal plate was secured to the back of Mrs Brown's pelvis with four screws. Drilling these in was likely to have caused one of her veins to rupture, he said. By the end bleeding was noticed, partly caused by the fractured hip, but largely from a punctured vein, he said, which was likely to have been caused by the drilling or a screw protruding through the bone. Surgeons are supposed to ensure that screws only go into a ‘safe zone’ area and avoid them piercing the other side of the bone, Dr Keene said. He added: ‘If the screw is out of the front of the pelvis towards the vein it was more likely to have been outside the safe zone.’ Medics realised she was swelling from internal bleeding while sowing her up after the operation and specialist vascular surgeons were brought in to stem the blood loss - but she died days later. Dr Nakhla, who carried out the bulk of the surgery on May 2 last year, initially stood by his decision saying at the hospital patients under 70 would usually have the uncemented procedure. However, he later added: ‘I perfectly accept if it was cemented it could have prevented the fracture and vein injury and that the cementless option has higher incidents of fracture.’ Anger: Roger and Steve Brown, Mrs Brown's sons, say they are considering legal action in light of the coroner's decision . He added: ‘The risk of this happening was very low, but unfortunately to everyone here it did happen.’ The . hospital carried out an internal investigation following the death and . have brought in procedures to try to prevent a repeat. Dr . Amgad Nakhla said: ‘I am currently working on a system to drill into . bones and avoid vascular injury. There have been some changes in . practice. 'Hospital . guidelines not do not allow cementless operations in any patient over . 70. That would not have changed it for Mrs Brown, but it should minimise . it.’ Coroner Eleanor McGann told Mrs Brown's family: ‘I hope you feel we have had a full and frank inquiry. The conclusion I reach is she died as a result of a complication of a medical procedure which was necessary to relive her pain.’ Mrs Brown’s grieving relatives said her death could easily have been avoided. Brother Peter Humphrey from Laindon, Essex, and her sons Roger and Steve Brown, from Avelye, also in Essex, attended the inquest. Outside court Mr Humphrey said: ‘This should never have happened. For someone with her history of brittle bones they should have cemented the hip. There are a lot of unanswered questions from the inquest and we will be looking to take legal action.’","Eileen Brown was having hip replacement operation in Basildon, Essex .

"By . Mark Prigg . A radical 'snakebot' that slithers down a patients throat to perform surgery has treated its first patients. Called the flex, it can go down a patient's throat without needing incisions to gain access. The device this week successfully operated on a human for the first time - raising hopes it could soon become commonplace. Open wide! The Flex System is inserted into the throat to perform operations inside the human body . Physicians use a joystick to steer the snake around organs and other obstacles after it has entered through the mouth. Attached to the head is a high-definition camera so the physicians can see where it is going. The snake is made of linked segments that enable it to bend while remaining rigid. Each link mimics the position of the one in front, preventing it from accidentally bumping into something as it moves through the body. Either side of the camera are ports for small surgical instruments to be attached. These can be used to operate in confined spaces of the human body. Known as the Flex System, the design is based on research by Howie Choset, Professor of Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, Pennsylvania. The robot-assisted device is being developed by New England-based company Medrobotics Corp. Surgeons at the University Hospital Dinant Godinne have now completed the world’s first robotic-assisted surgical procedures with the Medrobotics’ Flex System. The surgical team of Prof. Marc Remacle and Prof. Georges Lawson successfully performed procedures on two patients, which included the ablation of a vocal fold angiectatic polyp and the resection of tongue-based lymphoid tissue (lingual tonsil). The first patient had a chronic hoarseness induced by a polyp on the vocal fold, and returned home on the same day of the surgery. The second patient had severe snoring, and was discharged from the hospital one day after surgery. 'With other approaches, surgeons sometimes cannot achieve the access and visualization that they desire minimally invasively.' said Prof. Remacle. 'With the Flex® System, we can more easily access and treat patients with challenging anatomy.' The device (pictured) will primarily operate in the oropharynx (the area between your mouth and the top of your throat) and the endolarynx (within the larynx). But in the future it could also be used for more complex operations like heart procedures . Originally the robot had been used to explore Austria’s abandoned Zwentendorf nuclear power plant. But now this flexible endoscopic system will be used to give surgeons access to parts of the human body that are difficult to reach via other methods. This will enable more patients to get so-called minimally-invasive treatment, speeding up hospital waiting times. ‘The Flex System is the first robot-assisted flexible endoscopic platform for use during surgical procedures,’ Dr Samuel Straface, president and CEO of Medrobotics, said in a release. ‘The system enables surgeons to access and visualise hard-to-read anatomical locations.' In addition, the robotic snake can 'deploy specially designed flexible surgical instruments to perform procedures.’ Physicians use a joystick to steer the snake around organs and other obstacles after it has entered through the mouth.

The work is part of a feasibility study by the European Space Agency (Esa) which aims to provide greater mobility during space research than traditional rovers can provide. One . idea is to use a conventional rover, such as Curiosity, to carry a robotic snake over large distances and then deploy it to places the rover . can’t access. Sintef's robot consists of 10 identical joint modules, each having two motorised degrees of freedom. The . modules are covered by passive wheels to give the robot ground . friction, which enables it to slither forward over flat surfaces.","The robosnake was made by Carnegie Mellon University and Medrobotics .

"By . Olivia Williams . Frustrating: Claire Lennon will have to wait for her pet Sarah to die before she can get her earring back . An unlucky woman whose pet cockerel swallowed her diamond earring will have to wait until it dies to retrieve her precious jewellery. Claire Lennon from Berkshire lost her earring when cockerel Sarah pecked it off while perched on her shoulder. She will have to wait eight years to get her hands on the £300 present that her partner Adam, 38, gave her again. Vets say it is trapped inside the stomach of six-month-old Sarah and will not come out. Claire, also 38, said 'The vet said he could operate to recover the earring, but that might kill Sarah, which would devastate our six-year-old daughter Mia'. 'So we’ll have to wait till Sarah gets old and dies, but they live to a ripe old age - we are probably looking at another eight years before I get my earring back.' Sarah, who is in fact a cockerel despite having a hen's name, is a family pet who loves sitting on Claire’s shoulder at home near Newbury. Claire explained: 'I felt this sudden sharp pain in my ear lobe and realised Sarah had gobbled down the earring'. She and Adam, an IT specialist, put the chicken in a cage and spent the next few days searching the floor in case the earring had passed through the chicken. 'But there was sign of it and Mia’s friend’s father, who’s a vet, said it might have got stuck in the gizzard.' Irretrievable: A vet's x-ray shows the diamond earring inside Sarah, which would be too dangerous to cut out . 'We spoke to another vet, Carl Gorman, who said he would do an X ray. 'The X ray showed it was stuck firmly in the gizzard so Carl gave Sarah some laxatives, hoping it would pass. 'But it didn’t work, it’s still stuck fast and we have accepted it is trapped inside and won’t come out. Missing: Claire's surviving earring, worth £300 . 'The vet said he could operate and go in through Sarah’s stomach but it could prove fatal. 'We couldn’t face that - Mia adores Sarah and would be heart-broken. “The vet said over the weeks and months, the platinum white gold would disintegrate and be ground down by the grit and stuff that hens eat to aid their digestion. 'But the diamond is so hard it will not be damaged and will just stay there in the until Sarah dies and then of course we can get it back.' Claire explained why Sarah is in fact a cockerel. She said: 'He’s called Sarah because when we got him as a chick, we thought he was a she. 'When he got older and we realised it was a cockerel, we decided to stick with the name. 'We’re keeping as close eye on him to make sure he doesn’t get caught, carried off and eaten by a fox or the diamond will be gone forever. 'It’s a shame I have lost the earring because it was one of a matching pair that Adam bought for me so they’re really sentimental and mean a lot. 'But we can’t risk anything that might mean we lose Sarah. 'At least we know where the earring is - and one day I will get it back, even if it means waiting for a few years!'","Diamond earring is stuck in cockerel's gizzard after he pecked it off .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Findings: Those with high levels of melatonin were 75 per cent less likely to develop the deadly disease (library image) Sleeping well may help to protect men from prostate cancer, scientists claim. Those who had high levels of the sleep hormone melatonin were 75 per cent less likely to develop an advanced form of the deadly disease, a study found. Our bodies produce melatonin when it is dark. It helps to regulate our sleep cycle and affects many functions tied to the body’s 24-hour clock, or circadian rhythm. People with too little melatonin tend to have trouble getting to sleep and wake up in the night. Scientists tested the melatonin levels of 928 Icelandic men, then monitored them over seven years. In that time, 111 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, including 24 who had advanced cancer. Advanced prostate cancer that has started to spread is often aggressive and is likely to be fatal. The researchers found men whose melatonin levels were higher than the middle of the range were 75 per cent less likely to develop advanced prostate cancer than those with levels below the middle mark. Study leader Sarah Markt, from the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, US, said: ‘Sleep loss and other factors can influence the amount of melatonin secretion or block it altogether. ‘Health problems associated with low melatonin, disrupted sleep, and disruption of the circadian rhythm are broad, including a potential risk factor for cancer.’ More research should be done into how melatonin affects cancer risk, she said, adding: ‘Our results require replication, but support the public health implication of the importance of maintaining a stable light-dark and sleep-wake cycle.’ Dr Matthew Hobbs, of Prostate Cancer UK, said: ‘Over 40,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in the UK. ‘Improving our ability to distinguish which of those men are at risk of aggressive cancer that is likely to spread to other parts of the body from those with low-risk cancer is of crucial importance. Difficulty: Those who struggle to sleep and have low levels of melatonin run a higher risk of getting cancer (library image) ‘However, this study is a long way away from developing a test based on melatonin levels.’ A separate study of 572 prostate cancer patients found those who walked at a faster pace before being diagnosed had a better prognosis. They had larger and more even blood vessels in their tumours, which the US researchers said can make cancer easier to treat. It is known that physically active men with prostate cancer have a lower risk of recurrence and death, but until now scientists have not been able to explain why this should be the case.","Those with high levels of melatonin less likely to develop deadly disease .

Same-store sales are measurements of . sales using sales figures from current stores, excluding data from new . store openings and stores that have closed. The last time the brand saw such an increase was in 2011, with a 5.1 per cent increase in sales over one quarter with the launch of it's Hot 'n Juicy burgers and in 2002 with a line of high-end salads which sparked sales increases of 5 per cent or higher for three quarters. Wendy's same-store sales have risen the past two years, but 5.5 per cent is more than double last year's 2.7 per cent sales increase. Part of the burger's success may be in the fact that the fancy bun appeals to millennials. Younger customers: The new burger may be an attempt to attract millennial customers, a new trend among fast-food brands . Pretzel love songs: Wendy's booked former 98 Degrees singer Nick Lachey to sing customer's love-filled tweets for the new menu item at a store in New York City . CEO Emil Brolick and other Wendy's executives have noted that small adjustments like bread can have a big impact on how customers perceive the quality and healthfulness of a chain's food - making them competitors for upscale fast-food chains like Chipotle or Panera Bread which are modeled to appeal to new-age customers. And Wendy's isn't the only brand focusing on a younger generation of customers. Long-term: If the burger becomes a permanent item on the menu, Kalinowski predicts financial success for the brand 'for years to come' Fast-food chains like McDonald's and Taco Bell are implementing new menu items to appeal to a younger set.

McDonald's focus is on adding healthier items, like their new egg-white breakfast sandwich, in an attempt to appeal to calorie-counters between 18 and 32. Taco . Bell, which recently ditched their kids menu to be more 'edgy', is . focusing more on trendier menu items like their new breakfast taco or . the Doritos locos tacos. The pretzel burger takes a bit from both of these approaches. The bun makes it look more upscale, but in reality it's not that healthy. According to nutritional information on Wendy's website, the burger comes it at 680 calories with a shocking 1,100 mg of sodium. But calorie counts don't seem to matter too much with recent fast-food menu item launches like the Glazed Donut Breakfast Sandwich at Dunkin' Donuts and the Carl's Jr. Strawberry Pop-Tart Ice Cream Sandwich. 'This could be a very, very big deal,' Christopher Muller, professor of hospitality at Boston University's School of Hospitality Administration, told International Science Times. 'I don't know why, but there's nothing else on the market quite like it. If it's a hit, others are guaranteed to follow.' Dunkin' Donuts is already planning a pretzel bun menu item of their own. On Monday the coffee chain announced they would be launching a Pretzel Roll Roast Beef sandwich.","The new Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger was launched at Wendy's in early July .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UFO hunters believe that may have found evidence of a UFO streaking through the sky - on Mars. They claim a picture taken by the Curiosity rover shows a possible extra terrestrial craft. In the image, a bright object can been seen appearing to leave a trail in the Martian sky. Scroll down for video . UFO spotters claim the object in the top right of the sky could be a UFO - saying the conical shape exhibits all the hallmarks of an extra terrestrial craft . The video, posted by prolific UFO hunter Streetcap1 uses an image stored on Nasa's servers. 'Enlargement of the object reveals a spherical top cone, a rounded center mass and what looks like some kind of propellant ejecting from its tail,' the Bublews site claims. 'Does Mars have its own space programme?' According to the ufosightingsdaily site, 'Another UFO was caught in a Mars rover photo. 'If you look at it closely, you see that it has a trail behind it and it looks to be moving to the upper right side of the photo.' The image is one of several UFO hunters have claimed show mysterious objects in the sky. However on further inspection many turn out to be meteors in the sky. One Youtube commenter points this out, saying 'I'm sure they will have a meteor excuse but the trail says otherwise.' The finding is not Curiosity's first brush with extraterrestrial life - according to some experts. This iguana-shaped rock is seen on the top right of this image. It would be easy to miss, but the keen eye of Scott C. Warin, was able to spot the iguana rock in several photos taken by the Mars Curiosity rover . In May, a science blogger claimed to have spotted a lizard meandering around Mars. The unknown spotter from Japan alerted Mr Warin of the unusual sight. The claim, posted on UFO Sightings Daily, caused some excitable conspiracy theorists to fear that Nasa could be planting life on the planet for scientific testing. ‘Then again, is Nasa placing animals from tiny cyogenic chambers inside the rover onto the surface of Mars to conduct tests?' he continued. Curiosity landed on Mars on August 6, 2012, and has spent its time investigating and analysing the landscape and geology of the red planet. The $2.5 billion rover was sent to the planet to assess if the planet most like Earth has or ever had the chemical ingredients and environments for microbial life. The image was taken by Nasa's Mars Science Laboratory nicknamed Curiosity, which left Earth on Nov 26 on its mission to explore the red planet.","Image taken by the Curiosity rover on the Martian surface .

"By . Liz Hull With Mia De Graaf . Fighting: Counter-terrorist teams fear two 16-year-old Muslim girls have joined ISIS fighters in Syria after fleeing their bedrooms in Manchester last week . Twin sisters aged 16 may have travelled to Syria to become jihadi brides, it is claimed. The British citizens crept away from their home in the middle of the night and boarded a flight to Turkey. The girls’ distraught parents raised the alarm after finding their beds empty when they went to wake them for college. Police discovered their passports and belongings missing and established that they had flown to Istanbul. They alerted counter-terrorism colleagues when the ‘extremely religious’ pair contacted  relatives to say they were in Syria. Officers are investigating how the girls paid for the trip – amid fears that it was bankrolled by jihadi fighters in the Middle East who want them as their wives. It is thought the sisters, who have nine siblings, travelled to Syria after an elder brother went there to fight for Al Qaeda-inspired militants ISIS. Mohammed Shafiq, the head of Muslim group the Ramadhan Foundation, said their ‘moderate’ parents were shocked. He added: ‘I’ve spoken to the mosque where the family worship and others in the community where they live and people are saying they are a decent family. We know they have gone to follow their brother, but they are putting themselves in danger and I’m sure that the moment they arrive in such a savage country they will regret it.’ British fighters: Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana appeared in this ISIS recruitment video earlier this month . Sources said it was unlikely women would be recruited to fight and becoming jihad brides was the most likely scenario. They admitted there was a risk they were being groomed as suicide bombers. ‘We’ve . seized their computers and not found any videos or statements of . intent, but are not ruling anything out,’ the source said. The sisters, . who fled ten days ago, are of Somali origin and go to a sixth form . college in Manchester, where the family is thought to have moved ten . years ago. Last week . Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable for Greater Manchester police, who sits . on the Association of Chief Police Officers’ counter-terrorism . committee, warned young women as well as men were being ‘brainwashed’ by . ‘perverted messages’. He . said: ‘We’ve got some information about girls trying to get to Syria . and some we believe may have gone out there on the idea of being a jihad . bride. So there are a number of absolutely perverted messages which can . brainwash impressionable young people and parents are feeling . desperate about this. It’s a bit like parents agonising about youngsters . getting  into street gangs or drugs, but the  consequences are far more . extreme.’ Greater Manchester police said they had a ‘line of contact’ with the girls and were working to bring them home. ‘The . family are very worried,’ a spokesman said. ‘We don’t know exactly . where they are but their parents are obviously very keen to have them . returned home.’ Calls: ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, issued a plea for the world's Muslims to 'obey' his quest for domination . As many as . 1,500 Britons may have travelled to Syria to fight. A number have posted . messages online promising to use their ‘terror skills’ if they return . to Britain. On Friday, . reclusive ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made a rare appearance to . order all Muslims to ‘obey’ him. A video of his sermon at the Great . Mosque in Mosul, Iraq’s second city, went viral on jihadist websites. David Cameron has warned that jihadis returning to the UK after fighting . in Syria and Iraq are ‘the most serious threat to Britain’s security . there is today’. Mr Shafiq . said: ‘ISIS is a barbaric and evil organisation, which has no regard for . human life and is contrary to Islamic teaching, and we urge people not . to go out there to fight with them.’ Nawal . Msaad, 26, was the first British woman charged with terror offences . over the Syrian conflict. Msaad, of north London, was arrested at .

"By . Brendan Carlin, Mail on Sunday Political Reporter . Reassurance: George Osborne yesterday . George Osborne flatly ruled out an electoral deal with Nigel Farage yesterday, even as he vowed never to ‘belittle’ UKIP voters. The Chancellor sought to silence talk by worried Tory MPs of an electoral deal with the UKIP leader by insisting the only real choice at next year’s General Election was between David Cameron and Ed Miliband. Speaking to Tory activists in London, Mr Osborne declared: ‘There will not be a pact. For a Conservative Government at the next  election, you have to vote Conservative.’ But the stern warning was coupled with a clear bid to reach out to UKIP voters and win them back to the  Conservatives. Mr Osborne stressed how he ‘respected’ UKIP voters and Mr Farage even if he did not agree with the party’s leader. He said: ‘The modern Conservative party will never dismiss or belittle the views of the people we aspire to represent. ‘We should show the highest respect for those who go out and cast their vote – and respect too for those who cast their vote for another party, and that includes those who voted for UKIP on Thursday.’ Difference: Lord Ashcroft's survey of key marginal seats put Labour at 41 per cent - ahead of the Tories on 29 . Decisions: This graphic shows how 56 per cent of voters would definitely not vote for the Lib Dems at the next election. The figure was 49 per cent for Conservatives, 38 per cent for Labour and 52 per cent for UKIP . But Mr Osborne insisted that Mr Farage did not have ‘the answers to the country’s future’. Liberal . Democrat president Tim Farron told Sky News today that unlike the . ‘spineless’ other leaders, Nick Clegg had been ‘the only one with the . bottle and the backbone to stand up to Nigel Farage’. Tory party . bosses are hoping their key pledge of an in/out referendum on the EU . after the next election will be decisive in pulling back disaffected . Conservative voters. But the Chancellor seemed concerned yesterday that voters were yet to be convinced by the promise. He . said: ‘We should stop complaining that the public don’t believe us on . our referendum pledge and instead work harder to make sure they do.’ It has been suggested that David Davies could be the Tory party's secret weapon to beat Nigel Farage's Ukip . Mr Osborne also braced his party for more bad news tonight when the European election results are unveiled. Poll: The new survey by former Tory vice-chairman Lord Ashcroft (pictured) claims Labour is still on course for a clear General Election win . The . Chancellor, who put the Tories’ economic competence at the centre of . its re-election bid, said the Government would now ‘listen, respond and . deliver’ in the wake of the voters’ verdict. But . he was challenged by Tory activist John Strafford to say how he would . listen to UKIP voters opposed to controversial coalition policies such . as high-speed rail, gay marriage or Mr Osborne’s own ‘barmy’ Help to Buy . mortgage assistance scheme. And, . despite Mr Osborne taunting Labour over a ‘miserable’ result in last . week’s local elections, a new survey by former Tory vice-chairman Lord . Ashcroft last night claimed Labour was still on course for a clear . General Election win. The survey of key marginal seats put Labour at 41 per cent – way ahead of the Tories on 29. The . poll found there was an average 6.5 per cent swing to Labour – enough . to oust up to 83 Tory MPs and secure what some observers said could be a . Labour majority of 70. UKIP was on 18 per cent with the Lib Dems scoring just eight per cent, based on 1,000 voters in each of  the areas. Last . night Labour election supremo Douglas Alexander said: ‘Lord Ashcroft’s . poll confirms that we are making real progress in seats where we need to . do well and that Labour can win next year’s General Election.’ Prediction: A survey of key marginal seats put Ed Miliband's Labour at 41 per cent . Mr Miliband will this week visit the scene of one of the Labour’s biggest disappointments, Thurrock, in Essex, number two on its Westminster target list, where it actually lost control of the council. ‘UKIP won over some voters who feel ignored by politicians and let down by the way the country is run,’ he wrote in the Sunday Mirror. ‘Our job now is to show all of those people that we can change our country so they can build a better life for themselves and their family.' Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat president Tim Farron has appealed for an end to ‘absolutely foolish’ calls for Nick Clegg to quit as leader. Mr Clegg's future has been questioned by MPs as Lib Dem candidates in target Westminster seats joined voices urging him to fall on his sword over dismal election results. The Deputy Prime Minister has insisted he is staying despite the party losing more than 250 councillors in local elections and anticipating another rout when European election results emerge. In a call for unity Mr Farron - a favourite to succeed Mr Clegg - said: ‘Nick Clegg should undoubtedly stay and the Liberal Democrats should stay the course in Government. There will be lots of people who are bruised by the results.’","George Osborne tries to silence talk of electoral deal with UKIP leader .

The celebrity chef has been hit with a class-action lawsuit from past employees of his new Fat Cow restaurant in Los Angeles. They're claiming the cranky cook failed to pay minimum wages for the hours they worked as well as meal breaks, overtime wages and more. Kitchen nightmare: The Fat Cow restaurant is Los Angeles has only been open for eight months yet it is now facing its second lawsuit where employees are alleging non-payment of wages including tips and overtime .

The thefts, which also involved a second suspect, took place at the Victoria’s Secret store at the Sawgrass Mills mall in South Florida. You're nicked! Daniel Espinosa, 18, of Carol City, and a 17-year-old boy from Hialeah Gardens were arrested Wednesday after Sunrise Police say 850 garments worth $11,725 were stolen from the store during three incidents in 2012 . In November of 2013, Espinosa stole . 300 pieces of Dream Angels women’s underwear and allegedly on another . date, stole 175 pairs of women’s underwear, and that was worth over . $2,500. At a circular kiosk . that was stacked with drawers, panties were grabbed by the handful and . stuffed into shopping bags, the videos showed. The . thongs were stashed into a blue and pink bag in a shopping cart, on top . of which they placed another and wheeled it out of the store. On a third occasion, he allegedly stole 375 pairs of women’s underwear worth more than $5,000 but was caught. Quite a haul: 300 Dream Angels-style thongs valued at $3,750 went missing from the store on Nov. 23, police said.

"By . Alex Greig . The father of a 16-year-old boy has been arrested for beating the teen with a broom and then knocking him unconscious after he was caught stealing in a Philadelphia clothing store. Marvin Francis, 39, was called to the Burlington Coat Factory in Upper Darby on Friday by store security after his son was allegedly caught stealing. Arrested: Marvin Francis was arrested after witnesses saw him beat his son unconscious . Police say that Francis grabbed a broom from a display on his way into the store and beat his son repeatedly with it. According to the Philadelphia Daily News, he then dragged the teen out onto the sidewalk and there beat him unconscious. The incident occurred after store security officers allegedly caught two 16-year-old boys - cousins - stealing. They called the boys' parents and Francis arrived first. 'He beat him like a piece of meat,' Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood told the Philadelphia Daily News. 'As . he's walking in, he picks up a broom in the store from a sales display . and walks into the security office and starts beating his son with the . broom,' Chitwood said. 'Then he throws the broom down and punches, kicks . and knocks the kid to the ground.' The boy's cousin looked on, said Chitwood, 'scared to death.' 'The next thing you know, he's outside of the store and he starts punching him and beating him again,' Chitwood said. 'This time he knocks him down, stomps him in the head and knocks him unconscious.' The disturbing scene was caught on security cameras. Chitwood says store security didn't call police when the boy was caught stealing, which is not unusual, but should have when the father began assaulting his son. Petty theft: While the son allegedly stole from the Burlington Coat Factory, the father's alleged crime of beating his son unconscious is much more serious . Instead, officers were called to the scene by concerned passersby who witnessed the alleged beating. According to the Philadelphia Daily News, when repeated attempts to revive his son failed after Francis had knocked him unconscious, he threw the boy over his shoulder and piled him into the back of his black Lexus. Officers were able to locate the child, who lives with his mother in West Philadelphia. When they arrived the boy was conscious but his mother was 'reluctant' to take him to the hospital. While officers were at the boy's home, Francis arrived and was arrested. He is being held on $100,000 at Delaware County Jail after being charge with aggravated assault and other charges. 'It's one thing to discipline a kid, it's a another thing to feloniously assault a child and then not even get him medical help,' Chitwood told the Philadelphia Daily News. 'This is a nasty, nasty, nasty case,' he said.","A 16-year-old boy was allegedly caught stealing at the Burlington Coat Factory in Upper Darby, Philadelphia .

"By . Graham Johnson And Jonathan Petre . Whistleblower: Former matron Lynn Smith leaked an email from previous employers Stowe School . A former matron has been left jobless after revealing that a prestigious private school ran out of ‘morning after’ pills. Lynn Smith had been due to start work at the Royal Ballet School later this year – but last week it withdrew its job offer. Mrs Smith leaked an email from her previous employers, Stowe School, which was published in The Mail on Sunday last week. It detailed the ‘great concern’ staff had over pupils having sex in the £33,000-a-year school’s boarding houses. The day after our exposé, Ms Smith received a call from the London-based ballet school – and 24 hours later was told  she could no longer take up her new post as a £19,600- a-year assistant. She suspects Stowe School had ‘smeared’ her – a claim that headteacher Anthony Wallersteiner strenuously rebuts. Ms Smith, 57, says she was  warned before the story was published  that the head was threatening to write to the Royal Ballet School if she continued to cooperate with this newspaper. But Dr Wallersteiner  ‘categorically’ denied contacting the dance school. The Royal Ballet School confirmed it had ‘no contact’ with the head, although it said its human resources department had been in touch with Stowe’s HR staff the day after the story appeared as part of ‘normal’ checks on references Ms Smith had provided more than a month earlier. Ms Smith has nevertheless consulted legal advisers claiming she had been the victim of ‘smears’, including initial suggestions by the school that the email might have been ‘doctored’. She said: ‘I feel I’m being picked on by some very influential parties. Stowe have over-reacted and been heavy-handed.’ Ms Smith worked at Stowe for two years as a matron, but left earlier this year after bullying claims. She and a matron friend at Stowe, Terry Sanders, decided to leak the email to expose what they saw as weaknesses in the school’s policies to protect pupils, including its decision to scrap live-in matrons. No longer wanted: London's Royal Ballet School, which withdrew its offer to Lynn Smith. Its human resources department had been in touch with Stowe's HR staff as part of 'normal' checks on references . On the day before we published the story, Dr Wallersteiner cast doubt on the leaked email, telling us  it may have been ‘altered and doctored to sensationalise a matter of pastoral concern’. During that day Ms Smith received a call from Ms Sanders, saying that Dr Wallersteiner planned on writing to the Royal Ballet School. Ms Sanders, who is now suspended from the Buckinghamshire  school, also claimed that she was being ‘threatened with everything’ –including the sack – if she could not persuade Ms Smith to stop the story. When Ms Smith refused to back down, Dr Wallersteiner enlisted the services of spin doctors Bell Pottinger and media lawyer Schillings. Previous employers: £33,000-a-year Stowe School. Anthony Wallersteiner strenuously rebuts Ms Smith's claim that the school 'smeared' her following her decision to leak an email to The Mail on Sunday . On Monday Ms Smith was called by the Royal Ballet School’s HR manager Emma Grant who said they had questions over why she had left Stowe. The next day Ms Grant told Ms Smith she had spoken to Stowe and the job offer was withdrawn. Dr Wallersteiner said; ‘I am sorry the Royal Ballet School have not taken forward her contract. They have inferred that there was a compromise agreement [over Ms Smith leaving Stowe] and they clearly feel something had gone wrong that make her references perhaps not as robust as they might be. What I can say categorically is that I did not contact by any means or by a third party the Royal Ballet School.’ He refused to comment on Ms Sanders’s call to Ms Smith but denied making any threats to Ms Sanders. However Ms Smith said: ‘I turned whistleblower to expose a serious matter of public interest.  Now I  have lost my prospective job, my future home and my livelihood.’ Memories: Liv Stevens was a sixth former at Stowe School from 2006-2008 . The motto at Stowe School, ‘persto et praesto – I persist and I excel’, was a source of inspiration for pupils when I attended. Especially when it came to having sex. Teachers knew it was happening, but there wasn’t much they could do about it. Confined to the school grounds for weeks at a time with hormones raging, pupils were regularly having sex. There was a game known as the Temple Challenge, where couples would compete to have sex at all  of the 40 tiny neo-classical buildings in the school’s 750 acres. In one girls’ boarding house, a tally chart of locations where pupils had sex was updated regularly. Pupils had sex anywhere they could: in unlocked classrooms in the evenings, in the cricket pavilion, even outside boarding houses. I never heard of anyone getting caught, but there were a few close calls. Once a girl was forced to sneak out of a boy’s  bedroom window when the housemaster came knocking. These rendezvous weren’t one-night stands, but part of loving relationships – and never underage as the school only accepts girls from 16. Two old school friends are still going out with the boyfriends they met aged 16. All the girls knew that the school’s medical centre, the San, stocked the morning-after pill. On at least one occasion I accompanied a friend to get one. The school should be both open and realistic about sex and accept that it’s better to prepare, and offer pupils contraception if they need it.","Former matron Lynne Smith was due to start at the Royal Ballet School .

He dramatically raised the diplomatic stakes during an exchange at Prime Minister’s Questions. The accusation by the Prime Minister came as it emerged that the Ministry of Defence has 'contingency plans' in place enabling troops to be deployed swiftly in an emergency to the Falklands via Ascension Island. Last night Argentina’s interior . minister Florencio Randazzo hit back after Mr Cameron approved the MoD plans, saying: ‘It is absolutely . offensive especially in the case of Britain. History clearly shows what its attitude to the world was.’ Conflict: The Liberation Monument in Port Stanley. More than 900 people were killed after Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982 . The war of words is fresh evidence of . the increasing tension between the two countries in the run-up to the . 30th anniversary of the invasion of the islands by Argentina in April . 1982 and their liberation by British forces. Pledge: David Cameron said Britain should urge the international community to step up sanctions against Syria . Days ago, the Prime Minister hosted a . National Security Council summit which was devoted to the defence of . the islands, which are claimed by Argentina as Las Malvinas. Ministers were shown plans drawn up . to combat a campaign of intimidation planned by Argentina to mark the . anniversary. Mr Cameron was warned at the meeting of intelligence . showing that Argentine fishermen could be sent to land on the Falklands . and the neighbouring island of South Georgia to plant an Argentine flag . this spring. The mock invasion fears have echoes . of the 1982 conflict which began when an Argentine force landed on South . Georgia, which was defended by a small company of Royal Marines. Chief of the Defence Staff General . Sir David Richards has already outlined Britain’s contingency plans and . reassured Mr Cameron that Britain can defend the islands. But ministers . and spy chiefs warned the Prime Minister that Argentine president . Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner will use the anniversary as the pretext . to ‘raise the temperature’. At the NSC summit, Mr Cameron led a . series of war game discussions about how to respond to a series of . provocations by Argentina. The NSC agreed that the Falklands . police – rather than the Armed Forces – would be used to combat a . flag-planting stunt by the Argentines. But Mr Cameron went public with . details of the meeting yesterday to deliver a ‘strong message’ to Buenos . Aires that the UK will respond militarily if Argentina tries to reclaim . the islands. The Prime Minister said he wanted to send a 'strong message' about the islands which the Argentinians refer to as the Malvinas, following months of escalating rhetoric from Buenos Aires . The Union flag flies over Port Howard, West Falkland in June 1982 for the first time in more than two months - signifying the end of the Falklands conflict . The Prime Minister told the Commons that the islanders can . remain British as long as they want. ‘What the Argentinians have been . saying recently, I would argue, is far more like colonialism because . these people want to remain British and the Argentinians want them to do . something else,’ he said. A Royal Navy ship caused outrage in South America earlier this month after docking in Uruguay as tensions build ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War. HMS Protector's presence in the port of Montevideo on January 5 came days after the Mercosur bloc, made up of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, agreed a pact to close ports to Falklands vessels. It had made a 'routine stop' on its way to the islands. A photo of the Portsmouth-based ice patrol ship appeared on the front page of Uruguayan national newspaper El Observador with the headline 'English boat in the port'. The article was critical of Uruguayan port authorities for allowing Protector to stop over ahead of going on to the Falklands. It was the Uruguayan government - in an act of solidarity with Argentina - which proposed the move to close ports to vessels carrying the 'illegal' Falklands flag at a summit in Montevideo on December 21. But Uruguayan port authorities claim there was nothing to stop HMS Protector coming into Montevideo on December 30 because she sails under the Royal Navy's White Ensign. Commentators say the new row exposes cracks in Uruguay's support for Argentina. Mr Cameron said he ordered the NSC discussion so he could ‘make sure our defences and everything else is in order’. He added: ‘It is important for . Britain to send a clear message that as long as people in the Falklands . want to remain British, we respect that right of self-determination. ‘The reason for holding a National Security Council is to make sure nobody is in any doubt that Britain supports that right of . self-determination, and we will go on doing so for as long as people in . the Falklands want to continue in that way. I think it is important that . everyone understands that.’ The NSC also heard that Prince . William will go ahead with a posting to the Falklands as a search and . rescue pilot next month. Argentina has called the posting a . ‘provocation’. General Richards detailed the military assets defending the islands and made clear that reinforcements could be sent quickly. Forces based on the islands include . four Eurofighter Typhoons and 150 troops, while the surrounding seas are . patrolled by the frigate Montrose, the offshore patrol vessel Clyde and . survey ship Protector. A Government source said: ‘Kirchner . is highly unpredictable. The meeting was designed to make sure we are . totally plugged into where the threats might come from. 'We think there . will be a further push at interfering efforts from Argentina.’ Mr Cameron also outlined plans for a . series of events to honour the 255 British servicemen and three . islanders who died in the 1982 war.","PM: 'As long as people in the Falklands .

"By . Liv Stevens . Memories: Liv Stevens was a sixth former at Stowe School from 2006-2008 . The motto at Stowe School, ‘persto et praesto – I persist and I excel’, was a source of inspiration for pupils when I attended. Especially when it came to having sex. Teachers knew it was happening, but there wasn’t much they could do about it. Confined to the school grounds for weeks at a time with hormones raging, pupils were regularly having sex. There was a game known as the Temple Challenge, where couples would compete to have sex at all  of the 40 tiny neo-classical buildings in the school’s 750 acres. In one girls’ boarding house, a tally chart of locations where pupils had sex was updated regularly. Pupils had sex anywhere they could: in unlocked classrooms in the evenings, in the cricket pavilion, even outside boarding houses. I never heard of anyone getting caught, but there were a few close calls. Once a girl was forced to sneak out of a boy’s  bedroom window when the housemaster came knocking. These rendezvous weren’t one-night stands, but part of loving relationships – and never underage as the school only accepts girls from 16. Two old school friends are still going out with the boyfriends they met aged 16. All the girls knew that the school’s medical centre, the San, stocked the morning-after pill. On at least one occasion I accompanied a friend to get one. The school should be both open and realistic about sex and accept that it’s better to prepare, and offer pupils contraception if they need it.

Though the particular history has been kept private, the Royal - a huge admirer of Ali - arranged for the over-the-top auto to be given to the three-time world heavyweight boxing champion. Ali owned the embellished car for about two years and was usually driven around it by a chauffeur, according to the sale listing. It is currently sitting in Manteca Ford, a dealership in Manteca, California, where it will be on display for two weeks before going up for auction. 'It is meant to glorify god,' Manteca Ford owner, Phil Waterford, told Fox40 of the car. 'It has all of the earth tones - from the sand to the oceans to the trees and even all the complexions of the human race.

"By . Luke Garratt . Mothers who fail to lose their baby weight within a year of giving birth have a much higher risk of diabetes and heart trouble, according to a new study. The new research adds to the already established theory that not losing baby weight for several years after pregnancy carries long term risks like diabetes and heart disease. Scientists at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Canada, decided to test the theory by tracking risk factors in the first 12 months after giving birth. The research was conducted at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Canada, where researchers have evidence that could confirm the link between weight gain after pregnancy and diabetes . The researchers followed more than 300 patients throughout their pregnancy and the year following birth. They found that three-quarters of the women lost at least some of their baby weight after a year and were found to have healthy levels of cholesterol and blood pressure. But the quarter of the women studied that gained weight in that year showed a clear increase in risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The study provides direct evidence to support . the theory that failure to lose 'baby weight' carries long-term . implications for diabetes and heart disease risks. Study leader Doctor Ravi Retnakaran, an endocrinologist and Associate Professor at Toronto University, said: 'This finding helps us advise women about the importance of losing their excess pregnancy weight in the first year after delivery. 'With these results, we can say that failure to lose weight between three and 12 months postpartum will cause blood pressure, cholesterol, and insulin action in the body to move in an unhealthy direction.' Most women who gain weight during pregnancy lose it in the months after they give birth, but the women who don't run a higher risk of getting diabetes due to an increase in cholesterol and higher blood pressure . The study, published in the journal Diabetes Care, found that the elevated risk factors seen 12 months after giving birth had not been present at three months after giving birth. Dr Retnakaran said: 'That means that the nine-month window leading up to one year after birth is a critical time for women to ensure that they are losing at least some of their pregnancy weight.' The study is the first to follow mothers' weight patterns for the first year after giving birth and check them against the full slate of metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors. Lead author Simone Kew, of the Leadership Sinai Diabetes Centre at Mount Sinai Hospital, said: 'These findings warrant further research, because doctors will want to know which interventions to suggest to women to help them maintain healthy weight patterns during this critical first year after delivery.' She said future research will include tracking weight against metabolic risk factors for two or three years.","Researchers followed 300 patients through pregnancy .

"EXCLUSIVE By . Chris Greenwood . The high-profile prosecution of a man suspected of . mugging the husband of millionaire Tamara Ecclestone has been abandoned. Jay Rutland, 32, was left with nasty cuts to his face . when he was ambushed by two men after stopping his black Ferrari. The former jet-setting playboy was robbed of a £50,000 . Rolex and £20,000 bracelet by at least two thugs. Case abandoned: Jay Rutland, 32, pictured here with pregnant Tamara Ecclestone in Switzerland, was left with nasty cuts to his face when he was ambushed by two men. The case against a suspect has now been dropped . It later emerged that the isolated petrol station . forecourt is a notorious spot for drug dealers and the entire fracas was caught . on CCTV. But now, the Daily Mail can reveal the case was dropped three months . after the 21-year-old suspect was arrested and charged. The prosecution was quietly discontinued without a public . hearing when lawyers wrote to the defence to say they would offer no evidence. This was despite the fact several court hearings had . already taken place, including one in which the defendant pleaded not guilty. The suspect was originally traced after dropping his . mobile phone during the scuffle and the victim picked it up and handed it to . police. But prosecutors said this was the only evidence linking . him to the crime and it would not have been enough to secure a conviction. Abandoned: The case against one of Tamara Ecclestone's husbands suspected attackers has been ditched because of a lack of evidence . Mr Rutland failed to identify his attacker when he . attended a police identity parade and investigators said the CCTV footage was . of poor quality. The robbery took place in July last year as Mr Rutland . drove back into Central London along the A12 from Essex. CCTV footage showed him driving on to the entrance of a . repair shop before a scuffle took place in Wanstead, East London. The attack took place in a poorly lit area behind a . petrol station that forms part of its forecourt. Minutes later a figure could . be seen searching the ground with a torch. Mr Rutland said he was driving home when his fuel gauge . started flashing, so he stopped. He went to relieve himself in a corner when he . was approached by two men. He said they threatened, assaulted and robbed him, . leaving him with a cut above one eye that required medical treatment. Motor repair shop owner Dave Dodds, 69, whose camera . captured the fracas, said at the time: ‘It's a drug drop-off area at night. ‘I've come back here late when I've forgotten something . and found people here. I've even got video of a gun being handed over.’ A 21-year-old man, of Manor Park, East London, spent . three months on remand after being charged with robbery and possession of a . knife. The robbery happened in Wanstead in East London last summer as Mr Rutland drove along the A12 from Essex . Mr Rutland said two men threatened, assaulted and robbed him, leaving the 32-year-old with a cut above one eye that required medical treatment . Prosecutors said the only evidence linking the suspect to the crime was a mobile phone, which would have not been enough to secure a conviction . A spokeswoman for Mr Rutland said: ‘Mr Rutland respects . the decision of the CPS. Clearly he is disappointed that the proceedings didn’t . result in a conviction.’ Mr Rutland and Miss Ecclestone, 29, daughter of . billionaire Formula One mogul Bernie, are expecting their first child in the . spring. A Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) spokesman said the . suspect was charged last July pending evidence that lawyers expected to become . available. But the case was abandoned in October because there was . ‘insufficient evidence to continue’. He said: ‘With the exception of a mobile phone found at . the scene, there was no substantial evidence that could have linked the suspect . to the alleged offending. ‘The mobile phone, while significant, could not (in the . absence of any other evidence) conclusively establish who had been present. ‘There was no CCTV or automatic number plate recognition . evidence that could identify the suspect and he was not selected by the . complainant during identification procedures. ‘In light of this, we decided to discontinue the case.’","Jay Rutland, 32, was left with a bloodied face after attack in East London .

"By . Mark Prigg . Music lessons as a child could improve your brainpower for life, researchers have revealed. Researchers found that children who undertook early musical training were better at quickly processing and retaining information and problem solving. Musically trained children had to have played an instrument for at least two years in regular private music lessons. Researchers found that children who undertook early musical training were better at quickly processing and retain information and problem solving: This image shows functional MRI imaging during mental task switching: Panels A and B shows brain activation in musically trained and untrained children, respectively. Panel C shows brain areas that are more active in musically trained than musically untrained children. Gaab and colleagues compared 15 musically trained children, 9 to 12, with a control group of 12 untrained children of the same age. Musically trained children had to have played an instrument for at least two years in regular private music lessons. On average, the children had played for 5.2 years and practiced 3.7 hours per week, starting at the age of 5.9. The researchers similarly compared 15 adults who were active professional musicians with 15 non-musicians. Both control groups had no musical training beyond general school requirements. The controlled study using functional MRI brain imaging was undertaken by researchers at Boston Children's Hospital. 'Since executive functioning is a strong predictor of academic achievement, even more than IQ, we think our findings have strong educational implications,' said Nadine Gaab, who led the research. 'While many schools are cutting music programs and spending more and more time on test preparation, our findings suggest that musical training may actually help to set up children for a better academic future.' Executive functions are the high-level cognitive processes that enable people to quickly process and retain information, regulate their behaviors, make good choices, solve problems, plan and adjust to changing mental demands. Gaab and colleagues compared 15 musically trained children, 9 to 12, with a control group of 12 untrained children of the same age. Musically trained children had to have played an instrument for at least two years in regular private music lessons.

The researchers say 'our findings suggest that musical training may actually help to set up children for a better academic future' The researchers similarly compared 15 adults who were active professional musicians with 15 non-musicians. Both control groups had no musical training beyond general school requirements. Since family demographic factors can influence whether a child gets private music lessons, the researchers matched the musician/non-musician groups for parental education, job status (parental or their own) and family income. The groups, also matched for IQ, underwent a battery of cognitive tests, and the children also had functional MRI imaging (fMRI) of their brains during testing. On cognitive testing, adult musicians and musically trained children showed enhanced performance on several aspects of executive functioning. On fMRI, the children with musical training showed enhanced activation of specific areas of the prefrontal cortex during a test that made them switch between mental tasks. These areas, the supplementary motor area, the pre-supplementary area and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, are known to be linked to executive function. 'Our results may also have implications for children and adults who are struggling with executive functioning, such as children with ADHD or [the] elderly,' says Gaab.

"By . Helen Pow . An 'always happy and bubbly' Missouri girl has died after she pulled one of her grandmother's powerful painkiller patches out of the trash and put it on her leg. Destiny Spitler, 12, was found lifeless in her bed in Clinton on Saturday morning and investigators called to the scene discovered a fentanyl patch on her thigh. The girl's grandmother, Diana Spitler, uses the medication, which is up to 100 times stronger than morphine and 40 times stronger than heroin, to manage her back pain but instead of flushing the used patch down the toilet, as instructed, she put it in the bin. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Destiny Spitler, 12, was found lifeless in her bed in Clinton, Missouri, on Saturday morning and investigators called to the scene discovered a Fentanyl patch on her thigh . A police report said officers were called to the home on East Lincoln Street, which Destiny shared with her grandmother, her mother Cathleen Perron and her brothers and sisters, on a report of a person not breathing. When they arrived they performed CPR on young Destiny until an ambulance rushed her to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead. According to NBC, investigators . are looking into reports that she had put the patch on her abdomen on . Friday night after complaining of a stomach ache. The devastated grandmother described young Destiny as loving, giving and caring. 'She . loved to sing. She sang all the time. But apparently she was a very . curious little girl that we didn't realize,' Mrs Spitler told KCTV. 'It was an accident. It was stupid on my part for not getting rid of them,' she added in an interview with NBC. She said she didn't know what prompted the 12-year-old to pull the patch from the trash and affix it. 'It was a patch that was from last Tuesday. And she put it on,' she said. University of Kansas Hospital toxicologist Dr. Stephen Thornton told KCTV than sadly such cases are not uncommon. He said he had seen many incidences . where children have been attracted to a patch thinking it's a sticker and . then overdosed on the powerful medication, which has been recalled in . the past for being too potent even for patients accustomed to using . strong narcotics for pain relief. 'Once . you use that patch and you take it off, it still has about 50 per cent . of the fentanyl that was started with,' Thornton explained, urging . people to dispose of their medicines properly. An autopsy is being conducted and more information will be released when the exam and toxicology tests are completed. Stomach ache: Investigators are reportedly looking into reports that Destiny, pictured, had put the patch on her abdomen on Friday night after complaining of a stomach ache . Dangerous: The girl's grandmother, Diane Spitler, uses the medication, which is 80 times stronger than morphine, to manage her back pain . Her parents, Jay Miller and . Cathleen (Spitler) Perron, said the sixth grade student at Clinton Middle . School enjoyed singing and dancing. She was also a member of the . Northeast Baptist Church of Clinton, Missouri where she participated in . the Girls In Action Youth Group. 'Destiny loved to help people. Her . main goal in life was to make others happy,' her family wrote in an . obituary on a local funeral services website. Lt. Sonny Lynch of the Clinton Police Department said the news has shaken the community. 'We . all have children of our own and grandchildren of our own and we're a . close knit community,' Lynch told NBC. 'Anytime we have a death of a . child, no matter where that's at, it impacts you.' Mrs Spitler made a desperate plea for families to take greater care with such medications. 'Mothers, . fathers ... anyone who wears these dang patches, dispose of them, fold . them up in tiny little pieces and flush them down the stool so your . babies won't be like mine,' the grandmother said. Scene: The girl was found dead on Saturday morning at her grandmother's house, pictured, in Clinton . Fentanyl is one of the few medicines doctors recommend be flushed because it is so dangerous. Police are still investigating whether Destiny was killed by the fentanyl itself or whether it reacted to medication she was prescribed. They are awaiting results of an autopsy. Friends have also created a tribute Facebook page for the youngster, whose former babysitter, Mary Hawkins, described as 'always happy.. very bubbly,' and a memorial was set up outside her home. Krisma Dee Hawkins wrote on the Facebook page: 'Beautiful little angel we love you dearly. You are always in my heart.' Potent: The potent painkiller patch is prescribed for patients who are in severe, chronic pain and have already developed a resistance to narcotic drugs. Anyone else, including Destiny, is likely to die from overdose . Neighbor Gina Candillo told NBC: 'She's going to be missed because you see her every day outside.' The painkiller patch is prescribed for patients who are in severe, chronic pain and have already developed a resistance to narcotic drugs. Cancer patients are sometimes prescribed the painkiller patch because of the extreme pain often associated with the disease. The Food and Drugs Administration warns that, for patients who are not opioid-tolerant, the amount of fentanyl in one fentanyl patch of the lowest strength is large enough to cause dangerous side effects such as severe trouble breathing, very slow or shallow breathing or even death. Police in Canada recently warned against the drug, which was being marketed as a recreational drug for young people on the black market. In late April, Montreal police raided seven locations, seizing more than 300,000 illegally produced synthetic prescription drugs, including Viagra and Cialis. Some of the seized pills were fentanyl. Dr. Peter Vamos, the Director-General of the Portage Rehabilitation Center, said the drug could prove exceptionally dangerous to potential users. 'The impacts are very unpredictable, and the unsophisticated users not knowing the impacts of the drugs that they are taking, not knowing the mixture of what's in these pills is going to result, unfortunately, in many tragedies,' Vamos said during an interview with the CBC. Fentanyl is so strong that even some of the police officers who handled the drug during last month's raids suffered injuries. 'Even though they were wearing masks and gloves, still just by being in contact with the product, they suffered from mild injuries. One of them had to be hospitalized because of a heart condition,' said Inspector Marc Riopel of the Montreal Police on Monday. Fentanyl, also known as fentanil, is a very potent, narcotic pain medication with a rapid onset and short duration of action. The drug is often used in the form of patches by patients with chronic pain or cancer patients. According to the Food and Drugs Administration, for patients who are not opioid-tolerant, the amount of fentanyl in one fentanyl patch of the lowest strength is large enough to cause dangerous side effects such as severe trouble breathing, very slow or shallow breathing or even death. Historically, it has been used to treat breakthrough pain and is commonly used in pre-procedures as a pain reliever as well as an anesthetic in combination with a benzodiazepine. The drug is around 100 times more potent than morphine, with 100 micrograms of fentanyl approximately equivalent to 10 mg of morphine and 75 mg of pethidine. The painkiller patch is prescribed for patients who are in severe, chronic pain and have already developed a resistance to narcotic drugs. Cancer patients are sometimes prescribed the painkiller patch because of the extreme pain often associated with the disease. Certain brands of the drug including Duragesic® by PriCara among others have been recalled in the past because a defect in the patches could result in even accustomed patient overdosing and dying.","Destiny Spitler, 12, was found lifeless .

"By . Associated Press . Chipotle's coming price hikes could hit steak lovers particularly hard. The Mexican food chain said earlier this month that it plans to start charging more for its burritos, bowls and tacos in coming weeks as it faces rising costs for ingredients. On Tuesday, Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung noted that the chain doesn't currently charge a whole lot more for its steak filling, even though beef costs have climbed considerably. Chioptle will raise the cost of steak dishes as the company is forced to pay more for beef due to the dwindling numbers of cattle in the U.S. 'There's a very narrow gap between our . steak burrito and our chicken burrito. We're going to widen that,' Hartung said at the Barclays Retail and Consumer Discretionary . Conference in New York City. 'We're going to allow our customers to . choose whether they want to pay the higher price of steak.' Hartung also said the price hike would be more like 4 percent to 6 percent, or 32 cents to 48 cents, assuming the cost of a burrito is $8. In the past, executives had said they were considering a hike of 3 percent to 5 percent, or 24 cents to 40 cents. Chipotle says it will be the first national price hike in three years. He did not specify how much more prices would rise for steak than for chicken. Fast-food and restaurant chains are facing rising costs for beef, given the reductions in U.S. cattle inventory in recent years. In April, Hartung said Chipotle's beef prices were up 25 percent compared with the prices it was paying in the fourth quarter of last year. Chipotle steak dishes may cost as much as 48 cents more per item as the company is forced to pay top dollar for beef products . Chipotle, which has more than 1,600 locations, isn't the only one encouraging customers to switch to chicken as the cost of beef climbs. Burger King's head of North American operations, Alex Macedo, has also noted that the chain has been able to maintain its profitability in part by marketing chicken items more aggressively. This week, Miami-based Burger King is bringing back its popular 'Subservient Chicken' advertising campaign from a decade ago to promote a chicken version of its Big King sandwich. Even if Chipotle Mexican Grill's higher prices for steak push customers to trade down to chicken or other options, Hartung noted that those alternatives are more profitable for the company because the ingredients don't cost as much. Exactly how much of a price increase customers see at Chipotle in coming weeks will depend on where they live. The company has said the price hike should be in place by this summer. As steak prices at Chipotle rise the company may stop advertising steak and start pushing customers to order chicken which will remain the same price .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Prosecutors said Monday they will not file criminal charges against a Northern California sheriff's deputy who shot and killed a 13-year-old boy carrying a pellet gun he mistook for an assault rifle. The parents of Andy Lopez decried the decision, saying 'it is impossible' to accept and they felt as though their son 'had been killed again.' The teen's death last year heightened racial tensions in a mostly Latino neighborhood of Santa Rosa, a city of about 170,000 residents around 50 miles north of San Francisco. The shooting parked protests and criticism that the officer acted too quickly. Scroll down for video . Off the hook: The Sonoma County District Attorney announced Monday that she would not be charging Sheriff's Deputy Erick Gelhaus (right) in the October 22 fatal shooting of 13-year-old Andy Lopez (left) Mistake: Deputy Gelhaus told investigators that he believed the eighth-grader was carrying an assault rifle, and only later found out that it was a toy BB gun . Grief-stricken parents: Lopez's parents Rodrigo (left) and Sujay (rught) seen leaving a news conference on November 4, 2013. In a statement issued Monday, the Lopez family said the decision not to press charges is like experiencing Andy's death all over again . Deputy Erick Gelhaus, 48, fired multiple rounds in response to what he believed was an imminent threat of death, Sonoma County District Attorney Jill Ravitch announced at a news conference. 'While in the lawful performance of his duty, Deputy Gelhaus was faced with a highly unpredictable and rapidly evolving situation,' Ravitch said. 'He believed honestly and reasonably that he was faced with a do-or-die dilemma.' 'While this was an absolute tragedy it was not a criminal act,' Ravitch said. Ravitch displayed photographs of the pellet gun found next to Lopez and a real assault rifle to highlight similarities in appearance. Ourtage: Dozens gathered outside the press conference today to protest the decision . Gelhaus shot Lopez on October 22 as the teen walked near his home with the pellet gun. The deputy told investigators he believed the gun was real and opened fire out of fear for his life. At least one witness said he heard the deputy order Lopez to drop the pellet gun before shooting, Ravitch said. Gelhaus fired eight times, striking the eighth-grader seven times with his department-issued 9 mm handgun. The district attorney said Gelhaus had 18 rounds in his gun and stopped shooting when he felt the threat had ended. Lopez was declared dead at the scene. 'This disheartening decision leaves the family feeling as though Andy had been killed again today,' Lopez parents said in a prepared statement released by their lawyer, Arnoldo Casillas. Casillas represents the family in a wrongful death lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco against the county and Gelhaus, which has been on hold pending the outcome of the district attorney's investigation. Casillas said he will petition the court to restart the litigation. Scorn: Human rights attorney Jonathan Melrod spoke after the decision, saying 'the militarization of the police is evolving into ""us versus them""' Casillas said 'it is impossible' to accept Ravitch's conclusions and that he and the family are asking federal officials to investigate. After the announcement today, dozens gathered to protest the decision . Human rights attorney Jonathan Melrod spoke, saying Lopez was shot 't because he was a kid carrying a toy gun where kids play. The militarization of the police is evolving into ""us versus them.""' The FBI said it is looking into the shooting to determine if any civil rights violations occurred. The district attorney forwarded her report to federal investigators. FBI agent Brian Weber said investigators have 'collected and reviewed documents and other evidence produced in connection with this matter and is working with the United States Attorney's Office and the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.' Weber declined further comment. Dangerous place: Part of what factored into Deputy Gelhaus's decision to open fire was that Lopez's neighborhood has been plagued with gun violence. Above, a scene of the neighborhood after Lopez was shot . Those who have protested the shooting said the deputy did not give ample warning before opening fire. Investigators have said 10 seconds elapsed between the time Gelhaus and a trainee reported a 'suspicious person' and then reported shots fired to dispatchers. The trainee did not open fire. Ravitch said her office's findings will not alleviate the pain felt by Lopez's family or the community. Sonoma County Sheriff Steve Freitas said an internal investigation also concluded Gelhaus and his partner acted appropriately and that the department would now evaluate the incident to determine if 'there are things we can do differently going forward, or to improve performance in general.' Freitas called for passage of a state Senate bill introduced in January that would require pellet guns to look clearly different from those that fire bullets. After a long delay, District Attorney Jill Ravitch announced today that she will not be filing criminal charges against Erick Gelhaus, the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Deputy who shot and killed 13-year-old Andy Lopez. This disheartening decision leaves the family feeling as though Andy had been killed again today. It is impossible to accept Ravitch’s conclusion that Gelhaus shot and killed Andy in response to what he 'honestly and reasonably believed was an imminent threat of death to himself or others.' No reasonable officer in such circumstances could believe he was encountering anything but a teenager with a toy gun on a sunny afternoon in a residential area.Erick Gelhaus’ exaggerated and careless response deserves a truly transparent and impartial evaluation. Ms. Ravitch’s conclusion is a mockery of justice and confirms that her office cannot meaningfully sit in judgment of local law enforcement. This cowardly political decision sends the tacit message that law enforcement officials who use excessive force in Sonoma County will not suffer meaningful consequences and, instead, will enjoy immunity from local prosecution.The family, through their attorney, will petition the U.S. District court for the immediate lifting of the stay of the proceedings as to Erick Gelhaus and thereby allow the civil case to move forward as to him and Sonoma County.The family will also urge the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Attorney’s office to conduct an impartial investigation as to the shooting and killing of Andy Lopez.Lastly, for those who share their anguish over this decision, the family asks that the Sonoma County community to continue to observe peace.","Sonoma County Sheriff's Deputy Erick Gelhaus shot dead 13-year-old Andy Lopez on October 22, 2013 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Investigators are piecing together the details of a devastating boating accident in Florida that claimed the lives of four young people, but one victim's family says it doesn't matter what happened; all that matters is that their daughter is gone. The devastated parents of Kelsie Karpiak, 24, who was killed when three boats collided in Dinner Key Marina have spoken about their heartbreak at the loss of their daughter. Rosanna and Craig Karpiak said their daughter wasn't even planning to go out the night of the accident, but received a last minute call from a friend. Unbearable loss: The Karpiak's daughter was sleeping on their couch when a friend called to invite her out on July 4 . Young life: Kelsie Karpiak was due to return to Jacksonville today to work for a dance company, but her family must now plan her funeral . 'The only thing that matters is that my daughter's gone and nothing's going to bring her back,' Craig Karpiak told NBC. 'It doesn't matter, the investigation will be what it is and what happened, happened.' Also killed were 23-year-olds Andrew Garcia and Tori Dempsey who were on the boat with Karpiak. The fourth victim was Jason Soleimani, 23, who was aboard another boat. Another victim, Catherine Payan, 24, is in hospital in a coma with serious brain injuries. Kelsie Karpiak was due to return to Jacksonville to work with a dance company Monday, but instead, her parents must plan for her funeral. 'Our family is devastated and there's three other families in this city that are devastated also, all young kids and that's all that matters,' Craig Karpiak said. Rosanna Karpiak says she has gotten some measure of comfort knowing that her daughter is with God. 'Life is short and as it is and you have to be ready and our daughter was ready,' Rosanna Karpiak told NBC. 'She believed in Jesus and she was saved and I know that she's in heaven and I know it because God has comforted my heart.'

The horrific scene unfolded after . 10.30pm after the three boats, including a 36-foot yacht collided in . what authorities called a 'mad dash' for the marina. The other two boats . were smaller fishing-type watercrafts, said police. Multiple . law enforcement agencies responded to the crash Friday night near the . Dinner Key Marina in Miami, with officers plucking several people out of . the water. Garcia, an avid fisherman and boater, is believed to have been behind the wheel of the vessel carrying Karpiak and Payan, as well as another female, when it slammed into another boat, police sources told WSVN. He was instantly ejected into the water as the boat ricocheted into another one - his body was found in the harbor along with Dempsey's, police said. Payan sustained severe head trauma, sources told WSVN, her long-term prognosis is not known. Rescuers . were alerted by one of the boaters at about 10:45pm He said he'd . been hit by another vessel and that his 36-foot pleasure craft was . taking on water, authorities said. 'We kept getting report after report of more people in the water,' Miami Fire Rescue Lt. Ignatius Carroll said during a press briefing. Destroyed: one of the boats in the collision sustained heavy damage . Helping hand: That same boat had to be towed to shore . Mobbed with emergency responders: Firefighters, paramedics and police flooded the scene late last night . The chaotic scene only grew worse as police had trouble determining how many people were actually in the water. 'The numbers kept growing and growing,' said Carroll. Eight people were initially transported to Miami hospitals. Garcia's father aided in the search for his son. 'I’ve paid the ultimate price, I’m out on my boat looking for my son’s body,' his father Jack Garcia texted a WFOR reporter. Jack Garcia is a retired fire boat captain from Miami-Dade Fire-Rescue. Carroll detailed the manic search and rescue effort in the moments after the crash in comments reported by the Miami Herald. EMTs were simultaneously performing CPR on three people as shouts of more bodies in the water kept calling out. Boats were going back and forth from water to land with people scooped to safety. 'We had boats motorcading back and forth bringing in injured people,' said Carroll. 'They were out there in the dark. What was really challenging was you don’t know how many people were on the boats. In a hurry: Emergency workers carry an injured person on a stretcher on Friday night, July 4, 2014 after three boats collided near a Miami marina around the end of a fireworks display . Medivac: Emergency workers bring another injured person to a helicopter for quick transport to a hospital . Lucky to be alive: Emergency workers treat a handful of the dozens injured in ambulances away from the docks . 'There were people who were traumatized, injured, confused,' said Carroll. 'We weren’t getting accurate counts of people. We were trying to determine, did we have everybody? And then we found out there was still a possibility two people were still missing'. The boaters are believed to have been taking in a fireworks display a short time earlier. 'My understanding is they may have been out there enjoying the fireworks display, and typically after the fireworks are over, everyone makes a mad dash for the nearest marina,' said Jorge Pino, a public information officer with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. However, Pino cautioned that the exact circumstances were still under investigation. Carroll recounted how anxious relatives waited for news of their loved ones at the dock. One man, he recalled, worried about his two grandchildren. Both arrived safely to shore. 'We were relieved to be able to let him know that they were OK,' Carroll said. Karpiak was a cheerleader during high school and even performed in the 2007 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, according to the Miami Herald.","Andrew Garcia, 23, Tori Dempsey, 23, Kelsie Karpiak, 24, and Jason Soleimani, 23, were killed after being thrown from their boats .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Lifeguards along more than six miles of pristine sand in this Southern California beach city had rescued more than 200 people by the time the call came to help a distressed swimmer east of one of the main piers. Ben Carlson, a lifeguard with 15 years of experience, sped out with other guards in a rescue boat on Sunday and jumped into the water, but he quickly disappeared under 10- to 12-foot waves. The 32-year-old, a passionate surfer and one of the fastest swimmers on the 200-strong mostly seasonal lifeguard staff, was pronounced dead late on Sunday after rescuers searched for him by air, water and foot for three hours. Ben Carlson, a lifeguard with 15 years of experience, sped out with other guards in a rescue boat on Sunday and jumped into the water, but he quickly disappeared under 10- to 12-foot waves . Ben Carlson was described as a 'swimming monster' who knew how to handle himself in 30- and 40-foot waves while surfing . He was the first lifeguard to die in Newport Beach, where locals and tourists alike flock to enjoy wide sandy beaches and waves that attract the attention of surfers worldwide. ‘He just loved being out on the water, he loved the opportunity to help people,’ said his father, Chris Carlson. ‘He was a water monster - that was one of the things that was so unbelievable to us; a lowly 10-foot wave would take him out because he was so experienced.’ He said his son knew how to handle himself in 30- and 40-foot waves while surfing. Newport Beach lifeguard boats converge at the end of the pier after the three hour search for a missing lifeguard Ben Carlson ended . 'He just loved being out on the water, he loved the opportunity to help people,' said his father, Chris Carlson . ‘It's one of those professions that people think you're getting in the way of fun, or it's kind of a cakewalk job, and something like this happens, and people realize how truly dangerous it can be,’ Carlson said. The swimmer, who has not been identified by authorities, was brought to shore and survived. Conditions on Sunday were especially treacherous, with swells of 12 feet or more crashing in without warning and a strong current that took swimmers by surprise. Around 100,000 people packed the beach with about 80 lifeguards on duty, said Rob Williams, the city's chief lifeguard. ‘It's not typical that we always have 10- to 12-foot surf, but it does happen once or twice a year, and it happened to be a Sunday with fantastic weather on a holiday weekend,’ said Williams, whose guards made more than 200 rescues and issued 3,000 warnings to beachgoers that day. Carlson was the first lifeguard to die in Newport Beach, where locals and tourists alike flock to enjoy wide sandy beaches and waves that attract the attention of surfers worldwide . Newport Beach lifeguards rescued hundreds of swimmers over the weekend due to dangerous rip currents . The city gets 10 million beach visitors annually. The National Weather Service had warned Sunday of dangerous rip currents and high surf along Southern California beaches due to a swell originating in the Southern Hemisphere. Beachgoers said on Monday that a particularly huge swell surged ashore in the late afternoon, drenching blankets and upsetting picnics. Shortly after, rescue boats buzzed between the waves and helicopters began flying low over the water up and down the beach. ‘The waves were huge. I saw it and I thought a tsunami was coming,’ said Shirley Reinker, 72, who has lived along the beach for 40 years. The fallen lifeguard was raised in the inland suburbs of Southern California but always loved the ocean. As soon as Ben Carlson was old enough to get a driver's license, he tried to get a lifeguard job about an hour's drive away in Newport Beach, his father said. Rescuers took three hours to locate the teenager after he disappeared under a 10-foot high wave and were later seen tearfully consoling one another on Newport Beach . He traveled to surf big waves and played water polo at the University of California, Irvine. And while worked as beverages director for the Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant chain, he would lifeguard whenever he could, the elder Carlson said. He was one of the fastest swimmers on staff, Williams said. All lifeguards must be able to swim 0.6 miles in under 20 minutes and re-qualify annually, but Carlson had additional training to work on a boat as a rescue swimmer and drive patrol vehicles, Williams said. As a seasonal guard, Carlson made about $22 an hour. Friends hung his red lifeguard jacket over the bar at a local Irish pub blocks from the beach, a lifeguard hangout. A sign outside read: ‘Ben would go. We love you. You will be missed.’ An autopsy was scheduled for Tuesday. For his part, the elder Carlson takes some solace in that his son died doing what he loved most, and that he was a man of faith. ‘He's in paradise today - swimming with dolphins,’ he said.","Ben Carlson was pronounced dead late on Sunday after rescuers searched for him by air, water and foot for three hours .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press . A federal judge has granted preliminary approval to a deal that would remove the cap from a settlement to compensate former NFL players over the next 65 years for concussion-related claims. Thousands of former players claiming their quality of life had deteriorated as they suffered from depression, memory loss and other consequences of repeated head injuries had previously balked at a $675million cap on claims. Their claims were made in well over 200 lawsuits and then consolidated into the class action lawsuit that appears to have finally been settled. Suffering from multiple concussions:  Ben Utecht #86 of the Indianapolis Colts, pictured being tackled by Marion McCree #20 of the San Diego Chargers during their 2008 AFC Divisional Playoff game, claims concussions forced him into early retirement and are now affecting his memory - he is one of thousands of former players to make such a claim against the NFL . 'This is an extraordinary settlement for . retired NFL players and their families — from those who suffer with . neuro-cognitive illnesses today, to those who are currently healthy but . fear they may develop symptoms decades into the future,' attorneys Sol Weiss and Christopher Seeger said in a statement shortly after the decision was announced. U.S. District Judge Anita Brody also announced that final approval will hinge on a fairness hearing scheduled for Nov 19. Lawyers will now begin notifying eligible players of their possible payouts. Those eligible include former Dallas Cowboys running back Tony Dorsett, Super Bowl-winning Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon, who suffers from dementia, and former Indianapolis Colts tight end Ben Utecht (pictured above), who claims he is suffering from memory loss. 'We are grateful to Judge Brody for her guidance and her thoughtful analysis of the issues as reflected in the comprehensive opinion she issued today,' NFL senior vice president Anastasia Danias said in a statement. League lawyer:  Anastasia Danias, the NFL's Vice President for Legal Affairs (pictured at a press conference earlier this year), announced the league is 'grateful' for the settlement's new terms . Brody denied in January an adjusted settlement with a cap of $765million and a fixed payout of $675million - which was an improvement on the league's first offer. The original settlement included $675million for compensatory claims for players with neurological symptoms, $75million for baseline testing and $10million for medical research and education. The NFL would also have payed an additional $112 million to the players’ lawyers, for a total payout of more than $870 million. There is now no limit to how much the league may be required to payout to settle claims, but many do not believe the league will pay out much more than $675million when all is said and done. The revised settlement eliminates the cap on overall damage claims but retains a payout formula for individual retirees that considers their age and illness. A young retiree with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, would receive $5 million, a 50-year-old with Alzheimer’s disease would get $1.6 million, and an 80-year-old with early dementia would get $25,000. The NFL was also limited to 10 annual appeals of decisions that a former player was eligible for a monetary award under the first settlement offer. Under the revised settlement, there is no limit on the appeals to a court-supervised 'appeals advisory panel.' But the settlement says if the NFL makes 'vexatious, frivolous or bad faith appeals,' the players' attorneys can petition the court for relief. All former NFL players retired as of Monday's preliminary approval will be eligible for benefits of the settlement — not just the ex-players who joined in suits. In court documents, the judge estimated there are about 20,000 retired NFL players. Brody scheduled the hearing, which will . determine if it is 'fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best . interests' of former players, for November to allow adequate time for . them to be notified. Also eligible: Former Dallas Cowboys star running back Tony Dorsett (left, pictured in 2011 at the 'NFL Experience' in Shanghai) and Jim McMahon (right, #9 of the Arizona Cardinals) shown dropping back to pass during a 1994 game . In the suits, the ex-players alleged that for decades the NFL knowingly concealed the risk of concussions and their long-term effects. In the settlement, the NFL makes no admission of guilt to those allegations. The players also are not required to prove that their conditions are related to football. The diagnoses would be made by a network of physicians approved by the NFL and the players' attorneys. Attorneys for the players will get paid, too. The judge will determine that based on a petition by the attorneys provided it does not exceed $112.5 million. That amount will be paid separate. 'These fees and incurred costs will be paid separately by the NFL Parties and not from the Baseline Assessment Program Fund, Educational Fund or Monetary Award Fund,' says the settlement notification to ex-players. Players who do no opt out of the settlement may still raise objections to its terms. They are asked to notify the court in writing. They may also ask the judge for permission to speak at the fairness hearing. Critics of the deal have said the league, with annual revenues approaching $10 billion, was getting off lightly. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the settlement avoids the risk of a protracted legal battle.","The judge's decision removes a $675million cap previously in place to limit the NFL's liability in settling concussion-related claims .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . A severe thunderstorm spawned a tornado over the holiday weekend that injured at least six people and caused significant damage to homes in western Michigan, officials said Monday. The fast-moving thunderstorm intensified in Michigan Sunday evening over Kentwood, just south of Grand Rapids, the National Weather Service said. It packed winds in excess of 80mph, according to some estimates. The twister touched down in Byron Center and traveled just over 6 miles. It was 300 to 400 yards wide, according to the weather service website. Uprooted: Leisure Acres condominium residents make their way through the damaged area in Kentwood, Mich. Monday, July 7, 2014 . The tornado's winds reached the 100-110 mile per hour range, weather service forecaster Brian Meadey said. The impact was serious but limited in area. 'It's not extensive damage, but there was some heavy damage within it,' said Meade. It knocked down trees and power lines, ripped the roofs of a number of houses and sent two people to hospitals for treatment after their homes collapsed, Kentwood Mayor Stephen Kepley said in a statement. Many roads remained impassible Monday afternoon because of fallen trees. The American Red Cross opened a shelter about 1.00 a.m. Monday at a Kentwood recreation center, and about 60 people stayed overnight, said Kent County emergency management coordinator Jack Stewart. He said about 20 people were still there Monday afternoon. A total of six people were hurt, thankfully none of the injuries appearing life-threatening, according to Stewart. Badly damaged: This house, in Kentwood, was hit by trees brought down by heavy winds in a severe storm late Sunday . A helping hand: People stand outside a Red Cross emergency shelter that was set up at the Kentwood Community Center . Several tornadoes were also reported Iowa, and at least two homes were damaged after storms passed through the central part of the state. The same possible tornado tracked through both Grundy and Tama counties, the weather service said, with a separate storm hitting Jasper County. In North Dakota, weekend storms caused heavy damage at a Missouri River recreation area south of Bismarck and injured people at a lake southwest of the city. Several tents and vehicles were destroyed by strong winds and falling trees at Kimball Bottoms on Saturday night. In Michigan, Jan Collins told The Grand Rapids Press that she heard the wind blow and then, an enormous boom as a tree toppled onto her family's garage. 'There was this rumbling sound, and it was raining especially hard, before the wind came out of nowhere,' Collins said. 'I think the car will be OK - the tree kind of just rested on top.' Flood warnings were in effect until Tuesday morning in Michigan's Gratiot, Ionia and Montcalm counties, where some roads were washed out, the weather service said. CMS Energy Corp.'s Consumers Energy unit said Monday morning that roughly 20,000 of its customers lost power. About 9,600 of those homes and businesses are in Kent County, including Kentwood.","The twister touched down Sunday night in the town of Kentwood .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The mother of a murdered 4-year-old boy is outraged that a YouTube user refuses to stop posting videos about her slain son. Brendan Gonzalez disappeared when he was only 4, his father later convicted of his murder . Brendan Gonzalez was murdered by father Ivan Henk in Nebraska in 2003. While the body was never recovered, mother Rebecca Gonzalez told KHOU she's come to accept her son's death. 'Nobody wants to be a part of a club like this,' she said. 'You always think about your children whether they’re with you . or not.' Then in January, YouTube user changinglittlethings posted a montage of the boy's pictures with a suggestion that he may still be alive. Not only is there a suggestion that the boy's disappearance may be linked to a child trafficking ring, the user even speculates on his current appearance were he alive. The video hast torn open old wounds for Gonzalez. 'If someones posting lies about your loved one, you want to fight . it. You just can’t let it go,'  she said. She . has flagged the video more than 100 times and asked both the user and . YouTube to remove the video but it has remained online. 'She needs to leave my son out of it,' she said. 'We’ve been through enough. My son’s memory deserves more than that.' Mother Rebecca Gonzalez says she's begged both YouTube and the user to remove the video but to no avail . The user has argued that any objection to the video is simply acting on behalf of a conspiracy to hide the truth of Brendan's disappearance. The woman, who's real name has not been released, has vowed to continue posting until she is put in jail or killed. Gonzalez says she simple wants he boy's name and photos out of the videos. She says she is currently seeking legal representation. 'It can happen to anybody’s child, and that’s scary,' she said. 'You can’t just use people’s images of their loved ones for sick . twisted missions.'","Mother Rebecca Gonzalez says she's begged both YouTube and the user to remove the video .

"By . Lydia Warren . A former gang member, juvenile inmate and high school dropout could become the next lieutenant governor of Nevada - and the most high profile Hispanic Democrat in the U.S. State Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, 34, is the party's nomination for June's election, when she will go head-to-head with top attorney and state senator Mark Hutchison from the GOP. The election is considered particularly important because whoever wins will take over as governor when Gov. Brian Sandoval likely vacates his office to challenge Senator Harry Reid in 2016. It means that Flores, who was born into an impoverished family of 13 children and repeatedly clashed with the law before turning her life around, would finally give the Democrats a high-profile candidate to appeal to Hispanic voters. Key candidate: Nevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, pictured in May, could become the next lieutenant governor of the state - and the most high profile Hispanic Democrat in the U.S. 'I don't have the background of a typical politician, right?' she told a crowd of Democratic activists as she accepted the party’s nomination, MSNBC reported in a lengthy profile of her this weekend. There is also that Flores will be able to appeal to Latino voters, battling the Republican party's Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and New Mexico's Susana Martinez - making her a key figure for the Democrats. 'There are Lucys in every town across . this state,' she told activists. 'That's why my focus is on making sure . that this is a state that works for every Nevadan, not just the . privileged few.' Flores, who has a rose tattoo on her ankle, had a troubled childhood before she went to college and eventually became a lawyer and state legislator. When she was a toddler, her mariachi singer father . moved the family from California, where she was born, to Nevada after two of her . older brothers were killed in gang-related violence. She initially took well to the new home, but when her mother suddenly left the family when Flores was nine, things took a turn for the worst. Younger years: Flores (pictured center with her father and brother) started struggling at school after her mother left her and her 12 siblings and became mixed up with gangs when she became a teenager . As she hit her teen years, Flores was failing classes and hanging out with gangs, eventually committing petty crimes such as theft and running away from home. But after she stole a car to drive to a store to steal beer, police signaled for her to move over - and she hit the gas. 'I led them on a bit of a low speed chase through half of a neighborhood that I currently represent,' she recalled, MSNBC reported. 'There are Lucys in every town across . this state. That's why my focus is on making sure . that this is a state that works for every Nevadan, not just the . privileged few' Lucy Flores . After they caught her, she spent most of the following year in a juvenile detention center, leaving when she was 15 - and vowing not to return. Still, she ran into problems with the law again and was ultimately helped by a tough parole officer, Leslie Camp, who urged a judge to release the troubled teen after another arrest. 'I . recognized she had a lot of familial issues,' Camp told MSNBC. 'She basically needed some mentoring and . direction, but she had a good heart.' At 17, she left high school to work at a doctor's office before becoming a receptionist at a local women's prison and finally working as an office manager for an accounting firm in Los . Angeles. But then she hit a ceiling: higher-up positions required a degree. She returned to Las Vegas, earned a GED, enrolled in her local . community college and received a scholarship to the University of Southern California where she decided to study law. Video Source YouTube . Turning her life around: A 19-year-old Flores is pictured with her father and stepmother after dropping out of school and working in local businesses before realizing she needed a college degree to further her career . 'Growing up, I'd had all these interactions with the law,' she said. 'I'd always tell myself ""I could be my own lawyer"".' She then went on to study at . the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, where she helped found a clinic to . challenge wrongful convictions. From there, she started to lobby the state . legislature for new reforms and was inspired to run for . state Assembly and by 2011, she was representing her former neighborhood. Heading for the top: Flores, pictured on her Twitter page, is an important candidate for the Democrats . Flores, who is single, is not afraid of referring to her troubled past when throwing her support by issues or calling for reform. Mostly famously, she revealed in 2012 as she testified in support for the expansion of school health programs that she had undergone an abortion aged 16. 'I had six other sisters… all of them . became pregnant in their teens – all of them,' she had said. 'One of . them was 14 years old when she got pregnant with twins. 'Since . I’m sharing so much this session, I might as well keep going. I always said that I was the only one who didn't have kids in . their teenage years. That's because at 16, I got an abortion.' She explained how she had begged her father to pay the $200 for the procedure because she didn't want to be like her sisters. She said she had no regrets about the decision. After the testimony, she was attacked by anti-abortion activists and lauded by pro-choice groups, while other women reached out to share their own stories with her. 'Demographically, she's perfect: Young, dynamic, Hispanic,' Harry Reid has said. 'Our . young women can be able to actually look at the governor’s mansion and . see that there is a woman - a woman of color - who was actually able to . come from District 28 and become the governor of Nevada.' If she takes over the governorship - by filling Reid's vacancy or winning in 2018 - she would become the most high profile Hispanic Democrat in the U.S.","Lucy Flores is the Democrat's nomination for lieutenant governor .

"By . Associated Press . Washington state issued its first retail marijuana licenses on . Monday, in a series of middle-of-the-night emails alerting bleary-eyed . pot-shop proprietors that they will finally be able to open for . business. 'We're pretty stoked,' said John Evich, an investor in . Bellingham's Top Shelf Cannabis, in a 2.30am PT interview. 'We haven't . had any sleep in a long time, but we're excited for the next step.' Randy . Simmons, the state Liquor Control Board's project manager for legal . marijuana, said on Sunday night that the first two dozen stores were . being notified so early in order to give them an extra few hours to get . cannabis on their shelves before they are allowed to open their doors at . 8am on Tuesday – an opening that is expected to be accompanied by high . prices, shortages and rationing. Cannabis City owner James Lathrop prepares for his new marijuana shop days before the grand opening on Wednesday . A one-gram packet of a variety of recreational marijuana named 'Space Needle' is shown during packaging operations at Sea of Green Farms in Seattle . The issuance of the retail licenses marked a major step that has been 20 months in the making. Washington and Colorado stunned most of the world by voting in November 2012 to legalise marijuana for adults over 21, . and to create state-licensed systems for growing, selling and taxing the . pot. Sales began in Colorado on 1 January. It remained unclear . how many of the pot-shops being licensed in Washington planned to open . on Tuesday. Officials eventually expect to have more than 300 . recreational pot shops across the state. At Cannabis City, which . will be the first and, for now, only recreational marijuana shop in . Seattle, owner James Lathrop worked into the night on Sunday placing . no-parking signs in front of his building, hoisting a grand-opening . banner and hanging artwork before he turned his attention to his email – . and the official notification that he was a licensed marijuana dealer. 'I've . had a long day. It really hasn't sunk in yet,' he said early on Monday. He planned to hold off on opening his store until noon on Tuesday. 'Know your audience: we're talking stoners here,' he said. 'I'd be mean to say they need to get up at 5am to get in line.'

A worker weighs out one-gram packets of a variety of recreational marijuana named 'Space Needle,' during packaging operations at Sea of Green Farms in Seattle . Stevie Askew, a worker at Sea of Green Farms, packs recreational marijuana into blunts that will be sold in stores tomorrow . With . the emailed notifications in hand, the shops immediately worked to . place their orders with some of the state's first licensed growers. As . soon as the orders were received, via state-approved software for . tracking the bar-coded pot, the growers could place the product in a . required 24-hour 'quarantine' before shipping it early on Tuesday . morning. The final days before sales have been frenetic for . growers and retailers alike. Lathrop and his team hired an events . company to provide crowd control, arranged for a food truck and free . water for those who might spend hours waiting outside, and rented a . portable toilet. At Nine Point Growth Industries, a marijuana . grower in Bremerton, owner Gregory Stewart said he and his director . celebrated after they worked through some glitches in the pot-tracking . software early on Monday and officially learned they would be able to . transport their weed 24 hours later, at 2.22am on Tuesday.

Cannabis City owner James Lathrop briefly stands outside his business which will open to the public tomorrow . 'It's . the middle of the night and we're standing here doing high-fives and our . version of a happy dance,' he said. 'It's huge for us.' Pot . prices were expected to reach $25 a gram or higher on the first day of . sales – twice what people pay in the state's unregulated medical . marijuana dispensaries. That was largely due to the short supply of . legally produced pot in the state. Although more than 2,600 people . applied to become licensed growers, fewer than 100 have been approved – . and only about a dozen were ready to harvest by early this month. Nevertheless, . Evich said his shop in Bellingham wanted to thank the state's residents . for voting for the law by offering $10 grams of one cannabis strain to . the first 50 or 100 customers. The other strains would be priced between . $12 and $25, he said. In Seattle, among those who planned to buy . some of the first pot at Cannabis City was Alison Holcomb, the lawyer . who drafted Washington's law. She said it was a good opportunity to . remind people of the big-picture arguments for ending nearly a century . of prohibition and displacing the black market, including keeping . non-violent, adult marijuana users out of jail; redirecting profits away . from criminal groups; and ending racial disparities in who gets busted.

"By . Associated Press . When a man regarded as the deadliest sniper in U.S. history detailed his kills in a bestselling autobiography, he also included details about a 2006 incident in which he says he punched a guy he called ‘Scruff Face’ — later identified as former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. Ventura, a public figure with a tough-guy image, says the fight didn't happen, and he sued author Chris Kyle for defamation. The trial begins Tuesday, and it will be up to Ventura's attorneys to prove that Kyle's account about that night in a California bar was false — and even more difficult, that Kyle knew it. ‘Ventura is going to have to prove falsity...but the harder part is proving actual malice,’ said Raleigh Levine, a law professor at William Mitchell College of Law in St. Paul. ‘It has to do with what you know about the truth — that you actually knew that what you were saying was false or that you recklessly disregarded the truth.’ The suit must go on:  ¿It's about clearing my name. It's a lie,¿ Ventura told The Associated Press in February about the reference to him in Chris Kyle's 2012 autobiography. Kyle used the name Scruff Face for a man whom he punched out in a bar for disparaging George W. Bush. Scruff Face was later revealed to be Ventura . Besides sorting out what happened in the bar, jurors will have to assess whether Ventura's reputation was damaged and whether Kyle used Ventura's name to make a profit. Kyle and a friend were killed in February 2013 at a Texas gun range, allegedly by an Iraq War veteran they were trying to help. Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, is now the defendant. Big money may be at stake. Court documents show Kyle's book had earned royalties of more than $3 million as of June 30, 2013, and the judge already has ruled that proceeds from an upcoming movie could be subject to damages, too. Ventura has said the case isn't about money. ‘It's about clearing my name. It's a lie,’ Ventura told The Associated Press in February. Ventura and Taya Kyle are both expected to testify during the trial, which will likely last more than two weeks. Defendant: Kyle, seen here in 2012, claims 'Scruff Face' disparaged the president and said the Navy SEALs deserve to 'lose a few' at a bar . Kyle died when an Iraq War vet he was allegedly trying to help shot him and a friend at a Texas gun range in 2013 . Ventura, a former Navy SEAL and pro wrestler whose post-political life has included hosting several cable TV shows, claims Kyle defamed him to gain notoriety for his best-selling 2012 book, ‘American Sniper,’ which describes his kills of insurgents from 1999 to 2009. A movie based on the book, starring Bradley Cooper, is in production. Claim to fame: Kyle is to date the most deadly of all U.S. snipers. The autobiography in which he allegedly defamed Ventura is called American Sniper . In the book, Kyle describes an incident in which he claims Ventura was speaking loudly against President George W. Bush, the Iraq War and Navy SEAL tactics. Kyle, also a former Navy SEAL, claimed Ventura said the SEALS ‘deserve to lose a few.’ Kyle wrote that he punched Ventura, knocking him to the ground. Ventura denies making those statements, and says Kyle never laid a hand on him. Kyle had maintained the events in the book are true, and the essence of what was said is accurate, court documents say. Both sides have witnesses to back up . their version of events; and attorneys have cast doubt on the opposing . witnesses' credibility. While Kyle's book says ‘rumor has it’ Ventura . had a black eye the next day, photos of Ventura from that time don't . show him with any visible injury, according to court documents. In . March, U.S. District Judge Richard Kyle — no relation to Chris or Taya . Kyle — said the case could go forward because Ventura had offered . sufficient evidence that could lead a jury to conclude Kyle's statements . were false. But because . Ventura is a public figure, the judge wrote, Ventura must show ‘actual . malice’ or prove by clear and convincing evidence that Kyle knew the . statements were false or acted in reckless disregard of the truth. Levine . said Ventura has a high bar to clear, and to win damages, he must also . prove his reputation was harmed in a quantifiable way. In . a November deposition, Ventura said his job offers dried up after the . book was published, and he was worried about being seen as a traitor to . the military. He also said publicity Kyle got from interviews about the . alleged incident with Ventura helped Kyle's book sales and led to the . film option. The defense . argues in court documents that the public embraced Kyle's book for . reasons ‘completely unrelated to any passing reference to Ventura,’ and . that the book has been more successful than any Ventura has written.","A Minnesota judge said this week that Ventura's suit against American Sniper author Chris Kyle may go forward .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Grand Canyon, one of the seven wonders of the natural world, is facing the most serious threats to its existence since it became a US park 95 years ago as nascent developments jostle over its dwindling water supplies. The menace is two-fold, say National Park Service officials, and both would alter the park's vistas and jeopardize its fragile ecology and water supply. The most immediate comes from the east on the floor of the canyon, where few visitors ever venture. The Navajo Indian tribe wants to change that by making the area more accessible to tourists. The group has proposed a Grand Canyon Escalade gondola to ferry people from planned hotels and restaurants on its reservation abutting the park along the Little Colorado River to the point where it intersects with the Colorado River. Visitors paddle whitewater rafts and kayaks along the Colorado River surrounded by the steep walls of the Grand Canyon in 2013. Several planned developments threaten to alter the canyon's natural vistas and jeopardize its water supply . The Colorado River, seen here winding through the canyon from Navajo Point, is said to be at risk from the planned developments. A proposed gondola ride would ferry tourists from the Navajo Reservation to the east to this area to give tourists rare access to the canyon floor . This is the view from the South Rim of the park, the point where most of the 5 million annual visitors enjoy the magnificent view and snap photos for their scrapbooks . This image released by Stilo Development Group USA shows a proposed Native American cultural center in Tusayan, a tiny Arizona town on the road to the Grand Canyon's South Rim . The Native Americans contend that they have rights to the property above the high-water mark of both rivers, The Los Angeles Times reports. The National Park Service says that the proposal would disrupt the natural beauty of the canyon and creep in on its boundaries. The other threat comes from the south, where a tiny two-block town recently approved a major housing and commercial development that would put significant pressure on the ecology and water supply of the arid South Rim plateau. Tusayan, population 555, wants to build 2,200 houses and 3 million square feet of commercial space. They are serious threats to the future of the park,' park Superintendent. Dave Uberuaga told The Times. 'When you have that size and scope of potential development that close to the park, it will impact our visitor experience.' A bus ferries tourists to Grand Canyon National Park from Tusayan, a small community that serves as the main gateway to the park . Tourists board the train in Williams to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. More than five million people visit the park every year . The Grand Canyon, carved out over the eons by rushing river water, began to form 17 million years ago, making it nearly three times older than previously thought, scientists said in 2008. The canyon is 277 miles long, 18 miles wide and represents two billion years of the Earth's geological history. Garcia Lopez de Cardenas of Spain was the first European known to have visited the canyon in 1540, and it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. More than five million tourists visit the Grand Canyon every year, making it one of the most popular destinations in the US. Most of them go only so far as the South Rim to take in - and digitally chronicle - the seemingly endless expanse of receding canyons and rock walls that descend down to the Colorado River a mile below. Only the most tenacious and experienced of hikers ever take the long, meandering path to the canyon floor. Park managers have struggled to preserve the South Rim natural vista for years, but the developments are testing their limits in their push to give tourists easier access to the rivers and make a bundle of cash in the process. The Native American tribes around the park have already in recent years been pursuing developments to cash in on more of the canyon's tourism dollars. Grand Canyon West, on land owned by the Hualapai tribe, runs the Skyway attraction, a glass walkway that juts out past the cliff walls. Since 2007, it has also given helicopter tours that land on tribal property next to the river. Tourists walk along the Skywalk overlooking the Grand Canyon on the Hualapai Indian Reservation near Peach Springs in 2011 . This artist rendering depicts the Navajo's proposed aerial tramway that would ferry tourists from the cliff tops of the east rim of the Grand Canyon to the water's edge of the Colorado and Little Colorado Rivers below . The Navajo's planned gondola would give more visitors that rare opportunity to see the canyon floor, developer R. Lamar Whitmer, who is working with the tribe, told The Times. The park service offers nothing more than 'a drive-by wilderness experience', Whitmer said. 'The average person can't ride a mule to the bottom of the canyon. We want them to feel the canyon from the bottom.' But park officials say the Navajo's claims to the land by the river are mistaken. They say the federal government owns all the land a quarter-mile on either side of the Colorado, and development isn't allowed within that area. The Navajo still must officially approve the plan, and some within the tribe oppose it for spiritual reasons. They believe the two rivers represent male and female, and life begins at their confluence. The bigger threat is the development planned two miles from the canyon's front entrance because of how it would diminish the small amount of water found naturally on the plateau. Tourists enjoy sunset at Hopi Point on the South Rim. If development plans go through, they may soon also have a view of a hive of construction workers building restaurants, hotels and shops . The town of Tusayan has approved a plan that would increase its demand for water fourfold, The Times reported, without detailing where it would all come from. Arizona is currently suffering its worst drought in at least 110 years, leaving not enough water to support both wildlife and a new development. 'That kind of water just isn't around there,' Uberuaga said. Yet the city continues 'to pursue a full buildout and full development at whatever pace the developer wants.' Tusayan developer Tom De Paolo and partners in Stilo Development Group, backed by Italian investors, have been trying to build at the Grand Canyon since 1991, when they began systematically acquiring private land within nearby Kaibab National Forest, according to The Times. The town has the right to extract water from the plateau's aquifer, and its wells have drained water resources by 10 per cent in recent years. The park service is urging Tusayan to downsize its plans. As they stand, the developments represent 'profound and enormous threats to the park', said Dave Nimkin of the National Parks Conservation Association. 'It's a grim forecast.' The sun rises over North Point and is reflected in the Colorado River in Grand Canyon National Park in September 2013 .","The National Park Service says two planned developments would alter the national park's vistas and jeopardize its fragile ecology and water supply in the middle of the worst drought on record .

Someone had fired a shot in the air in High Ridge as Jan Brewer was enjoying the fireworks display. Suddenly, she was struck in the face by what felt like 'a baseball bat type thing,' she said. Stray bullet: Jan Brewer was injured when a bullet hit her in the face and lodged in her cheek . Irresponsible: It narrowly missed her eye and Brewer and her husband think it must have been shot by a reveler from far away, because no one close-by was shooting . Brewer told KMOV that she thought she must have been struck by fireworks. It wasn't until she went to a local hospital for X-rays that she found out she had a bullet lodged in her cheek. Brewer and her husband believe someone far away must have fired off a celebratory shot. No one in their area was shooting a gun, they say, and Jefferson County sheriff's deputies have not yet identified the shooter. Surprise: Brewer thought she was injured by a firework until an x-ray revealed the bullet . 'I have nothing against people owning guns. That’s their right,' Brewer told KMOV. 'It’s the responsibility they should take when they own a gun. That’s my biggest concern. Once you own a gun, you should take responsibility to do the right thing.' Brewer's injuries could have been far worse. 'One inch up and it would have taken my eye out. One inch lower it would have hit my throat. But it hit the bone and lodged in the side of my face,' she said.

"By . Corey Charlton . They have a reputation for avoiding humans and being easily frightened. But this rare loggerhead turtle had no problem coming out of its shell for a selfie - or a shellfie - in these amazing pictures with diver Cristian Dimitrus. The pair recreated the famous style of photograph - made popular by celebs like Kim Kardashian - under the waves in the Bahamas. Photographer Cristian Dimitrus got up close and personal for an intimate selfie with the turtle in the Bahamas . The photos were taken during a snorkel at a site called the Lost Blue Hole, near Nassau, the Bahamas . Mr Dimitrus said he had photographed turtles before but they were usually skittish and didn't approach him . The wildlife cinematographer, 39, travels the globe searching for great wildlife moments but said he's never experienced anything like this before. 'I took the turtle pictures in the Bahamas, in a dive site called the lost blue hole, near Nassau. 'The Bahamas is known as one of the world's best dive destination and I was there for vacations, not working. But I always take my camera with me. 'It's is a loggerhead turtle and it is a great rule of thumb to keep your distance from marine creatures and not touch them . 'But when you work underwater and visit sites regularly you get to know the inhabitants of the area, in other words you get to know the hood and you get to meet the gang. Loggerhead sea turtles can grow up to a metre in length and weigh a whopping 135kg when fully grown . The photos taken by Mr Dimitrus are remarkably intimate, and show the endangered reptile in a natural state . 'This was my first selfie with a turtle and no other turtle has ever allowed such of thing. 'It's not hard to see a sea turtle but they are usually skittish and do not approach divers. 'But this one was different and when it saw me it came straight towards me which is really weird. 'She was all over me, following me, gently biting my fins, and looking me straight in the eyes.' Although normally shy, this particular turtle seemed more than happy to pose for a few selfies . 'I have never seen something like that, a totally different behaviour and I count more than 4,000 dives all over the world. it was an amazing encounter, really unique and after taking some pictures of the turtle, I just had to turn the camera around and start making selfies to remember this rare encounter. 'Imagine how wonderful it would be if all the animal did not fear humans and how nice it would be to interact with wild animals like that with love and respect in a daily basis. 'After that encounter I felt that this could be possible and we just need to spend more time with nature, loving it, admiring it, enjoying it and not destroying it.'","Photographer takes amazing 'seflie' pictures with a rare loggerhead turtle .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Kate McCann told a court today that her young son asked her about allegations by a former Portuguese police chief that she killed her daughter Madeleine. Mrs McCann was delivering a personal statement at Lisbon's Palace of Justice in the libel case brought by her and husband Gerry against Goncalo Amaral, a former police chief. He made the claims in a book about their role in the disappearance of their daughter from the family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve in 2007. More pain: Kate and Gerry McCann arrive in Lisbon, Portugal, to give statements to the libel trial of former detective Goncalo Amaral whose book suggested they hid their daughter's body after she died in an accident . She told the court her son Sean heard about Amaral's allegations on the radio while travelling on the school bus. 'Sean asked me in October, ""Mr Amaral said you killed Madeleine"". I just said that he said a lot of silly things,' she said. Sean and his twin sister Amelie were aged two when Madeleine, who was nearly four, went missing. The . McCanns arrived back in Portugal this morning for the latest hearing in . their ongoing libel trial against a former police chief. The . couple hoped they would be able to deliver personal statements to the . trial after they were thwarted last month when the case was adjourned. Mr . and Mrs McCann previously criticised Amaral for what they claimed was a . 'blatant and cynical' attempt to hold up the trial after he removed . powers from his lawyer on the morning they were due to make statements . about the effect allegations in his book had had on them. Goncarlo Amaral, right, and his lawyer smoke cigarettes before appearing in court in Lisbon today . The couple had travelled to Lisbon on . what was due to be the last day of the long-running trial over Mr . Amaral's book The Truth Of The Lie, but the case was adjourned in the . wake of the former detective's application. After . that earlier hearing they spoke of their anger, accusing him of trying . to wear them down and delaying justice for their missing daughter. Madeleine . disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the . Algarve on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with . friends. The McCanns are suing for libel over . claims made in Mr Amaral's 2008 book, including suggestions that they . hid Madeleine's body after she died in an accident and faked an . abduction. They say the allegations damaged the hunt for their daughter and exacerbated their anguish. If . successful, the family stand to gain around £1million in damages. A . judgment is not expected in the trial until later this year. News cameras and reporters crowd around Mr Amaral as he arrives at Lisbon's Palace of Justice this morning . The couple's latest visit to Portugal . comes after Scotland Yard detectives last week returned to the country . to help interview suspects in the case. Officers . from the force's Operation Grange joined their Portuguese counterparts . in Faro last week as they interviewed people of interest in relation to . Madeleine's disappearance in 2007.

"Comes after it emerged 114 files had been lost by Home Office officials . By . James Chapman . Failure to report suspected child sex abuse could become a criminal offence, Theresa May revealed yesterday. The Home Secretary’s announcement came as, bowing to growing pressure, she agreed to a sweeping inquiry into allegations of paedophilia in Establishment circles. The Hillsborough-style investigation will look into the activities of churches, hospitals, schools, political parties and the BBC. Scroll down for video . Home Secretary Theresa May has revealed failure to report suspected child sex abuse could become a criminal offence . The Home Secretary's announcement came as, bowing to growing pressure, she agreed to a sweeping inquiry into allegations of paedophilia in Establishment circles . Mrs May also announced that a separate inquiry, led by NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless, will review an investigation conducted last year into the Home Office’s handling of historical child abuse allegations. It has been prompted by claims of a cover-up after it emerged that 114 files had been lost by Home Office officials. The Home Secretary suggested that the main inquiry could examine the work of party whips who are said to hold ‘little black books’ containing damaging information against colleagues they want to control. An expert panel will be able to call witnesses from the private sector as well as the Civil Service – and pore over secret files kept on prominent figures by the security services and whips. More than 150 MPs had backed calls for a wide-ranging inquiry following appalling allegations against Cyril Smith and the unmasking of Jimmy Savile as a prolific sex offender. Campaigning Labour MP Simon Danczuk said: ‘I’m in no doubt that there are Parliamentarians, just a handful, who will be worried about where these inquiries are going – no doubt about that.’ Announcing a probe to be headed by a . senior figure yet to be appointed – probably a retired judge – Mrs May . said: ‘Where there has been a failure to protect children from abuse, we . will expose it and we will learn from it.’ More than 150 MPs had backed calls for a wide-ranging inquiry following appalling allegations against Cyril Smith (pictured) and the unmasking of Jimmy Savile as a prolific sex offender . Campaigning Labour MP Simon Danczuk said: 'I'm in no doubt that there are Parliamentarians, just a handful, who will be worried about where these inquiries are going - no doubt about that' Mrs . May told former Tory Cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan the inquiry will . examine the case for introducing a ‘mandatory reporting’ law in the UK. It would apply in schools, hospitals, churches, or sports clubs operated . by a national body. Similar . laws exist in Northern Ireland, Australia, the US and Denmark. They . impose a legal duty on professionals such as teachers, social workers, . police and doctors to report suspicions of abuse or face legal action. Mrs May’s announcement follows months of resistance from ministers and stops just short of the full judicial inquiry, with sessions held in public, that some campaigners demanded. Like the investigation into the Hillsborough football disaster, it will be a non-statutory inquiry but it will have the power to call witnesses. The Home Secretary said it would be converted into a full public inquiry if its chairman felt at any point it was necessary, and will not report before the next general election. She told MPs the inquiry would be able to access all government and local authority paperwork it wants to – and suggested its head would be cleared to review security service files which might contain incriminating evidence against powerful individuals. Labour MP Lisa Nandy raised remarks by the late Tory MP Tim Fortescue, a whip in Edward Heath’s Government between 1970 and 1973. He said in a 1995 documentary that MPs in trouble would ask for help, adding: ‘It might be debt, it might be… a scandal involving small boys… If we could get a chap out of trouble then, he will do as we ask forever more.’ The review led by Mr Wanless centres on concerns the Home Office failed to act on allegations of child sex abuse contained in a dossier handed over in the 1980s by former Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens. Then Home Secretary Leon – now Lord – Brittan says he passed them to the Home Office but last week said they had been mislaid. David Cameron said: ‘We are going to leave no stone unturned to find out the truth. Three things need to happen: robust inquiries that get to truth; police investigations that pursue the guilty and find out what has happened; and proper lessons learned so we make sure these things cannot happen again.’ Mr Danczuk said: ‘I am pleased the Government has shifted its position significantly in the last few days. ‘I hope that the inquiry will have powers to hold the intelligence services and special branch to account where investigations into powerful child abusers have been discontinued or blocked. I also hope it will give an amnesty for retired and serving officers to give evidence on what they know about Establishment paedophiles without fear of losing their pension or other repercussions.’ Former Labour minister Tom Watson backed the proposed change in the law, saying: ‘Mandatory reporting is a policy that has to be taken seriously now. This is particularly critical when children are under the care of those institutional settings like schools, nurseries and children’s homes.’ Conservative MP Dr Phillip Lee said sex abuse victims who might give evidence tneeded to be protected from blackmail. ‘I gather that there are general concerns around the potential use of photographs and films from the 1970s and ’80s which have now been digitised in order to discourage victims from coming forward,’ he said. The inquiry into historical child sex abuse is expected to last at least two years and cost millions of pounds. The Hillsborough-style panel of independent experts will initially be tasked with trawling over mountains of evidence of how children were not properly protected from sexual predators. Its powers will be similar to those granted to the two-year Hillsborough Inquiry. That panel, headed by the Bishop of Liverpool the Rt Rev James Jones, analysed more than 400,000 documents before producing in 2012 a stinging report on police attempts to cover up their failings during the tragedy. The Hillsborough panel, headed by the Bishop of Liverpool the Rt Rev James Jones (pictured), analysed more than 400,000 documents before producing in 2012 a stinging report on police attempts to cover up their failings during the tragedy . For the child abuse probe, full access will be granted to all government papers, including letters to and from ministers, minutes of meetings and any intelligence compiled by MI5, MI6 and GCHQ on paedophile MPs and diplomats. Scores of witnesses are expected to be called to give evidence in public – though, unlike at the Leveson Inquiry into phone hacking, they will not swear an oath. If the panel’s powers prove inadequate or witnesses refuse to attend, it will be upgraded to a full statutory public inquiry that can force compliance. A public inquiry, involving armies of lawyers, could cost tens of millions. Leveson cost taxpayers almost £5.5million. The independent panel will not be ready to begin work for weeks or report back before the General Election in May 2015 but will give an update to Parliament before then. For days, senior ministers had been resisting demands from more than 130 MPs for a wide-ranging inquiry into child sex abuse, insisting it would interfere with ongoing police inquiries. But, following days of political pressure, Mrs May performed a sharp U-turn in the Commons. In a sign of how hurriedly the Government had changed its position, Mrs May was unable to set out any terms of reference for the inquiry – though officials insist this will take place within days. She was also unable to say who would take charge, other than to say it would be an ‘experienced and senior figure’. But Mrs May said the panel would be given huge scope to go wherever the evidence took them, no matter how far in the past. Officials said its inquiries could extend to the Church of England and Roman Catholic Church – both of which have been dogged by sex scandals dating back to the 1960s and have been repeatedly accused of cover-up. Other bodies which will be asked to hand over paperwork and give evidence include political parties, Whitehall departments, schools, hospitals, councils, social services departments, the private sector and the BBC. MPs repeatedly pressed Mrs May over whether the panel will have access to material gathered by the intelligence services, which allegedly kept files on suspected Westminster paedophiles, including Cyril Smith. The Home Secretary said, where possible, all government papers would be released, including those written by spies. She said that, where national security was an issue, special arrangements may have to be made.

"By . John Stevens, Political Reporter . Nigel Farage will announce within weeks which constituency he will stand in at the next election. The Ukip leader says he has not yet chosen which parliamentary seat he will target in his attempt to become the first person in his party elected to the Commons, but that it would ‘more than likely’ be in Kent. It had been widely expected that Mr Farage would stand in Thanet South, but his plans were dealt a blow at the weekend when the Tories selected a former Ukip leader to stand there. Plans: Nigel Farage (pictured in the European Parliament) will be standing for a Westminster seat next year . Last night he told radio station LBC that he still might stand against Craig Mackinlay, one of the founding members of Ukip, who has defected to the Conservatives. ‘I’m not interested in who stands for the Conservative Party or the Labour Party. Thanet South is a three-way marginal,’ he insisted. ‘The last raw data we had from opinion polls put the parties within 2 per cent of each other. Ukip will fight Thanet South to win. 'Just give me another couple of weeks... The European Parliament goes into recess on July 24, I will announce within a couple of weeks of that where I will stand.’ Asked if he had picked the . seat where he will stand as a candidate, he added: ‘No. Thanet South is . up there in my top two or three. ‘I’m going to stand somewhere in the South East, more than likely in Kent.’ It is understood that as well as South . Thanet, Mr Farage is considering other options including Folkestone, . Dover and North Thanet. Mr Farage told LBC radio: 'I'm going to stand somewhere in the South East, more than likely in Kent' Ukip is due to unveil its party manifesto at its conference in Doncaster in September. Mr Farage last night suggested that it could include a pledge to axe inheritance tax. ‘Compared to the cost of collection it raises a pitiful amount of revenue,’ he said. ‘The people that have died have paid tax on this stuff already, why should the next generation not benefit?’ Mr Mackinlay, 47, was one of the founders of the Anti-Federalist League, a forerunner to Ukip set up in 1991. He was leader of the party briefly in 1997 before serving as deputy leader until 2000. He defected to the Conservatives in 2005, declaring that he wanted to be part of a party that would form a future government ‘rather than messing around on the fringes’.","Nigel Farage said he will declare where he will be standing within weeks .

"By . Jack Doyle . A massive public sector walkout expected to cause chaos on Thursday is ‘entirely legitimate’, a senior Labour figure said last night. Shadow Welsh Secretary Owen Smith said that pay had been frozen for too long and he ‘completely’ understood why the hundreds of thousands of workers were planning to strike. Mr Smith, who was drafted into the Shadow Cabinet by leader Ed Miliband two years ago, went further than any other Labour frontbencher in giving the strikes full-throated backing – and indicated he wanted more money spent on public sector wages. Shadow Welsh Secretary Owen Smith said that pay had been frozen for too long and he 'completely' understood why the hundreds of thousands of workers were planning to strike . The Tories said it showed that Labour was ‘still the party of strikes and uncontrolled  public sector pay’. The main unions with workers in the state sector plan to mount a co-ordinated walkout on Thursday. Thousands of schools are expected to close as a result of the strike by a single teaching union, the NUT – causing misery for parents. Firefighters are also downing tools for nine hours – the 15th such strike by the Fire Brigades Union in recent years. One union leader, Unison’s Dave Prentis, has predicted the planned action could  be bigger than the General Strike of 1926. Senior Labour figures have tried to distance themselves from the walkout, with many saying they support only the general right of workers to go on strike. On Sunday, the party’s education spokesman, Tristram Hunt, refused three times to condemn the NUT strike, and also declined to support teachers crossing picket lines. But yesterday, speaking on the BBC’s Daily Politics, Mr Smith made clear his backing for the unions’ action. Thousands of schools are expected to close as a result of the strike by a single teaching union, the NUT - causing misery for parents. Pictured: Defiant teachers marching last October . He said it was legitimate as public sector wages had been frozen for ‘far too long’ and staff were right to worry about pensions and pay. ‘Would I like to see the public sector given a pay increase?’ he said. ‘Absolutely. Have we seen pay being frozen for far too long from the perspective of those individuals? Yes we have. ‘Are they right to be worrying about pensions, pay and the way in which earnings are being outstripped by inflation? Of course they are. So I completely understand the decision they are taking to strike.’ Mr Smith was then asked by presenter Jo Coburn if he supported ‘the strike, not just the right to strike, on the basis it has been so tough on pay’. He replied: ‘I do. I think it’s a very legitimate thing for them to voice their concern about the nature of their jobs and how long people will have to work and about how much they are earning. ‘They [the strikes] are entirely legitimate.’ Mr Smith is a former BBC journalist who worked as an adviser for Labour in Northern Ireland before he was elected MP for Pontypridd in 2010. Tory MP Chris Skidmore said: ‘These comments make one thing abundantly clear – Labour are still the party of strikes and uncontrolled public sector pay. ‘Ed Miliband must get a grip and condemn these strikes from his union paymasters – strikes which will damage children’s education, hurt the economy and inconvenience millions of ordinary people. ‘If Miliband remains silent there can only be one conclusion: he’s a weak leader who just isn’t up to the job.’ The planned walkout has prompted calls for new laws to constrain strike action. Critics say it should not go ahead when the turnout in some ballots was as low as 25 per cent. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude is drawing up plans for a minimum turnout of 50 per cent before a strike can proceed – but the Lib Dems are blocking any further union laws.","Shadow Welsh Secretary Owen Smith said pay frozen for too long .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Plight: Danny Binks in hospital in Bodrum, Turkey, after he was stabbed with a broken bottle in a brawl with a gang who accused him of stealing a watch . A British tourist has been left badly hurt and stranded in Turkey after he was attacked by locals and stabbed with a broken bottle. Danny Binks, 20, was set upon by a gang of up to 15 men in front of his fiancée after he was accused of stealing a watch from a jewellery shop in Bodrum, a popular tourist town. After he fled down an alley, witnesses say he was attacked by a man who stabbed him four times in the chest. Mr Binks, a joiner from Poulton, Lancashire, . was taken to a local hospital where he underwent emergency surgery for . stab wounds to his chest, a severed liver and cuts to vital arteries. His condition was so serious he was initially treated in intensive care, but he is now recovering on a mainstream ward. Although . Mr Binks’ fiancée, Remi Simpson, 21, had taken out on holiday insurance . they are worried they might still have to pay for his medical treatment . and flights home. Insurers are waiting for a police and hospital report of the incident before deciding whether to pay out. One . man is thought to have been arrested and Turkish police are due to take . a statement from Mr Binks about the attack last Friday. Until officers . speak to the holidaymaker, he is not allowed to leave the country. The . family is now facing the prospect of a medical bill, interpreter costs, . accommodation and new flights. They fear it could spiral to more than . £20,000. So far wellwishers have raised £2,165 towards a £5,000 goal of . getting the holidaymaker home. In a statement, Mr Binks said he believed the man who stabbed him was the owner of the shop who had accused him of stealing the watch. 'It all happened so fast. We had been for a meal and went into a shop to buy some things,' he said. 'We went to another shop and this guy chased us saying I had pinched a watch from his shop, which of course I hadn’t, and said I needed to go back to the shop to be searched. 'It was really intimidating. All of a sudden there was 15 of them there - I had no chance. Before I knew it they were battering me. I had wounds all over me. 'We managed to get away but then the shopkeeper appeared and stabbed me. 'I don’t remember much after that apart from sitting on a chair pressing my T-shirt into my side where all the blood was.' He added: 'Depending on what the police say I may have to go to court to give evidence due to the seriousness of the offence. Until then I can’t go home. I’m in a lot of pain. All I want to do now is go home. It’s a nightmare.' Badly hurt: Mr Binks, a joiner from Poulton, Lancashire, was taken to a local hospital where he underwent emergency surgery for stab wounds to his chest, a severed liver and cuts to vital arteries . Mr Binks with his fiancée Remi Simpson: He wrote on Facebook that the stress of the experience and his brush with death had finally given him the courage to propose to Miss Simpson, who witnessed the attack . Miss Simpson, a project manager at a . construction firm, said: 'When Danny went back to the shop the . shopkeeper tried to lock him inside. 'There were 15 or 20 of them there with metal poles and other weapons. He didn’t stand a chance. 'It . was awful, I just couldn’t do anything.

Phil Neville's future with Manchester United remains unresolved but it appears increasingly likely that he will have to accept a markedly reduced role at Old Trafford next season. Sportsmail understands that Neville will hold high level talks with executive vice-chairman Edward Woodward within the next week as the two parties attempt to find a compromise solution following the appointment of Louis van Gaal. Neville, a graduate of the Class of '92, was brought to Old Trafford by the recently-deposed David Moyes last summer in the role of first-team coach and was then retained when Ryan Giggs assumed managerial responsibilities for the final four games of the season. VIDEO Scroll down for Giggs, Scholes, Neville and Butt talking tactics at United . Right-Hand Man: David Moyes' former assistant Phil Neville is likely to have a reduced role this season . Experience: He has more recently been at the World Cup as part of the BBC's coverage . However, new manager Louis van Gaal has brought in his own men to work alongside himself and Giggs, who will work as assistant manager. Marcel Bout was appointed as an assistant coach at the beginning of the summer and further doubt was cast over Neville's role after fellow Dutchman Albert Stuivenberg was appointed on Sunday afternoon to work under Van Gaal with the first team. The United players who did not feature at the World Cup - including cast-offs such as Bebe and Anderson - returned for medical tests late last week before beginning ball-playing sessions under Ryan Giggs on Monday.

Experience: But the Man Utd board want to keep as many of the Class of '92 as possible at Old Trafford . Certainly, one would expect that a senior coach to be present on the first day back for pre-season but a senior United source was unable to confirm on Monday evening whether Neville had been present at the club's Carrington training ground as the players regrouped following their summer break. United are understood to be keen to retain Neville's services in some capacity, maintaining that 'the Class of '92 are very important to the club' but with Van Gaal's backroom staff becoming increasingly bloated, the former United player is going to have to settle for a role carrying considerably less responsibility than last season.","Neville's future at the club remains unresolved with pre-season underway .

"By . John Stevens, Political Reporter . 'Irrational political demands': The guidelines are reminiscent of the comedy Yes Minister . Civil servants are being encouraged to resist the demands of ministers, a leaked document has revealed. They have been accused of undermining democracy, after the official document setting out the job description of permanent secretaries was discovered. Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, is said to be angry at suggestions that civil servants could pick and choose when they backed ministers. Their priority must be serving the government of the day, he said. The 2009 document, which was still in use in recent weeks, lists the qualities needed for the leading civil servants, who are the UK’s most powerful government officials. It said a permanent secretary must ‘balance ministers’ or high-level stakeholders’ immediate needs or priorities with the long-term aims of their department, being shrewd about what needs to be sacrificed, at what costs and what the implications might be’. But in a letter to cabinet colleagues, Mr Maude said: ‘As currently framed [the document] plainly does not conform with constitutional propriety. ‘The civil service aims not to serve the ""long-term aims of the department"" but the priorities of the government of the day.’ The . document, which was circulated by Mr Maude last week, has intensified a . row with civil servants over whether ministers should have more of a . say in the appointment of permanent secretaries. Mr Maude intends to update the guidelines, which could lead to further tensions. According to their code of conduct, civil servants should ‘serve the government, whatever its political persuasion … in a way which maintains political impartiality’. But the . guidelines, which conjure an image of Sir Humphrey Appleby, the . fictional permanent secretary in the sitcom Yes Minister, said top civil . servants ‘tolerate high levels of ambiguity and uncertainty and rapid . change — and at times irrational political demands’. Anger: Former Tory minister Nick Herbert (pictured) said the rules were 'actually beyond a joke' It . added they ‘act as a “pivot point” in terms of knowing when to “serve” the political agenda and manage ministers’ expectations, versus leading . the department with a strong sense of mission’. Former Tory minister Nick Herbert told Newsnight: ‘This is actually beyond a joke. Francis Maude (pictured) has written a stern letter to Cabinet colleagues . 'We can’t have a kind of permanent . government of an unelected bureaucracy deciding that it has its own . long-term priorities which may be different to those of ministers and . elected government. ‘And I think this does go to some of the problems that we’re seeing of a civil service which is sometimes resistance to change.’ But former head of the civil service, Lord Butler, said the document was an accurate summary of the relationship between civil servants and politicians. ‘Ministers have a political agenda which civil servants can’t get into,’ he said. ‘Although you’re working very closely together, you’ve got to keep a bit of difference between yourselves.' He added: ‘There is nothing there that I wouldn’t have put down in black and white... some of it could have been a bit more straightforwardly expressed but... I think it does reflect the borders that permanent secretaries can’t cross.’ A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘The constitutional position is clear that the civil service exists to serve the government of the day, while retaining the potential to serve a future government. ‘A document laying out the criteria for permanent secretary candidates from 2009, which predates both this government and the leadership of the civil service, did not reflect that position and is therefore being refreshed. ‘Permanent Secretary appointments are made on merit following fair and open competition.’","Guidelines were produced in 2009 and were still being used in recent weeks .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . Controversial ‘green’ plans to lower motorway speed limits to 60mph in a bid to cut pollution levels from cars are to be scrapped by ministers. The reversal comes after the Government’s Highways Agency announced in January that the existing national speed limit of 70mph would be curtailed on certain sections of motorways policed with a new generation of speed camera. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will today announce he is ‘rejecting’ this approach stating: ‘I want all motorways to run at 70mph.’ Plans announced in January to reduce speed limits to 60mph have been abandoned . A lower variable speed limit ‘must only apply when absolutely necessary’, he says adding: ‘Blanket reductions are not acceptable.’ Motorways must instead maintain the 70mph limit wherever possible ‘particularly when traffic tends to be lighter, such as at weekends and outside of peak commuting hours,’ he said. Motoring groups hailed the decision as ‘a victory for common sense.’ The controversial go-slow 60mph limits announced in January  by the Highways Agency  would have meant  speed limit slashed from 70mph on a three-mile section of the M3 between junction 3 at Lightwater in Surrey and junction 4 near Farnborough in Hampshire. The lower 60mph were supposed to operate between 7am and 7pm daily to meet air quality levels imposed by Brussels. Controversial 60mph speed limits were also planned for a 32-mile stretch of the M1 from junction 28, near Matlock in Derbyshire, to junction 35a, north of Rotherham in South Yorkshire – again on  air quality grounds. It too was supposed to apply for 12 hours a day - from 7am to 7pm -  seven days a week and be enforced by speed-cameras and police patrols. That stretch of motorway goes past Mansfield, Chesterfield and Sheffield – and also through nine so-called Air Quality Management Areas (AQMA) described as ‘pockets of poor air.’ But today ministers will announce that 70mph must remain the norm except in exceptional circumstances. A Transport Department spokesman said: ‘The Highways Agency previously consulted on proposals to limit speeds to 60mph between 7am and 7pm seven days a week because of the potential effect of the new schemes on local air quality. ‘However, the Transport Secretary has rejected this approach as the Government’ s preferred option for managing the problem. ‘He has instead asked the Highways Agency to rigorously investigate alternatives as work progresses on the schemes in the next 12 to 18 months. ‘If any proposals continue to include varying speed limits, they must only apply when absolutely necessary. In particular, the Agency must look for alternatives that maintain the 70mph limit wherever possible, particularly when traffic tends to be lighter, such as at weekends and outside of peak commuting hours.’ Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin, the Secretary of State for Transport, has rejected calls to lower motorway speed limits to 60mph . Mr McLoughlin said: ‘Let me be absolutely clear, I want all motorways to run at 70mph. While it sometimes makes sense to use variable limits to keep people moving, blanket reductions are not acceptable.’ This way the three new ‘smart’ motorway schemes on the M1 and M3 will ‘cut congestion and give Britain’s drivers smoother, quicker journeys’, he said giving the green light for construction will now start on the M1 junctions 28-31 in Derbyshire, M1 junctions 32-35a in South Yorkshire and on the M3 at junction 2-4a in Surrey. He said the new schemes are part of £24billion of investment in the road network by 2021 which will see spending tripled to £3billion each year on England’s key highways and motorways. AA president Edmund King said; ‘This is a victory for common sense. We campaigned vigorously against the 60mph limit on motorways. Why go to all the trouble of widening the motorway and adding extra lanes if you are going to cut the speed limit and slow the traffic.’ A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Smart motorways convert the hard shoulder to a running lane to boost capacity and smooth traffic, operating either permanently or during busy periods. ‘Overhead variable message signs inform motorists of changes in speed limits, queuing and lane closures, while staff in regional control centres use CCTV to monitor incidents and keep motorists safe.’ The schemes will boost capacity by a third and improve journey times by up to 10 per cent on the key stretches of the  M1 and 15 per cent on the M3, where average speeds are currently 45mph during rush-hour. The DfT spokesman stressed: ‘The national speed limit on these sections will remain at 70 mph.‘He added: ‘Drivers should see an improvement in their journeys when the M1 schemes commence operation from autumn 2015, and when the M3 scheme opens to traffic in 2016.’ Mr McLoughln said: ‘Smart motorways are an effective and cost efficient way of increasing space on our roads, cutting jams and speeding up journey times and I am pleased to announce the start of work on these schemes.’","Plans to reduce speed limits between 7am and 7pm for Brussels dropped .

Mr Coulson is expected to attend a preliminary hearing on August 6, the Crown Office - Scotland's prosecution authority - confirmed tonight. The 46-year-old father of three is accused of committing perjury while giving evidence at Mr Sheridan’s own perjury trial. Mr Sheridan was found guilty of perjury in 2010, and jailed for three years. Coulson appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court in June 2013, where he did not make a plea or declaration. He was later granted bail by Sheriff John McCormick. Mr Coulson was the editor of the News of the World from 2003 to 2007 after taking over from Rebekah Brooks, who was acquitted of all the charges against her. He went on to become the Conservative Party’s director of communications and moved into Downing Street when Mr Cameron became Prime Minister.

"By . Leon Watson . A tree trimmer died in a freak accident when a stray branch hit him on the head and led to him suffocating 60ft off the ground. Father-to-be Tim June, 21, from Roswell, Georgia, died of asphyxiation caused by 'head and neck compression' on Saturday while working on a pine tree in Fairburn. Sergeant Anthony Bazydlo, a spokesman for the Fairburn Police Department, revealed that when officers turned up they were left confused at first by the cause of death. Father-to-be Tim June, of Roswell, Georgia, died after suffering 'head and neck compression' when he was struck by a tree branch. He is pictured (left) with his pregnant girlfriend Sarah Docekal . Police initially thought the force of the branch hitting Mr June had killed him. But pathologists later ruled he died of asphyxiation, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Following an emergency call, firefighters from the Fairburn Fire Department were dispatched to the scene and managed to remove Mr June's body from the tree and take him to a waiting ambulance. 'It took some doing to bring him down,' said Sgt Bazydlo. 'This is the definition of a tragic accident.' Mr June, who had worked as a tree trimmer for three years, was the owner of Atlanta Tree Assurance, founded last year. One of trees Mr June has trimmed, pictured on his company's Facebook page . His 21-year-old girlfriend, Sarah Docekal, who is nine months pregnant, said he was an accomplished arborist. 'We were going to give it [the child] up for adoption,' she told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'Now, I may change my mind.' Mother Susan Coker, of Marietta said by the time he was 14, he was cutting grass and cleaning gutters for cash. Then he discovered tree cutting. 'He finally decided he could make more money as the boss instead of working for the boss,' his mother said.","Father-to-be Tim June, from Roswell, Georgia, died of asphyxiation .

"By . Corey Charlton . Fraudster Mirriam Clark pictured before her sentencing outside Southwark Crown Court today . A crooked book-keeper at a leading real estate firm who plundered £2m from her bosses to launch her own property empire in Zambia has been jailed for four years. Mirriam Clark, 47, blew the cash on first class flights to Africa and private school education for her children. She bought properties in her native Zambia and used stolen funds to maintain five homes she owned across England and Wales, Southwark Crown Court heard today. Clark was working for Dowley Turner Real Estate (DTRE) from their luxury offices on London’s Bond Street at the time of the thefts. Prosecutor Charles Pentangeli said only £295,000 has been recovered by Clark’s former bosses so far. ‘This fraud was carried out over a three-and-a-half year period while the defendant was the book keeper for the property and real estate consultancy firm Dowley Turner Real Estate, based in London. ‘The partners at the business had both known the defendant for 15 years, she having previously worked for the previous incarnation of the firm between 1995 and 2006. ‘Not only did she work as a bookkeeper and a personal assistant to Mr Dowley and Mr Turner but she was their friend. ‘She played a key role with the business’s bank account and tax affairs’. Clark siphon £1,977,327 from the company over a three-and-a-half-year period, the court heard. She confessed to the thefts, which began in late 2009, just days after she was sacked for work related reasons in March last year. Clark said she stole the cash to pay off credit card debt and claimed she had been struggling financially since her divorce. But it emerged she had spent £50,000 of . her employers’ money on 14 return flights to Zambia and paid a £25,000 . gift to an ex-employee of the firm. Even after all Clark’s properties are sold, Dowley Turner may be short of £700,000 as a result of her fraud. Clark, left, admitted to the theft of £2 million from her employers Dowley Turner Real Estate, pictured right. However, so far the company has only recovered £295,000 and is facing an expected shortfall of £700,000 . Jailing Clark for four years, Judge Alistair McCreath said: ‘While this fraud was going on you were buying other properties in Zambia from the proceeds of your crime. ‘You were taking flights which the partners paid for personally - 14 of them - the maths suggest you weren’t going economy. ‘These thefts were over a substantial period of time, in excess of three years, and you were in a position of trust. ‘You have caused your former employers, your former friends, a significant loss indeed’. Clark was sentenced to four years in jail at the Southwark Crown Court today for her large scale fraud . Clark, of Cavalier House, Uxbridge Road, Ealing, West London, admitted fraud by abuse of position. Detective Constable Malcolm Duncan, of Westminster Major Crime Unit, said: ‘Mirriam Clark was put in a position of trust by colleagues who she had worked with for a number of years. ‘However, she chose to abuse that trust and defrauded her employers out of a significant amount of money with no consideration of those that had employed and trusted her. ‘It is commendable how they have managed to not only stay afloat but also managed to safeguard their employees’ livelihoods during what has been a difficult and upsetting time.’ One of the directors of DTRE, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘From the outset this has been an extremely harrowing experience, which has not come close to ending for us, as individuals or a company. ‘Mirriam Clark has not disclosed to us, the court, or the police where she has put the money. This has been, and continues to be, the most arduous and stressful time of me and my business partners’ lives.’","Mirriam Clark jailed for four years for plundering £2 million from employees .

"By . Associated Press . and Ted Thornhill . Eduard Shevardnadze, a groundbreaking Soviet foreign minister and later the president of an independent Georgia, died Monday at the age of 86, his spokeswoman said. Marina Davitashvili said Shevardnadze died after a long illness. She did not say where he died. Shevardnadze swept heroically across the international stage in the final years of the Soviet empire, helping topple the Berlin Wall and end the Cold War, but as the leader of post-Soviet Georgia his career in the public eye ended in humiliation and he was chased out of his parliament and forced into retirement. Influential: Shevardnadze, pictured during an interview at his home in Tbilisi, Georgia, in 2010, swept across the international stage in the final years of the Soviet empire, helping topple the Berlin Wall and end the Cold War . As Soviet foreign minister, the white-haired man with a gravelly voice was the diplomatic face of Mikhail Gorbachev's liberalizing policies of glasnost and perestroika. Following the wooden Andrei Gromyko, Shevardnadze impressed Western leaders with his charisma, his quick wit and his commitment to Gorbachev's reform course. Shevardnadze helped push through the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in 1989, signed landmark arms control agreements, and helped negotiate German reunification in 1990 — a development that Soviet leaders had long feared and staunchly opposed. Western leaders, especially Germans, would remain grateful for Shevardnadze's work as foreign minister. But in the former Soviet Union, those nostalgic for a return to superpower status lumped Shevardnadze with Gorbachev in the ranks of the unpardonable. Shevardnadze resigned in December 1990, warning that reform was collapsing and dictatorship was imminent. A year later, the Soviet Union collapsed in the wake of an attempted hardline coup against Gorbachev. Positive contribution: Western leaders, especially Germans, would remain grateful for Shevardnadze's work as foreign minister . Shevardnadze returned to Georgia after its first elected president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, was ousted in a coup in 1992; Shevardnadze was elected speaker of parliament and became the country's leader. Gamsakhurdia died under mysterious circumstances in 1993, and Shevardnadze was elected president for a five-year term in 1995 after the country adopted a new constitution. He survived two assassination attempts, including an assault on his motorcade with anti-tank weapons. Many observers suggested the attacks blunted Shevardnadze's reformist impulses and left him interested only in holding onto power. Although he had pursued a pro-Western policy, Georgia under Shevardadze became plagued by corruption and a deterioration of democracy. In November 2003, massive demonstrations that became known as the Rose Revolution erupted after allegations of widespread fraud in a parliamentary election. Police maintained a low profile — Shevardnadze later said he feared any police action against the demonstrators would lead to terrible bloodshed. After three weeks, protesters led by future president Mikhail Saakashvili broke into a parliament session where Shevardnadze was speaking and drove him out of the building. Shevardnadze was born on Jan. 25, 1928 in the village of Mamati near Georgia's Black Sea coast, the fifth and final child in a rural family that hoped he would become a doctor. Instead, he launched a political career at age 20 by joining the Communist Party, and received a university degree only 31 years later from a teachers' institute. He steadily rose through the ranks of the party, its Komsomol youth organization and Georgia's police force until being named the republic's interior minister, the top law enforcement official. He gained a reputation for purging corrupt Georgian officials and forcing them to give up ill-gotten cars, mansions and other property. Shevardnaze (right) with President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz (left) at The White House in 1988 . Shevardnadze's anti-corruption campaign caught the attention of Soviet officials in Moscow, and he was named Communist Party chief of Georgia in 1972. He eased censorship and permitted his republic to become one of the most progressive in the cultural sphere, producing a stream of taboo-breaking films and theatrical productions. Shevardnadze was appointed Soviet foreign minister in 1985. He resigned five years later to protest plans to use force to quell unrest in the Soviet Union. He joined Russian leader Boris Yeltsin in resisting an attempted coup against Gorbachev in August 1991, and returned to the foreign minister's job for a brief stint later that year, as the Soviet Union sped toward extinction. When he returned to Georgia, he inherited a country wracked by chaos. Fighting broke out in 1990 in the northern province of South Ossetia, bordering on Russia, after the nationalist Georgian government voted to deprive the province of its autonomy. A more serious secessionist uprising followed in the province of Abkhazia. The small region, bordered by the Black Sea and Russia, has been effectively independent since separatists drove out government forces during a 1992-93 war. The two sides reached a cease-fire in 1994, but peace talks on a political solution have stalled. Even the capital Tbilisi was run by politically connected gangs and gang-related politicians, and legislators had to be reminded to check their guns before entering parliament. Shevardnadze managed to disarm the most notorious gang, the Mkhedrioni or Horsemen, in 1995, after the first attempt to kill him. The political chaos was accompanied by economic hardship. Georgia lost Soviet-era orders for its factories. Every winter, Georgians suffered gas and electricity outages. In spite of Shevardnadze's Communist-era record as a ""clean-hands"" politician, corruption gripped the country at every level. Shevardnadze shepherded Georgia into the Council of Europe, and said on occasion — to Moscow's considerable irritation — that Tbilisi would one day ""knock on NATO's door."" U.S. officials forged close ties with Shevardnadze, and the U.S. government gave his nation millions of dollars in aid in hopes of keeping Georgia in the western orbit. Shevardnadze's wife, Nanuli, died in 2004. The couple had a daughter and a son.","Shevardnadze had a huge global impact as Soviet foreign minister .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Two boy racers who killed a grandmother by smashing in to a taxi she was travelling in with such force she was thrown through the window were jailed today. Mary Byrne, 51, had arrived at her home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, when the taxi she was in was hit by a speeding BMW - which was racing with a Ford Focus. The impact was so great, the grandmother-of-seven was thrown through the window of the vehicle - suffering from fatal injuries. Joseph Robinson, 23, right, was racing with Thomas Healey, 21, left, when his BMW smashed into a taxi which was taking grandmother Mary Bryne, 51, to her home in Bradford, West Yorkshire . The BMW 330i was driven by Joseph Robinson, 23, who pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving after initially denying the charge. He was jailed for five years and three months at Bradford Crown Court today. Thomas Healey, 21, who was driving the Ford Focus ST, was found guilty of the same charge after a two week trial. He received a six-year sentence. Both men were handed five-year driving bans, also. Sentencing, Judge John Potter said: 'This was a spur of the moment decision by two . young and, it appears, intelligent men driving high powered vehicles to . indulge themselves in a high speed chase, deciding to race each other . other perhaps in a view to test each other’s macho-inspired bravado.' He told the court their lack of care for other people 'amounts to almost indescribable selfishness'. Judge Potter said both vehicles were driving between 60 and 70mph on roads with a speed limit of 30mph. The grandmother, pictured, was thrown through the window of the cab after the BMW smashed into it . When Robinson hit the taxi he was travelling at around 63mph, the court heard. Mrs Byrne's daughter said  today the family were 'glad' the pair had been sentenced - but that it 'wasn't going to bring mum back' When . Robinson, of Bradford, hit Mrs Byrne’s taxi he was driving at around . 63mph, he was travelling so fast when he came over the brow of the hill . on her road he was unable to stop in time. Judge Potter added: 'It . was your decision to behave in this way and the subsequent driving that . followed to have fatal consequences, taking the life of Mrs Byrne and . creating that chasm in the lives of her bereaved family that that exists . this day and for evermore.' Robinson was also charged with obtaining insurance by making false statements. Judge . Potter told him: 'In this context you indulged in racing the car with a . complete stranger’s vehicle for 15 minutes over two miles with fatal . consequences. 'This selfish and wholly inconsiderate attitude to others is reflected in the manner in which you drove the BMW.' Mrs Byrne, a mother-of-four, was returning from . celebrating a friend’s birthday to the home she had shared with her . partner of 27 years Alan Jones when tragedy . struck. In a cruel twist of fate the accident happened just a few steps from the gates of a primary school where a poster by her granddaughter Grace pleaded for drivers to be considerate. The court heard how Healey briefly stopped at the scene following the smash on April 20 last year before turning around and driving off. He later attended a police station and was arrested. The scene in Bradford, West Yorkshire, pictured right, where Mrs Byrne was killed . Scores of tributes line the pavement outside the Bradford home of Mrs Bryne. Her daughter said today she was 'missed every single day' Healey, of Bradford, was driving a car registered to his dad. Speaking after sentencing Mrs Byrne’s daughter, Sarah Harrison, 32, said: 'She is just missed every single day, it doesn’t get any easier.' Leading up to the crash Robinson, who . was on bail for a previous driving offence and was driving with faked . insurance documents, had been seen driving in an aggressive manner. He . had been weaving in and out of cars and one concerned motorist had even . taken a picture of his vehicle and given it to the police. Her eldest daughter, Sam Rees, 34, said: 'We are glad that they have been sentenced but we echo what the judge said, it’s not going to change it. 'Whatever they got sentenced is never going to bring mum back but their families will know what its like to lose a loved one for a couple of years.' Following the tragedy, councillors and local MP Gerry Sutcliffe added their support to calls for traffic calming measures where Mrs Byrne was killed. Since then Bradford Council has spent £10,000 installing speed humps, traffic islands and solar-powered road signs in the area.","Mary Bryne killed when a BMW smashed into a taxi she was travelling in .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Bernie Ecclestone’s command over Formula One has been diluted for the first time in 40 years with the announcement that he is no longer signing the cheques. The landmark statement came on Thursday from the sport’s parent company Delta Topco, seemingly bringing an end to ‘Bernie’s Game’ — his Svengali-like hold over virtually every aspect of Formula One’s billion-dollar empire. But later Ecclestone defiantly refused to countenance the idea that he was being stripped of his power, posing the question: ‘If people want to shake someone’s hand (on a deal), whose hand do they shake? It will still be my hand.’ On trial: The 83-year-old will stand trial on criminal charges later this year, a German court has announced . Munich State Prosecutors... allege Ecclestone paid Gerhard Gribkowsky  a £27.5million bribe to ensure Bayern LandesBank’s 47.2 per cent stake was sold to CVC Capital Partners. Constantin Medien... sold their 16.7 per cent stake to Bayern LB for just £7.2m with a guarantee of 10 per cent of the proceeds if sold for more than £670m. It was sold to CVC for £467m. The media company claim Ecclestone entered into a ‘corrupt bargain’ with Gribkowsky to undervalue Bayern LB’s stake. Bayern Landesbank... also claim to have missed out on a significant sum when Ecclestone allegedly undervalued their 47.2 per cent stake when it was sold to CVC. Bluewaters CH... filed a £408m lawsuit at the New York Supreme Court in 2012 against Ecclestone, CVC and Bayern LB, alleging Ecclestone bribed Gribkowsky to ensure the Bayern LB stake was sold to CVC, despite their offer of ‘10 per cent above any genuine bona fide offer’. Swiss Prosecutors... are investigating whether the alleged £27.5m bribe paid by Ecclestone to Gribkowsky was a criminal offence under Swiss law after a complaint brought by an unnamed ‘third party’. Ecclestone added: ‘That is how I do business, always have done and it will be the same in the future. ‘These changes were discussed a year ago and agreed. They are a bit theatrical really. ‘We have to do things more formally than in the past — very formally. ‘It . has not been my style but it is part of what we need to do because we . have been thinking about floating the business. That is all there is to . it.’ The announcement comes as Ecclestone fights four cases . concerning alleged bribery, including a criminal case in Germany, where . the prosecutors have formally charged him — the development that prompted the restructuring. He could also face charges in Switzerland where, after a complaint from a ‘third party’, investigations  are under way to establish whether there was any criminal activity under Swiss law. Thursday's statement said: ‘The board of Delta Topco Limited (the holding company for the Formula One Group of companies) has met today to discuss the decision of the Munich Court  to commence proceedings against  Mr Ecclestone. ‘Mr Ecclestone has reassured the board that he is innocent of the charges and intends to vigorously defend  the case which will commence in late April 2014.’ Ecclestone is accused of paying  £27.5million to German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky — who has already been sentenced to jail in Germany — so that he would push through the sale of the sport to its current majority owners, CVC, a private equity firm, in 2006. However, Delta Topco added: ‘After . discussion with the board, Mr Ecclestone has proposed, and the board has . agreed, that until the case has been concluded he will step down as a . director with immediate effect, thereby relinquishing his board duties . and responsibilities until the case has been resolved. Keeping faith: Red Bull team principal Christian Horner insists Ecclestone is still the 'right man for the job' ‘The board . believes that it is in the best interests of both the F1 business and . the sport that Mr Ecclestone should continue to run the business on a . day-to-day basis but subject to increased monitoring and control by the . Board. ‘Mr Ecclestone has agreed to these arrangements. The approval . and signing of significant contracts and other  material business . arrangements shall now be the responsibility of the chairman, Peter . Brabeck-Letmathe, and deputy chairman, Donald Mackenzie.’ Mackenzie, who is in charge of CVC, declined to talk to Sportsmail. He . has generally been loyal to  Ecclestone, though told the High Court in . London last month that Ecclestone would be replaced if he was found . guilty. There was little reaction from the teams as news broke yesterday. They . do not want to speak out against Ecclestone while he may still be in . power and have long believed the ‘fact’ that ‘Ecclestone still runs . Formula One’ is the third guarantee of life, along with taxes and death. Many . also feel great affection and admiration towards him for the . transformational role he has played in monetising the sport and . elevating its status around the world. The only person who spoke up yesterday, did so in Ecclestone’s favour. Red . Bull’s Christian Horner, who holidays with Ecclestone and attended his . latest wedding, said: ‘Bernie is absolutely the best and only guy to do . what he does, to take Formula One to the global reach that the sport has . achieved, introducing races in Russia this year, going back to the . Austrian Grand Prix. ‘It’s in all our interests that he’s around as long as possible.’ Glamour time: Ecclestone on the grid in Texas at last year's US Grand Prix . Ecclestone . recently spoke of Horner as his possible replacement — the first time . he had publicly contemplated Formula One in a post-Bernie world. But . at least one member of the  Formula One board would like to hasten . Ecclestone’s demise: Sir Martin Sorrell, the founder and chief executive . of multi-national advertising and public relations company WPP. A . Jew, he was angry about comments Ecclestone made lauding Hitler as a . man who ‘got things done’ in an interview in The Times five years ago . and has since kept a close, and often  disapproving, eye on Ecclestone. While . it is clear that Ecclestone’s tenure would entirely end if he went to . jail in Germany, it is  uncertain whether he would get his place on the . board back  if cleared of wrongdoing. The  German trial starts in April . and will drag on for several months — detaining Ecclestone at the . hearing which will take place for two days each week — and he will be in . his mid-80s by the time it is resolved. Ecclestone’s change of . status throws doubt on the prospect of Formula One agreeing a new . Concorde Agreement — the tripartite regulatory and commercial package . between the rights holder (represented by Ecclestone),  the FIA and the . teams. A test of Ecclestone’s status will be whether he is still . conducting those  negotiations, or will Mackenzie or Brabeck-Letmathe? Ecclestone, as he told the High Court last month, keeps all the papers in his offices and controls who sees them. It would, therefore, be difficult for anyone else to pick up the pieces immediately. And, despite the mighty symbolism of Thursday's developments, he won’t be handing over the keys readily.","Ecclestone will stand trial in Germany on bribery charges later this year .

"Click here for all the latest news . Manchester United will pursue Edinson Cavani in the summer after establishing that his club Paris Saint-Germain would not countenance a sale this month. Sir Alex Ferguson is understood to have called his former United centre half Laurent Blanc to check on the Uruguay striker's situation and the PSG coach said they would not listen to bids in this window, but would be willing to discuss the possibility at the end of the season. It proves how comfortable Moyes is with Ferguson's presence that he is utilising his predecessor's network of contacts to take the next stage in rebuilding United. Target man: Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani has emerged as a summer target for Man United . On the move? It's understood  PSG would be willing to discuss Cavani's (second left) departure in summer . It's good to talk: Sir Alex Ferguson spoke to PSG boss and former United player Laurent Blanc about Cavani . Moyes was interested in Cavani in the summer but shelved the idea of a bid as he pursued midfielders and a left back. Injuries and form have dictated a world-class striker is required though and Cavani's dissatisfaction with life in Paris means he is a prime candidate. That does not mean Moyes wants to offload Wayne Rooney, however. United are prepared to bite the bullet and let Rooney run down his contract until 2015 if he continues to turn down talks on a new deal. He has worked well with Moyes and the hope is he will be convinced by what the manager looks to bring in in the summer. Contract rebel? Man Utd are prepared to let Wayne Rooney (right) run down his contract until 2015 . Silence: Rooney's representatives have so far delayed contract talks with Man Utd officials .

Chelsea remain keen on Rooney and will bid again for the England striker but United plan to stick to their stance that he is not for sale. United are interested in Juan Mata but a swap is unlikely. They believe the player would push to move to Old Trafford if a bid was made but, likewise, Chelsea would prefer to sell abroad, if at all. With that in mind United, are continuing to look elsewhere but Moyes is wary of what pressure would fall on the shoulders of any signing that is made now. Form and morale should be lifted this week by the return of Rooney to the first-team squad, while Robin van Persie is back at Carrington today after his weekend trip to Holland. Final details: Everton expect to finalise Lacina Traore's loan move from Monaco to Goodison Park shortly . Difficult deal: Everton have struggled to strike a deal with Standard Liege for Michy Batshuayi (left) The presence of PSV Eindhoven's fitness coach Arno Philips in recent weeks has not gone down too well among all sports science staff at United but there is an acceptance that he is a man the player has grown to trust over his career. Which Premier League defenders were involved in such an angry training ground spat that the mother of one of the youth team players decided to complain to local police? The players have since settled their differences - for now. Everton hope to wrap up the signing of Lacina Traore on loan from Monaco but are facing an increasingly difficult task to sign No 1 target Michy Batshuayi of Standard Liege. Roberto Martinez was keen to sign the 20-year-old Belgian until Everton were told his £7million clause would have to be paid in full. That has delayed their bid until the summer but an extra complication is that Borussia Dortmund have made a move to sign the striker. The clubs met in a friendly in La Manga last week and Dortmund officials are ready to pay the asking price. Liege president Roland Duchatelet insists Batshuayi will not be leaving the club this month. Benfica, as well as Arsenal, have also shown interest. When Batshuayi was asked whether he will play the next five months for Liege, he answered: 'For sure!' However, the player himself told Het Laatste Nieuws: 'The Premier League and the Bundesliga are my favourite destinations. Benfica is a big club, but I'm not really convinced by the Portuguese league.' Prospect: Arsenal were spotted scouting Lille's Pape Souare in their match against St Etienne on Friday . Arsenal scouts were at the Stade Geoffroy Guichard on Friday to watch Lille left-back Pape Souare against St Etienne. The Senegal defender has impressed this season and has scored three goals in 20 Ligue 1 appearances. Meanwhile, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says he is not 'particularly interested' in signing Juventus' Mirko Vucinic. The 30-year-old striker's agent was reportedly heading for London on Monday but instead he is expected to join Inter Milan on loan. Ailing Inter have been frustrated in their attempts to sign Pablo Osvaldo from Southampton and have offered Fredy Guarin to Juventus in a bid to make Vucinic's transfer permanent. Should Guarin stay, Juve may try again for Nani at Manchester United but the £16m price may still beyond their January budget. In safe hands: Manchester City are considering swooping for Real Madrid goalkeeper Diego Lopez . Manchester City will monitor developments with Real Madrid goalkeeper Diego Lopez. The 32-year-old, installed as No 1 ahead of Iker Casillas by Jose Mourinho last year, is wanted by Borussia Dortmund and City may enter the bidding if there is any sign of a sale. Costel Pantilimon is ready to leave in the summer and Lopez would be perfect competition for Joe Hart.","Manchester United believe PSG will consider offer for striker Edinson Cavani this summer .

"By . Australian Associated Press . 'Husband, real estate agent, adulterer and efficient killer’ - were some of the roles played by Gerard Baden-Clay, jurors in his murder trial were told. Crown prosecutor Todd Fuller began his closing address in the Supreme Court in Brisbane on Tuesday, accusing Baden-Clay of ‘efficiently’ murdering his wife, Allison Baden-Clay, in a struggle at their home on April 19 or 20, 2012. Mr Fuller told the jury Baden-Clay had presented a number of faces to different people throughout his life, including the facade of the anguished husband during his own trial. The prosecutor said he played the role of ‘effective and efficient’ killer by ending his wife Allison's life and leaving no significant evidence. 'Husband, real estate agent, adulterer and efficient killer' - were some of the roles played by Gerard Baden-Clay, (left) jurors in his murder trial for his wife Allison (right) were told . He urged the jurors to look closely at a photograph of jagged scratches on Baden-Clay's cheek taken by police the day he reported his wife missing. Several experts have told the court they were probably caused by fingernails, and were unlikely to have been caused by a blunt razor as Baden-Clay has maintained. Mr Fuller said the scratches were evidence that Allison had struck out in defence during 'close hand contact', unable to injure her husband in any other way. 'There was a struggle between the two of them and she left her mark upon him,' he said. 'They are damning and link to the act of violence without any doubt.' Mr Fuller said Baden-Clay was reacting to an accumulation of pressures  including a struggling business, large debts and the double life he was leading with mistress Toni McHugh. Mr Fuller dismissed suggestions by Baden-Clay's defence team that Mrs Baden-Clay could have fallen or jumped to her death, saying these had been effectively ruled out by expert witnesses . The prosecutor dismissed the 43-year-old's claims he hadn't loved Ms McHugh pointing to an email in April 11, 2012, in which Baden-Clay told her: 'This is agony for me ... leave this to me now. I love you'. Baden-Clay wanted to be with Ms McHugh but didn't have the courage to leave his wife, Mr Fuller said. 'Does that not show the pressure and the place this man was in come the 19th of April 2012?' he asked the jurors. The court was shown diary entries written by Mrs Baden-Clay in 2010 that spoke of her regret about getting married, her fear of being alone and how she blamed herself for the breakdown of her marriage. 'I would give anything if my partner would love me and make love to me,' she wrote. 'If my relationship ends it will be because I didn't work hard enough.' Crown prosecutor Todd Fuller said the scratches were evidence that Allison had struck out in defence during 'close hand contact', unable to injure her husband in any other way . Mr Fuller dismissed suggestions by Baden-Clay's defence team that Mrs Baden-Clay could have fallen or jumped to her death, saying these had been effectively ruled out by expert witnesses. Her body was found on April 30, 2012, on a creek bank at Anstead in Brisbane's west, 10 days after her husband reported her missing from their home in nearby Brookfield. He has pleaded not guilty to murder. Mr Fuller is expected to finish his closing address on Wednesday before the judge sums up the trial and the jury retires to consider its verdict.

"By . Alan Roden . Three trips to the United States saw Alex Salmond stay in some of the country's most luxurious hotels while racking up a bill of more than £20,000 at taxpayers' expense. The Scottish Government has finally published details of the First Minister's foreign jaunts following an eight-month battle over the data. Mr Salmond's travel and subsistence bill for a visit to Chicago for the Ryder Cup in 2012 cost £7,046. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, pictured in Hollywood in 2012, has been criticised for hisglobe-trotting at taxpayers' expense . In 2012, Mr Salmond donned his tartan trousers to attend the Hollywood premier of Disney film Brave . He stayed in a suite in the five-star Peninsula Hotel, popular with celebrities such as Brad Pitt, which included a guest powder room, living room, a dressing area, three TVs, a video games console, a surround-sound stereo system and a marble bathroom. Mr Salmond would have been treated to panoramic views of Michigan Avenue, one of Chicago's main thoroughfares, and the city's historic Water Tower Park. The SNP leader, who was accompanied by three officials, has refused to disclose how much he spent on this weeklong jaunt, dismissing criticism as 'ridiculous frippery'. But the majority of the 'Team Scotland' delegation in the US at the same time stayed in a more modest hotel near the Medinah golf course, which charges £60 for a room. The entire trip cost taxpayers nearly £500,000. The new figures also show that Mr Salmond's bill for a four-day trip to California in 2012 was £8,197, where he attended the movie premiere of the Disney/ Pixar film Brave. He took three officials with him. In April last year, the First Minister took part in New York's Scotland Week for the first time in five years, and his bill came to £4,999. Once again travelling with three officials, he delivered speeches which covered his push for independence. While in the US, it is thought Mr Salmond stayed at the Algonquin Hotel in midtown Manhattan, which offers rooms for up to £400 a night and is officially designated a historic landmark. Mr Salmond watches play at the 2012 Ryder Cup at Medinah Country Club in Illinois during a trip which cost more than £7,000 . But the Scottish Government repeatedly refuses to confirm where the First Minister stays when abroad and Freedom of Information (FOI) requests asking for costs to be published have gone unanswered. In November, the Tories used the FOI Act to request a breakdown of all ministerial overseas visits between February 2012 and October 2013, and complained to the Scottish Information Commissioner last month when the data had still not been released. Finally, it was disclosed yesterday that the SNP administration spent almost £219,000 on overseas trips for ministers and officials in the past three years. Mr Salmond's bill included £7,725 for a trip to China in November. Tory chief whip John Lamont accused the Scottish Government of being 'secretive' about the spending. He said: 'The sheer expense of some trips has to be questioned, especially with so many officials accompanying people like the First Minister abroad. 'The fact the Scottish Government took several months to publish will also arouse suspicion. If ministers did not have something to hide, why were they so secretive?' In 2012 he stayed at the five-star Peninsula Hotel in Chicago (left) and last year he is thought to have stayed at the Algonquin Hotel in midtown Manhatten . Scottish Labour business manager Paul Martin said: 'When many families are having to forego their summer holiday because money is tight, it is clear Alex Salmond thinks there is nothing wrong with spending our money on luxury hotels. 'Given the bill he is running up, Alex Salmond seems more interested in having a good time than winning jobs and investment.' But a spokesman for Finance Secretary John Swinney said: 'This is the height of hypocrisy from a Tory Party which, in government at Westminster, thinks nothing of spending £13million in a year on flights and hotels for the Foreign Office. 'Meanwhile, the [UK Government's] Scotland Office's bill for domestic flights has almost doubled in just two years to more than £130,000. 'And the Tory Treasury are still hiding polling on the referendum, despite spending £300,000 of taxpayers' cash on it.'","Scottish government releases details of First Minister's globe-trotting .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Vanessa Feltz, pictured today, said she has received a 'storm of insults and bile' following her allegations she was assaulted by Rolf Harris . Vanessa Feltz says she has received a 'storm of insults and bile' following claims she was sexually assaulted by Rolf Harris. The broadcaster claimed on Sunday the sex predator put his hands up her dress and tugged at her underwear during a live interview on Channel 4's The Big Breakfast. Feltz claims she only managed to stop Harris assaulting her by calling out for an advertisement break. Following her allegations, which date back to 1996, the presenter says that she's received an 'outpouring of misogyny and hatred' online. Speaking on the radio,  she said: 'You think if people react like that, you can see why people don't come forward. 'I'm 52 and I can handle myself so imagine if I was a seven-year-old child, or 12 or 17. 'I'm not saying just if it's someone famous, but imagine if it was your dad, uncle or teacher. 'The kind of reaction I have had, I found so upsetting. 'I was upset by the outpouring of misogyny and hatred and you know ""Who would want to assault Vanessa Feltz?"".' Today, scores of comments could be seen on Twitter. One, named Jack, said: 'Vanessa Feltz claims Rolf Harris groped her. Surely even Rolf Harris has standards?' Another, Jo Hoskinson, wrote: 'Apparently #RolfHarris groped #vanessafeltz. Really Vanessa? Does someone need some publicity? #jumponthebandwagon' One Twitter user, Rob, wrote: 'If #RolfHarris has touched up #vanessafeltz he deserves another 5 years for p***poor taste.' Another, referred to as Belcher, added: 'Vanessa Feltz, though? You've really let your fans down this time, Rolf.'

Miss Feltz claims the disgraced star attacked her during a live interview on Channel 4 in 1996. Pictured is one of the abusive tweets written about the broadcaster . Miss Feltz said on Sunday it 'didn't occur to her' to inform officers of Harris's alleged attack. Pictured is another of the tweets posted today . Miss Feltz said today she was 'upset' by the messages, one abusive example pictured . Derek Stitt said: 'Vanessa Feltz has accused Rolf Harris of touching her up in 1996. I think he thought he was sedating a hippo in animal hospital to be fair.' One, known as Fattus Antus, wrote: 'Vanessa Feltz looks like the offspring of a knockoff Barbie doll from Rwanda and a neglected beanbag. I can honestly say that I'd rather grope a Kangaroo than Vanessa Feltz.' Feltz said that she contacted Metropolitan Police on the first day of the trial hoping to testify against him. However, she was told that Harris's lawyers said the allegations came too late to investigate without derailing the case. Earlier this week, singer Linda Nolan also alleged the paedophile molested her when she was 15. She claims Harris attacked her while she was backstage in South Africa  - where she and her sisters were due to perform. Harris, 84, was jailed for five years . and nine months at Southwark Crown Court last Friday for 12 indecent . assaults on four victims including his daughter’s best friend and an . eight-year-old. Another of the messages. Miss Feltz's claims come as singer Linda Nolan alleged she was attacked by Harris when she was 15 years old . Feltz says the attack took place in May 1996 while she was interviewing Harris on a bed. In an interview with The Daily Express, she said some of the staff on the show warned her Harris was known in the business for his wandering hands. The presenter, who was wearing a floor-length evening dress for the interview, described the alleged attack to the newspaper. She said: 'As the interview continued, with his wife watching and with the crew all in the room, I suddenly felt a rustling at the hem of my dress. ‘I was on live television so I could not look down but I sensed that his hand was at the bottom of my dress and he was slowly gathering the fabric up and moving his hand higher and higher up my leg.’ She said Harris carried on smiling and joking as though nothing was happening. ‘Suddenly his hand had reached my knee and he was still going up and travelling at speed.

'After a few seconds he had managed to get his hand inside the elastic of my knickers and I was absolutely staggered. ‘I had to do something but I was in the middle of an interview on live television with one of the most famous men in the country. I have not a shadow of a doubt that he knew exactly what he was doing and he was getting excited about it, doing what he was doing while he was on live television. ‘The second we went to the break I jumped away from him and got his hand out from under my dress. He didn’t react in any way at all. When we came back to the live interview he carried on as if nothing had happened. ‘I was powerless to protect myself and he knew and he was getting a thrill from it.

"By . Andrew Magee . Brazil 2014 has become the World Cup of 'Supersubs' - with goal after goal being scored by replacements. The World Cup has come to life and, with so many late goals, it has been as exciting a tournament as anyone can remember - and even sub goalkeepers have contributed to the entertainment after Tim Krul's cameo in Holland's 4-3 penalty shoot-out victory over Costa Rica. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at some of the best and most important goals from substitutes so far. Subs: Even replacement goalkeepers have been the talk of the World Cup in Brazil . HARIS SEFEROVIC (Switzerland 2-1 Ecuador) Trailing Ecuador 1-0 at half-time, Ottmar Hitzfeld brought on Mehmedi, who equalised straight after the break. Hitzfeld repeated the trick when he brought on Haris Seferovic, who scored the winner three minutes into injury time. Leaving it late: Haris Seferovic scoops home a late opener for Switzerland in a 2-1 win against Ecuador . JOHN BROOKS (Ghana 1-2 USA) Clint Dempsey scored one minute into the USA’s campaign.

Case for the defence: John Brooks looks in a state of shock after scoring the winning goal against Ghana . MAROUANE FELLAINI (Belgium 2-1 Algeria) Belgium boss Marc Wilmots used his subs effectively in Brazil.

ANDRE SCHURRLE (Germany 2-1 Algeria) In another cagey last-16 game, Andre Schurrle came on at half time.

"By . Fiona Macrae . Forget the search for life on Mars. Scientists want to know if it is possible to make chips in space. Greek researchers are to try to fry chips under type of reduced gravity found on Mars or the moon. They’ve already shown it is possible to make chips at forces three times the normal force of gravity. Greek researchers claim that frying chips in space would cause them to be soggy rather than crispy because there is no convection in zero gravity . The experiments are funded by the European Space Agency and follow comments from a Russian cosmonaut that what he’d really like is ‘fried potatoes’. Researcher Thodoris Karapantsios began by using a giant centrifuge to cook chips under conditions of hypergravity, which is when the force of gravity is more than that on Earth. He found that at a force of 3-g, which is three times the gravity of Earth, the potatoes formed a perfect crispy crust in around half the usual time. While the chips may not have tasted out of this world, they tasted as good as those fried normally. The chip experiments are funded by the European Space Agency and follow comments from a Russian cosmonaut that what he'd really like is 'fried potatoes'. Here, astronauts eat a meal on board the Space Shuttle Discovery . The professor, from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, said the same effect could be achieved by creating an industrial fryer that spins once a second or a home fryer that rotates twice a second, and he plans to patent a design. In the meantime, experiments that recreate the weightlessness of space are planned. Professor Karapantsios suspects that the potatoes will boil rather than fry but said: ‘It will be important to know whether we can fry on Mars or the moon.’ His experiments are described in the journal Food Research International.

"By . Emily Crane . An animal handler who suffered puncture wounds to both hands after a crocodile latched onto him at a zoo on the NSW south coast is now undergoing treatment at a specialised hand hospital. Trent Burton, 31, was bitten and dragged into the water by a 3.7m crocodile he was feeding at Shoalhaven Zoo on Monday afternoon. He was discharged from Shoalhaven Hospital late on Monday night and has since been receiving treatment at the Sydney Hand Hospital. Scroll down for video . Trent Burton, a handler at Shoalhaven Zoo, was taken to hospital on Monday suffering bites to both hands after being attacked by the crocodile he was feeding . Mr Burton, who is due to see a specialist today, broke one of his left fingers and has lacerations on his left hand that needs stitching. 'Trent was just happy that he had feeling in his hand and could move his fingers,' Shoalhaven Zoo owner Nick Schilko told MailOnline. 'We are just thankful that he is alright. He had a little bit of damage to his right hand that had a few stitches but his left hand needs specialist treatment. 'They want a specialist to look at it to clean and treat it properly before they do anything else.' Mr Burton, who has been handling crocodiles for more than 10 years, was presenting a regular feeding show at the zoo when the croc, known as John, latched on and dragged him into the water. He managed to scramble out of the water as a shocked school holiday crowd watched on. 'Trent was feeding the croc... He flipped the food at his (the crocodile’s) face. He caught it in his mouth and as he’s tried to flick it up to put it in his mouth further, Trent tried to reached and take it out of his mouth,' Mr Schilko said. 'He was beating himself up over what he did. Basically his hand got caught in the moment... the crocodile has gone bonus and started backing up to the water and dragged him all the way into the water' He was presenting a regular feeding show at the zoo at 12pm when the 3.7 metre male crocodile, known as John, latched on and dragged him into the water . He managed to scramble out of the water and away from John the croc as a shocked school holiday crowd watched on . 'It was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life. I've seen them in the wild and at Steve Irwin's zoo but never anything like this,' Marlene Orr, from Shellharbour, said on Monday. Mr Burton was treated at the zoo by paramedics before being taken to hospital with puncture wounds to his hands. It's not known when Mr Burton will be back working at the zoo, but Mr Schilko said the crocodile handler would want to be back soon. 'He’s not a sook so he wants to be back at work as soon as possible. I will allow him to come back to work whenever the doctors say he can,' he said. Trent, pictured here with the zoo's two crocodiles - John and Dawn - has 10 years of experience handling crocodiles . The handler was holding out a piece of meat during the show when the crocodile snapped it up before he was supposed to, according to one woman in the crowd .","Trent Burton was bitten by a crocodile during a feeding show at Shoalhaven Zoo on Monday .

The South African athlete says he accidentally killed his model girlfriend after mistaking her for an intruder and opening fire through a door, but the prosecution say it was pre-mediated. Barry Steenkamp, in an emotional interview, revealed that the incident was the third tragedy in her life. Scroll down for video . Heartache: Reeva Steenkamp's mother and father, June and Barry, have spoken of their anguish over their daughter's death, revealing that the shooting was 'the third tragedy in her life' Trial: Oscar Pistorius (right) is accused of murdering Reeva Steenkamp (left) on Valentine's Day 2013 . He told Hello! Magazine: ‘She [Reeva] had three tragedies in her life – I was there for her the first and second time, but I wasn’t there for the third. ‘After she had her tonsils taken out when she was five, something went wrong and she almost bled to death. Then, when she was 19, she went riding on our farm. The horse stumbled, she came off and it fell on top of her, breaking her back. Luckily I was there, put her in the car and dashed to hospital.’ Reeva’s mother, June, in the same interview, revealed details about the dreadful moment she was told about the death of her daughter. The news came at 7am on February 15, 2013, the day after she was shot from Detective Hilton Botha. Oscar Pistorius, left, talks with a defense team member in court in Pretoria on Monday . She said: ‘I became hysterical. Then I had to tell Barry. His reaction… it was too terrible. We both went into what can only be described as a walking coma.’ June added that when Reeva’s body was flown home she could only see her face, as the body was wrapped in sheets and a pale scarf. She said: ‘She still looked beautiful. I kissed her and whispered “I love you, darling, and I’m going to miss you”. Then I collapsed.’ Reeva's death has taken its toll on her father, Barry, who has suffered a stroke and been unable to attend the court hearings. Trial: Pistorius, left, speaks with a woman in court . The interview came as the trial entered its 38th day in Pretoria’s High Court. The chief prosecutor in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Monday challenged the credibility of a physician who testified that the athlete has an anxious nature linked to his disability. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel on Monday said the defense witness, physician Wayne Derman, could not be objective about the double-amputee runner. The defense maintains that Pistorius has a deep sense of vulnerability because of his disability and a fear of crime, and it was a factor in the killing because he opened fire after thinking an intruder was in his house. Pistorius studies a document in court as he waits for the trial to get under way . Under questioning, Derman acknowledged that his testimony did not amount to a ""forensic report"" but disputed Nel's assertion that he could not give credible evidence because he was too familiar with Pistorius, having treated him over many years and traveled with him extensively. On Sunday, an Australian broadcaster showed video footage of Pistorius participating in a re-enactment of how he says events unfolded on the night he killed Steenkamp. In the video, Pistorius is seen walking on his stumps with an arm outstretched and fist clenched, as though holding a gun. It also shows Pistorius carrying a woman. It is unclear where the re-enactment was filmed. The broadcast by Channel Seven prompted criticism from a lawyer for Pistorius who said the re-enactment was made with the help of a U.S.-based company last year as part of the defense team's trial preparations. The video has not been shown at the trial.","Barry Steenkamp speaks of pain at being unable to save his daughter .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Children should be weighed every year in primary school to stop them getting fat, according to the head of the Commons health committee. Tory MP Sarah Wollaston warned that most parents do not know that they child is ‘slipping’ into obesity. One in five children are overweight when they start primary school, but by the time they leave aged 11 the figure has risen to one in three. Children are weighed at in reception and Year 6 of primary school, but there are warnings this is not enough to stem the obesity timebomb . Dr Wollaston, a former GP, was elected to chair the health select committee last week. She argues that current rules on measuring children only in their first and last year of primary school risked failing to catch health problems during the intervening seven years. Official figures show that 22.2 per cent of children aged four and five in reception classes were classed as overweight in 2012-13. But the figure rises to 33.3 per cent among Year 6 children. Dr Wollaston is calling for annual health checks to prevent children’s weight ballooning during their schooldays. ‘We should be measuring every year. If children start to slip into difficulties you can let parents know and offer help,’ she told The Sun. Dr Sarah Wollaston, a former GP who now chairs the Commons health select committee, warned many parents do not know their children are slipping into obesity . Obesity costs the NHS £5billion every year. In 2012-13, more than 3,100 children were admitted to hospital with illnesses linked to obesity, up from 1,117 a decade earlier. Dr Wollaston told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: 'A survey in Newcastle showed that parents tend to underestimate their children’s weight. It’s about catching them before they slip into obesity. 'Parents want information and the best thing they can do is cut sugar out of their children’s diets. The assumption that parents know that their children are slipping into problems is just not right. 'The results of the child management programme are never shared with the school. They can be shared with the parents but sometimes they would have to ask for the results to be sent direct to them.’ Health campaigners backed the idea of regularly weighing children in schools. But Tory MP Philip Davies said: 'You don't need some nannying doctor to tell you children are overweight.' A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Children are weighed and measured at key points in their development- the start and end of primary school. Local authorities can measure children more often if they choose to. 'We know some people eat too many calories including sugar. Childhood obesity is at its lowest since 1998 but more should be done. 'We want to help people make healthier choices and get the nation into healthy habits for life. 'We have invested £155m into school sport and our Change4Life Sports Clubs are helping over 225,000 children to take part.' In primary schools alone 75,000 children now enjoy 60 active minutes on most days of the week — an increase of nearly 60 per cent. We have also committed £1.2 million to promote walking in five of our major cities.' Local authorities can measure children more often if they choose.’ New food standards will encourage schools to make milk available while limiting access to unhealthy snacks and fruit juice. They will specify that semi-skimmed milk ‘must be available for drinking at least once a day’ in all primary and secondary institutions. However, it will not be free for all. Under the guidelines, fruit juice will be restricted to one 150ml glass per day from January amid growing evidence of the damaging effect of its rich natural sugars on children’s developing teeth. Many nutritionists now recommend that children are only allowed one small glass of fruit juice per week as a treat.","Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston warns action is needed to tackle health crisis .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Norfolk has once again been shown to be a treasure trove of archaeological finds after a second timber circle was uncovered off its coast. The Bronze Age wooden structure was first discovered in the late 1990s on the beach by Holme-next-to-Sea, and tests have now revealed it dates back to the summer of 2049 BC. That’s the same year as the timber used to build the original Seahenge circle, discovered in Norfolk in 1998 was felled. A second timber circle has been uncovered (pictured), 15 years after the first, dubbed Seahenge, was found along the Norfolk coast. The Bronze Age timber circle has been tested by archaeologists and dates to the summer of 2049 BC. Experts believe the upturned stump was a final resting place for an important person . Specifically, research by Norfolk County Council’s historic environment team has confirmed that Seahenge’s sister circle was made from trees felled in the spring or summer of 2049BC. Heralded as one of the greatest . discoveries of the late 20th century, the iconic timber circle of . Seahenge, also known as Holme I, sparked controversy when it was discovered, over whether it should be dug up and . preserved for posterity, or left where it was. The timbers came from a circle 21ft (6.6m) in diameter, comprising 55 closely-fitted oak posts, each originally up to (10ft (3 metres) in length. This . latest find looks similar to the original circle, and features two oak logs laid flat at its centre, surrounded by posts. The two circles, before Holme I was removed, were approx. 100m apart. Where seen, Holme II timbers were, in 2004, around 2.5ft (0.76 metres long), with the top 50 per cent eroded and damaged. The diameter of circle, was around 42ft (13 metres) and the monument once had two central logs, with two posts to the east and two to the west. These were surrounded by a central wooden oval made from 15 posts and two courses of hurdling. To the east of this was an inner arc of at least 16 timbers, and beyond this was an outer oval with a maximum diameter of 42ft (13 metres) comprising at least 65 timbers set edge to edge. The timber circle discovered in 1998 was dubbed Seahenge after Stonehenge in Wiltshire. Dating techniques revealed the circle was built around 2049BC. Its discovery was heralded as one of the greatest finds of the late 20th century, and analysis of axe markings revealed metal tools were used earlier than first thought. The wooden ring (pictured right) and its central upturned oak stump were removed . from the peat bed in Holme-next-the-Sea and taken to the local Lynn Museum. Archaeologists have now confirmed a second circle found nearby was linked to . Seahenge. While Seahenge is thought to . have been built to mark the . death of an important individual, the . second circle nearby could be the remains of a burial mound. Experts believe the upturned stump was used as the final . resting place of an important person, where his or her body . would be allowed to break down in the open air - a practice known as 'sky burial' and used by monks in Nepal. Dating has confirmed that the second circle was built at the same time as the first, and it is thought there may be others hidden under the sea. It has led archaeologists to again question why ancient people . built the mysterious oak circles, during the early Bronze Age. David . Robertson, historic environment officer with Norfolk County Council, . said: ‘The felling date on them is the spring or early summer of 2049 BC. ‘Those trees were felled at exactly the same time. Having one was fantastic - and having two just adds to the story. ‘We have to try to understand not just why they were built, but what were they used for.’ One theory . is that the upturned stump was the final resting place of an important . person after death, where his or her body would be allowed to break down . in the open air. The . second circle could have been the burial place, or mound, where the wooden posts acted as a . revetment, or sloping structures, into which soil was placed on top of the body. The Holme timber circle discovered in 1998 was dubbed Seahenge (pictured) after Stonehenge in Wiltshire. Its discovery was heralded as one of the greatest finds of the late 20th century, and analysis of axe markings on the wood revealed metal tools were used earlier than first thought . Both circles were uncovered in Holme-next-to-Sea near Old Hunstanton in Norwich, Norfolk (pictured). Holme is the only place in the UK where prehistoric timbers have been found and it is believed the tree used to make the two circles was felled at the same time . The second timber circle is the latest find in a string of discoveries that have highlighted Norfolk's place in archaeological history. A . Paleolithic hand-axe was found embedded in clay at Happisburgh by a . dog-walker in 2000. It was dated to 700,000 BC, and pushed back the . known origins of early human occupation in Stone Age Britain. The earliest evidence of human footprints outside Africa - some 850,000 . years old - were then discovered at Happisburgh in May 2013. Described . as 'the most important discovery on British shores', the footprints were found in the coastal town after being . exposed by sea tides. Scientists said in February . that the footprints are evidence of the earliest known humans in . northern Europe, previously only revealed through the discovery of . animal bones and stone tools. The project means that the two timber circles are the only ones in the country to have been dated precisely using dendrochronology. Controversy erupted when scientists began digging up Seahenge after it was discovered in 1998. Protesters clashed with archaeologists as the 55 posts and central stump were taken away to be preserved, before eventually going on display at Lynn Museum in King’s Lynn. Tree ring dating, or dendrochronology tests, were carried out on samples from the second circle last summer. While the results confirm it was almost certainly built by the same people as Seahenge, Robertson said the second structure would not be excavated. ‘Since 1999 it’s been visible at some times and covered by the sand at other times,’ he said. ‘There are no plans to dig it up. ‘It’s been decided with the second circle to let nature take its course. Over the years, the sea has claimed parts of the structure.' Erosion and the loss of its timbers prompted the dating project, the results of which are expected to be published soon. The significance of the find, and the positioning of the wooden stumps resemble those seen at Stonehenge, in Wiltshire (pictured), which led to the timber circle getting its Seahenge nickname .

"By . Lydia Warren . An Indiana teenager who smashed into a condo during a terrifying para-sailing accident last summer has reunited with the hospital staff who saved her life a year since the incident. Sidney Good, 18, was left in critical condition with friend Alexis Fairchild on July 1, 2013 when their parasail snapped free from . its boat in Panama City, Florida, leaving the girls soaring through the . air. In an ordeal that was captured on camera . by horrified holidaymakers, the girls . left to the mercy of the wind and thrown against the 13th floor of a . condominium before crashing in a parking lot. On Tuesday, Good returned to the Bay Medical Center where staff had coaxed her back to life after she suffered from cracked vertebrae and severe brain trauma, ABC News reported. Scroll down for video . Thankful: Sidney Good became emotional as she reunited with hospital staff who coaxed her back to life last summer after she suffered devastating injuries in a freak parasailing accident . Saviors: She could not recall many of the team due to her brain damage but remembered one doctor, Rebecca Hysong (pictured left), who had promised her she would walk again . She became emotional as she saw the doctors and nurses again, although her brain damage meant that she could not remember them. 'It just like… it upsets me,' Good said as she wiped away her tears, with her family by her side. 'I was dying, and these people saved me.' Good's mother Amy said the doctors hadn't been sure how successful her recovery would be. 'We didn’t know if she could walk or talk,' Amy Good said. 'They told us she may not remember.' But both girls, who are no longer as close as they were, impressed their medical staff and families when they walked on stage during the graduation at Huntington North High School on June 6. Life-changing: Good poses alongside her friend Alexis Fairchild before the parasailing accident last July . Terrifying: The girls' parasail snapped off and sent them into a condo before they crashed to the ground . Crash: After smashing into the condo, the girls crashed down on this car. They both suffered brain damage . Battle: Good, pictured in hospital, suffered spinal injuries and doctors did not know if she would walk again . But although they were on their feet, they still struggle every day with the aftermath of the incident. 'Both girls have brain damage,' Good's lawyer, Wes Pittman, told WJHG. 'One reads at a 5th to 6th grade level even though they have both . graduated from high school. The other one reads at a third to fourth . grade level.' He went on: 'Both have serious orthopedic injuries, spinal surgeries with more . coming, titanium plates and screws because of the multiple facial . fractures. Her optic nerves were damaged and she sees only right down . the center of what you're looking at between my two hands right now.' Attorneys for the girls claim that the parasailing company was negligent for taking the girls out during dangerous weather and for driving the boat too close to the shore with unsafe equipment. The girls became detached from the boat when their boat dropped anchor due to unusually high and dangerous winds and their line snapped. Fighting back: Good, pictured in May, returned home to Indiana and has fought to regain her abilities . Celebration: She is pictured walking across stage during her high school graduation in early June . Milestone: Good, pictured left at graduation, credits the hospital staff with saving her life last year . They underwent multiple operations for their injuries, and Alexis was eventually able to leave Bay Medical Center in Panama City, Florida in mid-July while Sidney remained for a further week. Both girls then returned home to Huntington, Indiana, where they have continued to undergo treatment as out patients. A new National Transportation Safety Board report has also criticized the parasailing industry, accusing operators of 'poor judgment, lack of sufficient experience [and] proper training'. 'Passengers seeking to enjoy the thrill, adventure and panoramic views of parasailing risk becoming accident victims,' the NTSB report said. 'Due to the nature of parasailing, accidents usually result in either serious injury or death.' There are no federal guidelines regulating parasailing and now the NTSB is recommended that all operators are licensed by the Coast Guard.

"By . Australian Associated Press . Brisbane woman Allison Baden-Clay could have fallen or jumped to her death while under the influence of anti-depressant drugs, a court has heard. Gerard Baden-Clay's lawyer has outlined a possible explanation for the 43-year-old's death as his client's murder trial draws to a close in Brisbane. Defence barrister Michael Byrne QC told the Supreme Court jury on Monday that in April 2012 Allison's depression could have been triggered by discussion of her husband's affair and recent news that his brother's wife had borne a son. Scroll down for video . Brisbane woman Allison Baden-Clay could have fallen or jumped to her death while under the influence of anti-depressant drugs, a court has heard . The court has heard evidence that the mother to three girls had desperately wanted a boy to continue the Baden-Clay name. Mr Byrne suggested Allison took an extra dose of her prescribed anti-depressant medication early on April 20, 2012, and went for a walk to clear her head. He said at 4am the drugs would have peaked in her bloodstream and she could have been affected by known side effects such as confusion, disorientation or suicide ideation. 'At some time, for some reason, she ends up in the river,' Mr Byrne said. 'The autopsy report can't rule out drowning, it can't rule out a possible fall, a jump from a bridge which could have rendered her unconscious.' Allison Baden-Clay's body was found on a muddy bank under the Kholo Creek Bridge in Brisbane's west on April 30, 2012. The discovery was made 10 days after her husband reported her missing from their home in Brookfield, 13km away. Former real estate agent Gerard Baden-Clay, 43, has pleaded not guilty to murder. Former real estate agent Gerard Baden-Clay (left) has pleaded not guilty to the murder of his 43-year-old wife (right) During his closing remarks on Monday Mr Byrne urged jurors to ignore 'sensational' publicity surrounding the month-long trial and calmly weigh the evidence when considering their verdict. He warned them against using moral judgments of Baden-Clay's adultery to convict his client of the serious crime of murder. 'Maybe you would think that you find his morals despicable. That is a far cry though from labelling him a murderer,' Mr Byrne said. The barrister used slides to highlight major gaps in the Crown's circumstantial case, such as how Mrs Baden-Clay died, his client's motive, and the lack of forensic evidence linking him to her death. A small amount of Allison's blood was found in the couple's car. Allison Baden-Clay's body was found on a muddy bank under the Kholo Creek Bridge in Brisbane's west on April 30, 2012 . The discovery of Allison's body was made 10 days after her husband reported her missing from their home in Brookfield, 13km away . 'Why is there no blood anywhere in the house, outside the house, on the patio, in the carport, when the prosecution case is somehow the body is either dragged or carried through the foliage and deposited in the car?' Mr Byrne asked. He also dismissed the testimony of several forensic experts who said marks on Baden-Clay's face looked like fingernail scratches. Mr Byrne said none of the experts could rule out 100 per cent that they were 'shaving scrapes' from a blunt razor. The barrister ridiculed claims his client had killed his wife because of financial pressure or plans to leave his wife. Mr Byrne is expected to conclude his address on Tuesday morning before the prosecution delivers its final remarks.
