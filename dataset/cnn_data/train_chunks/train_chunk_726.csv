A seven-year-old girl was airlifted to hospital in Georgia on Monday after falling about 50ft into a well at her grandparents' house. Megan Winters was left with bleeding on the brain and broke several bones including her hip, leg and arm, after falling headfirst into the dry well at about 2.45pm. It took more than an hour for firefighters to lift Megan to safety and, because the well was so narrow, the rescue crew had to send their smallest member in. Scroll down for video .

'She was in an awkward position, face . first, so it  took us a while to get her maneuvered around,' Lieutenant . Clay Kierbow, who was lowered into the well to rescue Megan, said. 'Luckily there was only a little bit of wetness down there but no standing water.' Megan had been playing in her grandparents' yard when plywood covering the disused well gave way beneath her. 'They . were out here playing, and my grandchild came in and told me Megan had . fallen in the well,' the child's grandmother Jean McCollum told the Times Georgian. 'I've told them a hundred times to stay away from that old well.' Megan's mother, who has not been named, said her daughter had been jumping on the well cover, which had been weakened by rain. She told ABC News that her daughter had been 'very lucky' and thanked Lieutenant Kierbow for saving her.

An alleged shark that appeared in a Manhattan Beach, California, wave on Friday as two children played in the water nearby was a dolphin, according to experts. A . local mother was taking a picture of . her 12-year-old son and a friend just as they were about to catch a wave . when the sea creature appeared in the break. The ‘photobomb’ story went viral on Sunday and Monday, as people argued over whether it was a shark or a dolphin. NOT a shark: A Manhattan Beach mother captured this image of what was initially thought to be a shark in the break of a wave next to her son and a friend in the water at Manhattan Beach, California . The verdict has now been delivered with an overwhelming majority of scientists concluding that the sighting was in fact of a bottlenose dolphin. Experts say the tail fin is horizontal, like that of a dolphin and there is no sign of a second dorsal fin, which sharks have and dolphins do not. Bottlenose dolphins are also frequently seen surfing in the faces of waves, while sharks are not, according to Grind TV. Kera Mathes, a naturalist with the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, posted on her Facebook page that the sea creature was definitely a dolphin. Dolphins vs sharks: Dolphins have horizontal flukes, shown here in this image . Big difference: Sharks have a second dorsal fin, seen here in this image, which dolphins do not . ‘I hate that the poor sharks are getting a bad, scary rep for this when it’s a coastal bottlenose dolphin,’ she wrote. Diane . Alps of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Cetacean Society said . in another Facebook comment: ‘Sure looks to be a bottlenose dolphin! Single falcate dorsal fin, horizontal flukes. General body shape looks . dolphin-esque too.’ Florida-based shark connoisseur, David Shiffman, says the creature is obviously a dolphin, based on its flat tail fin. ‘I asked about a dozen shark scientists and a handful of dolphin scientists [sic] to confirm my suspicion that it was a dolphin, and 100 per cent of them identified it as a dolphin. 'It doesn’t have a second dorsal fin and the tail is flat. Dolphin.’ Rant: David Shiffman, a shark enthusiast, took to Facebook to deliver his thoughts on the issue of the 'shark' photo-bomb . It is not the first time a dolphin has been mistaken for a shark. Professional . surfer, Kolohe Andino, was photographed riding a wave which contained a . creature that at first was thought to be a shark at the Hurley Pro surf . contest at Lower Trestles near San Clemente, California, in September . 2012. It was later identified as a bottlenose dolphin based on the shape of its dolphin-like fluke. And . in 2011 in north San Diego County, surfers were sure that a large . critter photographed in a wave was a large great white shark. But that, too, was most likely a dolphin turned sideways as it swam through the wave. Confusion: The bottlenose dolphin has many times been mistaken for a shark . Jaws? Surfers have often been photographed riding waves containing what looks to be a shark . However, there are still some who . believe it is a shark, such as Eric Martin, co-director of the . Roundhouse Marine Studies Marine Lab and Aquarium. And Salvador Jorgensen, a great white shark expert from Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station, told Grind TV that the tail in the picture from the recent shark scare ‘doesn’t really look like a shark tail more than, say, a dolphin sideways in the wave’. But he added that it was ‘impossible to say for sure from the picture alone’. Christopher Lowe, a white shark expert who runs the Shark Lab at Cal State Long Beach, said the tail looked more like that of a dolphin.","Alleged shark is a bottlenose dolphin say experts .

A Hawaii woman whose last name is 36 characters long has finally gotten the whole thing to fit on her driver's license and state identification card. Janice 'Lokelani' has a surname that consists of 35 letters plus an okina, a mark used in the Hawaiian alphabet. She received her new license and ID after her campaign to get her full name on the cards prompted the state Department of Transportation to change its policy to expand the number of characters that can appear. Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele, 54, said Monday that she's happy she was able to help fix the problem of identification cards lacking sufficient space for long names.

'Now, in the state of Hawaii, we are no longer second class citizens because of the length of our name,' she said. Hawaii driver's licenses and ID cards previously had room for names totaling up to 35 characters. The new policy allows 40 characters for last names, 40 for first names and 35 for middle names. Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele got the name when she married her Hawaiian husband in 1992. He used only the one name, which his grandfather gave him after it came to him in a dream. Ms Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele - who got her name after marrying in 1992 - said that her name had many layers of meanings including 'one who would stand up and get people to focus in one direction when there was chaos and confusion, and help them emerge from disorder'. She said it can also mean 'When . there is chaos and confusion, you are one that will stand up and get . people to focus in one direction and come out of the chaos.' The woman said her husband, who died in 2008, had similar issues with documentation. She said: 'He always had problems with trying to get people to use his whole name. 'They would chop it up into smaller pieces.' Hawaiian home: Keihanaikukauakahihulihe'ekahaunaele at her home in Ocean View, Hawaii .

At least one person has been killed as residents in Queensland and New South Wales are put on high alert over the state of 12 rivers. Australia's coal industry, concentrated in the region, is said to be largely unaffected, easing concern about a repeat of last year's disastrous floods that sent global coal prices soaring. Scroll down for video... Evacuation: Thousands of Australians were today forced to abandon their homes as the worst floodwater for 35 years continued to rise in St George . Salvage operation: Stephen Edgley is seen removing damaged household goods from his grandmother's home in Mitchell, Queensland, after it was hit by floods . But heavy rain is expected to take its toll on the region's agriculture, particularly on cotton, sugarcane, soybean and corn. Almost 4,000 people were evacuated from the Queensland town of St George, where flooding is expected to reach a record level of 45ft or higher, state police said. Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said: 'We're hearing from people whose families have lived on the property for 100 or more years who've never seen water in their homes who have now got water up to the roof. 'So we know that something that's never been seen before is on its way.' Inspection: A muddy-footed John Pallisier surveys the damage caused by floodwaters to his home in Mitchell, Queensland . Devastated: Families had to remove all their belonging from flooded homes in Mitchell, Queensland . St George was also hit in 2011, when flash floods across Queensland and New South Wales killed about 35 people, swamped 30,000 houses, and wiped out roads, bridges and rail lines. The flooding across the two states this year has resulted in tens of thousands of people being cut off in the last few days, with some having to battle with deadly snakes as they scrambled for dry ground. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has forecast that flooding will continue for weeks in some areas. The town of Moree, the centre of the New South Wales' cotton industry was cut in half by record floodwaters, and some estimated that each farm in the area could lose hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of crops. Prediction: The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has forecast that flooding will continue for weeks in some areas . Carnage: The aerial view of the floods that have hit the St George area . Australia is the world's largest coal exporter and accounts for roughly two-thirds of global trade of coking coal, used for steel production. The 2011 floods pushed up global coal prices as production was brought to a near standstill. Queensland Resources Council chief executive Michael Roche said: 'The coal mines themselves are not experiencing any difficulties. So far, the Queensland coal industry, as far as we are aware, has missed the flooding.' On Friday, Whitehaven Coal said it had shut four mines because of heavy rain, but the mines were not flooded and no equipment had been damaged. Do you really need the sign? A notice telling drivers that the road is closed due to flooding is almost itself submerged under water . Rescue: Flood victims are pictured being evacuated from their homes near Charleville in Queensland state . Global miner Xstrata said there was no impact on its operations. Spokesman Kathryn Lamond said: 'It's business as usual.' But the industry was still concerned about disruption if there was no let-up in the rain and more flooding, Roche said. Many mines are still carrying significant volumes of water from last year's floods, so more heavy rain is a danger. Storm damage was estimated to have cut Australia's commodity-weighted economy's gross domestic product growth by A$20 billion, or 1.5 per cent, in the 2010-2011 financial year.","At least one killed as waters rise in Queensland and New South Wales .

Debenhams issued a profit warning today following a nightmare Christmas which forced it to launch early sales and deep discounts. Britain’s second-biggest department store group said profits are expected to be down by 26 per cent in the first half of its financial year to around £85million. The chain is slashing prices by 70 per cent in its January sale in a desperate attempt to shift Christmas stock. Its share price fell more than 10 per cent in early trading today, wiping £140 million off its stock market value. Birthday blues: Debenhams, which celebrated its 200th birthday this Christmas, has warned of a 26 per cent profits plunge as a hoped-for sales surge failed to materialise . City analyst believe sales in many leading chains were below expectations over the crucial festive trading period. As a result, shares in the likes of Marks & Spencer, Next, Primark, Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons have all been marked down in recent days. Debenhams’ bosses described festive trading as ‘extremely difficult’ and competitive with a large number of early sales. They said: ‘We did not experience the anticipated final surge in sales in the last week of the period and as a result we expect the need for additional markdown to clear stock in January and February.’ The five-year cost of living squeeze, bad weather and a shift to internet shopping appear to have combined to pile pressure on retailers who rely on their bricks and mortar outlets. Major retailers were effectively forced to bring forward their sales and bargain promotions ahead of Christmas during what one industry insider described at the time as ‘a bit or a blood bath’. Debenhams and House of Fraser ran a series of one day sales and promotions in a bid to tempt shoppers. John Lewis was dragged into the fray under its price match promise. As a result, the value of sales through John Lewis department stores is likely to have been hit. Bosses at Marks & Spencer felt they had no choice but to run a 30per cent off ‘Magic and Sparkle Spectacular’ on the last Saturday before Christmas. It was the first time it had run such a wide-ranging promotion since the financial crisis was at its height in 2008. Other leading chains like Gap and Laura Ashley also ran deep price cuts ahead of Christmas. Weather woes: Debenhams blamed bad weather for having an impact on clothing sales, which fell over the 17-week period to December 28. Debenhams chief executive, Michael Sharp, said: ‘The market was highly promotional in the run-up to Christmas and we responded to these conditions to ensure our offer was competitive. ‘However, this extremely difficult environment has inevitably had an impact on both our sales and profitability. ‘Looking forward, I expect conditions to remain highly competitive as we enter 2014. Everyone in the organisation is focused on improving performance and growing the business.’ He described the scene on high streets ahead of Christmas as a ‘sea of red’ – referring to the garish red sale banners that appeared in windows. The firm’s website did achieve some successes with sales of beauty, home and gift products up by 17per cent on a year ago. The chain is currently running what it calls its biggest ever half-price sale across the store in order to shift unsold Christmas stock. The group told the City that pre-tax profits for the first half of its financial year are now expected to fall to £85 million from £114.7 million the year before. The gloomy trading update comes days after reports that Debenhams was under pressure to axe finance chief Simon Herrick amid shareholder concern over his performance. Mr Herrick has been under fire over a so-called ‘Santa tax’ letter hitting suppliers with demands for discounts days before Christmas. Retail analyst Andrew Wade said: ‘It looks like they’ve obviously had a very challenging Christmas period. While this is obviously a very disappointing update we don’t necessarily expect this to be repeated across the retail space.’ Meanwhile Sterling was up one cent today against the dollar at 1.65 US dollars, approaching a three-year high. It has also strengthened by a cent against the single currency to 1.20 euros. The FTSE 100 Index ended 2013 on a high, climbing 17.8 points to 6749.1 before closing at lunchtime. It left the benchmark index less than 200 points below its all-time peak of more than a decade ago and is 14 per cent ahead over the course of the year. Analysts and investors have predicted London's top flight will crash through the 7,000 level during 2014.","Store says its profits will drop by 26% to just £85m for past six months .

Elias Acevedo, 49 pleaded guilty to 297 charges in total after previously confessed to the kidnapping, rape and murder of two women in a Cleveland neighborhood in the early 1990s, as well as repeatedly sexually assaulting his own daughters. The disturbed man was sentenced to 445 years in prison without the possibility of parole, WKYC reported. Scroll down for video . Locked up for life: Convicted sex offender Elias Acevedo Sr. sobs Monday between his attorneys during his sentencing and will serve life in prison as part of a plea agreement . An emotional scene: Tonia Adkins, left, sister of victim Christina Adkins, and Mary Adkins (at the podium) stepmother of Christina, read a statement directed at convicted sex offender Elias Acevedo Sr., who can be seen crying in the background . The convicted sex offender wept Monday in court as the tortured girls, now adults, spoke in court about how their father destroyed their childhood. 'You have changed my life forever,' one daughter said, according to the Cleveland Plain-Dealer. 'You robbed me of my childhood... I have lived in fear but I will no longer.' His sister-in-law also spoke in court about the evil man - she was raped 20 years ago when only 18-years-old and more than five months pregnant. 'I am grateful I can stand here today as one of his survivors,' she said. 'Back then I was the coward, but I'm not a coward anymore.' Their attacker apologized for his horrific crimes after the families of Ms Pemberton and Ms Adkins also spoke. 'I can't describe the regret and shame I have for what I've done,' he said. 'I wish I could bring your daughters back.' The predator then wept again as his sentence was read aloud in court - life in prison without parole. Day in court: Elias Acevedo, shown here during a previous court appearance, pleaded guilty Monday to 297 counts including murder, rape and kidnapping . Confession: Elias Acevedo has confessed to raping and killing two women in the mid-90s . He has agreed to work with the FBI to help prevent crimes similar to his from happening in the future, according to the Plain-Dealer. Mr Acevedo initially landed in court after being charged . with the kidnapping, rape and murder of 30-year-old Pamela Pemberton who . was found strangled in 1994, and Christina Adkins, who was 18 and five . months pregnant at the time of her disappearance in 1995. He initially only faced charges in those cases, but investigators soon discovered he had raped several more victims. including underage children - he faced hundreds of counts by the time the investigation was concluded. Monday's guilty plea finally brings some level of closure to the families of Christina Adkins and Pamela Pemberton. Acevedo lived on the same block as sadistic Castro during the 1990s. Castro died while serving a life sentence, plus 1,000 years, and was found with his trousers round his ankles after dying while indulging in auto-erotic asphyxiation. Following the discovery of Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus, who had been missing for 10 years, languishing in the basement of Castro's home, there was a renewed focus on missing persons cold cases. 'Because the public became more aware and investigators were determined and relentless, people were re-interviewed and there was an increased interest in these missing person cases,' FBI spokeswoman Vicki Anderson said. When police questioned Castro's neighbors, it was discovered that Acevedo was a convicted sex offender and hadn't reported his address to police. Locals: Christina Adkins (left) and Pamela Pemberton (right) both went missing in the mid-90s . Neighborhood: Cuyahoga County Sheriff deputies patrol the neighborhood outside Ariel Castro's home in Cleveland in May, the same block where Acevedo lived . Acevedo was arrested on June 11 in connection with a 1993 rape case after a rape kit taken at the time was tested for DNA evidence. According to Cleveland.com, the woman Acevedo raped in 1993 was his brother's common-law wife. She dropped the charges against him because he had seven children and twins on the way at the time. Tragic: Christina Adkins was 18 and five months pregnant when she was murdered by Acevedo . When detectives spoke with her about Acevedo this year, they were able to start building up a profile of his behavior, which involved strangling, keeping the underwear of his victims and a tendency to return to certain geographical areas. The 1993 rape occurred close to the spot where his neighbor Pemberton's body was found in 1994. Pamela Pemberton was found dead in a field on West 11th Street, near Clark Field, by three youths going to school October 24, 1994. Homicide detectives said Pemberton had been strangled and was found naked. She had been going to meet a friend at a bar and never returned home. Acevedo was then linked to the 1995 disappearance of Adkins, who was last seen close to Acevedo's home. A spokesman for the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office said that Acevedo has confessed to the murders, which means authorities will not seek the death penalty. Victims: Christina Adkins (left) and Pamela Pemberton (right) were murdered within a few months of each other . The Guardian reports that Acevedo led detectives to the spot where he dumped Adkins' body in a manhole under a busy highway overpass on the Ohio city’s west side. Remains recovered from the manhole were sent for DNA testing and test results today proved the remains were those of Adkins. Acevedo has a long criminal history that dates back to 1988, including theft, receiving stolen property and a 2003 rape and kidnapping case for which he served three years in prison. The 293-count indictment, unsealed Thursday, charged Acevedo with aggravated murder, as well as 173 counts of rape, 115 counts of kidnapping and one count of gross sexual imposition.

Death: Rachel Osei, the teen mother who died in a ball of flames in New Malden, Surrey . The family of a teenage mother who died after running from her house engulfed in flames believe she died as the result of a tragic accident. Rachel Osei, 18, was heard screaming in agony as she ran from her home in New Malden, Surrey, before collapsing and dying at a level crossing on West Barnes Lane. The 18-year-old was studying to be a PE teacher at St Mary’s University in Twickenham and was mother to four-year-old son Kai. Her distraught brother, Justin, 20, said his younger sister was 'always dancing' and believes Sunday’s incident was a 'tragic accident', rather than self-inflicted. The law student from Colliers Wood, south west London, paid tribute to his sister: 'Rachel was very funny and outgoing. She loved dancing and was always doing it and was a really good drummer. 'She enjoyed sports as well and wanted to be a PE teacher. 'She was a really good mum, her son was always dressed well and was happy. 'When she had him she was young but dealt with it really well. She did well at school and got good GCSEs, which allowed her to stay on for A-Levels. 'Rachel was ambitious and always wanted to go to university and do well for her son. 'She was always happy and I’ll always remember whenever we had a family photo, we both would pull the silliest face so every picture we have when we were younger is us being silly. 'We grew up together with my mum, who is devastated. Rachel moved out when she was about 17 but used to come and visit all the time as her friends are all still in the area. 'I know some people are saying what happened is self-inflicted but it was a tragic accident. The fire started by accident and it caught on her clothes but I can’t say anything else about it.

'She was her usual, happy self and was excited because she was trying to pass her driving test. 'We have always been outgoing, like listening to music and dancing around, but Rachel especially. 'The . way people cared for Rachel around here was very loving and she had a . lot of people in the community helping her with her son and buying him . things. 'She had a lot of friends and a lot of love to give.' The London Ambulance Service, the London Fire Brigade and the Met police were called to the level crossing at around 1.10am on Sunday, but Rachel was pronounced dead at 1.45am. A post mortem carried out yesterday at St George’s Hospital gave the cause of death as burns and inhalation of fire fumes. Police say her death is being treated as unexplained, but early indications suggest it is not suspicious.

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 06:54 EST, 31 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:26 EST, 31 December 2013 . A four-year-old boy who was too young for life-saving heart surgery was kept alive by a rubber band until he was ready for the operation. George Slater, who was born with a hole in his heart, finally underwent the surgery earlier this year - and when he came round from anaesthetic, the cheeky boy's first words to his family were 'boobies and knickers'. His family has now paid tribute to the pioneering device which saved his life by reducing the size of an artery and helping him breathe properly. Miracle: George Slater was kept alive for four years by a rubber band in his pulmonary artery . When George was just a few months old and struggling to put on weight, doctors discovered that he was suffering from a hole in his heart as well as an enlarged artery which affected his breathing by putting pressure on his lungs. They believed he was too small for the surgery he would need to correct the faults, so they fitted a rubber band around the artery to reduce its size. The band could be easily adjusted by pointing a remote control at the boy's chest, meaning that its size changed as George grew older, avoiding the need for it to be manually adjusted. It was finally removed by doctors during a 12-hour operation in October at Liverpool's Alder Hey Hospital intended to repair his heart. Relief: George, pictured with brother Jack and parents Tim and Laura, has finally undergone the heart surgery . The FloWatch was invented by children's heart surgeon Antonio Corno of Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool as a way of helping children who need heart surgery but are too young. Pulmonary artery banding - essentially a rubber band wrapped round the artery to reduce its size - has long been used to control serious heart conditions in children waiting for operations. However, as the children grow older they often need the exact size of the band to be adjusted several times, which has previously required surgery. The FloWatch is controlled by a remote device which sends a radio signal instantly changing the size of the band without the need for further surgical intervention.The size is changed by a tiny motor and piston clipped to the band, which can either tighten or loosen the device as necessary. His mother Laura, from Whittingham in Lancashire, said: 'They wanted to wait until George was bigger so his heart would be bigger, making it a less risky procedure. 'Your heart is the size of your fist, and George had tiny fists so the operation would have been very intricate. 'Before this invention, George would have had to have surgery each time the band needed to be expanded, and he would have faced at least four or five operations by now. 'But instead, it took about 30 seconds to adjust the FloWatch with the remote control. They just put the remote control on George's chest to expand the band.' When the boy's parents first noticed that something was wrong, doctors sent him to Alder Hey where specialists discovered the hole in his heart. In addition, George's pulmonary artery was 3cm wide instead of 1cm, putting too much pressure on his heart and lungs. At home: George is now recovering at his home in Lancashire alongside six-year-old brother Jack . Mrs Slater said: 'Doctors had warned us that there was a 15 per cent chance that George would not make it through the surgery. 'The surgeon told us that for difficulty, he rated George's surgery as 9.5 out of 10.' He was in theatre for eight and a half hours, but then had to be rushed back for another three and a half hours after doctors realised he was suffering from internal bleeding. 'George is a cheeky little character and he loves making people laugh and telling jokes - particularly rude ones!', his mother said. 'The nurse just fell about laughing when he came out with his first words.' After a week in hospital, George is now recovering at home with his six-year-old brother Jack, and is healthier than ever before. Mrs Slater added: 'It has been a real rollercoaster for the whole family and we are thrilled that the heart surgery has been done, as that is all we have been gearing up to for the last few years.'","George Slater was born with an enlarged artery and a hole in his heart .

Revelation: Bernard Gray, chief of defence material, enjoyed a chauffeur-driven car and trips abroad . A leading figure in the Ministry of Defence has claimed more than £100,000 expenses in his first year of work, it has been revealed. Bernard Gray, who was appointed to help manage the budget, enjoyed 106 stays in London and Bristol hotels, for £23,000, despite his home being less than a 60-mile drive from both. He was also given an official car and chauffeur, costing the department £65,531. Official documents, seen by the Sunday People, reveal he also spent £17,929 on planes and trains, and £280 in taxis in 2011-2012. In the months since, he has spent £14,457 travelling abroad. Mr Gray, who earns £220,00 a year as Chief of Defence Material, was taken on in 2010 to help target waste in the department. But the former journalist, who was a defence advisor for Tony Blair's administration, spent a third of his nights between January and October 2011 in hotels. Although the official limit on London hotel stays for civil servants is £135 a night, Mr Gray has been a guest at the £360-a-night, five-star Sofitel London St James hotel in Pall Mall. The details follow news earlier this month that MoD officials collectively spent £110million on hotels between 2009 and 2013, a further £69million on cars, and £3,000 on Sky Sports. Andrew Manley, chief executive of the Defence Infrastructure Organisation, claimed £5,500 for nearly 50 nights at the luxury New Hall Hotel and Spa in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. Mr Manley, also paid around £200,000 a year,  spent 47 nights at the . £155-a-night, four star spa, despite it being less than two miles from . DIO headquarters which the MoD said he visited from his London office. In the new year, Whitehall (pictured) will launch the biggest round of cuts on the Armed Forces since WWII . The Sky Sports contract was bought for one small unit in Northwood, . Hertfordshire, so that it could monitor 'global 24-hour news feeds'. The revelations have sparked outrage as the Ministry of Defence prepares to cut billions of pounds in their budget, and make thousands of servicemen redundant. Blasted: Andrew Manley claimed £5,500 for 47 hotel stays at a four-star hotel . It is the biggest cut to the armed forces since the end . of the Second World War, with troop numbers being reduced, pay being . cut, and tanks, jets and warships being scrapped.

Revelations: A concerning number of  law-enforcement agents have criminal records, according to a memo addressed to State Deputy Inspector General Harold Geisel . A concerning number of State Department law-enforcement agents have criminal records or checkered backgrounds, according to memo. Around two thousands agents  in State’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security can play only limited . roles in the agency due to their previous form, reported the New York Post. The revelation is the latest disclosure in a series of scandals which are threatening to to engulf the bureau. The whistleblower's memo, obtained by the New York Post, was written to  State Deputy Inspector General Harold Geisel from a team leader in the IG’s Office. The person asserts that the hiring process is flawed and holds implications for the bureau. 'Department intakes of new . . . officers since the hiring surge a decade ago have reportedly been flawed, with ‘mitigation’ of troubling histories including criminal matters, wrote the team leader. The damning memo adds that some Diplomatic Security field offices 'have major problems just waiting to be discovered.' Yesterday an internal memo claimed the State Department called off an investigation into allegations that U.S. Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman repeatedly trawled overseas public parks in search of prostitutes, including minors. Undersecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy ordered the investigation closed shortly after it was opened, according to the memo, which was written by the State Department Inspector General's office. Gutman, who has not been charged with any crimes, said the allegations are 'baseless.' 'I am angered and saddened by the baseless allegations that have appeared in the press and to watch the four years I have proudly served in Belgium smeared is devastating,' Gutman, 56, told MailOnline in an e-mailed statement. 'I live on a beautiful park in Brussels that you walk through to get to many  locations and at no point have I ever engaged in any improper activity.' United States Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman is pictured with his wife, Michelle Loewinger, in April 2013. An internal State Department memo claims that he was investigated on allegations that he solicited prostitutes . The case against Gutman, a top Obama donor, was being investigated by the Special Investigations Division, an independent investigative arm of the Diplomatic Security Service. The investigating agent 'had . determined that the ambassador routinely ditched his protective security . detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and . minor children,' states the memo obtained by MailOnline. 'As the agent began to plan . surveillance on the ambassador to obtain corroboration, the agent . reportedly received notification that [Kennedy] had directed [the State Department's IG] to . cease the investigation and have the agent return to Washington.' Gutman is a top donor to President Obama, having raised a total of $775,000 for his 2008 campaign and inauguration committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. A native New Yorker and son of a Holocaust survivor, he has been married to his wife, Michelle Loewinger, since 1981. He is adored by Belgians, who dubbed him . in 2011 'the Ambassador who makes us love America again.' One Belgian . newspaper has even claimed that he could handily win an election if he . ran for office there. The case against Gutman is just one . in a series of supposed State Department coverups outlined in the memo, which was first reported by CBS News' John Miller. Gutman (center) is adored by Belgians, who dubbed him in 2011 'the Ambassador who makes us love America again' Secretary of State John Kerry is puctured with Gutman and his wife at their residence in Brussels, Belgium, on April 22, 2013 . The U.S. embassy in Brussels (left) sits on a 32-acre park (right) that is also the site of the Royal Palace of Brussels and the Belgian parliament . The incidents were also cited in a November 2012 draft of a report by the Office of the Inspector General on the performance of the Diplomatic Security Service. The report obtained by MailOnline stated that senior government officials were 'protecting favored [Diplomatic Security] rising stars from criminal charges or from embarrassing revelations that could harm a promising career.' July 8, 1956: Howard Gutman is born in New York, New York . 1977: Graduates Columbia University . 1980: Graduates magna cum laude from Harvard Law School . Oct. 3, 1981: Marries Michelle Phyllis Loewinger in Long Island . 1982: Joins Washington, D.C. law firm Williams & Connolly LLP . 1985: Becomes special assistant to FBI Director William H.

Aug. 14, 2009: Sworn in as ambassador to Belgium . May 2011: Accused by a Diplomatic Security investigator of having 'ditched' his private security detail on a regular basis to pursue sexual favors from prostitutes and minors . 'Such interventions take place often enough that several sources in the Department who regularly see [Special Investigations Division] cases summed the situation up with almost identical words: DS should never investigate DS,' the report continued. But those sentences, as well as all . references to the investigations that were detailed in the memo, were removed from . a final draft of the report - which was issued in March 2013 - at the . request of Diplomatic Security's top brass. At a December 14, 2012 meeting, . Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell . requested that the information be omitted from the final report, . according to notes from the meeting obtained by MailOnline. 'He proposed that the subject ""should . be withheld"" from the inspection report until INV's process determines . if ""there is something there,""' the meeting notes stated. 'Boswell . said putting the subject in the report would ""generally damage DS,"" would ""probably damage the Department,"" and would be used by ""every . defense lawyer around.""' In addition to the Gutman case, State Department officials also reportedly manipulated an investigation into . the 'endemic' hiring of prostitutes among agents belonging to former . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's security detail. The memo states that seven . security agents were accused of paying for sex while traveling with Clinton . overseas. Two agents confessed to the deeds while a third 'stated he . paid for services that were ultimately not received.' An internal memo has revealed that members of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's security detail were investigated for engaging prostitutes while on official trips in foreign countries . In . one instance, State Department superiors allowed an offending agent to . continue his role in securing a Moscow hotel 'despite obvious . counterintelligence issues.' Investigators . later uncovered evidence against four more agents and concluded that . the prostitution problem within Clinton's security detail was 'endemic.' As punishment, three agents were removed from the security detail and reassigned elsewhere. But further investigation into the remaining four agents was stopped by senior officials, 'despite the possibility of counterintelligence issues,' according to the memo. The document also references an 'underground drug ring' operating near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad may have been providing drugs to U.S. security contractors, including one who died of a methadone overdose. The memo was brought to light by Aurelia Fedenisn, a former investigator for the State Department Inspector General. She says is sharing the memo with the media to shed light on how internal investigations are influenced by the State Department. She told CBS that investigators . expect some influence but that 'the degree to which that influence . existed and how high up it went, was very disturbing.' Secretary of State John Kerry pauses during a joint news conference with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, Monday, June 3, 2013, at the State Department in Washington . State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki pushed back against the allegations in the memo during a press briefing on Monday. The 'notion that we would not vigorously pursue criminal misconduct in a case, any case, is preposterous,' she said. 'We take allegations of misconduct seriously and we investigate thoroughly. All cases mentioned in the CBS report were thoroughly investigated or under investigation.' Psaki added that the State Department has responded specifically to the Inspector General's claims that its investigations are being influenced. 'The department has responded to the recommendations in the [Inspector General's] report,' she added. 'Diplomatic Security has taken the further step of requesting additional review by outside experience law enforcement officers on top of the [Inspector General's] inspection so that officers with law enforcement experience can make expert assessments about our current procedures.'","Revelations made in memo to State Deputy Inspector General Harold Geisel .

"By . Wil Longbottom . UPDATED: . 07:43 EST, 3 January 2012 . Iran has threatened to take action if a U.S. aircraft carrier returns to the Persian Gulf. The USS John C. Stennis, along with another vessel, left the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz last week after Iran launched a series of military exercises. Tehran has also threatened shutting the strait - through which 40 per cent of the world's traded oil is shipped - if foreign powers impose sanctions on its crude exports. Bravado: A medium-range missile is fired from a ship during Velayat-90 war game in the Strait of Hormuz yesterday . Warning: This anti-ship missile can be seen streaking through the sky. Iran today warned the U.S. not to return an aircraft carrier to the Gulf . Speaking at the end of 10 days of naval exercises today, General Ataollah Salehi said: 'Iran will not repeat its warning... the enemy's carrier has been moved to the Sea of Oman because of our drill. 'I advise, recommend and warn them [the Americans] over the return of this carrier to the Persian Gulf because we are not in the habit of warning more than once.' Gen Salehi did not name the vessel, or give details of the action Iran would take if it does return. Force: The Nimitz-class USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier sailed through the Strait of Hormutz last week after visiting Jebel Ali port in Dubai . The USS John C. Stennis is one of the U.S. Navy's largest vessels. It had been on a 'routine' passage through the Gulf after visiting Dubai's Jebel Ali port last Tuesday. Iran has staged a series of naval . exercises at the mouth of the Gulf, including the test-firing of three . missiles designed to sink warships and 'mock' drills on shutting the . strategic waterway. Security: A long-range Qader shore-to-sea missile is launched during military exercises. Tehran has promised to respond if the USS John C. Stennis returns . Concerns: The missile disappears in a plume of fire on the Sea of Oman shore. The West has become increasingly worried about Iran's nuclear programme . The U.S. keeps at least one aircraft carrier in or near the Gulf at all times, on rotations of weeks or months. Its Fifth Fleet is based in the state of Bahrain, and has insisted it will not allow shipping to be disrupted in the strait. It comes after mounting criticism over Iran's nuclear programme. Tehran denies western accusations that it is secretly trying to build atomic bombs, claiming it needs nuclear technology to generate electricity. Earlier today, French foreign minister Alain Juppe said Iran was continuing to develop nuclear weapons and called for stronger sanctions. 'Iran is pursuing the development of nuclear arms, I have no doubt about it,' he told French television I-Tele. 'The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency is quite explicit on this point.' The U.S. and Israel have not ruled out military action against Iran if diplomacy fails to resolve the nuclear row. The EU is considering following the U.S. in banning imports of Iranian crude oil. President Barack Obama signed new sanctions against the Middle East country on Saturday, stepping up the pressure by adding sanctions on financial institutions that deal with Iran's central bank.","USS John C.

"By . Chris Pleasance . PUBLISHED: . 04:16 EST, 9 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:25 EST, 26 December 2013 . Pope Francis has spoken about how a nun saved his life while he was suffering from a lung condition aged 21 . He is the spiritual healer for millions across the globe, but now Pope Francis has revealed that his life was saved by a nun when he was just 21. While in hospital with a recurring lung problem, the pontiff says his doctor was not prescribing him enough antibiotics. However his life was saved by a nun who instinctively tripled his dose, a feat the Pope puts down to her working on the front line and being with the sick every day. The remarks were made in a new book, I Fioretti di Papa Francesco, (The Little Flowers of Pope Francis), in which Pope Francis talks to Andrea Tornielli, a veteran Vatican journalist. The former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio's condition came to light during his Papal election in March this year, after his predecessor became the first Pope in 600 years to retire due to poor health. Francis reportedly had three cysts on his lung, before having part of the organ removed, though Vatican officials have always said they have seen him in nothing other than good health. Speaking to The Telegraph, Mr Tornielli agreed. He said: 'His health is good and he shows great stamina. He works many hours a day and spends many hours a week greeting people in St . Peter’s Square in the freezing cold.' Mr Tornielli also revealed how Pope Francis made a personal phone call to a woman whose son is addicted to drugs after she passed a note written on a napkin to one of his officials. The incident happened at Bueno Aires airport, after which Francis called the woman and said he would pray for her and her son. Francis's condition was thrown under the spotlight during his Papal election in March after his predecessor, Emeritus Pope Benedict, retired due to poor health . Proving that Francis has always been a man of the people, the book also recounts how he dined with the poor while he was archbishop of Buenos Aires. After eating with the Pope, one man told the author: 'He looked me in the eyes and said to me: ""I like to sit at the tables of the poor because they serve food and share with their hearts.""' In another chapter, Francis reveals how he took a strong stand when priest Father 'Pepe’ Jose Maria di Paolo received death threats over his work with drug addicts. The former archbishop defended him, insisting that he would rather be killed than see any of his priests suffer.","Pope Francis reportedly suffered from cysts on his lung .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:15 EST, 25 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:50 EST, 25 December 2013 . The federal website has revealed that it received 2 million visits on Monday, and heavy - but not as heavy - traffic on Tuesday after announcing a later enrollment deadline. A White House spokeswoman said there was no immediate estimate of visitors or how many succeeded in obtaining insurance before the deadline, nor did they explain who will receive the extension and how long they will be given to try again before facing fines. It was . the administration's latest attempt to move the goalposts as it tries to . recover from technical failures and political missteps that dogged the . enrollment drive after it opened on October 1. Trying to make . up for lost time, the administration has announced a series of . last-minute changes and delays to get as many people as possible covered . under the Affordable Care Act. A computer screen reads, 'Enroll by Dec. 23 for coverage starting as soon as Jan 1' Before Monday's rush, more than 1 million people had . signed up for private coverage through HealthCare.gov - which serves 36 . states - and 14 state-run marketplaces, according to state and federal . estimates. The figure, though likely to climb by Christmas, is . still short of previous estimates that 7 million people could enroll by . the end of March, the last date to obtain health insurance coverage in . 2014. About one-third or more will need to be young, healthy adults . whose payments into the system would help offset the costs of covering . older, sicker people. 'Sometimes despite your best efforts, you . might have run into delays caused by heavy traffic to HealthCare.gov, . maintenance periods, or other issues with our systems that prevented you . from finishing the process on time,' Tuesday's blog post on . HealthCare.gov said. 'If this happened to you, don't worry - we still . may be able to help you get covered as soon as January 1.' The . problematic rollout of the health law known as Obamacare, which was . passed in 2010 and survived legal challenges, helped send Obama's . popularity ratings to record lows and stepped up Republican efforts to . gut the law and use it against Democrats in 2014 congressional . elections. Trying to make it work: President Obama, seen here at his last press conference of the year, has dedicated much of his presidency to enacting the health care legislation and Republican rivals plan to run against it in the midterms . The more recent changes, which the administration . has said are intended to show flexibility, have introduced a new element . of confusion for consumers as well as the health insurance companies . who have been pressed by the government to allow new members to pay, and . even sign up, past January 1 for retroactive coverage. So far the . industry has agreed to extend the first payment deadline to January 10. 'Health . plans will continue to do everything they can to help consumers through . the enrollment process and to mitigate potential confusion or . disruption caused by all of these last minute changes to the rules and . deadlines,' said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for American's Health . Insurance Plans, an industry trade and lobbying group. Elva Garcia (L) and Jorge Codevila were two of the millions who tried to sign up for the health care program before the first deadline of December 23, but that was later pushed back to December 24 . The . Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to be enrolled in coverage . by March 31 or face penalties that start at $95. This week's deadline, . which had already been moved to December 23 from December 15, applied to . coverage starting on January 1. Last week, the administration . said people whose plans were canceled because they did not meet new . standards of coverage under the law would qualify for a 'hardship' exemption that allows some people to avoid a penalty for not signing up . for health insurance. Several state-run exchanges have also moved . their enrollment deadlines. New York and California, two of the . largest, added a one-day grace period similar to the federal insurance . marketplace. Massachusetts said on Tuesday it would allow sign-ups until . December 31 given heavy volume and technical problems that have . hampered its exchange. Rhode Island, Oregon and Maryland had already . extended their deadlines beyond Christmas.","The Obama administration gave users an extra day to sign up for the President's signature health insurance after computer problems .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 22:02 EST, 25 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:27 EST, 31 December 2013 . Made for TV: The move to use the Antiquities Act as a way to buy private property and turn it into national parks was a plotline in The West Wing . A Republican member of Congress slammed the Obama . administration Monday for creating five new national monuments when the US . federal government is struggling under the weight of a mandated austerity plan. When the so-called budget sequester, a trigger mechanism . built into the failed 2012 congressional budget talks, kicked in, most federal . agencies were forced into across-the-board budget cuts. This includes the . Department of the Interior, whose National Park Service maintains and operates . national parks and monuments. The Obama administration has cited the sequester-based austerity program in closing the White House to public tours, a move that Republicans have called needless and silly. But the president created five new monuments Monday in a signing . ceremony announced just four days earlier. 'By designating these national . monuments today, we will ensure they will continue to inspire and be enjoyed by . generations of Americans to come,' he said. The White House emphasized that the new designations 'were . made with bi-partisan support from congressional, state and local officials, . local businesses and other stakeholders and are expected to promote economic . growth.' But Doc Hastings, a congressman from the state of Washington . who chairs the powerful House Natural Resources Committee, lashed out, countering that it was wrong to create new government expenditures . while the administration was already creating controversy with cuts to . constituent services. Making moves: The President created the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument in Maryland, as one of five national monuments he created using the obscure law . 'President Obama has closed the White House to public tours . but he's unilaterally ordering the National Park Service to spend scarce dollars . on little-known, privately owned property in Delaware,' Hastings said. Vice President Biden will travel to that Delaware site on . Tuesday, along with Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and Senator Tom . Carper. The newly designated First State National Monument is in New Castle, . Delaware. Officials from the Department of the Interior insisted . Monday that the cost of operating five new national monuments would be small. One official told MailOnline that compared to the . department's $12.2 billion overall budget, 'a couple million - probably tens of . millions - doesn't seem like much.' Crying foul: Congressman Doc Hastings says that the decision will cost too much money and only help five states . Hastings also sniped that Obama was abusing the Antiquities . Act, a 1906 law intended to give presidents the power to save historically . significant sites from destruction. The president, he said, was 'dictat[ing] under a century-old . law that the government spend money it doesn’t have on property it doesn’t even . own' and 'acting on simple whim.' 'No imminent threat of destruction or harm is posed at any . of these five locations,' he said. 'Especially troubling are the inclusion of private property . in these new monuments and the lack of transparency that surrounds monument . designations where the White House and President work in secret and are able to . thwart public review, public comment and consideration of environmental and . economic impacts.' Hastings' concerns about the Antiquities Act drew parallels . to an episode of the popular TV drama The West Wing. In an episode during the now-defunct show's eighth season, the fictional . Democratic President Jed Bartlet used the law to turn a contested piece of land . into a national park. Taking cues? The move was the plotline of a former West Wing episode where fictional president Jed Bartlet (right) did the same thing . In the storyline, Republicans holding up a banking reform . law agreed to drop their objections if federal lands in Montana were opened to . commercial strip mining. Bartlet agreed, but double-crossed them by using the . Antiquities Act to put the land out of reach - after he signed the banking bill . into law. In the real White House Principal White House Deputy Press . Secretary Josh Earnest fielded questions from reporters Monday, saying that . 'these kinds of designations are important both for, in some cases, for the . local economy in these communities. ... you can see local economies growing up . around the designation of these properties that as visitors come to enjoy these . new national monuments that will have a stimulative impact on the local . economies.' Earnest also said that 'a lot of the land for these new . national monuments was either land that was already owned by the federal . government or it was donated. And in terms of the immediate costs in terms of . the management of the land, I think they’re pretty minimal in the early . stages.. ' 'But certainly future budgets that the administration will . offer will reflect the acquisition of these new properties.' The Conservation Fund, a private organization, donated land . to create parts of two of the national monuments Obama created Monday, in . Delaware and Maryland. The other three sites are in Ohio, New Mexico and the . state of Washington.","New taxpayer-funded Park Service sites designated in five states .

A liberal magazine in Washington, D.C. has published secretly recorded audio of a strategy session, in which Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell McConnell's aides discussed how to use actress Ashley Judd's history of mental illness against her in a political opposition strategy. The recording includes McConnell's voice, advising his staffers that 'this is the ""Whac-A-Mole"" period of the campaign,' referring to the popular carnival game involving a foam sledgehammer and a series of underground rodents. 'When anybody sticks their head up, do them out.' Other meeting participants said Judd was 'emotionally unbalanced,' that she had 'suicidal tendencies,' and that she 'described having children as selfish.' Judd was also openly hostile to 'traditional Christianity,' the meeting heard. McConnell campaign director Jesse Benton told MailOnline that the campaign has asked the FBI to investigate. The February 2 conversation was part . of a 'private senior strategist meeting, with a very small number of . attendees,' Benton said. 'A ""family meeting,"" if you will.' Asked for a . specific number, Benton said 'about half a dozen' people were in the . room. 'The recording clearly came form some . sort of recording or listening device planted in our office without . permission,' he said. 'We'll see what the FBI finds.' SCROLL DOWN FOR AUDIO . Actress Ashley Judd read off vote totals from the state of Tennessee - not Kentucky - during the presidential roll call vote at the Democratic National Convention in 2012 . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky tod his aides to play 'Whac-a-Mole' with Judd, a potential rival who ultimately decided not to run against him . The liberal muckraking magazine Mother Jones published the 11-minute audio recording on Tuesday, along with a transcript . The . magazine made waves with another secret political recording in 2012 . when it published Mitt Romney's now-infamous claim that '47 percent' of . Americans would vote for Barack Obama no matter what, because Obama . would protect their government benefits in his second term. The recording itself will provide anti-McConnell Democrats with fodder for months. 'I . refer to [Judd] as sort of the oppo[sition] research situation where . there's a haystack of needles,' the Mother Jones recording shows one . McConnell aide saying, 'just because truly, there’s such a wealth of . material.' 'She's clearly - . this sounds extreme - but she is emotionally unbalanced. I mean it's . been documented,' the meeting's leader said. 'Jesse . can go in chapter and verse from her autobiography about, you know, . she's suffered some suicidal tendencies. She was hospitalized for 42 . days when she had a mental breakdown in the '90s. Judd lives in Tennessee and spent ever-increasing amounts of time in San Francisco, but planned to run for the US Senate from Kentucky, where she was raised. Her book, All That . Is Bitter & Sweet, contained a wealth of opposition research for . Republicans, including recollections of her fight with mental illness . In a recorded Associated Press interview played during the McConnell staff meeting, Judd is heard explaining how the sight of a pair of socks in an airport shop could prompt an odd reaction upon returning to the US after overseas travel. 'You know, I come back to this country. I freak out in airports,' the group heard Judd say. 'The colors, the sounds, ... The last time I came home from a trip, I absolutely flipped out when I saw pink fuzzy socks on a rack. I mean, I can never anticipate what is going to push me over the edge.' 'So pink fuzzy socks are of concern,' the amused meeting leader joked. The group also heard that Judd 'is . critical…of traditional Christianity. She sort of views it as sort of a . vestige of patriarchy. She says Christianity gives a God like a man, . presented and discussed exclusively with male imagery, which legitimizes . and seals male power.' McConnell's . native Kentucky is a Bible-belt bastion of religious conservatism, a . region where questions about God's gender would not play well in an . election season. Judd . announced on Twitter that she wouldn't be running for Senate against . Mitch McConnell, but the secret 'family meeting' at McConnell . headquarters happened weeks beforehand . In another recording of Judd played during the meeting, she discussed her preference for 'native faith practices,' saying she has 'a very nature-based God concept.' Mother Jones reporter David Corn argued that Judd has also publicly described herself as a garden-variety Christian. But worse still for Judd - had she run for Senate - might have been campaign ammunition about her reported view that 'having children [is] selfish,' and that 'she thinks it's unconscionable to breed.' The group also discussed the . usefulness of portraying Judd as a carpetbagger who would run for a . Senate seat in Kentucky while being on record claiming Tennessee and San . Francisco as her native home.' 'Not only has she clearly claimed . Tennessee as her home,' a voice on the recording says, 'she's actually . mocked Kentucky to Tennessee audiences. She was bemoaning the low voter . turnout among women in Tennessee. She said, ""People, that's worse than . even in Kentucky.""' That line of argument became part of the national conversation about Judd just four days later, with the release of a YouTube video by the political group American Crossroads. In included a clip of Judd telling an audience near her home in Nashville that one day, 'It just clicked: Tennessee is home.' The Daily Caller highlighted one passage in her book, All That Is Bitter & Sweet, that could have become the subject of TV ads against her. 'When I began to dream of making myself a . home I could live in for the rest of my life, a home that would shelter . me longer than anywhere I had ever lived before, this was the place the . fates seemed to choose for me,' she wrote in the memoir, referring to . the 200-year-old Tennessee farmhouse that has been her legal residence since the . 1990s. In a statement earlier Tuesday, the . McConnell campaign had painted the audio's release to a liberal magazine . as a political dirty trick. 'We've . always said the Left would stop at nothing to attack Sen. McConnell, . but Watergate-style tactics to bug campaign headquarters are above and . beyond.,' the statement read. 'Senator . McConnell's campaign is working with the FBI and has notified the local . U.S. Attorney in Louisville, per FBI request, about these recordings. Obviously a recording device of some kind was placed in Senator . McConnell's campaign office without consent. By whom and how that was . accomplished presumably will be the subject of a criminal . investigation.' Problematic: Judd has called her Williamson County, Tennessee . farmhouse home since the 1990s, which would have been an obstacle to her winning a US Senate election in neighboring Kentucky . McConnell campaign manager Jesse Benton (with former boss Ron Paul, L) said the audio's leak was the product of illegal wiretapping, and has asked the FBI to investigate . In Kentucky, it is legal to make secret recordings of conversations, provided that at least one of the conversation's participants is aware and gives consent. Other states have so-called 'all-party' consent laws, which provide that no one may be recorded without his or her permission. A federal law enforcement source told MailOnline that the FBI's involvement 'would typically commence after an illegally produced recording 'crossed state lines.' Mother Jones magazine's parent organization, the nonprofit Foundation for National Progress, is based in San Francisco, California. Reporter David Corn, who broke the news Tuesday, is based in Washington, DC. In a statement David Corn provided after this story was first published, Mother Jones magazine said it was 'recently provided the tape by a source who wished to remain anonymous. We were not involved in the making of the tape.' 'It is our understanding,' the statement also said, 'that the tape was not the product of a Watergate-style bugging operation. We cannot comment beyond that.' David Corn (L) has re-introduced the term 'Whac-a-Mole' into the US political vocabulary with a leaked recording of Sen. Mitch McConnell and his staffers .","Opposition research showed Judd was 'emotionally unbalanced' and had 'suicidal tendencies'

"PUBLISHED: . 17:13 EST, 27 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:21 EST, 31 December 2013 . Ashley Judd, the gorgeous 42-year-old film star who toyed with a political second act for her public life, has announced that she will not run against Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for his seat in the US Congress. Judd, who stars in the upcoming feature film Olympus Has Fallen, told supporters via Twitter on Wednesday afternoon that despite widespread speculation, she will not enter the Senate race in her childhood home state of Kentucky. 'Dear Friends,' she wrote in a series of tweets, 'Thank you for these months of remarkable support & encouragement, for your voices, exhortations, & prayers. I have decided.' 'After serious and thorough contemplation, I realize that my responsibilities & energy at this time need to be focused on my family. Regretfully, I am currently unable to consider a campaign for the Senate.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ashley Judd (L) will return to her Hollywood acting career without a detour into politics, she announced on Twitter. Judd has been a die-hard Democratic Party supporter, but a Republican consultant told MailOnline that her poll numbers against GOP Senator Mitch McConnell (R) were not promising enough to guarantee that the party would support her . Judd embraced Olympus Has Fallen co-star Gerard Butler at the film's premiere on March 18 in Los Angeles. She wore a Herve Leger cocktail dress featuring the 'bandage; fabric that has become the designer's signature - and a dramatically plunging neckline . 'I have spoken to so many Kentuckians over these last few months who expressed their desire for a fighter for the people & new leader. 'While that won't be me at this time, I will continue to work as hard as I can to ensure the needs of Kentucky families are met by returning this Senate seat to whom it rightfully belongs: the people & their needs, dreams, and great potential. 'Thanks for even considering me as that person & know how much I love our Commonwealth. Thank you!' Judd was widely rumored to be the Democratic Party's new Hollywood darling. She fueled the speculation herself recently, saying that she expected her mother, former country music star Naomi Judd, to convert her garage into a campaign office. The Washington Post was first to report the news Wednesday, citing inside sources. Within ten minutes, Judd confirmed the report on Twitter, where 171,000 fans follow her. Judd has been a stalwart Democratic Party supporter, publicly endorsing President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 and representing Tennessee at the party's 2012 national convention in Charlotte as the roll was called for votes to renominate him for the presidency. But it was Kentucky, not Tennessee, that she reportedly wanted to represent in Washington, DC, bringing catcalls from Republicans who said she shouldn't represent the Bluegrass State while she was a Tennessee resident. American Crossroads, a conservative political messaging group run by former George W. Bush Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove, distributed a YouTube video showing Judd telling an audience that ""Tennessee is home."" Judd lives in Tennessee but made it known publicly that she rooted for Kentucky sports teams. She watched Kentucky play Vanderbilt during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game at the Southeastern Conference tournament in March. The tournament game was held in Nashville, Tennessee, near her home. Sen. McConnell's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MailOnline. But a Republican strategist close to Senate campaign politics said that Judd would have had a tough time even winning the Democratic nomination. Alison Lundergan Grimes, the popular Democratic Kentucky Secretary of State, was thought to be a more viable candidate to challenge McConnell, the strategist said. 'Polls showed that Grimes matched up better against McConnell than Jud would have,' he told MailOnline, 'so Judd's handlers probably saw the writing on the wall. You can't win an election without money, even if your friends are in Hollywood. And the Democratic party wasn't likely to help her.' Judd also risked becoming a distraction, given her copious nude appearances on screen. The Daily Caller reported that MrSkin.com, the 'largest free nude celebrity movie archive,' has cataloged her history of flashing 'just about everything on-screen.'She showed full-frontal nudity, and her rear end, in 1996′s Norma Jean And Marilyn and 1999′s Eye of the Beholder. Fans saw Judd topless in the 1996 film Normal Life, and saw her both topless and bottomless in the 1999 feature Double Jeopardy.She also filmed a lesbian sex scene in 2002 for the Oscar-nominated movie Frida.","Screen siren risked being a distraction since she performed numerous nude scenes in films .

In a new Quinnipiac University poll, Florida Senator Marco Rubio leads a tightly clustered field of Republican presidential hopefuls among registered GOP voters. But Republicans are clearly at a point of limited popular support. The muddled field doesn't suggest a successful race in 2016 for Republicans, said Peter Brown, the assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. 'The Republicans are more disliked than Democrats,' Brown said. 'The Republican brand is essentially in the toilet these days.' 'The only place the Republicans do better than the Democrats is on the budget deficit.' Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had greater support than any Republican in the field, in a Quinnipiac University poll. Clinton is seen as the presumptive favorite to win the Democrats' presidential nomination in 2016 . US Republican Florida Senator Marco Rubio (L) topped the GOP field in the Quinnipiac poll, which included more than 700 Registered Republicans. Wisconsin congressman and 2012 vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan (R) was close behind . Senator Rubio was favored by 19 per cent of Republican respondents in the March 7 poll. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had 14 per cent support, slightly less than Kentucky Senator Rand Paul's 15 percent. Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman who served as the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2012, came in second place with 17 per cent, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush rounded out the top five with 10 per cent. Other hopefuls mentioned as possible GOP candidates, including Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. 'Three years before the nominating process, the Republicans have no clear favorite,' Brown said. 'What Quinnipiac found is there is no front-runner. Unlike in other years, when one candidate started out with a clear lead over other contenders, that's clearly not the case.' But Republicans 'appear to have a deeper bench this time' compared to the 2008 race, he added, conceding that the analysis 'sounds a lot like scouting a baseball team.' Combined, conservatives Rubio, Ryan, Paul and Bush attracted the support of 61 percent of Republicans, suggesting a tough road ahead for Christie, who is seen in most circles as a moderate. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, while thought to be among the most electable Republicans likely to enter the 2016 presidential race, trailed other candidates in the poll. Christie caught flak for appearing with President Barack Obama in the final weeks of the 2012 campaign, as the president directed hurricane relief fnds to the Garden State . Christie famously embraced President Obama in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, drawing criticism from Republican leaders because it happened in the final weeks of the 2012 campaign. 'It's clearly a conservative party,' Brown noted. 'The problem is that they have to have a message that appeals to people who don't think they [themselves] are conservative.' Democrats scored better than Republicans on issues including health care, same-sex marriage and immigration. But financial issues rate highest among the concerns of Americans in both parties, with 40 per cent listing the economy and jobs as the most important issue, another 20 per cent naming the federal budget deficit, and 8 per cent choosing taxes. 'Money will probably be a pretty big deal in 2016,' said Brown. Health care and gun issues, favorite topics among liberal Democrats, registered less concern, with 20 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul (L) was an also-ran in the Quinnipiac poll with 15 per cent support, but the poll was taken a week before he galvanized conservatives' support with a lengthy filibuster over the question of whether the Obama administration could legally kill American citizens with drone strikes if they were considered terrorists. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) attracted 10 per cent of Republicans' support. The conservative politician would be the third Bush family member to live in the White House if he were elected . Overall, Democrats have a 38 per cent approval rating, with 44 per cent disapproving. But Republicans fare even worse, with 51 per cent disapproving and only 28 per cent favoring them. The hyper-conservative tea party fared worst of all, with just 24 per cent approval. Hillary Clinton, the former first lady and Secretary of State, enjoys greater public support than Rubio, but the Florida senator tops Vice President Joe Biden and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. The poll also found 59 percent of Republicans would rather see a state governor - not a sitting senator - as their nominee. Ryan's status as the most recent vice presidential candidate won't help him, Brown said. 'History tells us being the running-mate on a losing ticket does not help one's presidential chances. 'Among the last six vice presidential nominees on losing tickets, none of them got to be their party's presidential nominee.' Peter Brown with the Quinnipiac Polling Institute said that the Republican brand is 'in the toilet.' His poll found President Obama had a 50 per cent approval rating, and the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had greater support than any of the GOP front-runners. Quinnipiac University's polling arm regularly publishes presidential survey numbers, and often provides the first look at races that are far in the future . The last three on the Republican side were former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, former New York Rep. Jack Kemp and former Vice President Dan Quayle, with former North  arolina Sen. John Edwards, former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman and former Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen holding that distinction on the Democratic side. None of them wound up winning their party's nomination for president after being the vice presidential nominee. Brown said that in the 1980s, the Democrats were in a similar situation to what faces Republicans today. 'Their brand wasn't very good, there was a lot of internal strife,' but they recovered eventually with a surging Congressional field and Bill Clinton as president during the 1990s. President Barack Obama scored a 50 per cent job approval rating in the Quinnipiac poll, which is up slightly from previous polling. His rating reached a high of 53 per cent in December, following his re-election victory, but dipped into the mid-40s by mid-January. Fifty per cent is 'certainly quite healthy for an incumbent starting his second term,' Brown said. The Quinnipiac poll sampled 1,711 registered voters overall, with a margin of error of 2.4percentage points. The sample included 712 Republicans, with a 3.7 percentage-point margin of error in that group. •    No single GOP presidential hopeful captured 20 per cent of Republicans' support . •    Marco Rubio won 19 per cent, followed by Paul Ryan's 17 per cent and Rand Paul's 15 per cent . •    Chris Christie, thought to be the GOP's golden boy, took fourth place with 14 per cent . •    Silver lining: Republicans' only strong issue is on the economic issues voters say are most important . •    59 per cent of Republicans said they would rather the 2016 nominee be a governor, not a senator . •    President Obama has a 50 per cent approval rating, down just three points since his post-election high . •    43 per cent of registered voters said they would vote for a Democrat for Congress . •    Just 35 per cent chose a generic Republican congressional candidate . •    Democrats in Congress rated 34 per cent approval, compared with 19 per cent for congressional Republicans . •    69 per cent of voters said they were 'very dissatisfied' or 'somewhat dissatisfied' with the direction of the country . •    52 per cent said they had a negative image of the Republican Party, compared to 43 per cent who said the same about the Democratic PartySource: Quinnnipiac University Polling Institute .","Democratic presidential candidates are favored by 43 to 35 per cent .

President Barack Obama famously promised in early 2009 to close the US military's detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba within 12 months. But new Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is instead considering a proposal from his top commanders to spend $195.7 million renovating it and erecting a new prison building. The new construction would include $49 to house high-value targets like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind behind the 9/11 terror attacks, whose initial detention and interrogation was handled by the Central Intelligence Agency. The New York Times reported that it . would likely replace Camp 7, the oft-rumored but never acknowledged . installation for those 'special' detainees. Al-Qaeda and Taliban detainees have been housed at the Guantanamo Bay military prison since at least 2002, and are always surrounded by heavily armed security forces . President Barack Obama (L) promised in the first days of his administration in 2009 to close the Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay during his first year in office. But the facility has become a money pit, says Retired US Air Force Colonel Morris Davis (R), formerly the chief military prosecutor at the prison on the island of Cuba . US soldiers escort a detainee out of an interrogation hut on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. Nearly 800 'enemy combatants' have been acknowledged as current or former detainees there, according to human rights groups . General John F. Kelly, who leads the United States military's Southern Command, testified in a congressional hearing Wednesday that with no end to the prison's operation in sight, repairs and upgrades are needed. Retired Air Force Col. Morris Davis, a former chief prosecutor at the Guantanamo Bay base, said in a separate interview with Russia Today that the US military spends $120 million annually 'just on the recurring costs of keeping the detainees there.' The Times reported that the Pentagon funding request includes $99 million for two new barracks facilities and a new mess hall costing $12 million. Military planners also want to reduce the frequent prisoner transportation around the base by placing new legal, medical and communications facilities at central locations in the main detention camps. The existing facilities, Col. Davis said, 'just weren’t meant to last for 10 or 11 years,' 'There’s a lot of money being wasted at Guantanamo,' he added, 'and a lot of our prestige is going down the tubes as well. So there's just no good reason to keep it going.' A Muslim detainee leads a group as they bow during Islamic prayer, in an outdoor common area at the Camp Delta 4 detention center on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. Camp 4 is a medium-security facility, but others, which house high-value prisoners, confine them alone in virtual isolation . Guards enter a maximum-security area of the US military-run Guantanamo Bay prison, meant to house high-value targets and high-profile detainees who may have valuable information that could help the American government's global war on Islamic terror groups . Protesters including Americans, Indonesians and citizens of other Muslim countries have pressured the Bush and Obama administrations to close the installation. But Bush - and, later, Obama - reportedly determined that the value of extracting information from terrorists and their confederates outweighed the reputational damage caused by Americans holding prisoners indefinitely under circumstances that would be unconstitutional if the detainees were US citizens. In January the Obama White House reassigned Daniel Fried, the special envoy for closing the Cuban prison, and determined that it would not replace him. The administration created Fried’s job in 2009, shortly after Obama took office and promised to . close Guantanamo within a year. The envoy negotiated the repatriation of 31 low-level detainees to their own countries, and convinced . other nations to accept about 40 more whose release was approved, but who feared government oppression or other abuse if they returned home.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:31 EST, 2 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:16 EST, 31 December 2013 . Maryland Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings' nephew Christopher was found murdered at age 20 in his home near Old Dominion University in Virginia two years ago, shot in the head. Cummings said Tuesday during a news conference at the National Press Club that Congress has moved too slowly to pass new gun-control measures. One place Congress should act, he said, is with a law criminalizing so-called 'straw purchasers' of firearms. 'Most Americans already think gun trafficking is a federal crime,' he said, 'but it's not. Straw purchasers are individuals who buy guns with the intention of selling them or giving them to others - often to individuals who would not pass background checks administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Calling for action: Congressman Elijah Cummings cried foul on Congress saying that they failed to act quick enough to pass a comprehensive gun law . Straw purchasing was an element of the Newtown, Connecticut gun massacre in December that left 20 children and six adults dead at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. Mass-murderer Adam Lanza obtained his weapons from his mother, who reportedly bought them legally. It's unclear if he would have qualified to buy firearms himself, but his history of mental illness, experts say, would have made it unlikely. Straw purchasing, however, was also an element of the Obama administration's effort to fight drug trafficking along the US-Mexico border. In Operation Fast and Furious, the Justice Department and the ATF used straw purchasers to 'walk' guns into Mexico in an ultimately failed effort to track them to drug cartels. The government lost track of those guns, more than 2 thousand of them, including AK-47 rifles. And the Fast and Furious firearms have been linked to hundreds of death in Mexico, and to the death of at least one US Border Patrol Agent, Brian Terry. Victim: Congressman Cummings' nephew Christopher (pictured) was found murdered at age 20 in his home near Old Dominion University in Virginia . Cummings said his bill would put the federal government out of the straw-purchasing business. 'Yeah. In other words, it was wrong,' he said of Fast and Furious when asked by MailOnline.' I think . everybody agrees that was wrong. And yes, the legislation would address . that issue.' Cummings has . introduced the Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of 2013, legislation that . would increase the penalties for straw-purchasing guns to a maximum of . 20 years. 'Bipartisan support for the legislation is growing every day,' he said. Vendetta: Cummings thinks that lawmakers should go after 'straw purchasers' of guns . Surveys show that nine out of ten Americans, and a majority of National Rifle Association members, support universal background checks for gun buyers, a measure that would be part of a strategy to limit straw purchasing. 'I believe fixing the background check system is one of the most common-sense actions we can take to prevent criminals from getting guns,' Cummings explained. 'And I think it would complement our gun trafficking legislation as well. 'I will fight for that legislation until I die,' an emotional Cummings told reporters. ‘This is about moving the ball up the floor. I don’t know if we’ll score 2 points or 3 points.’ The NRA has been critical of gun control legislation, and gun-rights advocates have pointed out that Cummings' nephew was unarmed and in his home when he was killed. Greater freedom to own his own gun, they say, could have saved his life. NRA lobbyists are hard at work lobbying in the Senate to scuttle much of the White House's preferred legislative package, The Washington Post . reported Tuesday, by circulating new and weaker bill language to . senators. That language would use stricter evidentiary requirements for . prosecuting straw purchasers in federal court than what Cummings . prefers. 'I think it basically waters down the bill tremendously.' But 'they're not solid on that language, Apparently it's a draft.' Tragic: Cummings' nephew was unarmed and in his home when he was killed . During a Q-and-A from reporters, Cummings resisted every opportunity to criticize the gun lobby for undermining his efforts, aware that the organization would hold a press conference just down the hall when his concluded. 'You won't hear me beating up on the NRA. I want to work with the NRA to get something meaningful done,' he said. But Cummings is dead-set against allowing straw purchasing among ordinary US citizens. 'There are only two groups,' he said of his new legislation 'who should oppose this bill: criminals and people who want to buy guns for criminals.' Baltimore and the surrounding counties that Cummings represents have been hot spots for firearms violence, but it has what an analysis by The Daily Beast found is the 7th most aggressive state-level gun laws in the country. In memory: The New York Yankees started their season off with a commemoration of the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting . 'He was an amazing young man with his entire life ahead of him,' he said of his nephew, then a criminal justice major. 'It is a painful thing to see your nephew, son or daughter's blood splattered across the wall.' Asked if he would support the NRA's proposal, expected Tuesday morning, to arm a greater number of security guards in US schools, Cummings left room for negotiation. 'Having more guns in schools, I don't think, is necessarily the answer,' he said. 'But any jurisdiction that wants to take care of its kids that way, it's students - I don't think that's necessarily a bad proposal.'","Representative Elijah Cummings took aim at the practice of straw purchasing guns .
That type of gun purchase played a role in both the Newtown, Connecticut school massacre and the government's failed Fast and Furious program ."

One hundred years of commercial airline flight will be marked tomorrow with a re-enactment of the very first fare-paying journey. On January 1, 1914 the St Petersburg-Tampa Airboat line was able to make a 23-minute flight across Tampa Bay in Florida - and tomorrow, a replica of the first airboat will take off and fly the same route. The 18-mile flight - which was 11 hours quicker than travelling between the two cities by train - safely transported 1,200 passengers across the Bay in a Benoist Model XIV aircraft with a 75HP engine. Scroll down for video . One century ago: A flying boat begins its takeoff run on Tampa Bay in Florida for history's first scheduled airline flight - on January 1, 1914 . But it was forced to close at the end of March 1914 after just three months in operation because it did not have a continuing subsidy from St Petersburg or a steady income from tourist traffic. The re-enactment starts a year of celebrations backed by the International Air Transport Association. As preparations got under way for the replica flight, Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways’ parent company IAG, hailed the success of commercial aviation’s first 100 years. He said: ‘Aviation is a miracle. It’s truly wonderful. Everybody who lives finds it somehow touches their lives. Without question, aviation is a force for good. ‘There are issues we must address such as the environment where our performance must improve, but it’s a fantastic industry.’ Lift off: On January 1, 1914, the St Petersburg-Tampa Airboat line was able to make a 23-minute flight across Tampa Bay in Florida . Mr Walsh highlighted the rise of the low-cost airlines in recent years, saying ‘now everybody expects to be able to fly’. 'Aviation is a miracle. It’s truly wonderful. Everybody who lives finds it somehow touches their lives. Without question, aviation is a force for good' Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive . He went on: ‘I generally believe we are at an exciting stage in aviation where we can improve our environmental and financial performance.’ Iata director general and chief executive Tony Tyler said: ‘Over the last century, commercial aviation has transformed the world in ways unimaginable in 1914. The first flight provided a short-cut across Tampa Bay. ‘Today the aviation industry re-unites loved ones, connects cultures, expands minds, opens markets, and fosters development. Days gone by: Tomorrow, a replica of the first airboat will take off from St Petersburg to fly to Tampa . The Model XIV was purchased from  aircraft manufacturer Thomas Benoist (right) of Missouri. It could carry only one passenger, who sat next to the pilot in the open cockpit. Former St Petersburg Mayor A.C. Phiel paid $400 (£240) to be the first passenger, and the first flight was conducted by pilot Tony Jannus. The aircraft was powered by a Roberts 75HP, six-cylinder, water-cooled engine. The plane had a 44ft 6in wingspan and a top speed of 64mph, weighing 1,299lbs (589kg). Flights on the airboat cost $5 (£3) per trip and there were two journeys each way every day. ‘Aviation provides people around the globe with the freedom to make connections that can change their lives and the world.’ Iata today released statistics which showed that on average, every day more than eight million people fly. In 2013 total passenger numbers were 3.1billion - surpassing the three billion mark for the first time. That number is expected to grow to 3.3billion in 2014 (equivalent to 44 per cent of the world’s population). Iata also said about 50 million tonnes of cargo is transported by air each year, which is around 140,000 tonnes daily. And it added that aviation supports more than 57million jobs with the industry’s direct economic contribution being around £337billion. Global airline industry turnover is expected to be around £464billion in 2014, with an average industry profit margin of 2.6 per cent.

Strong: Admirers and opponents both value that she would never have dreamed of moving her position to fit the consensus . You will always remember this moment,' my mother told me, as I watched the lady dressed in blue walking through Downing Street's shiny black door. Thirty-five years later, it is still the childhood memory that is most indelibly seared into my brain: my mother calling me to the television set to see Margaret Thatcher reciting the St Francis prayer and then entering No 10. My mother was a shop-owner raised in a council house in Coventry; she was as convinced of Maggie's greatness on the first day of her momentous time in office as millions were when she left it. And when the former Prime Minister died this year, it was the strivers like my mother — the people who came from nothing, who worked hard and pulled themselves up by their bootstraps — who most mourned her passing. To those people, Baroness Thatcher personified all that is best about our nation, and about our politics. Her legacy stands today as a shining example, not only to citizens who aspire through their own endeavours to lead more prosperous and productive lives, but also to politicians who aspire to represent those people. Lady Thatcher, who died in April aged 87, was the last great conviction politician this country has known. She was also the last to imbue hard-working Britons with a sense that the Government was on their side. She unleashed a spirit of enterprise that turned Britain from a laughing stock into a global force that tackled and helped to defeat Soviet communism. She led from the front and from a deep sense of her own instinctive belief in the right of the individual to determine their own destiny. She loathed above all things the  U-turn, a manoeuvre that seems to have been perfected in recent years by David Cameron and his PR-savvy Notting Hill chums. Her leadership was the polar opposite of government by focus group, a tendency begun by Tony Blair. Instead of bowing to political weather, she changed it. She understood that there was no honour in formulating policies simply because they were popular. She would never have dreamed of moving her own position to fit the consensus. That is why the one thing you hear said about Margaret Thatcher by admirers and opponents alike is: 'You might not have agreed with her, but you knew where you stood.' Changed history: Lady Thatcher's funeral in April marked the passing of our last conviction politician . How different to the leadership that came after her. It speaks volumes that anyone who has ever tried to outline David Cameron's philosophy has become mired in a terrible muddle. By contrast, what Thatcher believed is as easy for a brickie or a bookie to explain as it is for a professor of politics. She stood for individual freedom and free enterprise. And yes, she clobbered those who got in the way of that. She knew that no state-owned industry, government regulation or union demand for wage increases was a substitute for the virtuous cycle that begins when one individual starts a business of their own and begins employing people. Her rigorous sense of fairness was sometimes brutal. Charging local tax according to the number of people in a house, and the amount of services used, was correct in theory but, in practice, triggered such powerful emotions that it led to the political disaster of the poll tax riots. But you only need to look at the individual stories of those who flourished during the Thatcher era to see how 'Thatcherism' worked. She unleashed a spirit of enterprise that turned Britain from a laughing stock into a global force . On the day we watched her walk through the door of No 10, my mother had been full of hope not just because the new Prime Minister was the first woman ever to hold the post, but because Margaret Thatcher was a shopkeeper's daughter who spoke the language of common sense. And Britain was in desperate need of common sense. My mother was fond of telling me then, as she does now, horror stories about the winter of discontent in 1978/9, before Margaret Thatcher came to power: how clients with wet hair sat under the driers of her hairdressing shop in darkness for hours, waiting for the power to come back on. Many of the young today who happily join in on Facebook and Twitter with the Left's relentless haranguing of Thatcher have no idea of what it was like to experience rubbish piled up in the streets, or bodies left unburied, or power cuts and — under Edward Heath's earlier lacklustre leadership — the three-day week. Whenever Labour talk about putting up income tax, the misty-eyed idealists who vote for them, and who denounce Lady Thatcher as cruel, conveniently forget that millionaires routinely used to move abroad to avoid paying tax altogether in this country. And when socialist bigots sought to tarnish Lady Thatcher's memory by hurling vile insults at her when she died, they only served to highlight what she was up against, and fought so hard to overcome, when she was in power. 'Ding dong the witch is dead', a moronic police sergeant from Milton Keynes wrote on Twitter. Well, yes, in a way, Mrs Thatcher was a sort of witch. She was certainly a miracle worker for dragging Britain back from the brink of irrelevance. And there was something almost supernatural about her ability to tackle vested interests, seemingly without fear. Tony Blair, in contrast, watered down his education and health reforms to appease the teaching and health sector unions defending their cosy pay deals. But Lady Thatcher would not be intimidated or worn down. She saw her mission through to prise . British industry from the vice-like grip of the unions. She cut taxes, . enabled people to own their own homes for the first time, and sparked a . revolution, social and economic, which attracted an influx of talent and . money into this country. She gave Britain a purpose again. Very . few people shape a nation's history. Very few leaders are exactly what a . nation needs at precisely the time it needs it. I don't think it is . overstating things to compare Thatcher to Elizabeth I, who saw off the . invading Spanish Armada and transformed Britain into a world power. Iconic: Very few leaders are exactly what a nation needs at precisely the time it needs it. Lady Thatcher was . Thatcher was an icon every bit as potent on her stage as the virgin queen — and with that halo of hair she almost took on the look of Elizabeth. Just as Elizabeth I was said to be married to England, Lady Thatcher put the duty she believed she owed her country before the responsibility she felt to her family. She may not have been the greatest mother, but to women (such as me) who like their female role models to be gritty, tough and uncompromising, Thatcher was a heroine. She had that rarest of qualities, not caring about what people thought of her. She was an exciting figure, a disrupter, an agitator. She never played safe, unlike so many of our political elite nowadays. One could fantasise endlessly about what Mrs Thatcher would have done about our problems today. Faced with extremist Islamists threatening her own people, what would she tell the European Court of Human Rights when they ruled she could not deport them? She would slam her handbag down and, with fire in her eyes, declare: 'No, no, no!' And they would struggle to argue with her. She was, after all, a force of nature. Her stoicism and relentless determination to propel her government forwards at all times led detractors to portray her as heartless or even inhuman. But this misses the point. She had a heart, and she had feelings. She just wasn't afraid to push them into the background so she could get on with the job. She stood for individual freedom and free enterprise. Anyone who got in the way was clobbered . If she had a blind spot, it was to disregard the fact that other people were not made of the same stuff she was. There is a poignant scene in the film The Iron Lady where she snatches a paper from her senior Cabinet colleague Geoffrey Howe and starts correcting his spelling. Her insensitivity and lack of tolerance sowed the seeds of her eventual destruction. But whatever her faults, they pale into insignificance compared to the self-seeking sleaze of the political class that came after her. Unlike so many of today's politicians, she was frugal and uninterested in the frippery of power. She would not have dreamed of overseeing a high-spec make-over of the kitchen in the Downing Street apartment, as the Camerons did. Not that she was uninterested in domestic matters. Hers was a unique brand of feminism. She would grab a vacuum cleaner during photocalls when it suited her, to become a housewife again. She connected with people by explaining the economy in terms of their household finances. My favourite phrase of hers was: 'If you want something said, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman.' As Charles Moore observes in his biography: 'Thatcherism was never a philosophy, but a disposition of mind and character embodied in a highly unusual woman.' There was one particular occasion I remember meeting her. It was during then Tory leader William Hague's doomed 2001 general election campaign when she joined in for a day and set the campaign briefly alight. She opened a speech that evening by noting that a cinema nearby was advertising the film called The Mummy Returns. With a withering stare, she said: 'You were expecting me after all!' She knew there were many people, even those who didn't like her, who deep down wanted her back, in the way a child left to run wild longs for a strong parent. Cast your eyes around for a political a leader of her stature today — and you will find, sadly, no one even comes close.","Former Prime Minister, who died in April aged 87, changed Britain .

The concerning footage was captured on CCTV in an unknown location and later posted on YouTube. Despite the fact that the footage is two years old, it is a timely reminder as hundreds of consumers across the UK have started to fight back against poor deliveries. Today, it has been revealed that a parcel delivery service working for some of Britain's biggest retailers - including Amazon and John Lewis - is facing allegations of bad service.

Hundreds of complaints have been posted . online - many of which are written on an Amazon forum called 'Hermes Parcel Delivery - . Utter Incompetence'. In response, the delivery firm - which uses about 9,500 self-employed workers - has said only a very small percentage of its parcels go missing or are mishandled. It has also added that is 'contractually unable' to deal with most complaints. This weekend, the British Online Retailing Association (BritORA) called for a reform of the parcel delivery system - dubbing the current system a 'Wild West'. Adrian Quine, director of BritORA, said retailers across the UK had expressed significant concerns about Hermes and Yodel. Complaints: Hundreds of people have complained online about UK delivery service Hermes. Many of the comments are written on an Amazon forum, pictured, called 'Hermes Parcel Delivery - Utter Incompetence' 'It is appalling that people are returning home to find parcels left in a bin or soaked by the rain,' he told the newspaper. 'Corners are being cut because costs have been cut to the bone.' On the Amazon forum, one user has written: '[Hermes'] latest effort resulted in a book I ordered being left in my garden in a puddle in the rain on the wettest day this year - contents were completely ruined'. Another has claimed he has 'never successfully received a delivery from them yet'. And one angry customer has said their parcel containing a television boxset - was delivered 'half-torn open'. However, one woman has spoken in support of Hermes - claiming the deliverymen are 'always very helpful' and leave parcels with neighbours or somewhere safe if she is not in. Hermes - owned by German retail giant Otto - goes through  more than 190million collections and deliveries a year. Gary Winter, sales and marketing director at Hermes, told the newspaper the firm took 'immediate action' when couriers did not comply with its procedures - but did not believe there was a significant problem. He added that the company delivered about 5million parcels a week - and could not do that if it provided poor service. Meanwhile, Yodel has about 1,500 clients and works with 80 per cent of the UK's top retailers, including Tesco and the Shop Direct Group. In a survey published by MoneySavingExpert.com in January, it was rated the worst delivery service by consumers - with 71 per cent complaining of a poor experience. A Yodel spokesman said the YouTube clip of one of its couriers dropping a parcel over a gate had been taken nearly two years ago and did not clearly identify the driver involved.","Deliveryman caught on CCTV two years ago hurling rectangular parcel over gate .

Michelle and husband Jason were so 'outraged' at the tattoo they called the police and local council. Michelle said: 'This person thinks they can tattoo. She is willing too tattoo under age kids and needs too be stopped and shamed.' She called her a 'monster' and said her tattoos were marking youngsters for life with awful inkings. She then posted a photo of her son's 'awful' tattoo on Facebook, adding: 'This is what a so called tattooist did to my underage son! DO NOT Get a tattoo done at LoveTattoo in Dymchurch.' Speaking last week, Michelle said it was the 'worst tattoo she had ever seen', adding: 'He was silly for having it done and regrets having it, but no-one should be subject to such shoddy work.' Father Jason said Dagmar Oates should have asked for ID from Robin before inking him and said: 'The tattoo cost £5 - you can see why.' Writing on her Facebook page Dagmar Oates claimed that she was being persecuted and that Robin had told her he was 18. A sign on her tattoo shop door reads that she has 'closed for winter' and will be 'back in May', . Mrs Oates' Skillpages entry reads: 'Tottooing (sic) is one of my hidden skills.

A long-lost Gold Rush town that had been submerged beneath a lake has been revealed its secrets for the first time in 60 years. December has been one of the driest months ever recorded in California, causing a huge drop in water levels at Folsom Lake and revealed the remnants of the town of Mormon Island. The town was set up in 1848 after prospectors struck upon gold in nearby Coloma. At its peak, it was home to 2,500 Mormon immigrants seeking riches in the region. Scroll down for video . The crumbling walls of a structure on Mormon Island in California were revealed this week after the state had one of the driest months on record . The arches of a bridge begin to emerge from Folsom Lake following the dry spell . It reportedly had four hotels, a school and seven saloons during the boom times but after the wealth ran out, only a few families were left by the 1940s. The town was finally torn down for the Folson Dam project which flooded the site on which it stood during the 1950s. Mormon Island, which is a California Historical Landmark, came into view for the first time in 60 years due to the recent dry spell. The stone foundations of the town are now visible along with piles of rusty, square-headed nails, tool parts and broken bottles. The water level has reached a historic low in Folsom Lake, California over the past month . At its peak, Mormon Island reportedly had four hotels, a school and seven saloons . Along the waterfront are crumbling, stone foundations which are believed to have been the sites of a winery and a dairy. A portion of a stone water well is also now visible. Amateur archaeologist Alex Caudill, who brought his son Skyler to see the ruins, told KCRA: 'I always love stuff like this, it's history. 'It's kind of sad that they knocked out a lot of these towns but they had to do it.' Park rangers encouraged people to come visit but warned not to touch anything as Mormon Lake is a protected landmark. The broken bottles have been at the bottom of the lake for 60 years after the town was razed to make way for a dam .

But there is mounting concern among doctors . and healthcare leaders that even if this level of income is guaranteed, . the service will not be able to meet the soaring demand. This . is because of the rising population, increased numbers of elderly, the . effects of obesity and alcohol and the cost of expensive new medicines. In . a message to the BMA, the doctors' union, Dr Porter said: 'The . financial outlook is dire. The NHS is struggling just to keep pace. He blamed the rising cost of treatment, the ageing population, and obesity for rising costs . 'A . growing and ageing population, public health problems like obesity, and . constant advances in treatment and technology are all contributing to . push NHS costs well above general inflation. The numbers overall are so . bad that if the NHS was a country, it would barely have a credit rating . at all.' He said that NHS . staff had 'borne the brunt' of the Government's  efficiency drive – the . health service has been asked to find £20billion in efficiency savings . by 2015. 'The National Audit Office said the NHS had made the “easiest” savings first,' he said. 'They . were certainly not easy for the doctors and other healthcare staff who . were made to bear the brunt. And it is not easy for the patients and . staff every time a vacancy is not filled, a ward is closed, or a clinic . is cancelled.' Earlier this month, another senior healthcare leader suggested routine treatments would have to be cut. David . Flory, head of the NHS Trust Development Authority,  the hospital . watchdog, said there were a 'number of organisations facing really . significant financial pressures'. At a meeting at the King's Fund think-tank in London, he said there were at least 30 hospital trusts  facing serious problems. Mr Flory said: 'We've simply had too much uncertainty in the first half of the financial year.' He . warned of a 'build-up of more patients nobody can afford to pay for' and said the NHS would have to 'take out capacity' or cut services. It . is not clear which treatments or procedures currently available on the . NHS would be slashed, but some areas are already rationing hip and knee . replacements and  cataract treatment. Leading . figures have suggested charging patients for services which are . currently free, such as GP home visits and even hospital stays. He also criticsed Jeremy Hunt for suggesting that GPs contracts had lead to increased waiting times at A&E, calling the remarks 'attacks on our professionalism' Earlier . this year the NHS Confederation, which represents healthcare managers, . said patients could be made to pay £8.50 every time they call out a . doctor. And a poll by Pulse . magazine in July found that half of GPs were in favour of charging . patients for appointments, with fees ranging from £5 to £25. A . spokesman for the Department of Health said: 'We know the NHS needs to . change to meet the needs of an ageing population and increasing demand . on services. 'Dr Porter . acknowledges that it  is possible to achieve efficiencies and still . improve care, and that is exactly what the NHS must continue to do. 'We . have protected the overall health budget and we also recently announced . plans to invest £3.8billion to improve the way health and social care . services join up. 'This . amounts to a major shift of resources to prevention of ill health. We . are also bringing back named GPs for vulnerable elderly patients so that . they get the care they need and prevent unnecessary trips to hospital . and A&E.'","Dr Mark Porter made the remarks in his New Year message .

A tin of biscuits and a pint of milk were both reported stolen from police stations as officers repeatedly filed crime reports for their own missing possessions. Other items which were supposedly stolen from police stations in Devon and Cornwall included make-up, phone chargers, a torch and £2 in cash. Police filed the bizarre reports at the same time as being called to deal with around 100 genuine thefts a day. Theft: Police filed a crime report when a tin of biscuits went missing from Heavitree station in Exeter, pictured . Officers at the Heavitree police station in Exeter reported in February 2012 that a tin of biscuits had been stolen from the premises. In another incident that year, police claimed that a pint of skimmed milk had been stolen from a station. Precise details of the alleged theft are unclear, but it is thought that officers suspected a colleague of taking the milk without asking. The bottle apparently had a set of initials written on its lid in an attempt to deter thieves - but without success. The crime is officially classified as unsolved. Mystery: The culprit behind the disappearance of the biscuits has never been found (file photo) Swiped: At another stations, a missing pint of milk was recorded as a stolen item (file photo) Following a Freedom of Information request, Devon and Cornwall Police revealed that 18 thefts from police stations were officially logged as crimes between 2010 and 2013. Among the items which have gone missing from the force's premises were two phone charges, a dress, a designer coat and a gym belt. Toiletries were also a popular target for thieves, with perfume, eyeliner, foundation and aftershave listed among the stolen items. A gift card was also reported missing from one station, as were two pound coins. None of these items were ever recovered - the only thing which went missing from a station and was then found was a car's number plate. When they were not dealing with the loss of officers' own possessions, Devon and Cornwall Police received reports of more than 35,000 thefts in the year to June 2013, and nearly 85,000 total crimes. A spokesman for the force said: 'We encourage all staff to report thefts regardless of value, of which there are only a very small number as you would expect.

Taking it easier: The Queen made 341 official engagements this year - 85 fewer than in 2012 . The Queen significantly reduced the number of engagements she carried out last year, handing over more duties to younger royals. The 87-year-old monarch conducted 341 official visits, ceremonies, audiences and investitures over the last 12 months, compared to 425 in 2012 - a drop of about 20 per cent. Although the Diamond Jubilee in 2012 kept her busier than usual, her 2013 diary was noticeably slimmer than the 370 engagements she undertook in 2011 and the 444 in 2010. The last time she fulfilled foreign duties was in 2011. The Queen’s workload is still prodigious, particularly for a woman two decades over the average age of retirement. Indeed, based on these latest figures she still carries out engagements at a rate of almost one a day - in addition to the many hours she spends dealing with the red boxes full of official papers every day of the year except Christmas Day. Buckingham Palace has always been at pains to deny any suggestion that the head of state is plans to abdicate or even semi-retire in favour of her eldest son, Prince Charles. He turned 65 in November and is the longest-serving heir apparent in British history. However the latest tally is a sign that the Queen is, inevitably, slowing down. Earlier this year, palace officials were forced to announce what many royal watchers had known for some time - that the Queen had decided to completely scale back on her long-haul foreign travel. In November Charles attended the bi-annual Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka on behalf of his mother for the first time in her six decade reign. Indeed, the last time the Queen undertook any foreign engagement was back in 2011 - although it is very likely she will attend the 70th anniversary commemorations of the Normandy Landings in France next year. Back at home, Prince Charles, Princess Anne and now even her grand-son, Prince William, are taking on more of her physically strenuous duties such as investitures, which require the Queen to stand on her feet, pinning on medals and wielding her father’s sword, for more than an hour at a time. A senior royal source told the Mail: ‘The simple truth is that the Queen is simply unable to keep working at the same pace she has done for the last 60 years. More duties: Prince Charles and Princess Anne are taking on more of the Queen's physically demanding roles . ‘She isn’t retiring, she isn’t taking it easy, but she is scaling back some of her more strenuous duties.’Michael Ellis, the chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, who organised the commission of a special stained glass window in Westminster Hall to mark the event, also insisted that she was not scaling back her duties. ‘On the contrary, the fact that at age 87 she is still carrying out 341 official duties shows that Her Majesty continues to be highly devoted to her role as our Queen and I believe that she will continue in that role for many years to come,’ he said. ‘She works her way through reams of papers, she undertakes numerous audiences and she remains an example of duty and service to this country.’ The Queen’s 92-year-old husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, has also seen a reduction in his workload. In 2012 he conducted 325 official engagements, which fell to fewer than 200 this past year. This is largely due to an extensive period of convalescence following surgery earlier this year. Passing the baton: Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge have also taken on events, though fewer as they are not full-time royals . Charles was the busiest member of the Royal Family with more than 500 official engagements under his belt, followed by Princess Anne. Last week the prince was named by a Danish newspaper as the hardest working member of any Royal Family in Europe. At the bottom of the list are the youngest royals, Prince William, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge. The brothers carried out just over 50 engagements each, but this is due to the fact that both had full-time jobs in the military and are not classed as full-time working royals. Prince Harry also undertook a four-month posting in Afghanistan and a four-week charity trek to the South Pole. Kate, 31, undertook just 43 engagements, but her staff have always insisted she does not want to be a full-time working royal either. She went on maternity leave in June in advance of the birth of her first baby, Prince George, the following month.","The 87-year-old monarch conducted 341 official engagements in 2013 .

Marvine Rosales-Martinez, 27, who came upon a winning lottery ticket while blowing leaves at his landscaping job last fall, was finally allowed to collect his $1million prize this week. Rosales-Martinez, of Hicksville, Long island, was among five lucky winners who were handed oversize checks by the New York Lottery officials Friday. Rosales-Martinez chose to take his prize in a lump sum. After taxes, he will walk away with $515,612. Seeing green: Marvine Rosales-Martinez, 27, who found a winning scratch-off card while blowing leaves at his landscaping job last fall, was allowed to collect his $1million prize this week . The 27-year-old man, who only recently got married, said that in November 2012, he was doing yard work at a client's home in Bayville when he spotted a 'Win $1,000 a Week or Life' scratch-off ticket in a pile of soggy leaves. 'I still don't know what made me pick it up,’ he told the New York Post. Rosales-Martinez took the ticket home and dried it off before heading to a local New York Lottery office, where it was confirmed that he was in possession of a winning ticket. However, before the landscaper could rake in the greenbacks, the lottery conducted a year-long investigation to make sure that the ticket was real, and that the person who had originally purchased it would not contest Martinez's claim. 'A standard and thorough internal security investigation found no reason to believe that the ticket wasn’t rightfully the property of Mr. Martinez,' a spokesman for the New York State Gaming Commission said. 'There was no ­report of theft or of a ticket being misplaced.' The winner's mother, Maria Martinez, admitted to the New York Daily News that she had told her son to throw out the waterlogged scratch-off card when he found it, but now she is glad he didn't heed her advice. Small fortune: Rosales-Martinez (left) and fellow winner Isai Cortez were presented with oversize prize checks for $1million, but after taxes they will take home just over $500,000 . Rosales-Martinez forgot all about his find. Then about three weeks ago, he got a call saying that he will be allowed to collect the prize. The 27-year-old did not tell him wife, Miriam Benitez, about the ticket until Friday, when reporters rang their doorbell. The humble landscaper, a recent immigrant from El Salvador, said that his windfall would not change the way he lives, adding that he will continue working six days a week. He plans to send some of his prize money to his family back home, help out his mother, buy a house and use a portion of it to take his new wife on a honeymoon to Miami.","Marvine Rosales-Martinez, 27, found a 'Win $1,000 a Week for Life' scratch-off card at a client's house in Bayville, New York, in November 2012 .

Around three Britons a day had to be rescued this year after becoming trapped in toilets. Firemen attended 1,132 incidents involving people unable to extricate themselves from public toilets or their own bathrooms, while one woman called for help after becoming wedged on a lavatory seat, a freedom of information request revealed. Most of the toilet rescue missions were in London, where crews were called out 395 times. Figures revealed firefighters rushed out 41 times on Merseyside, 31 times in Cheshire and 27 in South Wales. In Northern Ireland, an obese 30-year-old woman had to be prised out of a toilet seat using 'manual handling techniques' after becoming 'wedged. A man from Guildford, Surrey, had the ignominy of being rescued by the fire service after accidentally locking himself in a ladies loo. In Barnstaple, North Devon, fire crews had to remove a toilet seat which became stuck on the head of a child. And a Cardiff woman needed rescuing after becoming trapped between a toilet and a wall after falling over. Mick Flanagan, 52, a fire and rescue investigator in South Wales, said it was mostly youngsters rescued after getting trapped in toilets - but not always. He said: 'We had a lady who had fallen between a toilet and a wall and we had to dismantle the toilet.It was a bit comic at the time because she was a bit tipsy and laughing. 'We just unbolted the toilet which gave her and us space to help her up. Thankfully she wasn't injured. 'Most of our calls to bathrooms are children who have shut the door, locked the door and couldn't open the door - and a panicking mum calls us out. 'We would either put a ladder through the window or put a foot through the door.' Figures showed there were 1,132 cases across England, Wales and Northern Ireland of people becoming stuck in toilets and bathrooms. Call out: Firemen said most of the calls were from panicked mothers, whose children had locked themselves in the bathroom . A spokeswoman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said those most at risk from a home accident are the 0-4 years age group and the over-65s. She said: 'During these early years, babies begin to develop and grow more adventurous and inquisitive, and all of a sudden everyday household objects can become potential hazards. 'This is why parental supervision is important. 'Falls account for the majority of non-fatal accidents and many of the fatal and non-fatal accidents to older people are attributable wholly or in part to frailty and failing health. 'This can lead to failure or slowness to see and avoid risks.'","Freedom of information request revealed the catalogue of incidents .

Suited and booted: Natalie Hynde, the daughter of musician Chrissie Hynde, arrives at Brighton Magistrates' Court following her arrest during anti-fracking protests . The daughter of musicians Chrissie Hynde and Ray Davies appeared in court today after she was arrested during anti-fracking protests. Environmental activist Natalie Hynde was charged with trespassing . on railway property at Balcombe in West Sussex on August 18. She had been due to stand trial at Brighton Magistrates's Court in Sussex today, although her case was adjourned until next year. No evidence was heard during today's hearing, with the 30-year-old's trial now set for March 17. The former model arrived at court today dressed in a suit, shirt and pink tie. She was arrested on August 18 as energy company Cuadrilla conducted exploratory drilling on the outskirts of the village at the height of anti-fracking protests. Hynde, of St Leonards-on-Sea denies the single charge of trespassing. Opponents of fracking - which involves high-pressure liquid being pumped deep underground to split shale rock and release gas supplies - feared Balcombe would become a site for the extraction method. In June, a British Geological Survey claimed there may be more than 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas under the North of England alone. Industry experts claim even if 10 per cent is recovered – more than all of the gas produced from the North Sea – it will be enough to power Britain for 50 years. Now a similar study is being carried out in the South, with results expected next spring. Although no fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, took place there, Balcombe was thrust into the national spotlight over the issue, with a number of protestors attempting to block equipment from being taken into the site. Return date: No evidence was heard during today's hearing, with the 30-year-old's trial now set for March 17 . The anti-fracking movement led to dozens of protesters setting up camp outside the drill site and a policing bill of around £4 million, forcing Sussex Police to apply for Home Office help. Campaigners had turned up to the West Sussex site included Bianca Jagger and former Page 3 model Marina Pepper. Hynde, who with her dark hair closely resembles her famous mother, was born in 1983, the year before her parent's four year relationship ended. Protest: Hynde and her friend Simon Medhurst at the Balcombe site . Accused: Hynde denies a charge of trespassing on railway property at the site . During their time together the pair would regularly collaborate musically, with Pretenders recording a version of the Davies-penned I Go To Sleep. Pretenders singer Chrissie, herself an outspoken animal rights activist, went on to marry Jim Kerr of Simple Minds fame and later artist Lucho Brieva, while Mr Davies, of The Kinks was married three times. Hynde, who grew up in north-west London and moved to Leonard’s-on-Sea in Hastings two years ago, works as a painter and decorator. She is also a veteran of the Occupy London campaign.

More than 40 per cent of Britain is to be opened up for fracking as the hunt for shale gas gathers pace. A new map reveals the huge swathes of the country where energy firms will be invited to drill. Stretching from Devon to Aberdeen, the map, published yesterday by the Government, shows the extent of the new areas under consideration for exploratory work. These include much of the South Coast, the Midlands and most of Yorkshire. Fracking has already proved to be hugely controversial, sparking protests in Balcombe in West Sussex when exploratory drilling began this summer. Green groups opposed to the technology said the announcement ‘cast a dark shadow’ over the communities where fracking could take place. But Energy Minister Michael Fallon said the energy reserves had the potential to transform Britain’s economy. A new licensing round will start next summer, with companies expected to be granted up to 150 exploratory licences. The new map reveals 39,000 square miles of land to be considered for exploration, covering 42 per cent of the country. At the moment companies have licences to drill in 7,300 square miles, mostly in Lancashire, Sussex, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. Mr Fallon said: ‘Today marks the next step in unlocking the potential of shale gas in our energy mix. It is an exciting prospect, which could bring growth, jobs and energy security.’ Protests: Fracking has already proved to be controversial, sparking protests in Balcombe in West Sussex . An independent environmental assessment of the new industry, also published yesterday, said fracking could create up to 32,000 jobs and plough £1billion into communities where drilling takes place. But it found that each well would create a significant local impact. Each fracking site could see as many as 51 lorry movements a day for up to three years, said private firm Amec, which produced the report for the Government. That’s the equivalent of one lorry weighing at least three and a half tons, every five minutes of the working day for nearly three years. The report says that this level of activity ‘could have an adverse impact on traffic congestion, noise or air quality’ depending on existing conditions. The report also found that new technology would require 9million cubic metres of water a year, increasing industrial water use by 18 per cent. Up to 2,880 wells would be drilled, the report estimates, producing up to 8.6trillion cubic feet of gas over 20 years – enough to meet British demand for three years. Communities where planning permission is granted will get a £100,000 one-off fee and  1 per cent of revenues throughout the lifetime of the wells, divided between parish and county councils. Support: Designer Vivian Westwood gave her support to the protestors at the fracking site this summer . Mr Fallon, a Conservative, pledged that local councils would have the final say as to whether drilling goes ahead. And the Government expects that up to 7,700 square miles, only a fifth of the land under consideration, may be explored for fracking. But he claimed shale gas could significantly reduce household bills. Green groups say fracking will devastate local environments and prolong reliance on fossil fuels. Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Tony Bosworth said: ‘These plans cast a dark shadow over many communities across Britain who could now face the threat of fracking in their backyard. Greenpeace energy campaigner Anna Jones said: ‘Michael Fallon is desperate to put a positive spin on this report, but what it actually shows is that the Government wants to open two-thirds of England up to fracking, with all the associated risks.’ Keith Taylor, Green MEP for south-east England, said: ‘The Government is ramping up their pro-fracking rhetoric ahead of issuing the next round of licences but campaigners and concerned residents won’t be tricked into believing the hype.’","South Coast, the Midlands and most of Yorkshire earmarked .

Lee Culley, 44, who lives in a boat on the river claims he witnessed at least two ducklings being killed during one race. He also said he has spotted other dead birds and a mother looking for her missing young.‘It was absolutely disgusting,’ he said. ‘They just sped through even though I shouted to them, warning them about the ducks. ‘They just kept on going and their blades went through the ducks and killed two. The ducks were only three weeks old. ‘Another one died the next day and the mother has none but keeps coming back to my boat looking for the brood. ‘I am worried about the other wildlife. We just don’t have that much of it left on the river because there are just too many rowers.’ The May Bumps were this year held over three days from Wednesday to yesterday (FRI). Careful: Cambridge University have said every effort is made so as to not harm wildlife . Cambridge University Combined Boat Clubs, which runs the event, said: ‘Every effort is being made to mitigate disturbance to wildlife and to keep ducks and other waterfowl out of the way of racing boats. ‘Indeed, the start of the men’s second division on Wednesday night was delayed by 15 minutes while a family of ducks were guided out of harm’s way. ‘We are very sorry to hear of the incident Mr Culley apparently witnessed and will be briefing stewards to be extra vigilant. ‘The rowing community, the Cam Conservators residential boaters and Cambridge Animal Rights have met and formed the Cam River Users Group (CRUG) to discuss the issues surrounding river use and wildlife.’ ‘Bumping’ started in the 1820s as a way that crews from a number of colleges could race at the same time on the narrow river. Rather than race side-by-side, the crews are spread down a stretch of the river with one and a half boat lengths (about 90 feet) of clear water between them. The object of ‘bumping’ is to catch up and bump into the crew in front, without being caught from behind.","Residents say boats 'ploughed through' groups of young ducks .

A Florida family got the shock of their lives on Christmas when their house was broken into by a bear in search of a late-night snack. The black bear, taller than a full-grown man when standing on its hind legs, was caught red-handed with its paws in the cookie jar, or rather, the turkey oil pot. Tramaine Gaines, of Lake Mary, central Florida, filmed the animal sniffing around the back patio of his home on Redwood Grove Terrace after it had broken through the screen door just hours after he and his family had finished eating their Christmas dinner. Scroll down for video... Yum, what's the smell? Homeowner, Tramaine Gaines, right, said he saw the bear heading straight for a pot filled with turkey oil that was sitting out on a table in his back patio. The animal had broken through a screen door to get a closer whiff of what he was hoping to be food . Gaines said he thought at first it was a burglar breaking into his house, until he saw the bear heading straight for a pot filled with turkey oil. ‘He bust through and came to this can where he thought a turkey was, Gaines told CBS Local 6. ‘He stood up on his hind legs when he stood up on his legs he was as tall as me.’ Gaines said the bear returned a few days later and walked through his patio in search of food. 'The first time it was really funny,' Gaines told the ABC. 'This time I’m a little more concerned.' Bears can smell food from a mile away and will eat almost anything as they pack on extra calories before winter, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. ‘The bear was just being a bear at the end of the day. If you have food out they're going to find it,’ said Gaines. ‘We have to coexist even if it gets a little rough sometimes.’ Bear intruder: The animal was caught on camera sneaking around the patio of a home in Lake Mary, Florida, searching for a late-night snack. It returned a few days later . Close encounters: The incident was the latest in a string of recent bear sightings in residential communities in Central Florida, such as this one which was spotted walking through a backyard . The harrowing incident is just the latest in a number of recent close encounters with bears in Central Florida. A 200-pound female bear was suspected of mauling and seriously injuring a central Florida woman earlier this month . Susan Chalfant, 54, was injured by a bear while out walking her two small dogs an evening in Longwood, a leafy residential area about 15 miles north of Orlando. And just a few days ago a black bear was seen walking through the backyard of another home in the area. FWC warned residents of the importance of locking up food products, and to make sure to take out the trash the morning of pickup instead of the night before.","Black bear broke through the screen door of a home in Lake Mary, Central Florida .

HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will likely face new questions after Jan. 1 about how many -- or how few -- Obamacare enrollees have made payments and are actually covered . The Department of Health and Human Services is in mid-victory-lap over its enrollment of an estimated 2.1 million Americans into Obamacare insurance plans, a figure claimed in a blog post Tuesday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. But as many as half of those customers have yet to make a payment, a new report suggests. The Wall Street Journal interviewed Mark Waterstraat, the chief strategy officer at a firm that processes billings for insurers. He said that only about 50 per cent of enrollees in 17 states have paid their bills for the first month's premium. That statistic, if it were to hold true across the nation, indicates that more than 1 million Americans counted in the Obama administration's total aren't actually covered by medical insurance. Waterstraat's statistics cover more than 100 health insurance companies, which typically don't issue insurance cards or consider a new customer 'enrolled' until they receive payments. But the Obama administration has included in its public numbers everyone who has selected a plan – regardless of whether they have paid for it. Marilyn Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, wrote Tuesday on the agency's blog that '[t]he most recent data indicates that more than 2.1 million people nationwide have enrolled in a private health insurance plan through a new Health Insurance Marketplace since October 1.' That number would include enrollments from the District of Columbia and from 14 states that don't participate in the chronically troubled healthcare.gov website portal. But Waterstraat's statement suggests that half of them either incorrectly believe they are insured, haven't received a bill, or are still deciding whether to pay. Surge: As healthcare.gov's tech glitches were ironed out in December, more than 1 million new enrollees entered the system -- but how many of them have paid their bills? Think you're covered? Better have one of these: More than 1 million Americans may expect insurance coverage on Jan. 1 but haven't paid their premiums . 'We haven't written a check yet, because . no one has asked me for one,' Kelly Turner, a Fairfax, Virginia . homemaker, told MailOnline. 'This could be a disaster if I get hit by a . bus tomorrow, God forbid.' Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius blogged earlier on Tuesday that enrollees are largely on their own if they're not sure whether their sign-ups are complete. 'If . consumers have questions about their new private insurance coverage, . they can contact their insurance company directly,' wrote Sebelius. Few . appear to have taken that advice. The Wall Street Journal reported that . one health plan based in Temple, Texas only received first month's . premiums from 35 of its new customers. Some insurers expect customers to try to create their own proof of insurance. 'We anticipate that people will be using screen printouts' from . insurance exchange websites, the Journal heard from Donna Zimmerman, . vice president of government and community relations at HealthPartners, a . Minnesota insurer. Bad air out, good air in: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services chief operating officer Michelle Snyder (L) has stepped down as the Obamacare website saga nears its end; and CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner (R) now claims 2.1 million people have enrolled overall . Big picture: President Obama's public opinion ratings are still suffering from his false promises that Americans could keep their health care plans; many of the new enrollees are those who lost coverage anyway . Sebelius counseled Americans Tuesday on her blog to 'get your insurance card or a temporary card with your new plan’s information.' 'If you don’t have your card yet, ask your insurance company to give you another way to confirm your coverage.' But for those Americans who haven't paid, that proof will be impossible to get. 'It's bad enough that the coverage is nearly twice as expensive as what my family had least year,' said Turner, the perplexed Virginian. 'But what good is the plan if I can't prove I've signed up?'","In a blog post on one of the year's quietest news days, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services claimed 2.1 million sign-ups for Obamacare .
But an executive at a health insurance billing company says only half of enrollees have paid premiums in 17 states where his company has clients .
That would leave more than 1 million Americans possibly thinking they're insured on Jan. 1 – but having no medical coverage at all .
Many of them are expected to bring website printouts to doctor's offices instead of insurance cards, but it's unclear how physicians will react ."
"By . Janet Tappin Coelho In Rio De Janeiro . PUBLISHED: . 07:47 EST, 30 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:58 EST, 30 December 2013 . Football fans trying to avoid the rip-off prices being charged by hotels during Brazil’s World Cup next June are booking into Rio de Janeiro’s notorious favelas amid reports of an alarming increase in crime rates in the city. The hillside communities, which are home to some of the poorest families in Rio, have a history of violent crime and drug trafficking. But some are offering accommodation deals enviable for their breathtaking views from their elevated locations, near-to-the-beach convenience and budget-conscious prices of at least a third of the £300 a night average price being charged by hotels during the FIFA games. Room with a shanty town view: Rocinha as seen from the Rocinha Guesthouse . In Rocinha, the largest favela in Brazil, a recent escalation in shootouts between rival drug gangs and the police since November, following the arrest of 25 officers for the alleged murder of a resident, Amarildo de Souza, has not prevented supporters from booking into the Rocinha Guesthouse. Situated right at the top of the shanty-town and offering a stunning panorama of hundreds of pastel painted brick and wooden houses built haphazardly on the side of the mountain, the Rocinha Guesthouse is a family concern with two guest rooms: a mixed dorm offering six beds with an outside shared bathroom and a two bed en-suite. ‘We are already booked out for the World Cup. We have people coming from the UK, America and Europe. Some will stay for a day, for a week or a fortnight,’ revealed 18-year-old Oberdan Basilio, who manages the guesthouse with his mother, Neusa, 56. The Rocinha Guesthouse: Pictured left is the outside of the accommodation and right is a shot of a mixed-dorm room for six people . Decor: The Rocinha Guesthouse comes with graffiti on the bedroom walls . Basilio, who was born in Rocinha, says the hillside slum is a safe place so long as tourists don’t take unnecessary risks. In May this year, a German tourist was shot in an alley and seriously wounded in the stomach while visiting the slum with a friend, without a guide. Crime figures released this month by Brazil’s Public Security Institute (ISP) for Rio de Janeiro indicate a worrying increase in murders, robberies and rapes in the city just months before the World Cup kicks off. In the ISP research comparing September this year to September 2012, murders in the capital grew by 17.5 per cent from 97 cases to 114. There were 409 cases of thefts against 191, a jump of 114 per cent and reported rapes rose from 150 to 179, an increase of 19 per cent. ’There are dangerous places in Rocinha because the drug dealing still goes on even though we have a large police presence operating here. The trouble is Rocinha is too big to be controlled by the police and so crime still happens,’ Basilio explained matter-of-factly. Hosts: Neusa and Oberdan Basiliio, who run the Rocinha Guesthouse . ‘I always tell our guests to stay on the main street. Don’t go wandering into the warren-like alleyways without a guide. Rocinha is huge and it’s very easy to get lost and put yourself in danger,’ he warned.British Foreign Office advice warns that: ‘All favelas are unpredictably dangerous areas. Violence... can occur at anytime.’ Ironically, a survey by the ISP marking five years this month since the first Pacifying Police Unite, or UPP, was installed in Santa Marta, found that in 18 out of the 36 pacified favelas, where 252,500 people live, there were 8.7 deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants. This makes a number of the shanty-towns, not including Rocinha, some of the safest places to live as the figure represents less than half the average murder rate in the country, which is 24.3 per 100 thousand. Dangerous: The violent Rocinha favela (left) is rabbit warren of alleyways and it's easy to get lost. Pictured right is the Alzira de Alleluia Guesthouse in the Vidigal favela . Cristiana de Oliveira, 44, runs the 24-bed Favela Inn in Chapeu Mangueira, a shanty-town in Leme in the south zone of Rio. ‘Our favela is very peaceful. You don’t see any armed drug dealers walking around anymore. I have lived here nearly all my life and since the arrival of the UPP, I can sincerely tell my guests that they are safe walking here late at night and early in the morning.’ Quenia de Alleluia, 32, is hoping for record bookings from football fans in June at her Alzira de Alleluia Guesthouse in the Vidigal favela. ‘The money from our guests contributes to the sustainability of our community project which runs educational courses and football classes for the youngsters in the favela,’ explained de Alleluia. Cristiana de Oliveira looks out from her multi-coloured Favela Inn Guesthouse in Chapeu Mangueira . ‘Whoever comes to stay in our Guesthouse  is not just getting a good deal and an amazing experience, but they are giving something back to the community as well,’ she added. Her accommodation can be found on the Brazilian apartment and room rental website Favela Experience, which was set up by American-born Elliot Rosenberg a year ago. The site offers a budget conscious choice of hundreds of beds in Rio’s favelas. ‘We have different levels of accommodation so our prices vary according to the property,’ Rosenberg explained. ‘A single bed per night in the Rocinha Guesthouse is £30 a night, but in the nearby Vidigal favela we have a studio apartment en-suite with five beds, next to the beach for £90 a night per person. All come with breakfast and a laundry service,’ he said. ‘People often come to a favela with low expectations, they imagine it to be squalid and dingy but they are pleasantly surprised when they arrive. Favelas have a higher level of comfort than many outsiders expect,’ argued Rosenberg. Heather Watson, a 36-year-old teacher from Canada is staying at the Rocinha Guesthouse for the second time in two years. ‘The community is so vibrant and full of women and children and people who work very hard. The criminal element is not representative of the people here,’ Watson observed. ‘It’s a densely packed place. There are people everywhere, there’s light everywhere and there’s sound everywhere. I feel part of a close-knit community and I feel safe here,’ she added.","Murders in Rio de Janeiro have soared by 17.5 per cent year on year .

Common sense tells us that people with similar personality traits tend to flock together, and according to a new study, the same principle holds true for Americans living in different parts of the U.S. Research conducted by Dr Peter J. Rentfrow, of the University of Cambridge, has revealed that Americans living in the north-central Great Plains and the South tend to be conventional and friendly; those who reside in the Western and Eastern seaboards can be described as relaxed and creative, while New England and Mid-Atlantic dwellers are prone to being temperamental and uninhibited. The study dividing the map of the U.S. into three regions marked by distinct personalities was published online October 14 by the American Psychological Association’s Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Age-old stereotypes: A new study has revealed that Americans living in the north-central Great Plains and the South tend to be conventional and friendly, but also fairlt poor and less educated . Free spirits: Those who reside in coastal states like California and Oregon can be described as relaxed and creative . The scientists looked at the personality traits of more than 1.5milion Americans from 48 states and Washington DC by asking willing participants of various online surveys and Facebook to answer questions about their character traits and demographic factors, including their place of residence. After 12 years spent collecting data, the researchers were able to identify three psychological profiles based on five broad dimensions of personality, known as the Big Five — openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. When the research team juxtaposed the results of the study with the map of the U.S., they detected distinct psychological profiles associated with three geographic regions. ‘These national clusters of personalities also relate to a region’s politics, economy, social attitudes and health,’ Rentfrow said in a press release. Feisty: The 12-year survey that included some 1.5million participants determined that New Engenders and residents of New York are temperamental and uninhibited, but also neurotic . The study found that people who live in the friendly and conventional states like Minnesota and South Dakota tend to be poorer, less educated, more politically conservative and less healthy compared to people in other parts of the country. The research was led by Dr Peter J. Rentfrow, of the University of Cambridge, and the study was published online by the American Psychological Association's Journal of Personality and Social Psychology . Americans who reside in relaxed and creative states, such as California and Oregon, are more ethnically and culturally diverse, more liberal in their political persuasions, tend to have more money, higher level of education and better health in comparison to dwellers of other states. The temperamental and uninhibited portion of the U.S., which includes New York and Massachusetts, has more female residents and people who are older and wealthier. They also tend to be more liberal in their political views. The researchers also calculated an average value for each of the Big Five personality traits for each state, according to LiveScience. According to a chart presenting the findings, Washington DC residents are the least agreeable, followed by New Yorkers in close second. Wisconsinites were the most extroverted, while those who call Maine their home were the least conscientious. Colorado was revealed to be the least neurotic state, while DC residents distinguished themselves by the degree of their openness.","Data was collected over 12 years from more than 1.5million people living in 48 states and the District of Columbia .

It's a story that's sure to make you second-guess ever using second-hand furniture again. A woman who picked up a couch off the street in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was shocked to discover the furniture was home to a boa constrictor two months after she had been using it every day. Holly Wright told ABC13 on Tuesday that she and her boyfriend had given the couch a good once-over before bringing it home, never suspecting that a snake lived inside. It had a 'for free' sign on it outside someone's house and was in pretty good condition. Scroll down for video . Two months after she moved a second hand couch into her bedroom, Grand Rapids woman Holly Wright discovered a boa constrictor was living under the cushions. Holly Wright, sitting on the second-hand couch that she discovered a boa constrictor in, has now put the lounge out front of her house with 'Don't Pick Up' scrawled across it in marker . Holly Wright shows a video of her upturned couch and the snake that was living inside of it for two months without her realizing . 'We smelled it and everything-- it looked OK,' she said. 'We peeled off the cushions, cleaned it up, never saw anything.' But over the weekend the four-foot creature slithered out from the lounge. 'It's been living in the couch for like two months in my bedroom and I had no idea and it looks pretty big,' Wright said. She added that the snake wasn’t too menacing, and instead appeared 'lethargic' and likely hadn’t eaten in a long time. 'It didn't really react or hiss, but when we poked it with a coat hanger it coiled up a little bit, so at that point we flipped the couch over,' she said. Scary: Holly Wright could not believe there had been a snake inside her couch for so long . 'It was quite cold in the room, there was no food for the snake and I think it came out of the couch because it was dying.' Indeed, the spooky reptile died before Wright could take it to an animal rehabilitator. She buried it under a tree and put the couch back on the street — with “Do Not Pick Up” scrawled across it. The creepy discovery was still sinking in. The couch was often used by Holly Wright - who said she read 'a few novels' on it - and her dog. Luckily the snake did not harm either of them . 'Sometimes my dog would sit up there! I would drink a cup of coffee, check emails - I read a few novels on that couch,' she said. 'My room almost feels a little empty now. It's been really sad actually to realize all this time I was in proximity to that animal (that) was probably suffering.'

Power company which left tens of thousands of customers without electricity on Christmas Day are due to pay out millions of pounds in compensation. Southern Electric, who made a profit of £1.4bn last year, failed to get electricity to 19,500 users in south Hampshire, Surrey and West Sussex on December 25 due to flood damage. On Tuesday afternoon it confirmed it would pay £75 compensation to every customer, regardless of how long the outage lasted, bringing its bill to almost £1.5million. Power companies are facing payouts worth millions of pounds to customers after leaving tens of thousands without electricity over Christmas . UK Power Networks, who had 30,000 customers in Sussex, Surrey and Kent without power on Christmas Day have matched the offer - treble the legal minimum of £27 - costing them another £2.5million. However the total bill is likely to be higher as customers without power for 60 hours are paid more, and are then paid again for every 12 additional hours it takes to get the problem fixed. Southern Electric will be writing to every customer who is able to receive the payment to inform them, while UK Power Networks is asking customers to write to them if they think they are eligible. Some UK Power Networks customers were still without electricity five days after the Christmas Eve storms, as the CEO Basil Scarsella admitted fixing power lines had taken so long because engineers were on holiday. Meanwhile politicians have lined up to criticise the power companies' performance, with MP Tim Yeo confirming that bosses will be called before parliament in the new year to explain themselves. He told the Telegraph: 'I'm very concerned about how long the network distribution companies took to restore power to thousands of customers. The Committee will call them in when the House gets back. There were just four people left without power on Monday in Kent, but bad weather is now forecast for the rest of January raising fears of more outages . 'I'm already concerned that these distribution companies are not properly scrutinised by Ofgem, despite being effectively monopolies. Their performance over Christmas was unacceptable.' Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, said that energy companies had failed to prepare for the bad weather by sending too many staff away on holiday. He branded the poor performance 'unacceptible' and said that bosses had let their customers down badly. Under the law energy companies are required to pay £27 to any customer without power for 48 hours, and then pay another £54 for anyone without electricity for between 60 and 72 hours. Customers are then paid again every 12 hours until the problem is fixed, up to a maximum of £216. However UK Power Networks said last week that it would voluntarily treble the initial payout to £75 as a 'gesture of goodwill', with customers being paid £108 after that, up to a maximum of £432. Today Southern Electric matched that offer, adding that anyone who experienced a power outage on Christmas Day qualified for the £75 payout, no matter how long it lasted.","Southern Electric and UK Power Networks to pay customers for outages .

Hopes for a better new year for the 1.3 million Americans out of work were crushed today as federal unemployment benefits expired. With Congress in recess, no last-minute fix is possible meaning that those who have already dipped into savings and made other cutbacks will be left struggling to provide for their families. Perhaps surprisingly, many of those affected will be middle class workers who had previously earned  up to $70,000 a year until the recession hit. Helping hand: Figures from the Department of Labor show the previous salary brackets of those on Extended Unemployment Compensation . About 40 per cent of Americans who received long-term unemployment benefits since 2008 had been earning $30,000 to $75,000 before losing their jobs, according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Previous research by the Congressional Budget Office showed more than two thirds of recipients had incomes more than twice the poverty level, the Huffington Post reported. The figures show that the unemployment insurance, first offered by President George W Bush to provide a safety net for those hit by the recession, is mainly serving the middle class. A further problem for some of the job seekers receiving the benefits is that a steady career in a professional field, and advanced age, has limited their ability to find new work. One such person is David Torian, an Ivy-League educated lawyer with 23 years' congressional experience who lost his job in 2012. Safety net: A graph shows the number of people receiving the benefit, introduced in 2008 to help after the recession . Widespread: A table shows the number of people in each state who receive the benefit . 'I get interviews but lose out in the . end because prospective employers tell me my experience makes me ""over-qualified"" and they do not feel I would stay long in the position . if it was offered,' Mr Torian told The Huffington Post. For just over a year the 49-year-old has been receiving the unemployment benefit - about $430 a week. But that came to an end on Wednesday. Mr Torian has already made cutbacks, moving to a cheaper home and spending his savings and 401(k) accounts. He said he can afford to pay rent for the next three months but if he can't find work by then he is not sure what will happen. 'I'm in an out of depression mode,' he said, adding that he had looked at blue collar work but lacks the background or skills needed for that. When Congress returns on January 6, President Obama and the Democrats are expected to push to have the benefits renewed. The benefits are an extension for the unemployed once their state jobless benefits expire - which in many states happens after 26 weeks. Republicans are expected to try to block attempts to renew the benefits, but Democrats have been gaining momentum for their push by highlighting personal stories of some of those about to be cut off. They have also seized on a comment made by Republican Rand Paul who said extended the benefits would be a 'disservice' and give those out of work less of an incentive to find jobs quickly. Critical: Senator Rand Paul has said the benefit was giving the unemployed less of an incentive to find new work . Push: President Obama, pictured in the White House before the holidays, wants the benefit program to be reinstated . Mr Paul's comments hit a nerve with Bruce Hirshfield, who lost his job and six-figure salary when the bank he was vice-president of was restructured. 'My motivation is not about getting unemployment benefits. My motivation is to get back to where I was,' the father-of-three said. 'I understand what [Rand Paul] is saying, but he is dead wrong.' After losing his job, Mr Hirshfield took a course in project management to add to his professional skills, and extended the area in which he is looking for work. But the 54-year-old has now been unemployed for 14 months, and has been forced to turn to his savings and pension to provide for his family. His experiences echo those of tens of thousands of other Americans who have been striving to get back into work, and who will now struggle now the benefit has been cut. Temporary measures to help are being discussed, but with Congress away until January 6 no immediate relief will be available. President Obama has taken time out over the holidays to speak with Democrat Jack Reed and Republican Dean Heller, who are sponsoring a measure to temporarily extend the benefits. 'As the president has repeatedly made clear, it defies economic sense, precedent and our values to allow 1.3 million Americans fighting to find jobs to see their unemployment insurance abruptly cut off,' Gene Sperling, of the White House National Economic Council, said.","40 per cent of those claiming financial aid had been earning up to $70,000 .

Chicken has officially overtaken beef as the most popular meat product being consumed in the U.S. and the trend looks likely to continue in 2014. While the per capita consumption of beef has dropped from a peak of 90lbs per capita in the 1970s to 50 lbs in 2012, chicken consumption has gone the other way rising from under 20 lbs in 1960 to about 55 lbs in 2012. Americans now eat less beef then we did in 1955, but is the change a result of a healthier diet or because people are choosing the cheaper option? Chicken has officially overtaken beef as the most popular meat product being consumed in the U.S. due to price and health concerns . The answer is a bit both, as there is considerable evidence to backup the negative impact of both on the consumption of beef. Beef has always been the more expensive option, but over the past 20 years, the price of beef has risen dramatically when compared to other options such as broiler (chicken) and pork. The cost of beef has also been negatively impacted by the decreasing total inventory of calf and cattle in America, which hit a 60-year low in 2013, reports Priceonomics. Rising oil and grain prices, as well as NGOs that oppose meat consumption have all been blamed by the CME Daily Livestock Report. The growing popularity of chicken can also be attributed to the fact that white meat is considered to be a healthier option than beef .

Tory MP Zac Goldsmith has fuelled doubts over David Cameron’s leadership, saying he lacks vision and praising ‘magical’ Boris Johnson as his potential successor. The multi-millionaire MP openly questioned what Mr Cameron stood for and drew a sharp contrast with the clarity of Margaret Thatcher’s politics, saying: ‘Thatcherism – most people understand what that means. But if you ask what Cameronism means, you’d struggle to answer. ‘It’s not clear where we’re heading and it’s not clear what the underlying vision is.’ Zac Goldsmith said that Cameron's politics lacks vision and clarity, as he compares it to Margaret Thatcher . Mr Goldsmith went out of his way to heap praise on Mr Johnson, the Mayor of London. He said: ‘I’m a big fan of Boris, I make no secret of that. It’s very plausible to imagine him being the leader of our party one day, and I think he’d be a very good one.’ He added: ‘I see him as a very serious figure as he’s unique in British politics .  .  . whatever that magic is, he’s got it.’ The Mail on Sunday revealed last year that Mr Goldsmith had secretly offered to give up his seat representing Richmond Park and North Kingston to allow Mr Johnson to return to Westminster. Goldsmith added that talk of leadership coups against Cameron were damaging the party . He praised London Mayor Boris Johnson's 'magic' and said that he is a plausible leader of the Tory party . His remarks, in the latest edition of Total Politics magazine, come amid fresh speculation that more Tory MPs are poised to demand a vote of no confidence in their leader. Mr Goldsmith made clear that talk of leadership coups was undermining Mr Cameron and damaging the party. Zac Goldsmith was outspoken in his interview with Total Politics . The MP, who described the Prime Minister as ‘very capable’, warned: ‘It doesn’t help to have leadership attempts, speculation or conspiracy coups.’ But Mr Goldsmith called on Mr Cameron to show more ‘clarity’ in the run-up to the next Election. His criticism is the latest in a series of rows between the two men, who were once close political allies and friends. Two months ago, Mr Goldsmith – former editor of the Ecologist magazine – infuriated the Mr Cameron by forcing a U-turn on new planning laws. An outraged Prime Minister issued a stinging rebuke, saying: ‘Who does that man think he’s accountable to?’ And last year, Mr Goldsmith, who before the Election was Mr Cameron’s environmental adviser, accused the Prime Minister of ‘political deception’ for allegedly capitulating to big business over genetically modified crops. He has also said Tory plans to perform a U-turn on building a third runway at Heathrow would be an ‘unbearable betrayal’ for his constituents under the flight path. In the Total Politics interview with fellow Tory MP Rob Wilson he repeated his vow not to stand as a Tory candidate at the next Election if the runway went ahead.","Goldsmith criticised David Cameron, saying he lacks vision .

Taxpayers have been landed with a £67,000 legal aid bill by paedophile Stuart Hazell – who put the family of Tia Sharp through a murder trial before eventually admitting the crime. Despite overwhelming evidence, he initially denied killing the 12-year-old, but he changed his plea five days into the Old Bailey trial in May. Hazell, the 37-year-old boyfriend of Tia's grandmother, Christine Bicknell, was jailed for a minimum of 38 years. Jailed: Killer Stuart Hazell (left) eventually admitted murdering Tia Sharp (right) Details of his legal bill are likely to deepen the row surrounding taxpayer-funded defence costs. Last month it emerged that Mark Bridger, who murdered April Jones, received £150,000 from the taxpayer while dragging her distraught family through the courts. The former slaughterman, 48, who kept child pornography and pictures of dead youngsters on his laptop, abducted and murdered five-year-old April in October 2012 before butchering and disposing of her body. Two months earlier Hazell smothered Tia in the early hours after being left alone to babysit her while Miss Bicknell worked overnight at a care home. He photographed the schoolgirl's naked dead body before wrapping it in sheets and bin liners and hiding it in the loft, where it was found a week later during the fourth police search of the house in New Addington, South London. Hazell, the 37-year-old boyfriend of Tia's grandmother, Christine Bicknell, was jailed for a minimum of 38 years. He is pictured here being interviewed by ITV before Tia's body was found . After the murder, he told Miss Bicknell that Tia had gone shopping in Croydon and had left without her phone. He later claimed she had died in an accident. But Hazell's DNA was found on her clothes and her blood was found on his belt, leading the prosecution to accuse him of sexually assaulting Tia before her death. In the weeks before the murder, he had repeatedly photographed and filmed the 12-year-old as she slept. Evidence of his obsession with child porn also undermined his story. Despite the mass of evidence, Hazell insisted he was innocent, forcing the case all the way to the Old Bailey and exposing Tia's family to the appalling details of what happened to her. Following a Freedom of Information request, the Ministry of Justice revealed that Hazell's attempt to dodge justice had cost £67,341 in legal aid. The ministry said anyone could apply for legal aid but it was 'determined' to bring down costs. A spokesman added: 'At a time when everyone has to tighten their belts, we can't ignore the fact that legal aid is costing hardworking taxpayers too much. We are determined to tackle this.'","Stuart Hazell, 37,  initially denied killing the 12-year-old .

Proud parents: Iraq war veteran Hannah Campbell . is miraculously pregnant despite a gun shot . wound to her womb . When soldier Hannah Campbell was shot in the stomach while serving in Iraq, she was told she would never be able to have a baby. The brave 28-year-old was given the devastating news by doctors after being dug out from underneath the rubble of a blasted building. A high velocity bullet had badly damaged the corporal’s womb, while the building’s collapse left her blind in one eye and with her leg so badly shattered it had to be amputated. Despite being ‘absolutely devastated’ by the news she would never conceive, she felt lucky to be alive. But now, against all the odds, Miss Campbell has astonished doctors by becoming pregnant. The former soldier, who has weekly scans to check on the strength of her womb, is six months pregnant by her long-term partner, Anthony McMorrow, 32, and has so far had a healthy pregnancy. The couple say they are ‘delighted’ to be expecting a daughter, who they plan to name Lexi-River Antonia McMorrow. From their home in Northampton, Miss Campbell told how she discovered she was expecting her ‘miracle’ baby on a routine visit to her doctor. ‘It was totally unexpected,’ she said. ‘The room started spinning. I just remember muttering: “Oh my god. No, that can’t be possible,” and I just walked out in a daze. ‘I was in such a state I then got back in the car and drove back to the doctor as I needed him to tell me again. He had to repeat himself five times as I just didn’t believe it. ‘It was only then that it began to sink in and I felt utter joy and excitement that something so wonderful and miraculous had happened against all the odds.’ Miss Campbell already has a daughter, Milly, eight, from a previous relationship and says this is what comforted her when she was told she would never conceive – even though she had always wanted a big family. She is now a beauty therapist and plans to set up a business with her partner in the New Year. Miss Campbell was deployed with 47 Artillery Regiment on sentry duty in Basra when insurgents opened fire and hit the building she was guarding with a mortar bomb on June 18, 2007. ‘There was no warning. The building was flattened and I was underneath it. I was later told US Special Forces took two and a half hours to dig me out,’ she said. Her first terrifying realisation was that the debris was packed so tightly against her face, she could not move her lips and could barely breathe. ‘I can remember screaming so they could find me. I had a cardiac arrest when they got to me so I must have been holding on just for them,’ she said. Miss Campbell, who was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder following her ordeal, has shown incredible strength and bravery in getting on with her life back home. Miss Campbell in her uniform as part of Windsor Platoon - 2 Section Army Training Regiment, Winchester in 2002. She was badly hurt when Iraqi fighters attacked the building she was guarding in Basra in 2007 . She was left in a coma for three weeks and was partially blinded in one eye by the blast as a metal pole had pierced her face. She needed plastic surgery and today has just 20 per cent vision in her left eye. Her left hand was almost split in two and she had bleeding on the brain. A second pole had pierced the top of her leg, leaving her lower left leg and foot almost completely shattered. She was flown to Birmingham’s Selly Oak Hospital where she had 19 operations. It was three years later that she decided to have her leg amputated as she was living in constant pain. ‘I’d become redundant as a mother. The pain meant I was unable to bathe Milly, I was confined to a wheelchair and my weight ballooned to 21-and-a-half stone,’ she said. But Miss Campbell, who joined the army in order to become an army nurse which she is now unable to do given her injuries, is focusing on the future. She said: ‘Most people I meet have no idea I served in Iraq. ‘They just see me as a proud mum at the school gate. It’s not that I hide my past, but I don’t dwell on it either. I live for today. Even after what happened I have no regrets as it’s made me a stronger person.’","Hannah Campbell was shot and trapped beneath fallen building in Basra .

"By . Sir Andrew Motion . PUBLISHED: . 19:30 EST, 31 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:33 EST, 1 January 2014 . As we reach 2014, we come to a fork in the road. In one direction runs a path to a greener, fairer and happier society, nourished by urban regeneration, energy efficiency, and proper protection of the environment. In the other direction runs a stony track surrounded by blighted landscapes, where inner cities and derelict sites are left to rot. Warning: Sir Andrew Motion warns the emerging political consensus, with its 'gung-ho emphasis on growth', promises a future of urban sprawl and exploitation of the natural world . Are we really prepared to head down that dismal route? To risk so much of what is precious to us and worth celebrating in our environment? To allow our appetite for economic success to create such pollution, such waste, such damage? Unhappily, it seems that we ordinary people may have no say in the matter. The emerging political consensus, with its gung-ho emphasis on growth, promises a future of urban sprawl and exploitation of the natural world, whichever leaders we elect. Awareness: The former Poet Laureate says politicans need to recognise the rising public anger about the loss of our green spaces . Unless, that is, our politicians think again and recognise the rising public anger about the loss of our green spaces. CPRE has warned repeatedly about the Coalition’s planning policies, arguing that they have made England’s countryside – our priceless national inheritance – more vulnerable than ever. But the situation is even more worrying now the Opposition has jumped on the same bandwagon: for their ‘right to grow’, read ‘right to sprawl’. The solution to our urgent housing needs is not to smear housing estates across open countryside, even if they are dolled up as ‘eco-towns’ or ‘garden cities’. Especially since they probably won’t be affordable to those most in need of a home. Only by concentrating a building programme on England’s 1.5 million brownfield sites can we meet our triple need: to save the countryside, revitalise our cities, and provide the necessary increase in new homes. Economic growth continues to be the politicians’ mantra, and fair enough. But we need green growth that respects the environment and our primal connection with the land. We can’t just go for growth and ignore the reality of climate change, attempting what a Treasury minister has called ‘the biggest programme of infrastructure development since the Victorian era’. The Victorians didn’t have to think about their carbon footprints. We do. And yet all our politicians’ stories about the growth of infrastructure depend on us consuming more fossil fuels, on building more roads and runways. Even farming is implicated in this, with wind and solar farms industrialising the countryside they set out to preserve. So often, this industrialisation simply isn’t necessary. The Energy Minister himself has pointed out that we can meet solar energy targets by installing panels on just 16 per cent of UK commercial and industrial roof-space. And we can dramatically reduce the amount of energy infrastructure we need – and improve our energy security – by focusing on energy efficiency. Driven by a dismaying short-termism, our leaders want to embark on a second industrial revolution in order to compete in ‘the global race’. But the difference in scale alone means we can never compete with the largest economies in the world. So let’s stop pretending we can, and instead make the most of our own particular, distinctive attributes and advantages. Maintaining our irreplaceable countryside must lie at the heart of that ambition. Not just for the sense of benefit and wellbeing that is essential to our humanity, but for good practical reasons as well: for the huge contribution that rural tourism and farming make to the Exchequer.","Former Poet Laureate condemns British government for 'gung-ho' policies .

Fine: Chinese film director Zhang Yimou, is facing a £100 million lawsuit, after being accused of fathering seven children . One of China's most celebrated film directors has said he broke the country's strict one-child policy because of an ancient traditional belief that having multiple children would lead to greater prosperity. Zhang Yimou, who directed hit movies House of Flying Daggers and Hero as well as the opening and closing ceremonies at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, is now facing a £100million fine after months of rumours that he fathered as many as seven children. He has admitted having two sons and a daughter with his current wife and a daughter with his ex wife, in a statement. Zhang, who faces an official penalty largely based on his and his wife's income in the years before each child was born, also claimed that one year he only earned $450. In an interview with the official Xinhua news agency on Sunday, the director said he broke the law because his father told him before dying that he wanted a grandson to 'carry on the family name'. He said: 'Traditionally my parents and I thought the more children one has, the more prosperous the family would be.' The one-child policy was put in place to control China's booming population, and officials say it has been key to the country's rising prosperity. But with demographic experts warning of a labour shortage within the next two decades, China's Communist Party leaders last month moved to expand the exceptions to the policy after a key meeting in Beijing, allowing couples to have two children if one of the parents is an only child. Zhang has come under mounting criticism for taking advantage of his fame and wealth, but said his family had suffered because they had broken the rules, according to the report. 'We were hiding here and there as ""extra-birth guerillas""', Zhang said, referring to a TV comedy in the 1990s about a couple who went on the run to have multiple babies. 'My fault has negatively affected my children's childhood significantly,' he added. Controversial: China's one-child policy was put in place to . control China's booming population, and officials say it has been key to . the country's rising prosperity . Critics . say China's late-1970s family-planning law, which restricts most . couples to one child, is selectively and sometimes brutally enforced, . while the wealthy and well-connected are easily able to pay the fines . levied for extra offspring. But some users of China's popular online social networks . have directed their anger at the policy itself, rather than Zhang, with . some hoping the attention heaped on his case may hasten the eventual . demise of the law, which authorities have recently moved to relax. The . policy was put in place to control China's booming population, and . officials say it has been key to the country's rising prosperity. But . opposition to it has steadily grown among members of the public as well . as among demographic experts, who warn that it has led to a decline in . China's working-age population and a swelling of the ranks of the . elderly that could bring about a labour shortage within the next two . decades. Those fears appear to be shared by . China's Communist Party leaders, who after a key meeting in Beijing last . month moved to expand the exceptions to the policy to allow couples to . have two children if one of the parents is an only child. Talent: Many of Zhang Yimou's films, such as the 2002 hit Hero (pictured) have proved popular with audiences in the West as well as China . Spectacular: Zhang Yimou masterminded the breath-taking opening and closing ceremonies at the 2008 Beijing Olympics . In the past Chinese web users have typically responded with fury to reports of celebrities escaping the one-child regulation, but sentiments over the past week have been more mixed, with some citing Zhang as an example of why the law should be scrapped. 'We should be grateful to Zhang Yimou!' one posted on Sina Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter. 'Thanks to his popularity, he's made the whole society debate the problems of the 'family planning policy'! This might help speed up the abolition of this draconian law.' Another said the controversy was 'more than ridiculous', adding: 'Procreating is a fundamental human instinct and a way of passing things on to future generations. Here in China, it's actually become a crime.' In 2012, 24 of the country's 31 provinces and regions collected a total of nearly 20 billion yuan in penalties, the Beijing News reported Thursday. None of the provincial authorities has detailed how the money was spent.","Zhang Yimou directed hit movies House of Flying Daggers and Hero .

But the most poignant of all is the tale of Malcolm and Wendy Molly. Worcestershire builder Malcolm, 55, spent much of his childhood in foster homes and never had a proper Christmas until he met Wendy, 53. 'When I was young Mum was always running away and Dad ran after her, so me and my brother and sisters would get taken into separate foster homes. I only remember two Christmases when we were in our own home, and at foster homes the people never had money for presents,' he says. It was only when he started dating Wendy and she filled her old Santa sack with presents for him that he realised what he'd been missing. But even she didn't realised just how hooked on Christmas Malcolm would become. 'We spend about £900 on electricity in December and about £750 a year on lights. There's a North Pole area with penguins and a Santa section with big sacks of toys.' The couple's enthusiasm is infectious and even the neighbours opposite can't raise a complaint. 'Though they have put up blackout blinds,' laughs Malcolm. In fact a sense of goodwill is evident in the communities where all the light fanatics live. Wayne and his father were persuaded by locals to keep their display when a stand-off with vandals saw John lose a tooth. And Dave Edwards says he couldn't carry on without the neighbours who hand out mince pies and let visitors stand on their lawn. Plastic Santas and flashing lights may not feature in the traditional Nativity story but it's hard not to conclude that these neighbourly souls embody the true spirit of Christmas.

If you want to keep that New Year's cheer tonight, wrap up warm - because 2014 is expected to start with freezing temperatures and a generous dusting of snow. Revelers watching the ball drop in New York City will see just a sprinkling of snow as a blizzard moves north before blanketing Chicago with as many as ten inches throughout the night. Party-goers celebrating the start of the year at the city's Navy Pier midnight fireworks can expect to see a significant snow storm, WLF meteorologist Mike Caplan warned.

'Gusty winds in this region will contribute to extremely cold wind chills.' One of the coldest celebrations could be in Plymouth, Wisconsin, where the city will drop a large ball of cheese to mark the start of 2014, and where temperatures are expected to hit 0 degrees.

A customer who popped out for a lunchtime snack got more greens than she bargained for after finding a dead frog in her salad. The Wall Street Journal employee had visited the Pret a Manger on Sixth Avenue/47 Street in Manhattan yesterday to get what she assumed would be a regular Albacore Tuna Nicoise Salad. But in addition to the tomatoes, tuna, egg and olives, there was an extra ingredient: the small amphibian, almost camouflaged among the salad leaves. A Wall Street Journal employee found a dead frog in a Tuna Nicoise Salad she bought from a branch of Pret A Manger on Sixth Avenue/47 Street . Kathryn Lurie, digital features editor at the WSJ, posted a photo of the novel salad on behalf of her startled co-worker who bought the meal and did not wish to be identified.

Questioned: Richard Wallace, former editor of The Daily Mirror, was questioned by detectives from Operation Weeting, Scotland Yard's phone hacking investigation, today . The Daily Mirror's former editor Richard Wallace, 51, has been interviewed by police investigating an alleged phone hacking conspiracy at the Mirror Group. Wallace becomes the latest senior figure with links to Trinity Mirror to be questioned by detectives. His long-term partner Tina Weaver, former editor of the Sunday Mirror, was one of four executives at the newspaper who were yesterday detained in dawn raids in relation to Scotland Yard's phone hacking investigation. Wallace was taken to a police station in south London at lunchtime and was questioned under caution by detectives from Operation Weeting before being released without charge. Weaver, who is heavily-pregnant, was woken at 6am yesterday to be arrested over the allegations. Speculation is growing that police . have found a new witness who worked both at Mirror Group Newspapers, the . Trinity Mirror subsidiary that publishes its national titles, and News . International. The surprise development brought the . Mirror Group for the first time into the Scotland Yard inquiry into . alleged phone hacking, codenamed Operation Weeting. Shares in the media group fell by . more than a fifth when the arrests were revealed. Profits fell 75 per . cent last year to £18.9m after writing down £66m from past acquisitions . of websites which failed to shine. Last night shares closed 24.75p lower than 24 hours earlier at 95.5p - a 21 per cent drop. The arrests – which centre on an alleged hacking conspiracy ten years ago – are likely to concern Piers Morgan. The . former Daily Mirror editor, who now works as a TV host, denied any . knowledge of phone hacking when he gave evidence in 2011 to the Leveson . Inquiry into Press standards. Dawn raid: Wallace's partner, former Sunday Mirror editor Tina Weaver, was among four executives arrested yesterday . Paper: The conspiracy was being treated separately from the two plots being investigated at the now defunct News of the World, the Yard added, and focuses on the Sunday Mirror (file picture) Masthead: James Scott, who is now the editor of the Sunday People, was said to be among those arrested . But later in the inquiry, Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman accused Morgan of telling him how to hack into a mobile phone during a lunch at Mirror HQ in 2002. He also said Morgan teased TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson about private conversations she had with Sven-Göran Eriksson. Earlier that year the Daily Mirror had revealed Miss Jonsson’s affair with the then England football coach. Miss Weaver, a member of the Press Complaints Commission, is seven months pregnant and in a long-term relationship with another ex-Daily Mirror editor, Richard Wallace. She also denied any knowledge of phone hacking when she gave evidence at the Leveson Inquiry. But yesterday she was arrested at the couple’s home in South-West London as police detained Sunday People editor James Scott, his deputy Nick Buckley and former Sunday Mirror deputy editor Mark Thomas. The four were bailed to return to various London police stations next month. Scotland Yard said the alleged conspiracy is being treated separately from the two plots being investigated at the now defunct News of the World, and its inquiry is focused on the Sunday Mirror in 2003 and 2004. Business address: The people arrested are journalists or former journalists on Mirror Group Newspapers titles, based at One Canada Square in Canary Wharf, east London (pictured) Statement: Scotland Yard said its officers have 'identified and are investigating a suspected conspiracy to intercept telephone voicemails at Mirror Group Newspapers' In a statement, Scotland Yard said detectives had ‘identified and are investigating a suspected conspiracy to intercept telephone voicemails at Mirror Group Newspapers’. Simon Fox, chief executive of Trinity Mirror, sent an email to staff confirming the arrests. He said the publisher was ‘co-operating with police’ and has provided Mr Scott and Mr Buckley – who are still with the company – with legal support . Media lawyer Mark Lewis is dealing with civil claims against Mirror Group for four high-profile individuals including Sven-Göran Eriksson, alleging phone hacking. The three other claimants are Coronation Street actress Shobna Gulati, a former nanny for the Beckhams, and Garry Flitcroft, former captain of Blackburn Rovers. The latest arrests were seen as a significant widening of Operation Weeting, which had focused mainly on the News of the World and had been expected to be scaled down this year. A former Sussex Police sergeant will be charged with selling information to the Sun newspaper for £500, prosecutors said today. James Bowes is accused of misconduct in public office for allegedly passing information on three high profile investigations to the tabloid in 2010. He will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on March 26.

Jailed: Driving instructor Ben Holloway has been sentenced to six years in prison for dealing Class A drugs . A Driving instructor turned Breaking Bad-style drugs dealer has been jailed for six years after being caught with cocaine and amphetamines worth £5million he planned to sell to save his  family home. Benjamin Holloway, 26, claimed he turned to drug dealing to raise £20,000 to stop his property being sold to pay for debts he incurred when his business went under. Birmingham Crown Court heard that the ‘hard-working’ instructor became increasingly desperate to provide for his family and became mixed up with dangerous drugs gangs. The case echoes the plot of the hit US TV crime drama Breaking Bad, in which respectable chemistry teacher Walter White turns to drug dealing to provide for his family after learning he has terminal cancer. White, played by Bryan Cranston, sets up a laboratory making the drug crystal meth to make a lot of money fast. Holloway was arrested after police pulled over his Ford Focus during routine checks on motorists in Birmingham on August 14. Officers discovered a huge haul of cocaine and amphetamines in his car. They then swooped on his £130,000 home in Redditch and found more than 50kg of amphetamines in his garden shed. Police also recovered drug-making . equipment and five phones that had been used to make calls to gang . members in Spain and Holland. Home: Holloway was desperate to avoid selling his house in Redditch, Worcestershire, pictured . Desperate: When police searched the property, they found 50kg of amphetamines in this garden shed . Sentencing . Holloway, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine and . amphetamine, Judge Roderick Henderson said: ‘You are a hard worker who . had never been in trouble with police but you became involved in . desperately serious offences. ‘You were more than just a courier and had played a significant role in the conspiracy.’ Police . found Holloway was living beyond the means of a driving instructor, . with two flat-screen TVs and a baby grand piano in his modest . semi-detached home. Defending, Imran Shafi said that more . powerful drug dealers had exploited Holloway, who was initially . vulnerable thanks to his financial troubles and then became tempted by . drug money. Parallels: The case has some similarities to Breaking Bad, in which chemistry teacher Walter White and his former pupil Jesse Pinkman start manufacturing and distributing methamphetamine . Speaking . after the case, local driving instructor Donna Scott said that Holloway, . who had been teaching people how to drive for five years, had behaved . recklessly. 'He appeared a bit of a wide boy but I never thought he was able to get mixed up anything like this,' she said.

Lavish expenses: Peter Luff was criticised during the expenses scandal for charging taxpayers for the cost of fixing the Aga at his constituency home . A backlash over the New Year honours list was growing last night after it emerged a knighthood has been given to a Tory MP who once claimed expenses for having his Aga cooker serviced. It comes after David Cameron was yesterday accused of ‘cronyism’ for handing gongs to Conservative donors, friends – even the woman who runs his supper club. During the expenses scandal Peter Luff, who received a knighthood for political and public service, was also criticised for switching the designation of his second home from Worcester to London, which allowed him to claim £3,000 for redecorating his flat in the capital. He charged taxpayers £5,000 for decorating and repairs on his constituency home, including the £53.71 cost of having his Aga fixed. He also claimed nearly £1,000 for two china tea sets. He has always denied any wrongdoing over his expenses and ‘flipping’ the designation of his home. Sir Peter said he will stand down at the next General Election. Last night MPs and peers accused Mr Cameron of looking after a ‘privileged few’, while failing to recognise the true spirit of the honours list. Shadow minister Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘David Cameron stands up only for a privileged few. His mates and millionaire donors get honours and tax cuts while everyone else is left to pick up the tab.’ And Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said: ‘Honours should be for the unsung heroes of our communities, not for outgoing MPs who are power-laden with their index-linked pensions.’ Yesterday Mr Cameron was heavily criticised for handing out honours to friends and associates, such as PR supremo Alan Parker with whom he went on holiday in 2008. Peter Emerson Jones’s OBE for services to business in the North West raised eyebrows because he has given £31,000 to George Osborne’s constituency party, and another £10,000 to the Tories. And Marion Dowding, chairman of the West Oxfordshire Conservative Association’s supper club and former deputy chairman of the same association received an MBE for voluntary political service. Other gongs causing controversy last night included a knighthood for services to politics and the public for Kevin Barron, a Labour MP and chairman of the Commons Standards Committee. In 2012, he was found to be claiming £1,500 in expenses to rent a family home belonging to shadow cabinet minister Jon Trickett, after selling his own flat for a £500,000 profit. Mr Barron said at the time that although the rental agreement was within the rules, ‘in retrospect it would have been better not to have rented off a colleague’. Meanwhile Tory MP Richard Ottaway, who . is also standing down in 2015, received a knighthood for parliamentary . and public service. However in November, it emerged that he was paying . Croydon Conservative Association £6,000 a year to use its office as his . constituency headquarters – a controversial arrangement that some . criticise as a means of gaining extra funds for party activities. Their . honours mean that the Prime Minister has now handed out knighthoods to . 11 male Tory MPs, but he has only made one female Tory MP a dame, Angela . Watkins. Former Cabinet ministers Cheryl Gillan and Caroline Spelman . were both overlooked. 'Privileged few': David Cameron, left, was heavily criticised for handing out honours to friends and associates, such as PR supremo Alan Parker, right, with whom he went on holiday in 2008 . Dame Tessa Jowell, a former Labour Cabinet minister who received an honour for her role in organising the 2012 Olympics, called for more transparency.  She said: ‘There is a case for opening up the process a bit and explaining a bit more how the system works.’ It also emerged that a former Conservative campaigns officer has also been put in charge of public appointments. But Laura Wyld’s former role at Conservative HQ has alarmed Labour, who claim it could lead to Tories getting honours and jobs on powerful quangos. Lobbying Transparency campaigner Tamasin Cave said: ‘Wyld’s been a lobbyist. This job needs someone impartial. It does not bode well.’  There was also controversy about the Former Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker being knighted. He was embroiled in 2012’s rate-fixing Libor scandal after he was forced to deny claims he had ‘leaned on’ Barclays to lower its rate after pressure from Whitehall.","MPs and peers accuse PM of looking after the 'privileged few' with honours .

The pound hit its highest level for nearly three years yesterday, and shares ended 2013 on the front foot in a vote of confidence for the British economy. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies rose 17.82 points to 6749.09, taking total gains for the year to £200billion – an increase of around 14 per cent. The pound also performed well, going up around half a per cent to $1.6565 and €1.2022. Boost: The pound goes into 2014 at its highest level in almost three years . Rollercoaster: The Footsie edged up another 18 points from 6,731 today to end the year at 6,749. Sterling is now at its highest level . against the dollar since April 2011 having clocked up a second year of . gains – although this could make Britain's exports less competitive. Last . year also saw the best London stock market results since 2009, boosting . the value of pension pots and investments for millions of workers and . savers. The stock market and . the pound benefited from stronger than expected growth throughout 2013, . as the economy finally emerged from the doldrums. The . UK economy looks set to have grown by around 1.5 per cent in 2013 and . could grow by as much as 3 per cent in 2014, according to analysts. That . would be the best performance since 2007 when output rose by 3.4 per . cent before crashing in the recession of 2008 and 2009. It . would also put Britain among the best-performing developed economies in . the world, well ahead of European rivals Germany and France. The . brighter outlook – and the sharp fall in unemployment to 7.4 per cent, . its lowest level since early 2009 – has fuelled speculation that an . interest rate rise is on the way. The . Bank of England has pledged not to raise rates from the current . all-time low of 0.5 per cent until unemployment falls to 7 per cent or . lower. Governor Mark Carney has insisted that 7 per cent is a . 'threshold' and not a 'trigger' for an automatic rate hike in a bid to . dampen expectations. But the . surge in the pound – which benefits from higher interest rates – . suggests many in the financial markets believe a rate hike is coming. Soaring: The FTSE 250 is up by almost a third this year. Sterling has jumped from below $1.49 in July when Mr Carney succeeded Lord King as Governor – a rise of more than 10 per cent. Howard . Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said: 'After some extended . gloom, 2013 was a year of mainly positive surprises for the UK economy.' Mr Archer believes . unemployment will hit 7 per cent during the second quarter of 2014 and . could be down to 6.7 per cent by the end of the year. But he played down . the prospects of a rate hike this year. He . said: 'Expectations are mounting that the Bank could start to raise . interest rates in 2014. However, the Bank will want to give the economy . as much chance as possible to establish broad-based growth and is more . likely to hold off from raising interest rates until the first half of . 2015.' Debenhams issued a profit warning yesterday following a nightmare Christmas which forced it to launch early sales and deep discounts. Britain's second-biggest department store said profits are expected to be down by 26 per cent in the first half of its financial year to around £85million. The chain is slashing prices by 70 per cent in its January sale in a desperate attempt to shift leftover Christmas stock. The news saw the retailer's share price fall more than 10 per cent in early trading yesterday, wiping £140million off its stock market value. City analysts believe sales in many leading chains were below expectations over the crucial festive trading period. As a result, shares in the likes of Marks & Spencer, Next, Primark, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have all been marked down in recent days. Debenhams' bosses described festive trading as 'extremely difficult' and competitive, with a large number of early sales. 'We did not experience the anticipated final surge in sales in the last week of the period and as a result we expect the need for additional markdown to clear stock in January and February,' they said. The five-year cost of living squeeze, bad weather and a shift to internet shopping have combined to pile pressure on retailers who rely on their bricks and mortar outlets. Major chains were forced to bring forward sales and bargain promotions ahead of Christmas during what one industry insider described as 'a bit of a bloodbath'. The gloomy trading update comes just days after reports that Debenhams was under pressure to axe its finance chief, Simon Herrick, amid shareholder concern over his performance.","2013 was the best year for the London stock market .

Commercial radio stations have accused BBC Radio 1 - whose breakfast show is presented by Nick Grimshaw (pictured) - and Radio 2 of becoming too mainstream and stealing advertising revenue . BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2 have become too mainstream, and are costing commercial broadcasters more than £50m a year in lost advertising revenue, MPs have been told. Commercial rivals claim that the BBC’s most popular radio stations are neglecting their public service obligations in pursuit of high ratings and are harming smaller competitors by drawing away their listeners. An alliance of commercial radio stations has now voiced its concern in a submission to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Radiocentre, the industry body that represents commercial radio stations in the UK, has now told the committee that the BBC’s most popular radio stations have become too dominated by popular artists that listeners can hear on commercial radio. They said: ‘The BBC’s radio services, particularly Radio 1 and Radio 2, should be more distinctive and take the opportunity to provide greater public value, rather than simply seek large audiences. ‘It is hard to avoid the conclusion that much of the BBC’s growth in listening share in recent years has come at the direct expense of the commercial sector.’ The hearing comes ahead of a parliamentary inquiry about the running of the BBC in the run-up to renewal of its royal charter in 2017. Earlier this year, Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps warned the corporation’s £3.6bn annual licence fee funds could be cut unless the BBC tackles a  ‘culture’ of secrecy, waste and bias. He said the Corporation must rebuild confidence following the Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall abuse scandals, controversy over fat cat salaries and pay-offs to stars and senior executives. In October, it was revealed that Radio 2 continues to have the UK’s biggest audience with 14.94m listeners each week, up a million in a year. Radio 1 has 10.83m listeners. Grant Shapps, the Tory party Chairman, warned earlier this year that the BBC grant could be cut unless the corporation tackles a ¿culture¿ of secrecy, waste and bias . Last month, Radio 2 were forced to scale back its planned coverage of Gary Barlow’s latest album after Radiocentre warned the extensive coverage risked breaching BBC guidelines which forbid the corporation from ‘unfairly promoting any commercial organisations’. They claimed the BBC’s decision to give the artist so much free exposure to promote his album to listeners could end up depriving other stations of advertising revenue. The commercial stations argue that the BBC should use its licence fee funding to promote new artists, make specialist programmes and cater for audiences that would not otherwise be properly served by the rest of the market. Radio 1, for example, should focus on younger listeners but the average age of its audience is now 32, Radiocentre said. A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘Research shows that not only is there strong public support for the BBC showing a wide range of content and funded by the licence fee, but also that in countries where public service broadcasting is strong, commercial broadcasting is also strong.’ In a separate submission, lobby group Voice of the Listener &Viewer defended the BBC, warning politicians not to allow the BBC’s commercial rivals to ‘set the tone of this debate without providing convincing evidence of the BBC’s detrimental effects on new services’.","BBC Radio 1 and 2 accused of becoming too mainstream .

TV presenter Julia Bradbury, who hosts the BBC's Countryfile, is among those forced to look again at what pension she might expect. Julia, who is 43 and could work until she is 67 or more, has a two-year-old son with partner Gerard Cunningham and homes in Rutland and West London.

The London house boom has left the rest of the country behind, with some areas even registering price falls. Land Registry figures show the average price in the capital was up by 10.6 per cent in November compared to a year ago, taking it to £396,646. The average London property price has increased by £38,000 in just 12 months – the equivalent of £730 a week. Price map: The South East and London has seen major house price gains in the last 12 months, while the North East has fallen . Across England and Wales, prices rose by 3.2 per cent on average over the year – but this figure masks falls in the North. The . average price in the North East was down by 1.6 per cent in a year to . £96,227, while the North West was up by just 0.8 per cent to £109,692. At . the same time, there were rises of 1.4 per cent in the East Midlands . and 1.6 per cent in the Yorkshire and Humber region – both below the . increase in the general  cost of living. Property prices in London have boomed amid an economic recovery in the city and an influx of wealthy foreigners. They have also been boosted by a raft of government schemes designed to encourage home ownership and mortgage lending. But the data from the Land Registry makes clear that there is no price bubble beyond the M25. Even in the South of England, the average annual increase is just 3.5 per cent. The upturn in the housing market is said . to have boosted consumer confidence, but there have also been fears . that people are being encouraged to stretch themselves too far . financially to meet rising prices. There have also been signs of ‘gazumping’ - which happens when a buyer thinks they have agreed a deal to buy a house only for someone else to step in and outbid them - being back on the increase in the capital. The South East saw the second largest annual jump in house prices, with a 3.5 per cent increase taking typical values to £216,618. Meanwhile, Wales recorded a 3.3 per cent annual increase in house prices, pushing them to £118,310 on average. Surge: Prices in London rose by 10.6% annually to reach £396,646 on average . The East saw the most significant monthly price fall with a 0.7 per cent drop taking average prices to £177,975. The Land Registry’s latest figures also showed how house sales have been much stronger than in the same period last year. The most up-to-date figures available show that during September 2013, the number of completed house sales in England and Wales increased by 24 per cent to 65,378 compared with 52,870 in September 2012. The housing market has consistently shown a strong pick-up throughout 2013 following the introduction of Government schemes such as Help to Buy, which have given mortgage borrowers with small deposits a helping hand on or up the housing ladder. Mark Harris, chief executive of . mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: ‘With funding more readily . available than at any time in the past five years, many buyers are . finally able to realise their property-ownership dream.‘ . He . added: ‘This surge in demand is pushing up prices, particularly in . London, where supply is already limited. Gazumping and sealed bids are . becoming commonplace as relatively ordinary properties fetch a premium. House prices: The only region to see property values drop in 2013 was the North East, which fell by 1.6% . Business Secretary Vince Cable has warned the £130billion project, which provides lower deposits and loans, could ‘inflate the market’ and push property prices even further out of reach of young families. Despite protestations from George Osborne, the Office for Budget Responsibility and the Institute of Directors have weighed in, claiming there is no doubt house prices will be driven up. Branding the scheme 'mad' and 'very dangerous', Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ‘The housing market needs help to supply, not Help to Buy, and the extension of this scheme is very dangerous.’ And experts warn young first-time buyers will bear the brunt of the side-effects, such as unavoidable administration costs. Solid year: House prices across England and Wales rose dramatically in 2013 . Many buyers are worried that if they don’t take the plunge now, they will be priced out further.’ Mr Harris said that locking into a fixed-rate mortgage deal could help give ‘peace of mind’ to some people who are worried about the prospect of interest rates rising. He added: ‘There are still plenty of rock-bottom mortgage deals available, with some particularly good pricing on five-year fixed rates.’","London house prices surge by 10.6 per cent year-on-year in November .

It is quite extraordinary that Alastair Cook’s position as England captain should even be a subject for debate, let alone his dismissal a serious option at the end of this admittedly tortuous Ashes. It is time to end this nonsense now. How any serious cricketing judge can believe that England would be better served by jettisoning the captain now, however badly his team have fared here, is beyond me. This is not football. This is no time to throw out the man who now has the chance to build his own England team, not lead Andrew Strauss’s. Right man for the job: Andy Flower is also adamant that Cook should remain England captain . Skipper: Captain Alastair Cook walks alone during day four at Melbourne, but has defended the current management structure within the camp . It has surely not been forgotten that this is Cook’s first defeat in six Test series as captain. There were no cries to get rid of him when England were creating history by coming from one down to earn an historic Test series win in India. And there were no complaints, other than from the tiresome Shane Warne, when Cook was leading England to a 3-0 Ashes victory last summer, a win that would have been greater but for ridiculous bad light regulations at the Oval. It is Cook’s misfortune to have come up against probably the two best, most pro-active captains in the world game at the moment in Brendon McCullum and Michael Clarke in his last four series. The England captain has suffered in the field, but not off it, by comparison with the New Zealand and Australian leaders but he has still only lost one of those four series. Pecking order: Stuart Broad is England's current Twenty20 captain and could replace Cook . I am not saying that Cook is a tactical genius. Far from it. His game-plan has looked defensive and unimaginative for much of this Ashes but that has mainly been because his team have been struggling so much. When England have been on top under Cook and his bowlers have been dictating terms then his apparent tactical inadequacies have been less pronounced. A captain, at the end of the day, can only ever be as good as his bowlers to a huge extent. The biggest reason to defend Cook the England captain is that he is having to learn arguably the toughest job in any sport at the highest level in front of the prying eyes of many a former international captain. England players are identified so young these days and invariably plucked out of the domestic system so early that they never have a chance to gain the county captaincy experience that many of the best England leaders have had before the ultimate elevation. Cook will never be one for an eye-catching, ‘look at me’ fielding place or bowling change. He is an under-stated character but a cricketer and man of substance who is destined to break every England batting record in the book and will always seek to lead by example rather than any ‘funky on-field tactics. Thrashing: England's latest loss at the MCG put them 4-0 behind and on course to be whitewashed . Dejection: Cook leads England off the field after their eight-wicket defeat in the fourth Ashes Test . The most important thing is that he does so much of his good work away from the spotlight, in the many off-field ways that a cricket captain must lead. The dressing room are totally with him, including Kevin Pietersen, who Cook bravely and rightly brought back into the England fold last summer. And, although it is perhaps a negative reason for advocating the status quo, who on earth could conceivably replace Cook as captain now, just when the need is greatest for his steady hand on the tiller and his runs at the top of the order? My colleague Mike Dickson, a cricket correspondent for nine years and a man who knows his subject having covered England under captains of real substance like Nasser Hussain and Michael Vaughan, advocates Stuart Broad and, yes, he has one of the best brains in the England cricket team. But the fact that England have quietly preferred Matt Prior and then, when he was dropped in Melbourne, Ian Bell rather than Broad as Test vice-captain says it all. A fast bowler with a history of leaving tours early through injury who plays in all forms of the game cannot feasibly be the captain of England. Carry on: Cook still needs the chance ton build his own side, not continue with Andrew Strauss's . Looking up: Alastair Cook's position as England captain is under threat after a disastrous Ashes tour . Elsewhere the captaincy cupboard is bare. Pietersen has the experience and know-how to have a second crack at the . job but the wounds from his serious brushes with authority run too deep . for it ever to be a viable proposition. England even preferred James Tredwell to Pietersen when they needed an emergency captain for a Twenty20 international last year. Ian Bell is another senior professional but nothing in his game and demeanour suggests he is a leader of men while the same reservations that apply to Broad would rule out Jimmy Anderson as a serious candidate even though he does not play Twenty20 cricket for England. England very much hope Joe Root will be Cook’s eventual successor but clearly the time for that is not now, particularly as he would be in the same captaincy boat as Cook in having had little chance to gain leadership experience before graduating to Test level. Leave Root alone to get back in the runs. So Cook it is but I admit, as Hussain has so eloquently pointed out in these pages, that he has to improve. He tried to fight the same battle here as Strauss did in winning three years ago but now is the time for change. To the future: Andy Flower wants to stay on as England coach despite the Ashes debacle . For a start Cook must make it absolutely clear who is in charge. This is his England now. Not Strauss’s. Not even really Andy Flower’s. As Duncan Fletcher, another great coach of England, would say – the coach is a consultant. It is the captain who is in charge of a cricket team. Do not let Broad and Anderson so clearly set their own fields, Alastair. Show them who is boss on the field as well as off it. Throw off the shackles of conservatism. Take control. There will still be times when he gets it wrong, like on the fateful third morning of the fourth Test when he seemed clueless against Brad Haddin, but those periods of play will become lesser the more he does the job. Cook has only been in full charge for a year, for heaven’s sake, and at 29 he should be in his prime as a player. Give him a bit more time and he will learn, as others like Hussain, Vaughan and Strauss did, with experience. Cook has risen to every other challenge set before him in his cricketing career and he will succeed in this one too. England will give him every chance to because they believe in him.","Cook must get the chance to build his own side, not lead Andrew Strauss's .

A shocked cleaner found the woman's body when she went into the room as part of her morning routine. Room: The naked body of the victim was discovered under the bed in a hotel room . 'So far, we do not know exactly the reason for the victim's murder,' said the inspector. 'We are now seeking the suspect in order to bring him to justice and punish him under Cambodian law.'

'On December 28, 2013, at about 11pm, he asked to get his passport from the hotel receptionist and said that he was taking it to get money from the bank in order to pay for his hotel room. 'But on that night he left the hotel without paying any money for his room fee.' The employee added that when Mr Green did not return the following day, a cleaner went into the room and found the body of the young woman.

It is believed no record has been found of him leaving from the airport and a watch has been placed on road crossings into neighbouring countries of Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. Vietnam requires a visa in advance, a visa can be obtained for Laos at the border for a fee and Thailand - the easiest country to enter - gives a free 30-day visa. The Bolyna Palace, where rooms are available for about £12 a night, has received mixed reviews from travellers, some who say they have been satisfied with the accommodation, others warning tourists not to stay there because there are no windows in the rooms and the place is 'dirty'.","Manhunt has been launched for James Green .

The England Test team, facing a repeat of the demoralising Ashes whitewash Down Under seven years ago, at least demonstrated more team unity on New Year’s Eve than the dysfunctional 2006-07 side. All the squad and their partners attended the ECB function last night at the Flying Fish  waterfront restaurant that offered a prime view of the Sydney Bridge fireworks. This contrasts with the splits in the camp under Freddie Flintoff’s leadership when the captain went out on a boat with his testimonial committee chairman Paul Beck and took with him three other members of the squad in Jimmy Anderson, Steve Harmison and Geraint Jones plus agent Neil Fairbrother. Sticking together: The England team celebrated New Year together in Sydney . Flintoff wrote in his autobiography: . ‘The media made a big issue about us not celebrating the new year . together as a team. Why would we want to do that? We’d hardly spent an . evening together during the rest of the tour so why would New Year’s Eve . be any different? I told the lads to do what they wanted. ‘I’d . flown out everyone who had worked on my benefit committee the previous . year and we had a great night on a boat in Sydney harbour. We watched . the fireworks and just for a few hours it felt like I wasn’t on this . tour from hell.’ The . ECB claimed all the tour squad had been invited on to the Flintoff boat. Attendance at last night’s function at the same venue was optional but . every player chose to go at some stage during the evening. The Aussies . saw in the new year as a unit watching the fireworks from their hotel in . the Sydney Rocks. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- . One of the many boats in Sydney Harbour on New Year’s Eve three years ago during the last Ashes tour contained a number of cricket-loving tycoons and captains of industry, including David Ross, Sir Stuart Rose and Sir Victor Blank. The chat concerned who, among them or their friends, could mount a much-needed challenge to Giles Clarke for the chairmanship of the England Cricket Board. None emerged and Clarke was re-elected unopposed for three more years in 2012. The sports honours committee meet in October to determine the new year gongs, which helps explain why retiring England chief selector Geoff Miller was rewarded with an OBE for the three Ashes victories on his watch. Certainly Miller would not have been recognised for how the selections in his last Ashes touring party  have fared - especially with three giant fast bowlers having played one Test between them. Gong: Geoff Miller has been awarded an OBE on the New Year Honours list . England look like they have already missed the big-money T20 boat despite inventing the format. There is likely to be room in the year for just two T20 competitions that will attract the world’s best players and Australia’s Big Bash has seemingly grabbed that second spot after the Indian Premier League. Big sucess: England batsman Eoin Morgan is playing for the Thunder in the Big Bash League and it is proving a sucess . The weather, the presentation, . free-to-air TV coverage, the use of large stadiums for big crowds and . slick entertainment around the cricket — such as motorbike stunts and . the chance for a viewer to win a six-figure sum if a celebrity on a . platform in the crowd catches a big hit — have all helped the Big Bash . establish itself in the cricket calendar while the ECB are still working . on their T20 revamp. Strauss in school shift . Andrew Strauss, former Ashes-winning  England captain turned Sky pundit, is temporarily taking his eight-year-old son Sam out of Caldicott Preparatory School, whose former headmaster Peter Wright has been found guilty of indecent assaults on pupils between 1959 and 1970. Strauss’s decision has nothing to do with his former school’s past, which emerged during Wright’s trial. Sam is being educated in  Australia for one term as Strauss is staying Down Under until April having bought a house in Ballarat, Victoria where his wife Ruth comes from. Staying Down Under: Former England captain Andrew Strauss is staying in Australia after the Ashes . The senior England players received up to £60,000 each in bonuses for their Ashes win last summer and the Aussies are on course to collect extra payments of around that figure also if they complete a 5-0 whitewash. Bonus: Peter Siddle, Michael Clarke and the rest of the Australian team will all receive bonuses for winning .","England players celebrate New Year's Eve together on Sydney's waterfront .

The moment Jacob and Joshua see each other for the first time at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital in Memphis, where they were born two years ago . Jacob and his brother Joshua were joined at the rear of the pelvis and gastrointestinal tract when they were born January 24, 2011 via cesarean section at the Regional Medical Center. They were attached at the pelvis and lower spine, but had separate hearts, heads and limbs. At eight-weeks-old they had to be separated because of the severity of Jacob's heart condition and endured a 13-hour operation. But the boys recovered at different rates. Joined: This MRI scan provided by the hospital shows just how the pair were fused together . Fused: A 3D reconstruction shows how the boys' vertebrae were joined at the base . Jacob remained in intensive care and . needed few more operations, while Joshua recovered quicker and was given . the all-clear to go home with the twin's mother Adrienne Spates.

He said that while Jacob has . more serious heart problems 'our cardiology team has very high hopes his . treatment… will be successful'. 'If they had not been separated, sometime in the next year or two, they probably would have passed,' Dr Langham said. Ms . Spates, a single mother who has two other children, cried when her sons . saw each other for the first time: 'I'm glad that everyone gets to see . my baby and view them as separate people because they are and they have . their own personalities,' she said.

Relief: Joshua and Jocob's mother Adrienne was overwhelmed that all went to plan at hospital . In April 2012 the twins were placed in the custody of the Department of Child Services following the DUI arrest of their mother. It was unclear whether the children were still in DCS custody when Jacob died. Just two dozen conjoined twins have ever been successfully separated anywhere in the world. The . condition is extremely rare, only about one in every 200,000 live . births is a set of conjoined twins and about 15 per cent of these are . joined in a similar way to Joshua and Jacob.

Scroll down for video . The family of Mamana Bibi, who was killed in a US-led drone strike in north western Pakistan last October are fronting an Amnesty International campaign to label the attacks war crimes .

The 68-year-old was killed when a drone, right, hit her family's field . Will I Be Next? US Drone Strikes In . Pakistan examines nine strikes that were launched in 2012 and 2013, and . the subsequent deaths. It focuses on the killing of . civilians - believed to number between 153 and 926, according to the . Bureau of Investigative Journalism - including the death of Mamana Bibi and a 14-year-old boy in north western areas . of Pakistan. Mamana Bibi's grandchildren recounted in painful detail the moment she was killed before their eyes on October 24 last year. She was gathering vegetables in the family fields in Ghundi Kala village when the attack happened. Her son Rafeequl Rehman said: 'We are ordinary people working in the education field. 'All of my brothers work in the schools; four as teachers, the fifth as a school assistant. My father is a renowned principal. They even named a school after him. 'After finishing my evening prayers in Miran Shah, I returned to my village and on the way I saw that villagers had gathered near our home.' Desperate to discover what had happened, some local children told him his house had been hit by a drone attack. 'I was shocked and rushed to my home and saw a big gathering of people,' he added. 'I rushed passed them and saw my mother’s dead body wrapped in a cloth – her body was in pieces.' Fearing his family had been wiped out in the attack, Mr Rehman was relieved to find all of his children had survived. Nearly a year later, Mamana Bibi’s family has yet to receive any acknowledgment that it was the US that killed her, let alone justice or compensation for her death. Amnesty says the US has 'failed to commit to conduct investigations' into alleged deaths that have already occurred. America views its drone programme as a key weapon in the fight against . insurgent groups that it says stages cross-border trips into . neighbouring Afghanistan. President . Barack Obama said in May that no drone strikes are conducted unless . there is 'near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured'. But Amnesty said the US is secretive . about the programme, calling on the government to 'come clean' and hold . those responsible to account. The first US-led drone strike in north west Pakistan took place in 2004. Since then there have been around 350 attacks killing thousands. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism estimates between 153 and 926 civilians are thought to have died . President Obama said in May that no drone strikes are conducted unless there is 'near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured'. Pakistani Premier Nawaz Sharif is set to raise the issue with Obama this week . The . group claims the clandestine nature of the scheme means there is no way . to tell what steps are taken to prevent civilian casualties. The . report also throws the spotlight on an even deadlier incident, which . happened in North Waziristan on July 6, last year, reports dawn.com. Witnesses and relatives said a total of 18 male laborers were killed, none of whom had links to militant groups, they claim. A volley of missiles fell on a tent where a group of men were having an evening meal, while a second strike hit those who came to the aid of the wounded - one of a number of attacks, which have hit rescuers, Amnesty International said. The report, compiled by Amnesty International, . examines nine strikes launched in 2012 and 2013. Two men, pictured, . reveal their injuries in similar attacks in October last year . Pakistani intelligence officials at the time identified the dead as suspected militants. The US did not respond to dawn.com's request for comment on the strike. The report will be released jointly with another report on US drone strikes in Yemen. Pakistan has repeatedly said that the airstrikes are a violation of its sovereignty, branding the attacks 'counter-productive' and a violation of international law. Premier Nawaz Sharif, who is currently visiting the US, said prior to his arrival that he will take up the issue during his meeting at the White House on Wednesday. He previously raised the subject at this year's United National General Assembly session, and sought an end to the attacks. UN chief Ban Ki-moon called for the controversial strikes to be brought within the sphere of international law during a visit to Islamabad this year . UN chief Ban Ki-moon, during his visit to Islamabad this year, also urged for the controversial strikes to be brought within the sphere of international law. Moreover the Bureau of Investigative Journalism had launched a report aimed at keeping track of victims of drone attacks. These groups indicated that the attacks have killed between 2,065 and 3,613 people, the report said. Between 153 and 926 were thought to be civilians. Amnesty said it is concerned that the attacks outlined in the report and others may have resulted in unlawful killings that constitute extrajudicial executions or war crimes, even though the US insists the strikes are legal. 'We cannot find any justification for these killings. There are genuine threats to the USA and its allies in the region, and drone strikes may be lawful in some circumstances,' said Mustafa Qadri, Amnesty International's Pakistan researcher. 'But it is hard to believe that a group of laborers, or an elderly woman surrounded by her grandchildren, were endangering anyone at all, let alone posing an imminent threat to the United States.' In 2004, the US carried out its first drone strike in Pakistan. Since then it is thought nearly 250 attacks have hit the country, the majority targeting North Waziristan. President Barack Obama significantly ramped up attacks when he took office in 2009, and the number peaked the following year with over 100 strikes. The frequency has steadily dropped since then, partly because of growing tension between Pakistan and the US. There have only been around two dozen strikes so far this year. 'Amnesty International is also extremely concerned about the failure of the Pakistani authorities to protect and enforce the rights of victims of drone strikes,' the report states. 'Pakistan has a duty to independently and impartially investigate all drone strikes in the country and ensure access to justice and reparation for victims of violations.' Amnesty said those victims they interviewed, who had no apparent connection to militant groups, have either received no compensation or inadequate assistance from the Pakistani government. The top political official in North Waziristan gave Bibi's family around $100 to cover medical expenses for the children injured in the strike, even though the total cost to the family, including loss of livestock and repairs to their home, was around $9,500, the rights group said. None of the victims in the attack on the laborers received any compensation, the report added.","Amnesty International report focuses on nine strikes in 2012 and 2013 .

Two Utah men already facing possible criminal charges for purposely toppling an ancient rock formation in a state park have now been removed from their posts as Boy Scout leaders. A northern Utah Boy Scouts council announced Monday that Glenn Taylor and Dave Hall will no longer be allowed to lead scouting troops due to what happened October 11 at Goblin Valley State Park, which they filmed and posted on Facebook. In another twist, one of the men has links with convicted killer Jodi Arias and appeared on HLN throughout her trial. Connection: Dave Hall was a close friend of murdered man Travis Alexander . Dave Hall was a close friend of victim Travis Alexander and spoke about his mistrust of the woman who was eventually convicted for stabbing him 29 times, shooting him in the face and slitting his throat. 'There was just something really weird about [Jodi Arias], and when she spent time with you, you even got more creeped out,' Hall told HLN’s Nancy Grace in January. 'Just the way she acted in our home. The way that she had this awkward silence about her. The way that she just had no soul. You could almost see through her. It’s not someone you could sit down with and have a conversation. She was very mysterious.' Scroll down for video . Father of the year: Glenn Taylor tipped over the rock while his son cheered him on . Chip off the old block: Dylan Taylor high-fived his father after defacing the natural wonder and jumped for joy over its demise . The cameraman: Dave Hall told local media he is receiving death threats since the stunt . Hall is currently under investigation by police for his part in the topping of a 170 million-year-old rock formation. The move by the Boy Scouts' Utah . chapter comes on the heels of the national Boy Scouts of America . condemning the men's actions last week and promising a review of the . incident. The Boy Scouts' Utah National Parks . Council posted a statement on its website saying the men's actions are . not in line with the principles the organization teaches about . preserving nature. 'We encourage all leaders and Scouts . to review the ""Leave No Trace"" principles, as we are all a part of . maintaining the integrity, character and the natural beauty of the . outdoors for all living things,' the statement said. The rock formation they toppled over . is about 170 million years old, Utah State Parks spokesman Eugene . Swalberg said. The central Utah park is dotted with thousands of the . eerie, mushroom-shaped sandstone formations. Hall and Taylor came under fire last . week after posting a video on Facebook where Taylor can be seen wedging . himself between a formation and a boulder to knock a large rock off the . formation's top. Taylor and his two companions can then be seen . cheering, high-fiving and dancing. They said the rock formation was . loose and they feared it was dangerous. They were leading a group of . teenage Boy Scouts on a trip when it happened. Hall said they found out about losing . their Boy Scouts positions Monday morning. They had been troop leaders . for a few years, Hall said, and hope to continue to be involved in . organization in the future using what happened as a teaching point. Both . men are from Highland, Utah, about 30 miles south of Salt Lake City. 'We've always supported the Boy Scouts and if that's what they feel is best, we support that decision,' Hall said. 'We're extremely sorry for our mistake. We look forward to doing everything we can to make it right and move on.' Utah State Parks authorities are . conducting a criminal investigation, and the Emery County Attorney's . Office also is reviewing the incident to determine if charges should be . filed. Caught on camera: Glenn Taylor is filmed pushing the 'loose' rock in Goblin Valley State Park . Destroyed: The massive rock, which had been in place for 20 million years, crashes to the ground beneath . Celebration: Glenn and Dylan Taylor high-five while the cameraman, Dave Hall, laughs and whoops for joy . Speaking to the Salt Lake Tribune, Mr Hall said he has received dozen of death threats in the past week. 'I’ve got over 100 death threats on the Internet already,' said Mr Hall. 'I’ve . got people all over the world telling me they are going to kill me . because I made the decision that lives are more important than this rock . staying here a few more hours,' he added. Despite . attracting possible criminal charges and the continuing hatred of people . across the globe, Mr Hall continued to defend his group's actions. 'I think we made the right decision, but probably the wrong method,' he explained . to the Tribune. 'we take full responsibility for whatever mistake we . made, and we’re open to whatever that means from the state, from the Boy . Scouts’ office, etc.' The rock formations at Goblin Valley State Park in Utah are thousands of years old, formed by the erosion of the material around the base of the rock . Proud: The men said they were 'saving lives' because the loose rock could have fallen on a child . Showing off: Glenn Taylor, a Boy Scout leader, flexes his muscles after forcing the rock from its perch . A criminal investigation is now underway in the incident, which occurred on October 11, spokesman Eugene Swalberg told the Tribune. 'It . is not only wrong, but there will . be consequences,' he said. 'This is highly, highly inappropriate. This . is not what you do at state parks. It’s disturbing and upsetting.' Deputy Emery County Attorney . Brent Langston said he was aware of the incident but that it has not yet . reached his office. If it does, he will consider whether to bring . charges. He said they could . face anywhere from a . class B misdemeanor (up to six months in prison) to a second-degree . felony (one to 15 years in prison) depending on how much the . formation is valued, the Tribune reported. He added: 'Some things can’t be replaced, like photographs in a family album, but they have great sentimental value.' But the men insist that they only pushed the rock to the ground because it was unstable and they were concerned about it crushing a child playing nearby. On the video, Hall says: 'Some little kid was about ready to walk down here and die and Glenn saved his life by getting the boulder out of the way. So it’s all about saving lives here at Goblin Valley.' Taylor said he had seen a family walk close to the rock and when he touched it, it was loose. 'I put my hand on a rock and it moved,' he said. 'While we were sitting right there we thought, ""Man if this . rock falls it’ll kill them"".' I didn’t have to push hard.' But when they left, he said he thought that he probably should have contacted a ranger before taking action. But the men said they had only seen one in the park that day. Goblin Valley is more than 3,600 acres of desert with hoodoo rock formations in Utah . Stunning: The rock formation at Goblin Valley State Park, pictured, was 20 million years old . Still, they apologized for their actions and said they wish they could have dealt with it differently. 'Glad we did it, wish we wouldn’t have done it,' Glenn Taylor said. Hall added: 'We're extremely sorry for . our actions. There was no in way shape or form any intent to go out . there and cause any harm to our natural resources.' Swalbery added that seeing a loose rock does not mean a person should push it over. Glenn Taylor and Hall are leaders for the local Boy Scouts troop and that they are also Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints youth leaders. They said authorities have not yet contacted them about the incident.","Dave Hall and Glenn Taylor have been removed as Boy Scout leaders .

Bridget Jones fans reacted with sadness and fury when it was revealed that the beloved character  Mr Darcy had been killed off in Helen Fielding's latest novel, Mad About The Boy. Now the author has revealed why she felt her heroine had to find herself suddenly single again at the age of 51 with two children. She explains in a video you can watch below: 'I . wrote this book from the inside out, that is what happened, Mark died. No-one gets to Bridget's age without suffering some sort of loss, life . doesn't turn out as you expect.' Scroll down for video . 'Life doesn't turn out as you expect': Author Helen Fielding explains why character Mark Darcy is dead in her latest Bridget Jones novel . No happy ending: Bridget, played by Renee Zellweger, is a widow following the loss of Mark Darcy, played by Colin Firth . The 55-year-old British writer said she also had to do something to make the book sufficiently different from the previous two novels in which hapless Bridget finally found love with the dashing lawyer. 'I didn't want this book to be a . weak copy of the other books,' she said. And despite the sad subject matter of Bridget becoming a widow, Fielding said the book is still funny and uplifting. Daniel is back: Fielding said she kept the character played by Hugh Grant, right, because 'an ex can become a friend' 'The thing about Bridget is the comedy . has always come from something real,' she explained. 'Tough things happen in life and she gets . through and she survives, she had her friends, she deals with it and she . comes through the other side and she's still finding things funny. 'It . hurts but she's still laughing, that was something important that I . wanted to say.' But while Mr Darcy - who was played by Colin Firth - in the films will only be referred to in flashbacks in the new book, Fielding was keen to ensure the character Daniel Cleaver still had a starring role. He was the lovable rogue who cheated on Bridget and almost cost her her happy relationship with Darcy. So it is plausible they would still be friends decades later? Fielding believes so. 'The . thing about Daniel is, people do stay in people's lives, old boyfriends . do become friends. Not all sad: Fielding said the new novel still has humour despite the loss of Bridget's husband . Still mad about Bridget: The book has been selling well despite poor reviews . 'He's still Daniel saying ""what colour are your . panties"" and having a crack at seduction but he's still in her life and . they accept each other as they are.' Fielding concedes his inclusion is also because she has a soft spot for the character - which was increased after Hugh Grant played him so charmingly in the film adaptations, adding his own improvised lines to the script. She said: 'I love Daniel as a character and I . love Hugh as a character. Hugh contributed a huge amount to the funny . lines in the movie. 'For example when he's seducing Bridget and she's . wearing the big pants, and he says ""don't worry, I'm wearing something . similar myself"" and ""oh mummy!"" that came from him. 'So I really wanted to . keep him present and he's now godfather to Bridget's children.' Despite some mediocre reviews and the loss of Mr Darcy, Mad About The Boy has still been snapped up by readers, topping the hardback chart the week it went on sale.","Fans saddened by loss of hero in latest Bridget Jones novel .

An ex-Lehman Brothers hotshot is accused of biting, kicking and pulling the hair of his estranged wife inside their lavish Manhattan co-op. David Milberg, 50, who was vice president at the failed bank and now runs a private investment firm, is set to go on trial for attempted assault after the alleged April 1 incident, which the mother of his three children says involved him using 'both of his hands to forcefully push me onto a chair... causing bruising and substantial pain.' Melinda Milberg, 50, told authorities she 'then observed (my husband) grab me by the hair and strike my head against the chair multiple times... causing my hair to come out of my head.' Set for trial: Ex-Lehman Brothers vice president, David Milberg, left, is accused of biting, kicking and pulling the hair of his estranged wife, Melinda Milberg, right, inside their lavish Manhattan co-op in April . According to Mr Milberg's lawyer, Robert Gottlieb, prosecutors dropped the charges from an A misdemeanor to a B misdemeanor Monday to force a bench trial, while he had been fighting for the higher charges so a jury would hear the case. The banker allegedly admitted to police as he was arrested that he 'bit her arm' but insisted 'I fell into a trap. This is what she wanted.' The couple had split in January and Mrs Milberg officially filed for divorce in March but were taking turns living in the Upper West Side pad with the children until April. When not with the kids, the other spouse would live in a hotel, Mr Gottlieb told MailOnline. He said that on April 1, Mr Milberg had returned to his home and told his wife he was fed up with the housing arrangement. Alleged abuse: Melinda Milberg, 50, pictured, told authorities she 'then observed (my husband) grab me by the hair and strike my head against the chair multiple times... causing my hair to come out of my head' Scene: The husband allegedly roughed up his wife at their posh Upper West Side co-op, pictured . But Mr Milberg's lawyer insists his wife trumped up the accusations to win leverage in the couple's nasty, multimillion divorce case. Mr Gottlieb told MailOnline: 'David is absolutely innocent of those absurd charges. This case is simply about a woman who has manipulated the police the District Attorney and is now trying to manipulate the courts for the sole purpose of getting money in the matrimonial case.' He said the divorce proceedings started before Mr Milberg's arrest. 'These charges were just part of her strategy to gain leverage in her quest for money,' Mr Gottlieb said on Tuesday. Fight: In the split, the couple are fighting over custody as well as access to a 400-acre country club - Sunningdale in Westchester, New York, pictured, of which they are members . Mr Gottlieb would not say exactly how much Mrs Milberg was going for in the divorce but said it was a 'significant' sum, adding 'she has refused to settle it while the criminal case was pending.' In the split, the couple are fighting over custody as well as access to a 400-acre country club - Sunningdale in Westchester, New York, of which they are members. 'Mrs Milberg's shenanigans and her abuse of the system has resulted in David having very little contact with the children,' Mr Gottlieb said. The kids are aged 14, 10 and eight. David Aronson, Mr Milberg's divorce lawyer, told the New York Daily News the estranged couple could both be 'at the country club at the same time as long as Mr Milberg understands he has to stay away from his wife and not approach her and not speak to her.' But Mrs Milberg's attorney told the newspaper that was inconceivable as the possibility of seeing their father at the posh club was 'really a frightening thought' to the couple's children. Mr Milberg's trial will begin later this week.","David Milberg, 50, who was vice president at the failed bank and now runs a private investment firm, is set to go on trial for attempted assault .

A woman who is now working as a male model has released a video of the life-changing moment when she had her hair cut off. Elliott Sailors came forward last week talking about her decision to use her androgynous looks in a different way by seeking work as a male model instead of female model. Now she and her husband have released the video of the emotional moments where she took her place in the barber shop chair and watched as the electric clippers. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE . The final look: She left her hair longer in the middle to give her some styling options . Excitement: Elliott Sailors decided that in order to make it in the world of male modeling she would have to get her long hair cut off for good . She wrote about the experience in The New York Post, saying that when she went to FSC Barber Shop she had to stand tall and stick to her guns. 'They . said, “We don’t actually do women’s short-style haircuts.” I laughed . and said, “I understand. I want to look like a boy,”' she wrote. 'When I sat down in the chair, I told him, “I’m going to cry, but don’t worry about it. I REALLY want to do this.”' Sailors, . 31, has explained that the decision to drastically change her look is a . pragmatic one, as she feels that she will be able to stay in the . industry longer as her career was headed down a catalogue-focused path as opposed to high fashion. 'For the last year I've been focusing on the artistry of it and the creativity of it and not the financial of it,' she told MailOnline. 'It's not a gimmick that I came up with because I couldn't think of something else . She and her husband Adam Santos-Coy married in 2011 and over the course of their first year as a married couple they had multiple conversations about the prospect of changing her look to work in the male modeling world. Sailors told MailOnline that he has been extremely supportive, and after she did one photoshoot in August 2012 where she had her long hair styled to look like she was a man. After that photoshoot, she went to a self-help seminar and she 'got really connected to what it is i am doing in the world.' 'I want to make something else available and possible for people,' she told MailOnline. Big step: She warned the barber that she might cry but she really did want to go through with it . Where'd it go: Sailors' husband supports her decision and took her to his barber . Sailors, . who is 31-years-old, is not the first woman to take this unusual route . as Casey Legler, 35, was the first woman to be signed on a modeling . contract for only male gigs, and like Sailors she has no intention of . taking an permanent steps to physically change genders. 'I cut my hair before she signed with Ford (modeling agency) but when she signed with Ford,' Sailors said of Legler, who she has never met. While admitting to MailOnline that she 'was a little bummed about not being the first' she also has 'really gotten aware of the gratitude' that she feels towards Legler and other gender-bending models who have helped pave the way for their particular career path. The . fact that Sailors has a first name that is typically used for men- . Elliott- is just a stroke of familial luck as it is her mother's maiden . name. Her mother has been . just one of the voices against the gender roleplay, but Elliott . maintains that she is 'just as loving as she's always been'. Once her Tuscon, Arizona-based mother woke up and watched her segment on The Today Show, Sailors immediately called her and checked in that everything was alright. Exposure: Sailors made an appearance on the Today Show Monday morning and she hopes it will jumpstart her bookings . Her . husband Adam Santos-Coy has been a constant source of support, and he was the one holding the . video camera during the landmark haircut and he suggested they go to his . barber for the big step. Santos-Coy was the one holding the . video camera during the landmark haircut and he suggested they go to his . barber for the big step. 'Tears welled in my eyes again at the first buzz.

It was saying goodbye to what . I had been and knowing that I was starting something brand new, and I . had no idea how it would go.' Androgynous: Before cutting off her hair, Elliott (seen here with her husband Adam Santos-Coy) was regularly critiqued for having masculine features . Standing tall: Sailors' decision has been met with mixed reviews .

JonBenet Ramsey's father doesn't want secret grand jury indictments from his daughter's case released to the public. John Ramsey's attorneys sent a letter Monday to the Boulder County District Attorney saying the release of such records without releasing the entire grand jury record would only defame the former beauty queen's parents. Only six-years-old at the time of her death, JonBenet Ramsey was found dead in the basement of her family's home Christmas Day in 1996 after the girl's mother called 911 saying a ransom note had been left. Help us find the killer: John Ramsey looks on during a 1997 television appearance as wife Patsy touts a reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer of JonBenet . Reports earlier this year suggested the secret indictments were of both John and Patricia Ramsey, the deceased girl's mother. John Ramsey's attorneys argued Monday that to release only the indictments, and not the entire grand jury record, would put him at a disadvantage. 'Public release of the allegations of an un-prosecuted indictment only serves to further defame (John Ramsey) and his late wife Patricia,' the letter said, according to the Daily Camera. 'Mr. Ramsey will have no access to whatever evidence the prosecutors presented to the grand jury and will have no ability to disprove those allegations in a court of law,' the letter continued. Beautiful: JonBenet Ramsey competed in and won several beauty pageants before her murder . 'Nor will the public have any ability to evaluate the propriety of the indictment unless the entire grand jury record is unsealed and opened to public view,' said the letter. The move to make the indictments public is an effort between the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and a Boulder Daily Camera reporter. The indictments were earlier this year reported to be of child abuse leading to their daughter's death, according to the paper. A grand jury voted at the time to go forward with the charges, but the district attorney declined to go forward with the charges over the fear he could not prove guilty without a reasonable doubt, according to the paper. Q&A: The Ramseys appear at the Newseum in 2000 to answer questions about their experience with the media from journalism students . Sent on John Ramsey's behalf, the letter was in response to a judge ruling last week that releasing the indictments would not be in violation of grand jury secrecy rules, the paper said. That judge ordered the current DA to provide reason why it should be kept secret, according to the Daily Camera, to which the said he would provide them to a judge to determine if they would be released. John Ramsey's attorneys argued against this move, saying he was never contacted about the release of any documents from his daughter's case - adding that without releasing the entire record, the objective will not be achieved. 'The District Court found 'transparency' to be the determinative factor in its order to show cause,' said the letter. 'Transparency can only be accomplished if the entire record is made public.' 'The court should also order release of the entire grand jury record, including all witness testimony, all exhibits, all colloquy discussions between prosecutors and the grand jury and all drafts of potential indictments presented by the prosecutors of the grand jury,' the letter continues. Officials responded to the letter by stating they only release the secret indictments in such a way that would not hinder potential future prosecution under charges where the statute of limitations has not yet expired, according to the paper. The Ramseys were exonerated in 2008 from any responsibility for the girl's death by the then-DA. The statute of limitations for the abuse charges expired in 2002.","JonBenet Ramsey, 6, was found murdered in her family's basement on Christmas Day, 1996 .

Arrested: Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz has been charged with accepting paid travel, the services of prostitutes and Lady Gaga concert tickets in a devastating bribery case for the US Navy . A high profile U.S. Navy commander has been charged with accepting paid travel, the services of prostitutes and Lady Gaga concert tickets from a Singapore-based defense contractor in exchange for classified information according to federal prosecutors. Commander Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz, who was born in Cambodia during the Vietnam War and gained media attention for his rise to captain of a U.S. Navy destroyer, has been arrested on federal bribery charges - in what some are calling the worst scandal to hit the Navy in decades. Also taken into custody and charged in criminal complaints unsealed in U.S. district court in San Diego were Leonard Glenn Francis, the CEO of Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd, and John Bertrand Beliveau II, a special agent with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Prosecutors accuse Misiewicz, 46, of sending Francis classified information, including ship movements, and helping arrange visits by U.S. Navy vessels to ports where Francis' company, Glenn Davis Marine Asia Ltd, had contracts worth $200 million to provide tugboats, security, fuel, waste removal and other services. CBS News reported that maintenance . for one ship, the aircraft carrier Stennis, cost the Navy $2.7 . million, which is about double the average price charged by other . ports. In exchange, Francis furnished Misiewicz with such gifts as travel, entertainment, luxury hotel stays and prostitutes, prosecutors alleged. Public Face: In this photo taken Dec. 3, 2010, U.S. navy officer Michael ""Vannak Khem"" Misiewicz smiles as he delivers his welcome speech on the deck of the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Mustin at Cambodian coastal international see port of Sihanoukville . According to the charges, the defense contractor provided Misiewicz with five tickets to a Lady Gaga concert in Thailand in May 2012. 'Allegations of bribery and kickbacks involving naval officers, contracting personnel and NCIS agents are unheard of,' retired Adm. Gary Roughead to The Washington Post, describing the accusation as 'extremely serious, disconcerting and surprising.' The complaint also described the two men as developing a close friendship in which Misiewicz referred to Francis by such terms as 'Big Brother,' 'Big Bro' or 'BB' and the defense contractor called him 'Little Brother,' 'Little Bro' or 'LB.' At the time, Misiewicz was deputy operations officer for the U.S. commander of the Seventh Fleet, which oversees operations over some 48 million square miles extending from Japan to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and from Vladivostok, Russia, to Australia. The Washington Post also alleges that Glenn Defense Marine has over-billed the Navy for the entire 25-years that it serviced ships and vessels attached to the service. CBS News reported that maintenance for one ship, the aircraft carrier Stennis, cost the Navy $2.7 million, which is about double the average price charged by other ports. 'The allegations described in this complaint describe a bribery case with all the sexy elements of a TV drama,' Laura E. Duffy, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California said in an e-mailed statement. Lured to his arrest: Also taken into custody and charged in criminal complaints unsealed in U.S. district court in San Diego on Tuesday were Leonard Glenn Francis . 'But the significance of the case is that it involves huge sums of money, a wide range of players, a long period of time and a number of countries.' Prior to his assignment at the Seventh Fleet, Misiewicz had been commanding officer of the USS Mustin, a forward-deployed guided-missile destroyer. A separate criminal complaint charged Francis with providing Beliveau, 44, travel, entertainment, prostitutes and other gifts in exchange for information about an NCIS investigation into his company. Prosecutors charged Beliveau with downloading confidential reports about that probe from the agency's database and conveying that information to Francis. Francis was arrested in San Diego last month, while Misiewicz was taken into custody in Colorado and Beliveau in Virginia - all mast month. Francis, a Malaysian national, was allegedly arrested in the United States after being duped into coming to San Diego by Navy officials who arrested him in a sting-operation. All three face a maximum of five years in federal prison if convicted at trial. According to a 2010 U.S. Navy release, Misiewicz grew up near Phnom Penh during the Vietnam war and was adopted by an American woman shortly before the Khmer Rouge came to power in 1975. Reunion: Navy Cmdr. Michael V. Misiewicz, then commanding officer of the guided-missile destroyer USS Mustin, is greeted by a member of his family as the Mustin arrives in Sihanoukville, Cambodia on Dec. 3, 2010 . He escaped the notorious 'Killing Fields' and was heralded publicly for his successful rise to become the skipper of the USS Mustin - and made an emotional returen to Cambodia in 2010, which was given huge media attention. The Navy said in the release that a visit by the USS Mustin to Sihanoukville, Cambodia, in December 2010 marked his first return to that country since his adoption 37 years earlier. On Sunday, a senior Navy spokesman deflected inquires into the status of the still-unfolding investigation.

'There’s no blame placed on Kate . Middleton, who was in the hospital as far as I could see for absolutely . no reason. She feels no shame about the death of this woman' Morrissey . Earlier this year Morrissey, who lives in Los Angeles, slammed the ‘blustering jingoism’ of London 2012 and even compared the support of athletes to Nazi Germany in the late 1930s. The Manchester-born star said: ‘I am unable to watch the Olympics due to the blustering jingoism that drenches the event. The spirit of 1939 Germany now pervades throughout media-brand Britain.’ The result of a post-mortem examination on the nurse will be released at the inquest into her death at Westminster Coroner's Court tomorrow morning. The death is not being treated as suspicious. Meanwhile, the family of Ms Saldanha are set to receive more than £300,000 from Southern Cross Austereo, the parent company of 2Day FM, through a memorial fund established in her memory. Remorse: Kate has not spoken out directly about the mother-of-two's death following the hoax call by Mel Greig (right) and Michael Christian (left) of 2Day FM, but Clarence House issued a statement last week . SCA chief executive Rhys Holleran said: ‘We hope that by contributing to a memorial fund, we can help to provide the Saldanha family with the support they need at this very difficult time.’ Labour MP Keith Vaz has been campaigning on behalf of the nurse's husband Benedict Barboza, daughter Lisha, 14, and son Junal, 16. 'She clearly loved her job, loved her work (and) cared deeply about the health of the patients, and what has happened is a complete tragedy' Prime Minister David Cameron . He has called on King Edward VII Hospital to hold a full inquiry and offer further support to her loved ones. It has been reported that the family did not know about the hoax call until after Ms Saldanha's death. David Cameron paid tribute to Ms Saldanha and told the Commons that MPs' sympathies and condolences would be with her family. Speaking at Prime Minister's questions, he said: ‘She clearly loved her job, loved her work (and) cared deeply about the health of the patients, and what has happened is a complete tragedy.’ Sadness: Labour MP Keith Vaz (right) has been campaigning on behalf of the nurse's husband Benedict Barboza (centre), daughter Lisha (left), 14, and son Junal (right), 16 . Mr Vaz has also written to Mr Holleran claiming that his company has yet to make any direct contact . with Ms Saldanha's family. 'I am concerned and disappointed that Southern Cross Austereo appears to have not taken any steps to assist the family' Labour MP Keith Vaz . The MP, who is chairman of the House . of Commons Home Affairs Committee, conceded there had been a public . apology for the incident and its consequences through the media. But he wrote: ‘I am concerned and . disappointed that Southern Cross Austereo appears to have not taken any . steps to assist the family. ‘There has been no written apology, no . request for a meeting with the family and no attempt to travel to the .

A £1.75billion Spanish submarine project has run aground after officials realised that the vessel is more than 70 tonnes too heavy - because an engineer put a decimal point in the wrong place. A former Spanish official has described the mistake, which has led to fears that the submarine might not resurface if sent to sea, as 'fatal'. The Isaac Peral, the first in a new class of diesel electric submarines, was almost complete when the problem was noticed. Too heavy: The Isaac Peral, a new, Spanish-designed submarine is more than 70 tons too heavy, and officials fear if it goes out to sea, it will not be able to surface. Officials are pictured next to the engine of the vessel last November . Spain will now pay US Navy contractor Electric Boat £9million over three years to assess the issue and carry out the work required to correct it, according to the Spanish Defence Ministry. Rafael Bardaji, former director of the Office of Strategic Assessment at Spain's Defense Ministry said that officials will review options suggested by Electric Boat. But he said the preference has been to extend the length of the submarine’s hull, perhaps by 5 to 6 meters, to increase buoyancy. Otherwise, the weight of the 2,200 tonne submarine would have to be reduced, and he said the Spanish Navy would not want to compromise features such as the combat system or an air-independent propulsion system. Experts: Electric Boat, the company who will help the Spanish rectify the problem, helped to build the Astute class attack submarine, pictured, for the British Navy in 2003 . Electric Boat, the primary contractor for the U.S. Navy’s fleet of nuclear submarines, accepted the contract through a foreign military sales agreement between the American Navy and the Spanish Defense Ministry, the U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command announced this week. The submarine project has cost the Spanish some £1.75billion so far. But what exactly are they getting for their money with the SSK submarine: . Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamic Corp., has helped other countries with their submarine programs. It began assisting with development of the Astute-class nuclear attack submarine for the British Royal Navy in 2003, and it is working under another foreign military sales agreement on Australia’s Collins class of submarines. The 233ft long submarine will carry a . crew of 32, along with eight special forces troops, and weapons systems . for surface and anti-submarine warfare. The Defense Ministry said technical problems are normal for projects of this scale. It . said in a statement: 'The technology challenges that these programs . face during development are much more than simple calculations. 'All . the major military programs, especially submarines, have experienced . delays and often have required the support of a technology partner.' Mr . Bardaji added: 'Apparently somebody in the calculations made a mistake . in the very beginning and nobody paid attention to review the . calculations.' The Isaac Peral, named after a 19th . century Spanish submarine designer, is one of four vessels in the class . that are in various stages of construction. The country has invested . about £1.75billion in the program. The . first vessel was scheduled to be delivered in 2015 but the Spanish . state-owned shipbuilder, Navantia, has said the weight problems could . cause delays of up to two years.","Experts fear that the Isaac Peral will not surface again if sent to sea .

Mary Berry effect: The WI's membership peaked at 211,000 in 2011/2012  - the highest since the 1970s, with the Mary Berry's popularity thought to have had an influence . Forget Calendar Girls. The WI has another phenomenon to thank for its latest resurgence – the Mary Berry effect. The woman who inspired a new generation to master the mysterious arts of fondant fancies and filo pastry has also, it appears, helped revive the Women’s Institute. Last year 22,600 women joined the WI, with overall membership for 2011/2012 peaking at 211,000 – the highest since the 1970s. Some new members are as young as 20. This huge rise has been credited in part to Miss Berry, 77, and the popularity of the Great British Bake Off. As a result, 144 new institutes have been created across England and Wales in the past year. Ruth Bond, chairman of the National Federation of Women’s Institutes, said: ‘Home baking has been enjoying a great resurgence over the past few years and many new WI members have told us that brushing up on their baking skills was one of the reasons why they decided to join the organisation. ‘I’m sure that programmes like the Great British Bake Off have inspired more women to take up baking because the experts make it look quite . easy and fun and take away the fear factor. 'Of course it’s practice that . makes things work like a dream and we offer the chance to get better . and better. ‘It’s a pity we don’t have cooking in schools in a more determined way. I . grew up knowing how to cook but a lot of people haven’t and there are . lots of basics in baking and cookery that you really need to know to . make things work. Inspiration: This membership surge rise has been credited in part to Miss Berry, 77, and the popularity of the Great British Bake Off . ‘And the great thing about baking is that you can quite quickly have a . decent end result that is enjoyable for the taste buds but also gives . you a sense of achievement at having made something that looks good and . that people say they enjoy.’ Post-war austerity prompted a steady rise in the number of women joining institutes around the country. In 1973 there were 442,158. But that slumped in the 80s and 90s as women took a stand against being labelled as housewives putting many institutes on the brink of closure. The Great British Bake Off has earned its makers between £5million and £10million, according to analysts, and they are not the only ones reaping the benefits. Cake-making groups are rapidly . becoming the new book clubs, with members meeting regularly to swap . recipe ideas and sample each other’s offerings. The . Clandestine Cake Club, which has branches across the UK as well as . abroad in countries including Spain, Switzerland and Australia, seen . membership figures increase from 1,000 last year to 6,000 this year. Success: Ruth Bond, chairman of the National Federation of Women¿s Institutes, said: 'I'm sure that programmes like the Great British Bake Off have inspired more women to take up baking' There are now 150 clubs, compared with 19 this time last year. Sales of baking equipment have also increased. John Lewis has reported a 126 per cent rise in sales of Silicone Bakeware and cooling racks are up 70 per cent, year on year. Lakeland sold 1.5 million pieces of bake and ovenware in 2012 and reported a 30 per cent rise overall in the sales of cookery products. Nicola Hattersley, cookshop buyer for John Lewis said: ‘We have definitely seen an increased interest from our customers for baking accessories. ‘I am sure that programs like The Great British Bake Off have reignited a passion for home baking and have inspired lots of people to try their hand at making freshly baked cakes and pastries.’","WI membership reached 211,000 last year, its highest level since the 1970s .

A man blackmailed a terrified Muslim teenager into handing over more than £15,000 worth of her mother’s jewellery to stop him exposing a sex tape of her on Facebook. Aamir Khan, 20, told the 16-year-old girl that he had covertly filmed her during an intimate encounter with him in his car. He then made demands for money and gold, threatening to post the footage on Facebook and send a copy to her parents. 'Cynical betrayal': Aamir Khan blackmailed a Muslim teenager, 16, into handing over more than £15,000 worth of family jewellery to stop him exposing her in a sex tape on Facebook, Leicester Crown Court (pictured) heard . The victim was so frightened of her parents finding out that she took jewellery, including irreplaceable family heirlooms, and handed them to Khan through her bedroom window on several occasions. The Muslim girl was so ashamed that she considered running away from home and killing herself, Leicester Crown Court heard. Khan, of Spinney Hills, Leicester, admitted blackmail and was sentenced to three years and seven months youth detention. Judge Michael Pert QC described Khan’s actions as ‘wicked’ and a ‘cynical betrayal’. He said: ‘The blackmail happened in 2009 when you were 18 and she was 16. It's of some significance you both come from a background where the shame of teenage sex would have more impact than perhaps it might in other circles. ‘You made a number of demands over several weeks, cynically and brutally. ‘She would have been mortified of photographs going on Facebook and her parents getting to know. There has to be a deterrent sentence. ‘People must realise what an appalling crime this is and how members of society view it with disgust.’ He said Khan only admitted his wrongdoing after a long delay, on the day of the trial. Judge . Pert said: ‘You hoped to get away with it and didn't plead guilty until . the last minute, causing the victim more anguish about whether she'd . have to say what had happened in court - and then be called a liar.’ A pre-sentence report on Khan described him as ‘controlling and manipulative’. Jonathan Eley, prosecuting, said after the sexual encounter with the victim the defendant dropped her off in his car. Khan casually remarked: ‘It's a good thing Blackberrys [phones] have cameras.’ A few minutes later he phoned the girl, saying he had filmed what had happened, the court heard. Mr . Eley said: ‘He told her to get money or he'd post a copy of the film . through her letterbox and put it on Facebook so her family would see . what kind of daughter they had.’ ‘The family had high value, high carat jewellery and she took rings, bangles and chains. 'Wicked' threats: Khan made demands for money and gold, threatening to post the tape on Facebook and mail a copy to her parents  after telling the victim he had covertly filmed an intimate encounter with her . ‘The . next night the defendant collected it from her window. He later falsely . claimed half of it was fake and demanded more gold and made more . threats about the video. ‘A day or so later he took more bangles, chains and necklaces with family names on them.’ He told her he needed the money to recompense someone for damage he caused to a car, and later demanded more gold because he needed to spend money on his own vehicle. Mr Eley said: ‘She told him it was all gone. He then sent her a message saying he'd given the video to a colleague who knew where she lived and demanded £500.’ There was a burglary a few weeks later at the house, by persons unknown. The victim's sister suspected something was wrong and found incriminating phone messages from Khan to her sister, demanding gold. The girl confessed to her family, who have had rallied round to support her, said Mr Eley. No video footage was ever recovered and it is believed no sexual encounter was ever recorded. None of the jewellery, worth £15,000, has been found. In a victim personal statement, the girl said she thought about running away and ending her life because of the ‘whole nightmare for me and my family’. Judge Pert made a restraining order banning Khan from any contact with the victim or her family. Anthony Rimmer, mitigating, said: ‘It was an unsophisticated blackmail. He's shown genuine remorse and realises the shame and abhorrence it's caused to the girl's family. ‘He wishes he could turn the clock back.’","Aamir Khan, 20, told the girl, 16, he had covertly filmed them during an intimate encounter in his car .

The doctor found to be responsible for the death of pop icon Michael Jackson will be freed from jail in just three months - after serving less than two years following his 2011 involuntary manslaughter conviction for giving the 'King of Pop' a lethal dose of the powerful sedative propofol. Conrad Murray is scheduled to be freed from the Los Angeles County Jail on October 28, after serving less than two years of a four-year sentence - and members of Jackson's family reportedly are livid. Murray served his time in county jail - rather than state prison - due to overcrowding in the the California prison system. Free man: Dr. Conrad Murray is expected to be released from prison in October after serving less than two years of a four-year sentence . 'This is It': 'The King of Pop' announcing what was supposed to be his final tour . 'It is not right I will never be able to see my son again, while his mother can see him,' sources close to the Jackson family told the Daily Mirror. The source went on to say the family - including his devastated children, Paris, 15, Prince, 16, Blanket, 11, and his 83-year-old mother, Katherine - feels Murray 'should serve his time for his crime.' 'Murray is the killer of Michael in their eyes. He cost them their son and father,' the source said, adding that 'for [Murray] to get out in two years is an insult. They still feel he should have been tried for murder.' Murray was sentenced to four years for Jackson's death, but is expected to get time off from his sentence for good behavior. Grieving: Jackson's children - Blanket (left) Paris (center) and Prince - will grow up without a father . 'He has been a model inmate and the authorities have granted him an early . release due to that good behaviour and the overcrowded California jail . system,' a friend of the doctor's told the paper. Murray reportedly has been serving his time in solitary confinement because of the high-profile nature of his case - and because the victim was a beloved figure in pop culture. Despite being in solitary confinement, Murray has both a television and a cell phone in his cell. In addition to the reduced sentence, the Jackson family is enraged that Murray has refused to provide testimony in their wrongful death lawsuit against concert promoter AEG Live, which was promoting Jackson's 2009 'This Is It' tour. Outraged: Jackson's mother, Katherine, is furious that Murray is being released after less than two years . The tour was pegged as Jackson's final tour. The family claims that the grueling rehearsal schedule - and AEG Live's negligence in hiring Murray - contributed to Jackson's death in June of 2009. This week, Murray made headlines when he said that if he was forced to testify in the wrongful death case, he would reveal information about Jackson's relationship with his family that would be like a 'nuclear' bombshell. It's unclear to what he might be referring. Murray says he wants nothing to do with the lawsuit because he fears he could be incriminated. Murray is appealing his criminal conviction.

French President Francois Hollande telephoned President Barack Obama to express his 'deep disapproval' amid claims that American spies secretly listened in to 70.3 million private phone calls in France over less than one month. Hollande told Obama that the alleged . practices were 'unacceptable between friends and allies because they . infringe on the privacy of French citizens'. At the same time, German weekly Der . Spiegel reported the NSA had also hacked into former Mexican president . Felipe Calderon's email account. Anger: French President Francois Hollande telephoned President Obama last night to express his 'deep disapproval' amid claims that American spies secretly listened in to 70.3 million private phone calls in France over less than one month . France's Le Monde newspaper reported that the US National Security Agency had secretly monitored 70.3 million phone communications in France over 30 days from December 10, 2012, to January 8 this year. The allegations, the latest from leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, also marred a visit to Paris by US Secretary of State John Kerry, where he discussed moves to try to end the war in Syria. Claims: A German newspaper reported the NSA had also hacked into former Mexican president Felipe Calderon's email account . Calderon, on Twitter, described the revelations as an 'affront to the institutions of the country, given that it took place when I was president'. The allegations come on top of previous revelations by Snowden - who has sought safety in Russia as US authorities pursue him for leaking classified information - that the United States had a vast, secret programme called PRISM to monitor Internet users. French prosecutors are already investigating the programme, and French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said he was 'deeply shocked' by the new revelations. 'It's incredible that an allied country like the United States at this point goes as far as spying on private communications that have no strategic justification, no justification on the basis of national defence,' he told journalists. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, on a visit to Luxembourg, said US ambassador Charles Rivkin was summoned to his ministry early Monday. 'These kinds of practices between partners that harm privacy are totally unacceptable,' he told reporters, adding France needed assurances that the United States was no longer monitoring its communications. His comments were relayed to the US ambassador during the meeting, a ministry spokesman said - the second time in less than four months that America's top representative in France has been hauled in over revelations about US snooping. Kerry refused to comment on the specific accusations, but noted that Washington was reviewing its intelligence gathering operations following protests from allied governments. He also sought to defend the US position. 'Protecting the security of our citizens in today's world is a very complicated, very challenging task... because there are lots of people out there seeking to do harm to other people,' Kerry said at a press conference after meeting Arab League officials. 'Lots of countries are engaged in the activity of trying to protect their citizens in the world,' he said. 'Our goal is always to try to find the right balance between protecting the privacy and security of our citizens.' Overshadowed: The allegations also marred a visit to Paris by US Secretary of State John Kerry, where he discussed moves to try to end the war in Syria . Talks: French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius shakes hands with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry at the Foreign Affairs Ministry in Paris . According to Le Monde, the spy agency automatically picked up communications from certain phone numbers in France and recorded certain text messages under a programme code-named 'US-985D'. The French daily said the documents gave grounds to believe that the NSA targeted not only people suspected of being involved in terrorism but also high-profile individuals in business and politics. Hollande's office said the French president and Obama had agreed 'to work together to determine the facts and the exact scope of surveillance activities' revealed by Le Monde. Der Spiegel also revealed that US agents had hacked into the Mexican presidency's network, gaining access to Calderon's account. According to the report, the NSA said this contained 'diplomatic, economic and leadership communications which continue to provide insight into Mexico's political system and internal stability'. The agency reportedly said the president's office was now 'a lucrative source'. The latest report on US spying in France underlines the extent of the NSA's capabilities in listening and recording such vast amounts of personal data . Mexican authorities said they would be seeking answers from US officials 'as soon as possible'. 'This practice is unacceptable, illegitimate and contrary to Mexican law and international law,' the foreign ministry said. Glenn Greenwald, an American journalist now living in Brazil who has broken many of the recent stories about secret US surveillance programmes, says Washington has spied on all Latin American countries. Speaking to a press association in Miami, Greenwald said he would report about each case in the region and warned that more spying within the United States would also be revealed. He also said the disclosures published by Le Monde Monday had been in the hands of the French daily for some time. The article in Le Monde was co-written by Glenn Greenwald, pictured, the American journalist who first published the documents leaked by Snowden . This is not the first time there have been reports that France and Mexico have been targeted in relation to NSA spying allegations since information leaked by Snowden first emerged in June.Mexico's current President Enrique Pena Nieto has already complained to Obama over reports US spies have gone through his emails. And Der Spiegel reported last month that in 2010 the NSA monitored the internal computer network of France's diplomats and that of the foreign ministry. But France itself has also been accused of spying. Le Monde reported in recent months that intelligence services intercepted all communications in the country, stocking telephone and computer data for years - accusations denied by the government.","Allegations based on leaks from US ex-intelligence analyst Edward Snowden .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:28 EST, 16 September 2011 . Silvio Berlusconi hired more than 30 women, including actresses and prostitutes, to attend his private parties, Italian investigators allege. They said they had intercepted more than 100,000 conversations and telephone calls following a two-year probe into the allegations. There are reports the calls involve . Berlusconi himself talking about nights spent with the escorts and . commenting on their performances. The investigators said at least 30 women were invited to his parties, and than many 'prostituted themselves' with the leader in return for cash and other gifts, the Daily Telegraph said. PM's girls: Sara Tommasi, left, and Barbara Guerra, right, have been named by investigators as being among those who attended Berlusconi's private parties . They now want charges to be brought against . eight people said to have supplied the Italian Prime Minisiter with . women for parties he hosted at his official residences in Rome, Milan . and Sardinia between 2008 and 2009. Some of the women were from South America and Eastern Europe. Italian actress Manuela Arcuri was allegedly promised the . chance to host the annual San Remo musical festival in exchange for . sleeping with Mr Berlusconi, but turned down the offer. Investigators say Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi recruited more than 30 women for his parties . Others named in the list leaked to the Italian press - who have dubbed it 'a harem' - included Patrizia . D'Addario, a self-confessed call girl, Ioanna Visan, a Romanian showgirl and underwear model Francesca Lana. Aspiring showgirls Sara Tommasi, Barbara Guerra and Barbara Montereale were also on the list. Berlusconi has always denied any . knowledge that the women were escorts and that he paid for sex insisting . he could 'never understand people who pay for sex as there is no thrill . of the chase.' His legal team are said to be frantically trying to have the intercepted calls ruled out as evidence in any potential trial. In Italy, wiretaps and listening devices are used extensively as part of prosecution cases and investigations. Among the eight people who could face charges are businessman Giampaolo Tarantini, who is already under investigation for his part in an alleged blackmail plot against Berlusconi. He is said to have paid him more than Â£660,000 in hush money so as not to reveal details of the prostitutes. Besides . Tarantini there is also Sabina Began, 36, a German actress who calls . herself the 'Queen Bee' when it comes to Berlusconi and who earlier this . year claimed in an interview that the under pressure politician had . 'helped her find God.' Investigators will now ask a judge to formally charge the eight people in connection to 28 offences ranging from procuring prostitutes to criminal association. Sabina Began, said to the 'queen bee' of Berlusconi's girls, allegedly recruited three women for a party he hosted in Rome . The inquiry began in 2009 after . Tarantini's name hit the headlines when it emerged he had arranged for . the escorts to attend parties Berlusconi hosted at his residences in . Rome and Sardinia and photographs of the women in one of his bathrooms . later emerged. Patrizia D'Addario, 42, said she was . paid to spend the night with the media tycoon and later went on to write . a book in which she praised Berlusconi, 74, for his sexual performance . adding that he deserved a 'place in the Guinness Book of Records.' Investigators say that Tarantini, Began and the others were in charge . of recruiting the women for the parties and were paid for their efforts . or had other favours in return such as contracts for business ventures. In separate but linked cases prosecutors are looking into allegations that drugs were also supplied. Barbara Montereale has been named as one of the women who attended parties held by Berlusconi . Italian escort girl Patrizia D'Addario, left said she was paid to spend the night with the media tycoon, while Moroccan call girl Karima Keyek was apparently paid to attend 'bunga bunga' parties . Details of the allegations and telephone calls were revealed in official prosecution documents deposited at the main court building in Bari and which a judge will now go through to decide if there is enough evidence for the charges to be be brought against the eight people named. In a statement the Bari prosecutor's office confirmed the investigation had officially closed and said: 'This case began in the summer of 2009 and since then more than 100,000 telephone calls and other intercepted conversations with listening devices have been transcribed and those that have been deemed relevant form part of the file asking for charges to be brought against eight people.' The files revealed how Miss Began had allegedly recruited three women for a party Berlusconi hosted at his Rome residence Palazzo Grazioli. Italian actresses Manuela Arcuri refused the offer to sleep with Berlusconi . Earlier this summer Miss Began, who has a tattoo dedicated to Berlusconi on her ankle, told an Italian radio show about her relationship with the politician and said: 'He loves God, he speaks to God. He is a believer and thanks to him I have become religious as well. 'He is a very spiritual man. He has helped me to find faith and his home is decorated with crucifixes. He is very spiritual and he has put me on a spiritual path.' Berlusconi himself is not suspected or accused of any wrong doing in Bari case which is different to the infamous 'bunga bunga' investigation which has led to him being accused of having sex with an underage prostitute. The pharse 'bunga bunga' is said to refer to crude after-dinner sex games played at Berlusconi's home near Milan by female guests who were invited there. Among them a then 17-year-old belly dancer called Karima El Mahroug who, prosecutors say was paid in cash and jewellery along with 32 other women who attended the parties. In Italy the age of consent is 14 but paying for sex with a girl below 18 is seen as under-age prostitution and carries a maximum three year jail sentence. As part of the same case Berlusconi is also accused of abusing his position as prime minister, using his influence to secure Miss El Mahroug's release from police custody after she was arrested in connection with a 3,000 Euro theft. Berlusconi denies all over the charges.","Many of them 'prostituted themselves' at parties held by Italian PM .

In . a written statement, addressing the question of what ethical issues . need to be held in mind by a journalist communicating with the police, . he said: 'The main ethical issue is that we never pay police officers . for stories or seek to put the police in a position where they feel that . they should provide information to us in exchange for anything that . they consider that they are getting from us.' Decision: Britain's Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, pictured, says 14 NotW staff will find out if they face charges within weeks . He also warned that there was a 'climate of fear' stopping officers talking to the Press. He wrote: 'I believe that officers . should be allowed to speak to the Press about their cases without the . fear that they are going to be accused of corruption. At the moment . there is a climate of fear in which officers are too scared to talk to . the Press.' The other . suspect was Daily Star . Sunday deputy news editor Tom Savage, who was shown on a GPS locator on . his website at East Dulwich police station in south-east London this . morning. The pair are being questioned at separate . police stations on suspicion of conspiracy to corrupt and of conspiracy . to cause misconduct in a public office, the Met said. A spokesman said: 'Today's arrests . relate to suspected payments to a public official and are not about . seeking journalists to reveal confidential sources in relation to . information that has been obtained legitimately.' The latest arrests mean 41 people . have been arrested by detectives on Operation Elveden, the investigation . into suspected corrupt payments to public officials. The operation is being run alongside Operation Weeting, the Scotland Yard probe into phone-hacking. The Met spokesman said: 'A . 37-year-old man was arrested at his home in Kent and a 34-year-old man . at his home in south-east London at approximately 6am this morning on . suspicion of conspiracy to corrupt (contrary to the Prevention of . Corruption Act 1906) and of conspiracy to cause misconduct in a public . office (contrary to common law). 'The two, both journalists, are being questioned at police stations in Kent and south-east London.' It comes after the Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer revealed more than a dozen former News of the World journalists will find out by the end of this month if they face phone hacking charges . Keir . Starmer says he is 'reasonably confident' the Crown Prosecution Service . will make a final decision on the 14 suspects within weeks. Probe: Former NotW staff arrested under Operation Weeting, pictured clockwise, include Rebekah Brooks, Andy Coulson, former assistant editor Ian Edmondson, and former Managing Editor Stuart Kuttner . Journalists arrested and bailed include former editors Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks, who may have directed or allowed their staff to intercept mobile phone voicemails. Former . assistant editor Ian Edmondson, chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and . managing editor Stuart Kuttner were also arrested as part of the . Metropolitan Police's hacking operation, known as Weeting. Starmer . told the Guardian that alleged phone hacking cases would be dealt with . as 'a batch' meaning that the fate of those allegedly involved will be . dramatically announced on the same day this month. Any hacking charges would be the first brought since 2007. The . News of the World's former royal editor Clive Goodman and private . investigator Glenn Mulcaire were then jailed for four months and six . months respectively for intercepting messages from members of the royal . family and their staff. Prosecutors . are currently using a 'broad interpretation' of the Regulation of . Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa), Starmer said, which will allow . journalists to be charged with hacking even if the person had listened . to the voicemail first. Former Met assistant commissioner John . Yates had said previously it was not clear if someone could be . prosecuted if a message had already been played back. Starmer . also told the Guardian that alternative charges would also be . considered 'in so far as it was necessary,' including conspiring to . intercept communications and computer hacking. He added that the 'public interest' test was being applied to every case. If the person allegedly being hacked had acted with 'serious hypocrisy', like having an affair for example, this will also be considered, he said.","Justin Penrose and Tom Savage held in dawn raids .

A Motorist was hit with a £70 parking fine after pulling over for just seven seconds to drop off his elderly mother-in-law. Ian Hardman, 58, fell foul of a council-run spy car when he stopped in an empty taxi rank to let 82-year-old Audrey Harrison out. He later received a letter from Bolton council, giving him 28 days to pay the fine – which works out as £10 for every second of his good deed. Stopped: Mr Hardman's car is pictured pulling over on Bolton high street at 14.22.28 . Driving off: In this next picture, the driver is about to pull away in his car at 14.22.35 . Close-up: The images were taken by a council 'spy car' parked a few metres away . The council-run car recorded the moment Mr Hardman stopped his Ford Focus at the side of the road that afternoon at 14.22 and 28 seconds. It then took a second snap of Mrs Harrison getting out of the car at 14.22 and 33 seconds before grabbing a third photo as her son-in-law was driving away at 14.22 and 35 seconds. The retired firefighter received a four-page letter from Bolton Council saying he was guilty of ‘parking contravention’ and was given 28 days to pay the fine. The council refused his appeal, warning that parking for just a few seconds could have prevented a cab driver from picking up a fare. If he had parked just yards further up the road in a loading bay, he would have avoided the penalty notice. Pay up: Mr Hardman received a letter  from Bolton Council saying he was guilty of a 'parking contravention' Today . Mr Hardman joined other drivers who also fell foul of the spy car by . complaining to Bolton Council claiming motorists were being targeted as . 'cash cows'. Mr Hardman, who . is a blue badge holder and registered disabled due to a spinal injury . he suffered when in the fire service, said he had never been given a . parking ticket before. He said: 'People talk about the death of the British high street and it’s hardly surprising when the people in authority allow this sort of thing to happen. Penalty charge: The driver thought this letter he received from Bolton council 'was a joke' 'It just puts you off going into town for fear of being spied on by these council snoopers. 'When the fine came through the post my first reaction was just to be very angry. I have never been in trouble in my life and never even had a parking ticket. 'I thought it was a joke. I could have just pulled over on the road but I thought I did the right thing by getting off the road and not causing an obstruction to other traffic. 'The taxi rank was empty anyway it was two in the afternoon, not in the rush hour or peak time and there was not a soul waiting for a cab. 'I didn’t even turn my engine off. How can you get a parking fine when you haven’t even parked up? It has all been a big shock. It took me a while to realise what the offence was and when I did I burst out laughing. 'The council must be very hard-up if they’re charging people for seven seconds. It is just ridiculous - whoever has seen this and then sent it out ought to be demoted. 'Our town centre is dead now, full of charity shops and empty buildings and it’s no wonder. Shoppers don’t want to come here any more because of these jobsworths.' Local shopkeepers near the layby in Knowsley Street said Bolton Council’s camera car, which films from inside a small Toyota IQ car, has been located at the layby for weeks trying to catch out motorists. One driver complained after pulling up for 12 seconds to drop off his wife and daughter in the same area. Ilyas Dajkatar, who runs Royal Cafe in Knowsley Street, said: 'Lots and lots of drivers, more than 100, have been caught. 'I got a ticket when I popped into the . shop with a small delivery a couple of weeks ago. I can’t believe that . they are trying to catch people out like this. 'When . I got my fine I had been stopped for less than 20 seconds. I think it . is affecting business. When people are so worried about parking then it . puts them off coming into town.' 'Spy car': The vehicles, which are fitted with CCTV cameras, have been called council 'cash cows' by critics . The council said parking and stopping, for any time, in taxi ranks contravenes the Highway Code. A Bolton Council spokesman said: 'The taxi rank is reserved for the use of Hackney Carriage drivers only and no other vehicles are permitted to stop there. 'We acknowledge this driver may feel that the fine is unfair because he was there for only a short period of time. However, the taxi rank is clearly signed and stopping in the rank, even for a few seconds, could prevent a taxi from parking and picking up a fare.' Today, figures released by car . insurance company LV showed that motorists are being stung by almost . 900,000 parking fines a month at a cost of £30million. This is an increase of 4 per cent on the previous year. The . figures also showed that tickets issued on Sundays have increased by 13 . per cent – with nearly 300,000 tickets issued on that day of the week . in the first five months of 2013. The AA have said that traffic wardens often target Sunday church-goers and choristers. Mr Hardman is just one of a string of drivers hit with fines from the so-called 'CCTV cars'. The camera cars were originally introduced to provide traffic safety outside schools, but have been increasingly used to capture motorists who park illegally - even for a few seconds. There have been reports of drivers who didn't even stop their vehicles being fined. In May, a London council was accused of ordering the 'spy' cars to hit minimum targets for issuing penalty notices - despite the practice being illegal. The alleged policy, carried out on behalf of Haringey Council in north London, was revealed in a series of leaked emails and showed that the cars were told to issue at least 260 fines a day. The council denied imposing a 87,360 per year quota for fines. In March, the Communities Secretary . Eric Pickles said he wanted to put an end to the 'over-zealous culture . of parking enforcement'. He said that shoppers visiting the high street should no longer be hit with fines for stopping at the local shop for 10 minutes.","Ian Hardman, 58, stopped in a taxi rank in Bolton, Greater Manchester .

With £6million in his back pocket, you'd think Stephen Hester would be able to afford the finest home furnishings money can buy. So it's a bit of a surprise that the 52-year-old former chief executive of RBS has been making trips to budget furniture store Ikea. The banker has been spotted carrying his belongings . in one of the chain's distinctive bright blue bags while on holiday in . the south of France with his wife Suzy Neubert. Flat pack millionaire: Former RBS chief Stephen Hester was spotted with his belongings in a bag from budget furniture chain Ikea, despite his £6m severance package . Break: Mr Hester arrived in the south of France with his second wife Suzy Neubert . He received the seven-figure sum - . enough to buy a million £6 Lack tables from the popular Swedish store - . as a golden goodbye from the bank, which is 81 per cent owned by the . taxpayer after a £45billion bailout. The keen huntsman is on a golfing holiday at the £1,000-a-night Royal Mougins resort near Cannes after leaving the bank last week. This cost-conscious choice of shop is especially surprising considering he enjoyed an annual salary of about £1.2million while heading the bank, as well as long-term incentives linked to shares. He owns a 350-acre estate in Oxfordshire and a ski chalet in Verbier, Switzerland - hardly the ideal setting for a £20 MDF side table.

With £6million, he could buy 240,000 units . He is on a golfing holiday at the £1,000-a-night Royal Mougins resort near Cannes in the French Riviera . He was brought in to run the bank after the Treasury was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis five years ago, but Chancellor George Osborne believes he is not the right person to guide the bank through privatisation. Speculation has been rife that Mr Hester’s departure from RBS reflected a split with Mr Osbourne over . the timing or structure of privatisation or perhaps a concern that the . Government was about to revive plans to break up RBS into a 'good' bank . and a 'bad' bank. However, he insists there has . been no falling out and claimed he did not feel any anger over the manner of his departure, adding: ‘I don’t want to show frustration, I don’t want to punch someone in the eye. ‘I haven’t hidden from anyone that I am torn a bit at this juncture. ‘Part of me did want to see the job fully through, did want the champagne and roses of a successful privatisation. Another part of me thought, “Goodness me, this job drives me nuts from time to time and how long do I want to do it for?”.' Mr Hester speaking to the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards earlier this year . He added: 'I genuinely mean I am comfortable . with what has happened. RBS is in much better shape than we had any . right to think it could be. I want the company to have a good future and . I want to pass the baton on smoothly and without rancour or difficulty. I am happy with this result.’ More than £1billion was wiped off the . value of the Government's stake in Royal Bank of Scotland in the wake . of the dramatic departure last week. Replacing him is expected to . take at least six months, with Mr Osborne reportedly sharing the RBS . board’s view that the next chief executive must be prepared to stay on . for at least five years. Mr Hester split from his first wife in 2010 and is now married to Mrs Neubert, a wealth manager. Cannes, on the French Riviera, appears to be a popular location for former RBS chiefs. Ex-Chief . executive Sir Fred Goodwin, who enjoys a £342,500 a year pension . despite the bank's failures, has a villa in the prosperous French city. The Oxford-educated banker enjoys hunting and is pictured here at the Warwickshire Hunt . More than £1billion was wiped off the value of the Government's stake in RBS after Mr Hester left . Stephen Hester was named the new chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland in October 2008 as Sir Fred Goodwin was ousted and the Labour Government made the first of two massive capital injections that eventually totalled £45billion to shore up the collapsing bank. Hester joined RBS from property giant British Land where he had been chief executive, but he was a banker through and through. A comprehensive education in Yorkshire took him to Oxford where he took a first in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. He then began a career in investment banking at Credit Suisse. It was here, between 1982 and 2001, that he laid the foundations of his personal wealth and met his first wife, Canadian-born Barbara Abt. Hester came to prominence in British retail banking from 2002 when he joined Abbey National, first as finance director and later as chief operating officer working alongside chief executive Luqman Arnold. Abbey had run into difficulties because of an expansion into wholesale banking which had backfired and lumbered the bank with toxic assets and spiralling losses. Arnold and Hester stabilised the bank and in 2004 sold it to Spanish giant Santander. After taking over at RBS, Hester oversaw a major shrinking of the bank’s assets, tackled the Libor scandal and suffered repeated public and political attacks over his bonuses, most of which he has been forced to waive.","Former RBS chief Mr Hester spotted with bag from budget chain .

A Halloween attraction featuring a section which sensationalises a simulated sex ordeal has been branded ‘degrading and humiliating’ by horrified rape charity bosses. The Scare Kingdom Scream Park is marketed as a ‘top Halloween destination’ and  promises a ‘unique and seriously twisted journey’. But this year, organisers have been accused of taking the ‘entertainment’ a step too far after adding a section which sees visitors strapped to a bed and a  cushion put on their faces, before a man climbs on top of them. One visitor, to the site in Ribble Valley, . Lancashire, was shocked to have a sex toy waved in her face before a bag was placed over her head. Scream Park: The Lancashire-based attraction has been heavily criticised but the owners say the content of the experience is explained before people enter . Scroll down for video . However, organisers AtmosFEAR! Scare Entertainment stood by the ‘Psychomanteum’, which is separate to the main attraction, for over 18s only and requires an additional charge. They said it was up to visitors whether they entered and they must sign a disclaimer before taking part, stating they know they will be manhandled, it will be sexually explicit and a bag may be put over them. Jo Wood, a trustee at Rape Crisis, said: 'I am horrified. We would not support such a degrading, humiliating experience or class it as entertainment. 'I am absolutely horrified that anyone can find it okay to prey on a woman’s deepest vulnerability and fear in this way in the name of cheap thrills, for who exactly? 'I can only imagine the damage this . would do to a recovering victim, a long ago victim - or any sane member . of public to be honest. 'This . is not about Halloween - or scares - it is about humiliation. It errs . on the dark side of scary - the secret and hidden world of sexual abuse . under the cover of ‘fun’ and ‘just a laugh’.' Valerie Wise, chief executive of Preston Domestic Violence Service added: 'I think it is legitimising violence against people. 'The . most common victims of personal violence are women. I think to make . entertainment out of violence against people is horrendous.' Psychomanteum is the only part of the . Scare Kingdom, held at Hawkshaw Farm Park that people enter alone. One horrified visitor to the Scare Kingdom attraction, who did not want to be named, has described her experience. She says she was repeatedly sworn at and strapped down on a bed. She said: 'It was an awful experience. It wasn't enjoyable at all and it certainly isn't entertainment. 'You enter on your own and walk into a dark room with a wheelchair in the middle. There's a woman who grabs you and shoves you down into the chair and then shouts at you to read the writing on the wall. 'I was then wheeled to the next room which had a toilet overflowing. I was told to kneel on a cushion with my head over the toilet and then the woman shouted and said ""I've finished with you now"". 'It was the next stage which I felt was just too far. 'There was a bed up against the wall and I was told to lie down. A man strapped me down and placed a cushion over my face. 'He then climbed on top of me and held the cushion down so I was really struggling to breathe. 'I couldn't see anything but I felt myself being wheeled through on the bed to another room. They must have untied me on the way. 'The cushion was removed and the man held a sex toy in my face and asked ""do you want it in your mouth or your f****** a***"". 'I was then chased out of the room with a man holding a chainsaw and you run straight into a bar. 'I was petrified but it meant I had to try and compose myself as quick as I could because there were people sat having a drink.' 'I couldn't believe it and it completely ruined the night,' the upset woman added, 'It was a real shame because the other sections were really good fun. 'There was a disclaimer on the wall before we went in which had some bullet points warning that it would be sexually explicit and you would be manhandled but I think my idea of explicit must be different to theirs. 'The disclaimer doesn't prepare you for the experience and I just wanted to go home after that. I was so shocked by what happened.' The experience lasts about three minutes. It is separate to the main attraction and it requires an additional charge of £3.50. Those who enter are given a ‘safe word’ which enables them to cut short the experience. It is the fifth year the festival has returned to the farm. In 2011, it was voted the ‘number one scream park.’ While visitors are in the room on their own, a live video feed of the activity is being streamed on a screen. Jason Karl, chief creative executive of AtmosFEAR! Scare Entertainment, said: 'Psychomanteum is a strictly 18 plus attraction which is an additional feature of the park. 'It is up to guests whether or not to enter. Those who do enter have the content of the experience explained and sign a disclaimer saying they wish to experience it. 'Psychomanteum is set in a fictional Victorian correctional facility where fear is pushed to the limit with intense and graphic encounters which are designed to make the guest feel uncomfortable and scared. 'We have had many positive reviews and feedback from guests, none of whom have complained of being offended by their experience.

Developers of a flying car say they're about $80 million closer to giving your morning commute a real lift. For years, Moller International has been working on a way to make the old science fiction dream of turning tires into turboprops a reality. Their SkyCar, designed for speeds of over 300 MPH at altitudes as high as 36,000 feet would seat four people and isn't trying to replace commercial air travel. Scroll down for video . Scenic drive: In this undated photo, Dr. Paul Moller stands with two prototypes of his SkyCar and his company's flying saucer, the Neuera, which he helped develop and himself piloted in the 1970s . Nor do they want their vehicle to cater to only the elite hobbyist. As of today, very few people have had the rare pleasure of riding in any iteration of the SkyCar. Instead, the company intends to bring their 'vertical take off & landing (VTOL) fast, low-cost personal recreational or utility vehicle' to the masses. Basically, an eye-catching alternative to the earthbound sports car. Jet set: To bring flying cars to a wide market, Dr. Moller insists they must take off and land vertically, like his SkyCar, pictured here in an unmanned demo of its hovering ability . Now, according to a Jan. 24 company statement, founder Dr. Paul Moller has persuaded a Southern California firm to offer up the hefty sum to speed his vehicles' path to the marketplace. The joint venture with Athena Technologies, Inc. of Harbor City . California, is intended to pair the 30 years of technological experience . backing Moller with Athena's affordable manufacturing capabilities . overseas in Chinese facilities. And the $80 million is just the tip of the iceberg. Flying high: Moller International has been working to bring a car/plane hybrid into reality for 30 years and the company's founder's latest attempt is the SkyCar 400, pictured here as an illustrated imagining of the car in flight . The companies are projecting an eventual $480 million investment into several varieties of the car-plane hybrid. This includes the 'Neuera' vehicle, basically a flying saucer powered by high-velocity fans. The company's website boasts the Neuera 'can operate up to 10 feet above any surface: land, water, sand, snow, . swamp or grasslands...combining the capabilities of a boat, hovercraft, ATV, snowmobile or . other off-road vehicle.' But don't start shopping around for pilot gear just yet. Production on the vehicles wouldn't begin until at least 2014 and the agreement between Moller and Athena isn't even yet official.

Home Secretary Theresa May welcomed the development, saying: ‘I hope what we are going to see is a resolution of this case for the sake of Maddie’s parents and family.’ Earlier this month Scotland Yard spoke of a possible breakthrough after it emerged that officers were analysing data from the phone records of people who were in Praia da Luz when Madeleine vanished.","Police look for ring of five paedophiles who may have taken youngster .

"By . Jenni Murray . PUBLISHED: . 17:13 EST, 23 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:13 EST, 23 October 2013 . Sitting opposite me, her tight sweater hugging her chest, her skirt barely skimming slender thighs, was the woman I had idolised as a teenager - and ever since. It's not often, when you've been in the interviewing business as long as I have, that you experience the flutter of nerves that once beset you in the early days. But my guest on the radio the other day was Cher, undoubtedly one of the most famous women in the world - indeed the only recording artist to have had a number one hit in every one of the six decades since she began her long music career with Sonny in the mid-Sixties. 'She's one of us': Jenni with her teenage idol Cher earlier this month . She's also known for being tough and outspoken and not suffering fools gladly and, as it's my job to ask the difficult questions, there were plenty of sticky subjects to approach which could have led to disastrous silences during Woman's Hour. There's the two kids and two husbands who had an unhealthy relationship with drugs, the daughter who became a son, and the rumours that she's spent half her life under the plastic surgeon's scalpel. My first thought when I woke up that day was: what if she's horrible? It would have shattered all the affection for her which began in 1965 when Sonny and Cher burst on the British music scene with I Got You Babe. I was 15, she was 19 and everything I wanted to be. She was beautiful with cheekbones to die for. Her voice was deep and powerful. Her hair hung around her face in the 'curtains' my mother had banned, and her clothes were loose and comfortable - totally on trend - but considered sloppy and messy by the American audience who never took to her as quickly as the British did. (When we met, she confided that those clothes were made for her by a dressmaker friend, and that they were all she could afford at the time.) On the day, she arrived at Broadcasting House to a barrage of paparazzi, and surrounded by the kind of entourage that accompanies any major star. I counted at least nine people dancing attendance and providing for her every need. Superstar: Cher at her most outrageous . She carried no handbag, suggesting one of them was responsible for carrying her money - and a packet of tissues. She says she never gets sick, but had picked up the cold that's going around. 'That's Britain for you,' she said with a grin and coughed heartily. Would she splutter through our interview? Thankfully not, after one of her minions handed her a plastic beaker with a straw containing some secret concoction. She is not a classically beautiful woman, but she is stunningly attractive. She's tall and fabulously slim and toned. She wore a leather jacket, which she removed at my request on account of the creaking every time she gesticulated. Not a good sound on the radio. Underneath, she had on what she described as her Union Jack sweater, seriously tight. Her skirt - an extended belt as my mother would have described it - and low-heeled black leather boots almost met at the hem. In other words, precisely the kind of thing she would have worn in the Sixties. Her hair is long and dyed black with a hint of bouncy curl, and her skin is flawless. I studied it carefully and, while it's obvious there's been work done, she doesn't have the tight, motionless features of one who's indulged in excessive plastic surgery. We talked first about those early days and the reason for her separation from Sonny. While she acknowledged he was pivotal in guiding her career, she told me that she found his need to control her and play the older, wiser partner suffocating. They were together for 12 years, but then she broke away, craving independence. I suspect that since that day, no one has been able to tell Cher what to do or how to behave. And I shouldn't have worried that she would duck the controversial questions. Why had she been critical of Miley Cyrus and her 'twerking' performance with the singer Robin Thicke, I asked? Wasn't it a bit rich coming from someone who'd unashamedly used shock tactics to engage her audience? She'd stunned America by baring her navel in the Seventies. She was apologetic, saying she'd kind of jumped on a bandwagon of criticism of Cyrus. She didn't blame her for knowing her own audience. She did, though, hold to her critique of the performance. It was, she smiled, simply bad and that's unforgivable. So, what about the plastic surgery? How much had she really had? First of all, she denied that there'd been any re-contouring of her body. She'd worked hard at it, she said, by keeping fit, slim and toned: it was all through her own physical effort with no surgical assistance. She had, though, begun to worry about her ageing face in her 40s. When she was cast in romantic roles opposite actors such as Nicolas Cage in Moonstruck - for which she won a Best Actress Oscar - she was very aware that he was in his 20s and the difference was glaringly apparent. She had a bit of bone shaved from her nose to give it a neater profile and had a nip and tuck. I suspected augmentation of the lips. There seemed to be a hint of a trout pout, though she denied it, saying she had no truck with anything that scared her. She had never had fillers or Botox, she said, and hated the idea of young people - who had nothing to fill - messing about with treatments she didn't think she could trust. Glamours: Cher strikes a pose in 1978 . She was open and confident about the work she had done, denying that she continued to feel pressure to look young. She claimed not to have any intention to go any further with surgery and insisted that what she had done had been entirely her choice and she had no regrets. She, at 67, has four years on me and there's no doubt she looks a good 30 years younger. It didn't make me like or admire her any less to know that she has cheated a bit. I would never go down that road, but then radio's a very forgiving medium for an older woman. Maybe if, like her, I'd relied on my face and my figure to earn a crust I might have been tempted to make a different decision. Sad, but seemingly unavoidable in our youth-obsessed culture. It was when we talked about her children that the emotion really surfaced. It had, she reckoned, been hell for them to be raised in the full glare of the publicity of being Cher's kids. She'd supported them through drug rehab, but had found her daughter Chastity's gender reassignment from female to male - he's now known as Chas - incredibly painful. She said she had called Chas soon after his surgery and heard his female voice on the phone. He'd forgotten to alter it and use a lower tone, and she asked him to leave it a little longer, a way of keeping in touch with the daughter she'd known. She says she's now completely happy with her son's decision because it has made him happy - which is all any mother wants. So what was it like to meet the woman I idolised as a girl? She was warm, passionate, kind and occasionally funny. And her voice is undiminished in its power. And I've never seen so many people finding spurious reasons to pop into the studio for a peek. Our conclusion? 'She's great. She's one of us. Just richer!' And with a very tight sweater.","The famous American singer doesn't duck controversial questions .

'I didn’t look anything like him, and my whole family always talked about it,' she said. 'He always picked up my sister instead of me and had more of a relationship with her through the years.

When she fell pregnant, she went back to Bohon because she already had a child to him, even though she knew David Cassidy was the father all along. After hearing the story, Shelley recalls: 'I was like, ""Mom, my god, why didn’t you tell me that?!"" And she was just like, ""Google him and see who he is. He’s kind of cocky and arrogant"".'

The Archbishop of Canterbury chose to urge George's parents and godparents to help the future monarch (pictured in the official portrait at Clarence House) to 'make sure he knows who Jesus is' The Archbishop was asked by Channel 4 News what his reaction would be if George, the third in line to the throne, wanted to leave the Church of England to become a Buddhist. He replied: ‘He’s perfectly entitled to be that, and we’ll cross that bridge if we ever get to it.

Prince Charles has already caused controversy within the Anglican Church by floating the idea that he could adapt his future title to embrace other religions. The prince, who has a particular fascination with Islam, believes that by calling himself Defender of Faiths he will unite the different strands of society at his Coronation. Earlier this year the Mail told how Prince William is not a regular churchgoer. Although the 31-year-old future king was confirmed into the Anglican faith in 1997, he is understood to attend services of worship just a ‘handful’ of times each year. Most of these are linked with official engagements or come on special occasions in the Christian calendar such as Christmas, or social occasions such as weddings and christenings. Sources say William and his wife ‘rarely, if ever’ go to church privately on a Sunday morning, or at any other time. A senior aide admitted: ‘I’m not aware that he goes every week.’ While William is not alone in failing to attend – barely 8 per cent of those who go to church regularly are men of a similar age – his stance is in strong contrast to other members of the Royal Family.

And for all his much-publicised interest in other faiths, Prince Charles is also a regular churchgoer. A spokesman for the Prince of Wales said he frequently attended Sunday service at a church close to Highgrove, his Gloucestershire residence, as well as in Scotland and Norfolk. Prince Charles said he may be known as Defender of Faiths after he becomes King . The monarchy has a unique relationship with the Anglican Church. The sovereign holds the title ‘Defender of Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church of England’. The monarch has been known by the title Defender of the Faith ever since it was bestowed on Henry VIII by the Pope in 1521 for his early support for Roman Catholicism.

She gradually changed her make-up, and even her clothing, to suit her softer, more natural 'do'. Now, she has scaled back her salon visits to once every two weeks and is using the money saved to buy a house. Mintel Group researchers wrote in a . report in June that express salons, such as blowout bars, are 'poised . to be a trend with ample opportunity for growth post-recession'. Grooming trend: Many time-strapped women are visiting express salons such as Drybar (pictured) for regular blow-out sessions, rather than wash their hair at home . Indeed, Drybar, which has the motto 'No cuts. No colour. Just blowouts', launched in February 2010 and today it has almost 30 locations across the U.S. Celebrity clients include Maria Shriver, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Cindy Crawford and actress Rose McGowan is an investor. And most who visit, like Ms Ballentine, say they would find it hard to go back to DIY blow-dries. 'It's OK when I do it, but this is much better,' the blonde writer said, back in the salon chair.","Sandra Ballentine from New York became aware that she had 'a problem' this year, when a friend asked why there was no shampoo in her apartment ."

A North Carolina county precinct Republican chair has resigned after a controversial interview that aired on 'The Daily Show' Wednesday night. A spokesman for the Buncombe County Republican Party confirmed that the resignation was directly related to the interview, in which Yelton said, among other things, 'lazy black people' want 'the government to give them everything.' Interviewer Aasif Mandvi interviewed Yelton about North Carolina's new voter ID law, which has been contested by the Justice Department. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Cringeworthy: Republican Don Yelton made comments to Daily Show correspondent Aasif Mandvi that prompted the latter to remark, 'You know we can hear you, right?' The state contends that the law, which requires voters to show certain specified forms of photo ID in order to be allowed to vote, is intended to limit minority voters. Yelton demurred, saying the law would prevent voter fraud, a crime committed, by his own admission, by possibly one or two people per year. 'The bottom line is, the law is not racist,' stated Yelton. 'Of course the law is not racist. And you're not racist,' suggests Mandvi, a statement which is greeted by a long pause from Yelton. 'Well,' he says. 'I have been called a bigot before.' Resigned: North Carolina county precinct GOP chair Yelton resigned on Thursday after the offensive interview aired . He goes on to tell Mandvi that in fact, one of his best friends is black. The segment then becomes a montage of cringe-worthy statements from Yelton, including: . 'When I was a young man, you didn't call a black a black, you called him a negro.' 'I had a picture one time of Obama sitting on a stump as a witch doctor, I posted that one Facebook... I was making fun of the white half of Obama, not the black half.' 'And now, you have a black person using the term, 'n***** this, n****** that,' and it's OK for them to do it.' This last comment prompts Mandvi to ask Yelton, 'You know we can hear you, right?' Yelton . goes on to explain that in fact, the voter ID law in North Carolina . would affect mostly Democrat voters, effectively admitting that the law . suppresses Democrat votes. 'If . it hurts the whites, so be it,' he says. 'If it hurts a bunch of lazy . blacks that want the government to give them everything, so be it.' Yelton's Facebook feed is equally unbecoming to a person in the public eye, proving he's never been one to mince his words - or even spell them correctly. Facebook faux pas: Yelton's Facebook feed is as uncensored as his Daily Show interview . Pushed out: The GOP says it does not support Yelton's views or comments . According to Business Insider, the Buncombe County GOP said in a statement that Yelton was 'recently reprimanded and removed from his position as a precinct chair.' He had been re-elected to the position at the 2013 convention by a margin of two votes - his own and his wife's. 'Mr Yelton's comments are offensive, uniformed, and unacceptable of any member within the Republican Party,' the statement read. 'In no way are his comments representative of the local or state Republican Party.'","North Carolina Buncombe County Republican chair Don Yelton has resigned after his 'Daily Show' interview .

Julie Sondra Decker from Tampa, Florida, revealed to MailOnline that she started describing herself as 'nonsexual' at the age of 15 and when she became aware of the term 'asexual', she changed it. The outgoing blonde says that she's had more offers of sex than she 'wants to count' over the years but, 'without the feelings that usually go with that sort of thing, it's kind of gross.' Happy being single: Julie Sondra Decker, from Tampa, Florida, revealed to MailOnline that she started describing herself as 'asexual' at the age of 15 and has never been attracted to men or women . The writer, who lives alone in a . two-bedroom apartment, states that she is not interested in dating or . pursuing a domestic partner. 'I have very close friendships but don't want a significant other. I don't want to find another asexual to be roommates with. 'As far as I can tell I'll be happy being single my whole life.' In a YouTube video, Miss Decker says that as a young teenager she kissed and cuddled both boys and girls. 'We are perceived as not being fully . human because sexual relationships are seen as . something alive people do' But she concluded: 'I never found anything that floated my boat.' She says that her family were convinced that she was a 'closet lesbian'. Before she went to college her mother . even took her to the doctors because she wasn't expressing 'normal' interest in the opposite sex. Given . the all-clear she carried on with her studies, graduating from the . University of Florida in 2000 with a degree in elementary education and . psychology. She said despite there being more awareness about asexuality today, it still remains largely misunderstood. She's had male friends try and 'fix' her by kissing her against her will and many insist that she will 'wake up one day'. An asexual is someone who does not experience sexual attraction. Unlike celibacy, which people choose, asexuality is an intrinsic part of who we are. Asexuality does not make our lives any worse or any better, we just face a different set of challenges than most sexual people. There is considerable diversity among the asexual community; each asexual person experiences things like relationships, attraction, and arousal somewhat differently. Asexuality is just beginning to be the subject of scientific research. SOURCE: AVEN . Since opening up about being asexual on the internet, via YouTube and her blog, Miss Decker says that she’s received death threats and been told by several commentators that she just needs a 'good raping.' 'When people hear that you're asexual, some take that as a challenge,' she told the Huffington Post. 'We are perceived as not being fully human because sexual attraction and sexual relationships are seen as something alive, healthy people do. 'They think that you really want sex but just don't know it yet. For people who perform corrective rape, they believe that they're just waking us up and that we'll thank them for it later.' Miss Decker says that asexuality presents itself in many forms. Some people, while lacking sexual attraction to any gender, may engage in purely romantic relationships. However, she defines herself as 'aromantic', meaning she does not have any romantic feelings either. Professor Bogaert, an associate professor at Brock University in Ontario, Canada, suggests in his book Understanding Asexuality, that around one per cent of the world's population - 70million people - are 'asexual. He believes that this demographic are 'under-studied' and that they can feel excluded from our 'very sexualised culture'. Experts say a certain number of asexuals may have always existed but are only now starting to 'come out' as society becomes more liberal. To her ‘haters’, Miss Decker concludes: 'I'm not damaged, lonely or in need of a conversion because I'm not interested [in sex].' She hopes to raise awareness about asexuality through her writing and public speaking. '[I want]  people who feel similarly to know they're not alone.'","Julie Sondra Decker from Florida, started describing herself as 'nonsexual' at the age of 15 .

It may seem some people are just naturally better at word games than others, but it's not all down to luck - there are some tricks you can use to steal points from your opponents. According to UK Scrabble expert and Countdown champion Barry Grossman, there are at least 100 different tips players can use to win, or at least boost their overall score. These include how to remember unusual words, why two-letter words, especially involving the 'X' tile, are so important and when it is acceptable to use proper nouns, which are usually banned. According to UK Scrabble expert Barry Grossman, there are at least 100 different ways players can win, or at least boost their score. These include how to remember unusual words, why two-letter words are so important and when it is acceptable to use proper nouns . Grossman suggests the more words in a person's vocabulary, the better, and knowing the more rare and unusual words can benefit the most in Scrabble. For example: . Epopoeia - an epic poem . Psst - a word used to capture someone's attention inconspicuously . Brrr - used to signify being cold . Barry - another word for a blunder . Euoi - cry of Bacchic frenzy . Qat - a variant spelling of the word khat, which is an evergreen shrub . Jiao - a monetary unit in China . In his book, 101 Ways to Win at Scrabble, Grossman explains that although proper nouns aren't generally accepted, there are some exceptions. For example, his own name Barry can be used as another word for a blunder or mistake. It is Australian slang. Equally 'danny' and plural 'dannies', is acceptable to describe a child's hand. Elsewhere in his book, Grossman explains that two-letter words are important because they can be used to get rid of tiles towards the end of the game, but they can also be used to connect words. He goes on to say the 'X' tile, worth eight points in the game, either preceded or succeeded by a vowel gives a high-scoring combination for a low number of tiles used. These include 'ax', 'ex', 'xi' and 'xu'. Many dictionaries now have a page detailing all the accepted two-letter words, described as the 'glue' of Scrabble including jo, es and ta. Equally, there are a host of three-letter words, such as iff, roc, and ulu that can be useful. Grossman's book adds that there are a handful of four-letter words that don't contain any vowels that are also accepted in Scrabble. These include psst, pfft, brrr and grrl - although Grossman points out that only these spellings are accepted, and extra 'F's, 'R's and 'S' can't be added. Another way to steal points from the words already placed on the board by opponents, as listed in Grossman's book, is to take advantage of prefixes and suffixes. These included 'ed', 'ing' and adding the letter S to the end of words, yet Grossman adds the suffix 'ish' is rare and equally effective, especially on words such as pixyish. Elsewhere in his book, Grossman explains two-letter words are important because they can be used to get rid of tiles towards the end of the game, and to connect other words. Described as the 'glue' of Scrabble, these include jo, es and ta. Equally, three-letter words, such as iff, roc, and ulu can be useful . The letter 'S' and the blank tile should be used sparingly, according to Grossman's book. An S, for example, should only be used when adding it increases the overall score by around five points, otherwise it's a 'waste'. Another key thing to remember is that the letter 'Q' doesn't always need to be followed by a 'U'. In the two-letter list the word QI is 'a variant of chi'. While Qat (a variant spelling of the word khat; an evergreen shrub), Qaid (a Muslim chief) and sheqalim (the plural of sheqel, the currency of Israel) are examples of longer words where this technique can be used. Grossman suggests the more words in a . person's vocabulary, the better they are at Scrabble, and knowing the more rare and unusual . words can benefit the most. He doesn't insist players learn the dictionary, but it is worthwhile familiarising themselves with some of these unusual words, or words that use unusual letter combinations including epopoeia, an epic poem, and tchick, a clicking sound. For words that are difficult to spell, Grossman suggests creating a mnemonic to help players remember them, such as 'John Is Always Out' for the word jiao, a monetary unit in China. Ultimately, Grossman claims that sometimes tiles need to be swapped, which means that player misses a go, but they may get a better selection of letters and a higher score as a result. The National Scrabble Championship final takes place on Sunday.","Wordplay expert Barry Grossman's book titled 101 Ways to Win at Scrabble .

A court ruling in Italy has put an end to a 39-year legal dispute between Oscar-winning film star Sophia Loren and Italian tax authorities. The 79-year-old Loren, who lives in . Switzerland, was quoted as saying she was happy with a ruling by the . supreme court that said her 1974 tax return was indeed covered by a 1982 . tax amnesty. 'A saga that . has lasted nearly 40 years is finally over,' Loren was quoted by the La . Stampa daily as saying, adding: 'I always look to the future and I . leave bad experiences like this one behind me.' A court ruling in Italy has put an end to a 39-year legal dispute between Oscar-winning film star Sophia Loren and Italian tax authorities.  Loren was spotted in Venice, Italy on Monday . Her lawyer, Giovanni Desideri, said: 'The supreme court has wrapped up a Kafkaesque case.' Loren's tax experts, applying one of Italy's not-infrequent tax amnesties, calculated that she owed tax on 60 percent of her income that year, but tax officials insisted she should have paid tax on 70 percent of her taxable income. Now the court has decided that the Academy Award winner was right. Loren, who was born Sofia . Scicolone and started out in film in 1950, famously spent 17 days in . prison in 1982 in a separate tax dispute -- an incident that drew crowds . to the jail near Naples. Her latest leading role: Sophia was filming La Voce Umana, which is being directed by her son Edoardo Ponti, in her native Naples over the summer . The . actress shot to fame internationally when she acted alongside Cary . Grant in Houseboat (1958) and she won an Oscar for her heart-rending . masterpiece Two Women (1961) about a mother raped while protecting her . daughter in war-torn Italy. She received a lifetime achievement Oscar in 1991. Meanwhile after more than six decades in the industry and 10 years after her last big screen leading role, Sophia is making her return to the spotlight in her youngest son's new feature film. The screen icon will be starring in Edoardo Ponti's La Voce Umana (The Human Voice), which she was seen filming in her native Naples over the summer. The film is based on a 1930 play by iconic French playwright Jean Cocteau, which comprises a single monologue by a woman on the phone to her lover, who is about to marry another woman. The actress' last acting role was three years ago when she played the part of her own mother in autobiographical Italian television La mia casa e’ piena di specchi (My House if Full of Mirrors). Her last starring big screen part was back in 2004 when she starred in Peperoni ripieni e pesci in faccia (Too Much Romance … It’s Time For Stuffed Peppers), directed by Lina Wertmueller.

JonBenet Ramsey's parents were indicted with child abuse charges resulting in her death - but the district attorney refused to prosecute them, newly-unsealed grand jury documents revealed today. In the 1999 indictment, John and Patsy Ramsey were not directly accused of murdering their six-year-old daughter, who was found strangled and beaten in 1996, but were accused of putting her in a situation that ultimately led her to her death. The couple were never charged because former District Attorney Alex Hunter refused to sign the document and prosecute them, saying there was insufficient evidence. The grand jury documents released in Boulder, Colorado on Friday were compiled long . before DNA evidence led the DA to . publicly exonerate the Ramseys in 2008. Scroll down for video . Loss: Six-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was killed in 1996, was abused by her parents until she died, a grand jury concluded in 1999. But despite their indictment, her parents were not prosecuted over her death . 'The . DNA was not available to the grand jury in 1999,' Lin Wood, the . Ramseys' attorney, told the Denver Post on Friday. 'What we have here is a release of a sliver of the . evidence that the grand jury looked at and reviewed. It's just based on . incomplete evidence.' A . reporter for The Camera and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the . Press had filed a lawsuit to seek the records and the documents were . released on Friday after a ruling by a Colorado judge. In . the four-page document, one of the counts read that they 'did . unlawfully, knowingly, recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be . unreasonably placed in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the . child's life or health, which resulted in the death of JonBenét . Ramsey.' Even though the . grand jury voted to go ahead with the charges in 1999, the DA had . declined to proceed over fears he could not prove guilt without a . reasonable doubt, the Daily Camera reported. The body of JonBenet, a child beauty queen, was found bludgeoned . and strangled in her family's home in Boulder on December 26, 1996, hours after she was reported missing. Indicted: John and Patsy Ramsey, who are pictured in 2004, were accused of putting their daughter in a situation that ultimately led to her death. Mrs Ramsey died from ovarian cancer in 2006 . The parents of JonBenet Ramsey were both indicted with child abuse resulting in death and acting as an accessory to a crime by the grand jury in 1999. On the child abuse charge, the grand jury wrote that John and Patsy Ramsey 'did unlawfully, knowingly, recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the child's life or health, which resulted in the death of JonBenet Ramsey.' On a second count of accessory to a crime, the grand jury wrote that each parent 'did render assistance to a person' with the intent to prevent their arrest or prosecution 'knowing they had committed and was suspected of the crime of murder in the first degree and child abuse resulting in death' Her parents had called police to report her kidnapping and said they found a note demanding a ransom of $118,000 for her safe return. After her death, her parents were . placed under an 'umbrella of suspicion', an investigator said, but in . 2008, the DA said that evidence suggested . the killer was a stranger, not a family member. Two years earlier, Mrs Ramsey had died after a long battle with ovarian cancer. The statute of limitations for the abuse charges expired in 2002. The case has never been solved. If Ramsey had not been killed, she would now be 23. The documents' release comes just days after . JonBenet's father said he didn't want secret grand jury indictments from . his daughter's case released to the public. John . Ramsey's attorneys had sent a letter to the Boulder County District . Attorney saying the release of such records without releasing the entire . grand jury record would only defame the parents. 'Public release of the allegations of . an un-prosecuted indictment only serves to further defame (John Ramsey) and his late wife Patricia,' the letter said, according to the Daily Camera. Help us find the killer: John Ramsey looks on during a 1997 television appearance as wife Patsy touts a reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer of JonBenet . 'Mr. Ramsey will have no access to whatever evidence the prosecutors . presented to the grand jury and will have no ability to disprove those . allegations in a court of law. 'Nor will the public have any ability . to evaluate the propriety of the indictment unless the entire grand jury . record is unsealed and opened to public view.' But the judge ordered the current DA to . provide a reason why the documents should be kept secret. He provided them to a judge on Tuesday to determine if they were . suitable to be released. Officials told Mr Ramsey that they would only release the secret indictments in such a way that would not hinder potential future prosecution under charges where the statute of limitations has not yet expired. The judge also said that the court would not be permitted to release all of the information in the case. 'The court is sympathetic to the position of Mr. Ramsey,; Judge Robert Lowenbach said on Wednesday, but a release of the entire record ""would set a precedent that would impede other Grand Juries in performing their functions under statute and rule'.

The Port Authority Bus Terminal – one block from Times Square – was evacuated New Year’s Eve after multiple people were slashed only hours before midnight. The busy transit hub plunged into chaos Tuesday night just before 9pm when three people began fighting on the terminal's main concourse near the ticket counters - two males, 47 and 61-years-old, were slashed. Police were allowing people back into the terminal as of 11pm. An FDNY spokesperson told MailOnline that two people were transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. A Port Authority spokesperson said one person was transported to a hospital. Mass evacuation: The Port Authority Bus Terminal is only one block from Times Square . Ghost town: Policemen stand guard Tuesday night inside a cordoned area at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York . The Port Authority spokesperson said the wounds were non-life-threating slash marks - 'they were not puncture wounds.' Port Authority Police believe the attack was carried out with a razor or a box cutter and not a knife. 'In port authority and some random guy just started stabbing people,' Twitter user Chase wrote. 'A bunch of people are currently hiding in the girls bathroom. Oh god.' Witness Natalie Morales told the New York Daily News her uncle became involved in an altercation and came out of the bathroom with blood coming out of his face and neck. Another witness claimed to the paper he tried to break up the fight but was unsuccessful. A source told MailOnline the three suspects likely knew each other, but was not able to confirm a New York Post report the suspects were homeless. The suspect is described as a Hispanic male wearing army fatigues, he escaped and is still at large, the Port Authority spokesperson noted. One block away: Security is tight ahead of the new Year's Eve ball drop one block away in Times Square . No where to hide: With officers across city, state and federal agencies patrolling the area, the assailant is not likely to get far . Packed: Over one million people fill Times Square each New Year's Eve . The evacuation was mostly calm and orderly, a witness told MailOnline. An announcement came over the bus terminal’s public address system and people filed out as instructed. ‘[It was] seemingly quick and well orchestrated, led by posted troops,’ said Michael Gasiorek. ‘[The] only concern was crowd buildup outside.’ That calmness evaporated once outside, as officers were surprised by the masses of people pouring out of the bus terminal, Mr Gasiorek explained. 'We just evacuated, is there a plan?' He said he asked police. 'Plan? Get away from the building,' the officer responded. It is not clear how long the evacuation order lasted, but it had been lifted as of 11pm, according to a Post Authority spokesperson. The Port Authority Bus Terminal is on 42nd Street at Eighth Avenue, one block from Times Square and across the street from police checkpoints regulating the flow of revelers into and out of the ball drop zone. Security in and around Times Square is tight for New Year's Eve, with multiple agencies from the city, state and federal level keeping watch over the more than one million people packed into the small area. More than 225,000 people course in and out of the bus station every day.

The solicitor who outed JK Rowling as the author of a crime novel written under a pen name has been fined £1,000. Chris Gossage, a partner at London firm Russells, was also rebuked by the Solicitors Regulation Authority for breaking confidentiality rules. In July, Miss Rowling brought a court case against Gossage and his friend Judith Callegari, who revealed on Twitter that Miss Rowling had written The Cuckoo’s Calling as Robert Galbraith. Russells made a payment to charity after the court heard Rowling had been ‘dismayed and distressed’ by the ‘betrayal of trust’. The SRA published the decision on their website. It said: 'The SRA decided to issue Mr Christopher Gossage with a written rebuke and ordered him to pay a financial penalty of £1000.' They stated that 'by disclosing confidential information about a client to a third party Mr Gossage has breached Principles 4 and 6 of the SRA Principles 2011 and failed to achieve outcome 4.1 of the SRA Code of Conduct 2011.' The SRA website explains: 'Where we impose a sanction against a firm or individual, we are satisfied that they have failed to comply with our Principles. 'Where we are satisfied that a firm or individual has failed to comply with the SRA Principles, we may give a written rebuke.' The maximum fine is £2,000. Principle 4 of the SRA rules is to 'act in the best interests of each client' while Principle 6 states that members should 'behave in a way that maintains the trust the public places in you and in the provision of legal services.' The Cuckoo’s Calling had sold just 1,500 copies, and attracted mixed reviews before Rowling’s authorship was revealed by The Sunday Times on July 14. The newspaper said it used a linguistics expert among others to analyse the debut novel.

Rowling, who said she had wanted to release the book 'without hype or expectation,' accepted the donation from the firm to The Soldiers’ Charity. Yesterday Russells was closed, and unable to comment.

The 80-year-old is the son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, an art dealer of part-Jewish descent who was ordered by Hitler to buy up so-called 'degenerate art' and sell it to raise funds for the Nazis.

Britain - knowing senior Nazis would pay excessive amounts for their new . purchase. Last month, German authorities revealed that the Gurlitt hoard was valued at £1billion. That collection had been held for decades by Cornelius Gurlitt . The . legal status of the hoard is unclear. Gurlitt has demanded his art back . and lawyers working on reclaiming property for heirs to Jewish . collectors say he may get to keep at least some. The Nazis plundered hundreds of thousands of artworks from museums and individuals across Europe. An unknown number of works is still missing and museums around the world have conducted investigations into the origins of their exhibits. The Bundestag's art collection comprises around 4,000 works and Bild said investigations had found some 108 pieces so far of unknown provenance. About four years ago, it returned a portrait of former German chancellor Otto von Bismarck in a hat by Franz von Lenbach to its original owners after it was found to have been stolen by the Nazis. The Central Council of Jews in Germany called for a list of the Bundestag's art works to be published. 'If the Bundestag is keeping lists of its collection secret, hindering the press in its investigations, protecting the perpetrators of Ayranisation and not informing the heirs, I would wish those responsible to show more sensibility and tact,' Council President Dieter Graumann told Bild. Chagall, Dix, Picasso: The Gurlitt hoard . By ALLAN HALL, JILL REILLY, TOM KELLY . Some were believed to have been lost forever in the chaos and carnage of the Second World War. Others were not even known about before. They are among the 1,400 paintings found in the flat of recluse Cornelius Gurlitt. Remarkable: A painting from Henry Matisse called Sitzende Frau (Sitting Woman) - one of the previously unknown works found at Gurlitt's flat - is projected on a screen during a news conference in Augsburg. It is worth an estimated £50-£60million . Treasure trove: An allegorical scene painting by Marc Chagall worth an estimated £15million had never been seen by the art world before emerging from Gurlitt's collection . The . extraordinary cache, which includes unknown works by Marc Chagall, Otto . Dix, Max Liebermann and Henri Matisse, was found when tax officials . raided 80-year-old Gurlitt’s Munich apartment. But the authorities kept secret their discovery for 20 months, and are refusing to publish details of the works. Ruediger . Mahlo, of the pressure group Conference on Jewish Material Claims . against Germany, accused the authorities of ‘what amounts morally to the . concealing of stolen goods’. Collector: Hildebrandt Gurlitt amassed more than 1,500 masterpieces and ordered them to be destroyed in 1945 . For some families missing art is the last personal effects of relatives murdered in the Holocaust. Anne Webber, of the Commission for Looted Art in Europe, said the response of the German authorities was ‘troubling’. She . said: ‘A list of these paintings must be published. There are hundreds . of families around the world urgently wanting to know if any of the . works belong to them.’ Reinhard . Nemetz, head of the prosecutors’ office in Augsburg, said the works, . which also included pieces by Canaletto, Courbet, Picasso and . Toulouse-Lautrec, had been seized in March last year. Most were in good condition. Asked . why the discovery had been kept secret for so long, he said: ‘It is for . us counterproductive to go public with such a case. The investigations . are costly, complex and lengthy.’ The . collection also contained works by Picasso, Auguste Renoir, Henri de . Toulouse-Lautrec, Max Beckmann, Max Liebermann, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner . and Carl Spitzweg, he added. Gurlitt vanished after the paintings . were confiscated, with police suspecting that he has access to almost . unlimited funds. As well as selling The Lion Tamer, he sold off many of the paintings  - works that wouldn't attract headlines - before the . intervention of German customs officials. Gurlitt was a man of mystery in many aspects of his life. The . son of art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt, he did not have an official bank . account, pension or insurance - he simply lived off the extensive . collection, selling them when his money dipped. He never held down a job and was not registered . with the authorities - mandatory in Germany - and was not known to the tax authorities or social . services. The paintings thought to have been destroyed in the war were found hidden behind tins of rotting food in a shabby flat. They . had been taken from their owners, many of them Jewish, by the Nazis, . who regarded the Impressionist, Cubist and Modernist pieces as . ‘degenerate’. The story of . their recovery begins one evening in September 2010 aboard a German . Intercity Express train from Zurich in Switzerland to Munich. Customs . officials were carrying out a routine check on passengers – many . wealthy Germans deposit money illegally in Switzerland to evade high tax . rates at home – and asked for the papers of a white-haired man. He . proffered an Austrian passport in the name of Rolf Nikolaus Cornelius . Gurlitt, born December 28, 1933, in Hamburg - currently residing in . Salzburg. ‘He appeared nervous,’ said customs officials. He said he had travelled to Switzerland for ‘business’ at the Galerie Kornfeld in Bern. He . then he pulled out an envelope with 9,000 euros in 500 euro notes . inside – 1,000 euros under the legal limit which must declared to . officials when crossing borders in Europe. Gurlitt was allowed to go on his way, but the officials remained suspicious. Extensive . checks soon disclosed that he did not live in Salzburg but in . Schwabing, and he was not registered with the authorities. ‘He was a man who didn’t exist,’ one official told Germany’s Focus magazine, which broke the story. Control: Hitler only liked classical art and held exhibitions of modern 'dissident' pieces to show German people what not to like. Many of those paintings that appeared in those shows have been found in Gurlitt's collection . Investigators applied for a warrant to search behind the barred windows of his £600-a-month rented flat, eventually entering it in spring 2011. There they discovered a mountain of tinned and bottled food, long past its sell-by date. Behind the decomposing food were the missing artworks. Hildebrandt Gurlitt was an art dealer who in the run-up to the Second World War had been in charge of gathering up the so-called degenerate art for the Nazis. Hildebrandt had bought for a pittance many of the paintings he seized, and they had passed to his son on his death. Cornelius then quietly sold a few, one at a time, to give him money to live on. Investigators are working to reunite them with the families of their rightful owners. One owner is already known. A portrait of a woman by the French master Matisse belonged to the Jewish connoisseur Paul Rosenberg. Rosenberg had to abandon his collection as he fled Paris when France fell to the Nazis in 1940. His granddaughter Anne Sinclair, wife of disgraced former IMF bank chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, has been fighting for decades for the return of her grandfather’s pictures, but is said to have not known of the existence of this painting.","One of the two pieces under scrutiny is oil .

Major talks aimed at resolving some of the most divisive issues hindering peace in Northern Ireland have broken down. David Cameron said it was ‘disappointing’ that Ulster’s main political parties could not end bitter rows over parades, flags and the legacy of the Troubles. But the Prime Minister insisted it was vital they ‘keep going’ to achieve a crucial breakthrough. Stalemate: David Cameron (left) said it was 'disappointing' Ulster's main political parties could not resolve issues hindering peace in Northern Ireland. Right, ex-US diplomat Dr Richard Haass, who chaired the talks . He said: ‘There is a shared commitment to making progress on these very difficult issues that continue to be a focus for tension and division.’ Former US diplomat Dr Richard Haass, who chaired the talks, emerged from a marathon 17 hours of negotiations to announce he had not secured consensus before his end-of-year deadline. He said: ‘All the parties support significant parts of the agreement. At the same time, all have some concerns.’ He said a working group made up of representatives of the five parties in Stormont's power-sharing executive would now be set up to try and find another way to build on 'significant progress' that had been achieved. Divisive: Loyalist protesters holding a flag walk past a burning car in the Centre of Belfast in August after trouble flared during a republican anti-internment parade . Negotiators from Sinn Fein, the . largest nationalist party in the Executive, said they were prepared to . recommend the proposals to its ruling executive, but unionists would not . sign up to the document by tonight. 'Yes . it would have been nice to come out here tonight and say we have got . all five parties completely signed on to the text, we are not there,' Dr . Haass said. Dr Haass, who was commissioned by . Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist First Minister, and Martin . McGuinness, the Sinn Fein Deputy First Minister, to chair the six-month . process, said he believed there was a prospect that all the parties . would either endorse all, or significant parts of his document in the . future. The DUP and Ulster . Unionists said they would consult within their parties before making a . final judgment on the proposals but both indicated they had major . difficulties with elements of the text. The . Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) said it would also be . conducting a consultation, but party leader Alasdair McDonnell said he . would be recommending a general endorsement of the proposals. Dr . Haass urged Mr Robinson and Mr McGuinness to make the details of the . final document public so people could make up their own minds. He denied the process had been a failure. Message: Mr Adams took to Twitter to say Sinn Fein were ready to accept a deal but the DUP and Ulster Unionists would not today . 'Success should not be measured by . what we report to you tonight or what the party leaders report tonight - . I would ask you to judge the success in six months, in a year, 18 . months, in two years, that would give a much more realistic definition . or yardstick of what constitutes success,' he said. 'What I believe what we have done is laid down solid enough foundations stones.' Dr Haass and talks vice-chairman Dr Meghan O'Sullivan, a U.S. foreign affairs expert, said their role in any future political process would be limited, but both insisted they were not washing their hands of the process. Naomi Long, the Alliance party deputy leader, who along with colleagues was mandated to make a final call on behalf of the party, said she was willing to endorse proposals on the past, but not on flags and parades. Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein's president, signalled his party's willingness to strike a full deal. He said the proposals presented by Dr Haass represented a 'compromise position' and provided the basis for agreement. 'They aren't perfect, we have had to stretch ourselves to embrace them,' he said. Mr Adams insisted talks could not continue forever and at some point parties had to 'call it'. 'The paper produced by Dr Haass does in the view of our negotiating team provide the basis for agreement,' he said. He said if there was no progress from this point he would be seeking an urgent meeting with the British and Irish governments to call for the production of a road map towards resolution. DUP negotiator Jeffrey Donaldson said progress had been made but said a number of difficulties remained. Leadership: Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein (left), with the party President Gerry Adams (right), arrive at the talks . 'We do not have an agreement this . evening but we are committed to continuing this work beyond now in . dialogue with others to try and resolve the outstandiing issues that . need to be addressed,' he said. 'We . owe that to the people of Northern Ireland, especially to the innocent . victims of terrorism who have suffered so much over the decades.' The Haass process was set up in July to deal with what have become three of the primary obstacles to meaningful reconciliation in Northern Ireland. Tensions over contentious parades regularly erupt into street violence while disputes over the flying of flags - both on public buildings and in loyalist and republican neighbourhoods - continue to be a source of community conflict. Reaction: Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said this morning the terms 'aren't perfect, we have had to stretch ourselves to embrace them' But arguably the most complex issue has been how Northern Ireland deals with the legacy of a 30-year-conflict where opposing sides retain competing narratives of what happened and victims still demand both truth and justice regarding thousands of unsolved murders. Dr Haass had initially hoped to strike a comprehensive settlement dealing with all three elements in full, but it became clear from the outset of the intensive negotiation phase earlier this month that was going to be highly unlikely. The last day of negotiations began around 10am yesterday and effectively carried straight through to around 5am this morning. There was little or no progress made on flags with a proposal to set up a commission to examine the issues over a longer term. It is understood the document also proposes the replacement of the Government-appointed Parades Commission with another set of structures to adjudicate on contentious marches. Hopeful: Richard Haass and o-chair Meghan O'Sullivan (left) had hoped that the deal would have been done by today . The text also envisaged a new mechanism to oversee dealing with the legacy of the past - with a truth recovery body that would potentially offer limited immunity from prosecution to those who co-operate. Unionists have indicated concerns with some of the language used and claimed too much focus has been placed on killings perpetrated by state forces. Mike Nesbitt, the UUP leader, said he had an opinion on the document but would not make it public until his party had the chance to examine the proposals. 'We will have an honest debate and hopefully form a final opinion at the end of that debate,' he said. Mr McDonnell said 'bigger and better solutions' were needed on some aspects, but said he would be recommending that his party give a general endorsement to what had been proposed. While Mrs Long criticised proposals on parades and flags, she said great work had been done in the past. 'We have seen a huge sea change in the level of political agreement which has exceeded public expectation, particularly in delivering for the victims and the reconciliation process,' said the East Belfast MP. Through the night: Figures like Sean Murray . (left) and Gerry Kelly (right) from the Sinn Fein negotiation team . inside the Stormont hotel in Belfast during the Haass talks into the . early hours . Having been given an end-of-year deadline to report, Dr Haass had aimed to strike a deal before Christmas but had to return to the US on Christmas Eve empty-handed after a marathon session of all-night negotiations last week. Cutting short his seasonal break, he returned to the region on Saturday in a last-ditch bid to secure agreement. Dr Haass is the president of US think tank the Council on Foreign Relations, based in New York, and was US president George W Bush's special envoy to Northern Ireland from 2001 to 2003. Theresa Villiers, Northern Ireland Secretary, said she was disappointed, but the failure to reach a comprehensive agreement should not be seen as the end of the road in seeking to find a way forward on difficult and divisive issues. She said: 'I welcome the suggestion by Dr Haass that the parties should now lose no time in getting together to see how they can most constructively take things forward. I would encourage them to maintain the momentum that their efforts, working with the Haass team, has created. For our part, the UK Government will look at how we can best facilitate this.' Eamon Gilmore, the Republic's Deputy Prime Minister, said he too was disappointed. But he insisted: 'This is not a step back but rather a step not yet taken. That step forward will have to be taken because it is right and necessary and because people across society are demanding it.'","Talks between Ulster's main parties ended without success at 5am .

Council plans to change the name of Welsh village Varteg to Farteg have been dropped due to 'overwhelming' public opposition. Welsh language campaigners had argued the name change was necessary because there is no 'v' in ancient Welsh. However the 1,000 villagers protested, arguing that the name Farteg would make them the butt of schoolboy jokes, as people unfamiliar with the nuances of Welsh pronunciation would say it as 'Fart Egg'. Due to 'overwhelming' opposition, plans to rename Welsh village Varteg as Farteg have been dropped . Welsh language campaigners argued that Farteg would be more accurate as there was no 'v' in ancient Welsh . After receiving a letter with 150 signatures opposing the plans, local councillor Richard Clark agreed that the new name could bring the town and villagers into 'disrepute'. He added: 'Whilst we in Wales understand the pronunciation, outsiders will say it Fart-egg.' The change was asked for because most Welsh street signs display place names in both English and Welsh. At the time Sioned Jones, 42, who lives in the village near Pontypool, South Wales, said: 'Just imagine how embarrassing it will be to have the word ""fart"" in your village's name - never mind being followed by ""egg"". The 1,000 residents opposed because they were worried that outsiders would pronounce it 'Fart Egg' Local councillor Giles Davies has hailed the decision as a 'victory for common sense' 'I'd be humiliated every time I told someone my address. Everyone will be laughing at us and coming to get photographed next to the street signs. 'I just think it's ridiculous - these Welsh language campaigners are a lot of gasbags, they’re full of hot air.' Fellow villager Ray Leyshon, 62, said: 'Can you imagine the bus going past and some naughty schoolboy shouting: ""You are going to Fart Egg"". It is just a bad joke.' Following the decision to keep the name Varteg, councillor Giles Davies hailed a victory for 'common sense.' Speaking to the BBC, he added: 'It's one thing for an outsider to say they have got to do it, it's the law, but if you live in the village and you don't want this change it's a different story.' While the villagers of Varteg may have narrowly escaped the humiliation of being called 'Fart Egg' by passersby, spare a thought for the residents of these unfortunately named places. Sitting between Dorchester and Poole, the hamlet of Shitterton has been voted as officially the most embarrasing place to live by ancestry website www.findmypast.co.uk. The tiny hamlet gets its unfortunate name from a literal translation from French, which meant it sat astride a sewer. It is probably best not to speculate as to how Slack Bottom, near Burnley got its name, though it could just be an unfortunate counterpart to the nearby Slack Top. Schoolboy taunts could also be levelled at places such as Upperthong, in West Yorkshire, Bushy Gap, in Northumberland, and Fannyfield in the Scottish highlands. The town of Sandy Balls misses out on the dubious accolade of most appropriate place name, because it is sadly at the wrong end of the New Forest, and therefore not next to the beach.","Due to 'overwhelming' opposition name will not be changed .

Five people were injured and two of them seriously when a ride malfunctioned Thursday night at the North Carolina State Fair in Raleigh. Riders were getting off the Vortex around 9pm when it unexpectedly started up again injuring five people ranging in age from 14 to 39. An EMS source told WNCN that all five were initially unconscious but that three regained consciousness. All of the victims were taken to WakeMed. Th same EMS source said that one of the injured is suffering from serious head injuries while the another is suffering injuries similar to a concussion. Tragedy at the fairgrounds: Five people were injured - and two seriously - when a ride at the North Carolina State Fair unexpectedly started up again just as passengers were exiting . 'The ride had stopped and they were fixing to offload when the ride started off again, but that is preliminary,' Wake County Sheriff Donnie Harrison said in a briefing Thursday night. 'It is going to take quite a while to talk to all these people.' The sheriff's office is interviewing 35 to 40 people to figure out exactly what went wrong on the ride, and is soliciting any video of the accident. 'It could be operator error. We don't know,' Harrison said. 'We aren't going to speculate.' Under investigation: All five people were taken to WakeMed to be treated for their injuries. The incident is still under investigation by the Wake County Sheriff's Office . Following North Carolina Department of Labor regulations, the ride is tested three times a day to insure safety. This is the first time the Vortex ride is at the State Fair. The injuries today happen 11 years to the day that a man was killed from a similar ride at the North Carolina state fair. Richard Gephart was near the ride when it malfunctioned and witnessed the accident. 'It sounded like a bunch of stuff hitting metal, and that was it,' he told WNCN. After that, Mr Gephart said it was silence, he didn't even hear screams but then emergency crews started responding. Another witness saw two people lying face down and the ride operator fall to his knees and start crying. Dangerous fun: The injuries today happened on the 11 year anniversary of a man being killed at the State Fair from another ride . The incident is still under investigation. Brian Lind with the State Fair expressed his sympathy for the injured and their families. 'This has shaken all of us, 'Mr Long said. 'We definitely have these folks in our thoughts and prayers.' Despite the accident, the State Fair will still be open tomorrow, officials said.","Passengers were exiting the Vortex ride around 9pm when it unexpectedly started up again .

These beautiful yet terrifying pictures capture the exact moment that a bullet leaves a gun barrel travelling at more than 1,200ft per second. Part scientific research and part art the pictures were captured by ballistic photographer Herra Kuulapaa using several different cameras to create a high-resolution stereoscopic 3D effect. His project began seven years ago using a group of amateur shooters in his native country of Finland, but has since expanded to help gun manufacturers figure out exactly what happens as their weapons are fired. High powered: Here a man fires .44 Magnum, made famous by Clint Eastwood as 'the most powerful handgun in the world', with a shortened barrel for added flame . Deadly: This is the modern-day most powerful handgun, the Smith & Wesson .500, in action . Before: The shooter takes aim with a S&W .500 before pulling the trigger . After: Flames engulf the shooter's hands as he pulls the trigger, with the bullet bending in the air (far right) Mr Kuulapaa said: 'The sports shooting community all over the world was hungry for information about what happens during the brief split millisecond moment when bullet actually leaves the barrel. 'To create the images we detect an ignition of powder and we then calculate when the bullet is in right place and set up a delay to trigger that takes the photo, there is a lot of sweat and tries before the small details are fine-tuned. 'Our latest method is taking stereoscopic 3D ballistics images, where you can really see the three dimensional structure of the blast and how the gas is flowing.' Beautiful and deadly: This photo series shows the split seconds before and after a Colt rifle is fired . Kuuapaa attaches a camera to the firing mechanism on the gun and then uses a delay to make sure the picture is taken when the bullet is in precisely the right place . Bang: In this image a pressure bubble can be seen expanding from the end of the rifle as the gunpowder burns orange and the bullet flies away to the left along with tiny lead fragments . Beautiful: As well as providing information to gun makers, the images are also works of art in their own right and can be bought to hang on walls . In the images Kuulapaa captures the alarming moment after the gun's trigger is pulled showing the exploding gunpowder, flames, and bullet frozen in mid-air. Worryingly a large number of the pictures show flaming gunpowder heading straight back towards the shooter, while other weapons eject their ammunition so fast not all the power has time to burn and appears as a fine spray in front of the bullet. Kuulapaa often accidentally damages his equipment and lenses thanks to the burning shrapnel and the fact that the camera is so close to the gun. Stereoscopic: Several cameras taking shots from different angles are used to create these highly detailed images in which the bullet appears to be travelling towards you . Huge: The Desert Eagle uses a huge round that is roughly the same width as the fingers of the man firing it . Small but deadly: By comparison this Benelli pistol fires a much smaller bullet but is much more accurate . Impressive: This formidable looking gun is actually a Glock pistol, just with a huge modification kit strapped to it . On other occasions, while firing particularly powerful weapons, the camera is jogged or dislodged by the force of the blast, meaning a lot of patience is needed to capture the perfect shot. Other factors such a bullet wobble - where the ammunition doesn't travel straight - and muzzle flash - the amount of flames you get coming out of the barrel - are useful for companies to examine in order to improve their products. None of this is visible with the naked eye as it all happens in just a fraction of a hundredth of second, far too fast to be detected without profession equipment. Stereoscopic: If you slowly cross and then uncross your eyes, focusing on the middle of your vision, these images are designed to appear in 3D . Under pressure: The cloud of smoke around the end of the barrel reveals how pressure escapes from inside . Slow motion: This image shows a pressure 'shell' forming around the bullet as it tears out of the barrel . Bullets from an AR-15 rifle can travel at 2,800ft per second, so the time between these two images is miniscule .","Images captured by Finnish photographer Herra Kuulapaa .

Israel released more than two dozen Palestinian prisoners convicted in deadly attacks against Israelis as part of a package to restart Mideast peace talks. After leaving on buses from Israeli jails overnight, the prisoners received hero's welcomes on their return to the West Bank and Gaza with officials and jubilant relatives lining up to greet them. At his headquarters in Ramallah, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas waited to meet the men in the middle of the night. Scroll down for video . Freed: Palestinians wave their national flag as they await the release of Palestinian prisoners to Jerusalem . Prisoner: Palestinian wife of Osama Al-Selawai holds a picture of him at their home in the West Bank city of Jenin. Al-Selawai is one of 26 long-serving Palestinian prisoners released this week under the deal . Welcome: Rami Barbakh, a released Palestinian prisoner (centre) arrives at a checkpoint at the entrance of the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun after he was set free early this morning in the US-brokered deal . He pledged to continue pressing for the release of long-serving and ill prisoners. 'We will not sign a final peace deal with Israel before all the prisoners are released,' he said. In Israel, though, the release was accompanied by anger and frustration with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing a public uproar over the move. With Netanyahu expected to accompany the releases with plans to build hundreds of new homes in Jewish settlements, the criticism came from some unlikely quarters. Supporters of peace talks said the expected construction would destroy any goodwill created by the prisoner release, while hard-line allies criticised Netanyahu for linking the Jewish settlement cause with the release of prisoners convicted in connection with killings, mostly of Israelis. 'Leadership is judged by the ability to implement decisions, difficult as they may be,' Netanyahu told members of his Likud Party on Monday. 'We were not elected to make easy decisions.' Under a formula drawn up by US Secretary of State John Kerry, Israel agreed last summer to release a total of 104 long-serving Palestinian prisoners in order to restart peace talks with the Palestinians. In exchange, the Palestinians dropped their demand for Israel to halt construction of homes in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, areas captured by Israel in 1967 that they claim for their future state. The Palestinians say they have received vague assurances that Israel would show restraint while the talks continue until an April target date for an agreement. Reunion: Rami Barbakh is reunited with his mother. Israel released more than two dozen Palestinian prisoners convicted in deadly attacks against Israelis as part of a package to restart peace talks in the area . Released: Palestinian Jamal Abu Jamal arrives in the Arab East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal Mukaber . West Bank:  Freed Palestinian prisoners celebrate as they arrive to the Mukata Presidential Compound . The latest prisoner release is the third of four planned stages. The release was carried out by Israel overnight to avoid the larger spectacle of having to witness the celebrations over the killers' freedom. All 26 of the men have been convicted in deadly attacks, and have spent between 19 and 28 years in prison. They included 18 men from the West Bank, three Gazans, and in a concession by Israel, five men from east Jerusalem. Israel considers east Jerusalem to be part of its capital and has previously balked at allowing the Palestinians to negotiate on behalf of prisoners living in what it considers to be Israeli territory. Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem is not internationally recognised, and the vast majority of Arab residents in the area hold residency rights but are not Israeli citizens. The coming releases generated excitement throughout Palestinian society, where prisoners held by Israel are revered as heroes and freedom fighters. Families decorated their homes and neighborhoods with posters of their loved ones who were returning home and planned large feasts.

I would leave my kids screaming and go for a visit,' she said. In the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal al-Mukaber, the sound of kettle drums filled the air as residents braced for the return of Jamal Abu Jamal, who has spent nearly 20 years in prison for a stabbing attack. Women holding Abu Jamal's picture sang and danced in circles and praised Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for securing his release. His mother Rayouf, 77, who is unable to speak after suffering two strokes, sat in a chair with tears in her eyes. Palestinians dropped demand for Israel to stop building homes in West Bank and east Jerusalem . Emotional: Families greet prisoners who were freed under the US-brokered peace deal . Release: 26 Palestinian prisoners celebrate as they arrive in the early hours . 'Since she heard the news, she's getting better,' said Abu Jamal's sister Huda. 'I can't express how happy she is.' Israeli opponents of the prisoner release have staged days of protests against the releases. A group representing the families appealed to the Supreme Court to block the release. It was rejected late on Monday, allowing the releases to continue. Netanyahu is expected to approve plans to build 1,400 new homes in both the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the coming days. The Palestinians say such construction undermines peace efforts, and have appealed to the US to block the expected announcement.

Anger: Protesters and relatives of Israelis who were killed by Palestinians . hold black umbrellas as they march in Jerusalem towards the house of prisoner Ahmed Khalaf, who was expected to be one of those released . The US and the European Union have harshly criticised settlement announcements during the current round of negotiations, with US Secretary of State John Kerry at one point questioning Israel's commitment to peace. Kerry is expected back in the region this week in another effort to breathe life into the negotiations. But Netanyahu indicated he would not back down. 'In these negotiations we are faced with our essential interests, including guaranteeing the settlements in the land of Israel,' he said. Netanyahu's decision to press forward with settlement construction at such a sensitive time has drawn criticism from all directions. Amir Peretz, a cabinet minister with the 'Movement' party, said the painful sight of watching convicted killers walk free could have been avoided had Netanyahu agreed to freeze settlement construction. Protests: Hundreds of people marched from the Prime Minister Residence to the Palestinian prisoner's house . Victims: Portraits of victims of terror seen on a table before a protest . Terror: People march with portraits of terror victims during the protest in Jerusalem, Israel. Mahmud Muammar, who served 23 years in Israeli Prison, was one of those expected to be freed last night . 'I would have preferred to freeze settlement building rather than releasing prisoners but at this point we must allow this stage to move forward, we must not do anything to prevent it,' he said. Settler leader Dani Dayan, on the other hand, said the timing of a new settlement announcement looked bad. 'The linkage between the release of convicted terrorists and the construction in Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria puts an unnecessary stain on the construction,' he said. The 'original sin,' he added, was agreeing to release any prisoners in the first place. 'Israel should have rejected the notion that it has to pay a price for negotiations,' he said. Placards: A person holds a sign during a victims of terror attacks protest . Tribute: A Palestinian relative of Osama Al-Selawai hangs a poster with his picture in the middle, with pictures of Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas and former President Yasser Arafat . The mother of Palestinian prisoner Rami Barbakh kisses her brother as they celebrate ahead of his release . Relatives of victims of Palestinian attacks awaited a decision from Israel's Supreme Court on Monday in an attempt to prevent the release . In another move that could upset peace efforts, a committee of Israeli cabinet ministers approved a bill Sunday that would annex a section of the West Bank near the Jordanian border to Israel. Netanyahu has said Israel must maintain a presence in the area, known as the Jordan Valley, as a security measure. Even so, it appears unlikely the bill, supported by hard-line lawmakers unhappy with peace efforts, will receive parliamentary approval. Speaking in Ramallah, Abbas rejected the move. 'This is Palestinian land and we will not let them do it,' he said. Israeli commentators questioned Netanyahu's judgment in pushing forward with more settlements. 'If Netanyahu has already undertaken to make this goodwill gesture, it would be best if he were to enjoy the international dividend that comes with it and not ruin things with a populist announcement about new construction,' wrote Shimon Shiffer, a columnist with the Yediot Ahronot daily. 'Netanyahu is like a cow that gives a bucket-full of milk, only to kick the bucket over.'","26 prisoners convicted of deadly attacks freed as part of peace deal .

A limited edition collection of bobbleheads celebrating past and present Supreme Court justices are amongst the rarest versions of the dolls ever produced. The bobbleheads, which are given away for free rather than sold, are the work of law professor Ross Davies, who has been creating them for the past 10 years. If you get a certificate to claim one, you have to redeem it at a Washington, DC, law office. When finished, the dolls arrive unannounced on the real justices' desks, secreted there by unnamed confederates. And fans will go to some lengths to get one. Extremely rare bobblehead dolls of Supreme Court Justices, from left, David Souter, William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, and Ruth Ginsburg . 'I think we take seriously trying to do them well,' said Davies, a law professor at Virginia's George Mason University and the editor of a quarterly legal journal called The Green Bag. Subscribing to the journal is the most reliable way to get a voucher to claim a bobblehead when they are released, but there's no guarantee. The certificates warn that the bearer 'might be able' to exchange it for a bobblehead, and the journal also hands out some bobbleheads to non-subscribers, including law school public interest groups that auction them at fundraisers. Some ultimately wobble their way onto eBay, where they reliably sell for hundreds of dollars. These bobblehead dolls representing Supreme Court Justices are some of the rarest ever produced and are given away for free, rather than sold . The justices themselves seem to have been charmed by their caricatures. Antonin Scalia once said in an interview that he understands his is the most popular. Stephen Breyer had four of the figures of his colleagues on display in his chambers during a 2009 C-Span interview. His own is currently in the works. And former Chief Justice William Rehnquist sent a thank-you note for his, which was the first to come out in 2003. 'Thank you for the ""bobble-head"" likeness of me which now sits on the mantle of the fireplace in my chambers,' Rehnquist wrote. 'It is probably a better likeness of me as I was 15 years ago than as I am now, but obviously I won't complain.' Davies said the idea for the bobbleheads came to him in the shower. In the decade since, he has immortalized 16 justices in ceramic, including four of the current court's nine members. Included in that total are a set of miniature bobbleheads representing the first justices appointed to the court. Ross Davies, professor of law and editor of The Green Bag, a law journal, holds one of the bobbleheads of Supreme Court justices that he helped to design for The Green Bag, in Washington . Antonin Scalia, right, once said in an interview that he understands his doll is the most popular, while Ruth Bader Ginsburg's figure stands on a replica of the parade ground at the Virginia Military Institute . Certificates for the newest tiny justice, John Blair, recently went out. The dolls, which are produced by Bellevue, Washington-based Alexander Global Promotions, are more than straight likenesses of the justices. Each has multiple references to the legal legacy of the person it honors. For example, Justice Louis Brandeis rides a train, a nod to his important opinion in a case involving the Erie Railroad in Pennsylvania. The David Souter bobblehead plays a song by Modest Mouse, a group he mentioned in a copyright case. And Ruth Bader Ginsburg stands on a replica of the parade ground at the Virginia Military Institute. In 1996 she wrote an opinion striking down the school's all-male admissions policy. Annotated sheets help collectors decode the details, which fans have been known to memorize and recite for visitors. If you get a certificate to claim one of these bobblehead dolls representing Supreme Court Justices, including Ruth Ginsburg, center, you have to redeem it at a Washington, DC, law office . 'It's like proof of their legal geekdom,' said Gregory Jacob, a Washington law firm partner and part of a small group of Green Bag editors who help create the bobbleheads. No detail is too small. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's bobblehead replicates the shoes she wore on Sept. 25, 1981, the day she was sworn in as the court's first female member. John Paul Stevens stands on a Betamax VCR, a nod to his opinion in a copyright case involving the device. When the VCR wasn't turning out right in production, Davies bought one on eBay and shipped it to China for a bobblehead sculptor to study. So far, Davies has gone through four drafts of the upcoming Breyer bobblehead, which portrays Breyer engaged in a favorite activity, riding his bike. The attention to detail delights devotees, who have been known to drive hundreds of miles to pick up their bobbleheads. And the figurines often are displayed in a prominent place in their owners' offices. Charmiane Claxton, a federal judge in Tennessee, said she contemplated insuring her collection, especially since she got her Scalia and O'Connor dolls signed by the justices. And Mark Killenbeck, a University of Arkansas law professor who collects the bobbleheads, says other faculty members have made 'veiled threats to steal them.' Robert Henry, a former federal appeals court chief judge who now heads Oklahoma City University, displays his collection in the school's law library. The school is moving to a new building, and he says he plans a prominent spot for the dolls. Henry says he talks to Ross Davies every so often just to make sure his subscription to The Green Bag is paid up so he doesn't miss an issue, or a bobblehead. 'I do not want to miss one,' he said.","Law professor Ross Davies has spent the past ten years creating a limited edition collection of bobbleheads celebrating past and present justices .

"Negligee style dress worn in pivotal scene of the 1939 film . Feared lost but reemerged in the 1980s, 40 years after the film was released . PUBLISHED: . 08:39 EST, 25 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:53 EST, 25 October 2013 . A gown worn by British screen siren Vivien Leigh in definitive Hollywood film Gone with the Wind has emerged for sale for £45,000. Leigh wears the sweeping pale blue negligee in the pivotal scene of the 1939 film in which her character Scarlett O’Hara’s daughter dies in a tragic horse riding accident. Fans and experts feared the iconic gown had been lost over the years - but to their amazement it reemerged in the 1980s, 40 years after the film was released. A gown worn by British screen siren Vivien Leigh in definitive Hollywood film Gone with the Wind has emerged for sale for £45,000 . It was revealed that the film’s costume company had given the gown to one of its seamstresses as a wedding present once filming was over. The gown remained in her family until the ‘80s when she sold it to a prominent collector of Gone with the Wind memoribilia, the current seller. Experts expect the gown to fetch £45,000 when it goes under the hammer. The film, which also starred Clark Gable as Leigh’s lover Rhett Butler, is regarded as one of the greatest of all time. Leigh, who was married to Laurence Olivier from 1940 to 1960, won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Scarlett O’Hara. Catherine Williamson, director of fine books, manuscripts and entertainment memorabilia at Bonhams, said: “It’s really wonderful to be able to offer any costume from Gone with the Wind let alone Vivien Leigh’s negligee. 'She wears this negligie under a fox fur in the scene where Bonnie Blue Butler has the fall off the pony and dies. 'It is a critical moment towards the end of the film, and you can see the negligie quite clearly under the fox fur. 'For many years collectors thought this piece was lost - no-one could find it. 'It wasn’t at the big MGM auction in the ‘70s and it wasn’t at the Western Costume Company, the company that made the costumes for the film. 'What had happened was that in the days after the film was made one of the seamstresses that worked on the film got married. The 1939 film, which also starred Clark Gable as Leigh's lover Rhett Butler, is regarded as one of the greatest of all time . 'The company gave her this dress as a wedding present and it remained in her family for decades. 'Towards the end of her life around 20 years ago she contacted the present owner who is a major collector of Gone with the Wind memoribilia. 'He bought it directly from her and it has since been confirmed as the piece that appeared in the movie. 'That doesn’t happen very often - when things go missing they don’t often come back. 'It’s lovely that something from one of the most iconic films of all time that we thought was lost was not lost at all. 'Gone with the Wind costumes are very rare and collectors will see this as a real opportunity.' Rhett and Scarlett remain one of film's most iconic couples and the dress was worn in the pivotal scene where Scarlett falls to her death from a horse . The auction will take place at Bonhams in New York on November 25 .","Negligee style dress worn in pivotal scene of the 1939 film .

Although the family only originally planned for the video to be for private viewing, the reaction of friends and family prompted them to make it public . Sara says that Lola's interest in hairdressing and playing with dolls hair gave her the idea that her daughter should help shave her head . Mrs .

A man has been pictured performing the anti-Semitic 'salute' made famous by Nicolas Anelka in front of the Jewish school where three children were killed in a 2012 massacre. The photograph shared on social media has helped to fuel anger over the 'quenelle', which was invented by an outspoken comedian accused of espousing extremist views. The gesture, said to resemble a Nazi salute, was brought to international fame last week when Mr Anelka made it after scoring a goal for West Bromwich Albion. Outrage: This photograph shows an unidentified man performing the quenelle, an allegedly anti-Semitic salute, outside the Jewish school where three children were killed in 2012 . Controversy: Nicolas Anelka made the gesture after scoring against West Ham United on Saturday . The footballer insists he was unaware of the gesture's alleged racist connotations, and only meant to show support for comedian Dieudonné M'Bala M'Bala. However, numerous photographs have emerged of members of the public performing the 'quenelle' in front of Holocaust memorials, concentration camps and a poster of Anne Frank. The latest image to spark outrage in France shows an unidentified man doing the gesture at the Ozar Hatorah school in Toulouse, site of the worst school shooting in the country's history. Anti-Semitic terrorist Mohammed Merah targeted the school during a gun rampage in March 2012, murdering a rabbi and three children aged three, six and eight. Friends: Anelka with comedian Dieudonné, who invented the quenelle gesture . In the photograph, which has been widely circulated online in the wake of the Anelka row, the man performing the quenelle is wearing a T-shirt depicting former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The salute involves extending one arm, as in a Nazi salute, but keeping it by your side as you touch your shoulder with the other arm. Mr Anelka has refused to apologise for doing the quenelle during a game against West Ham United last Saturday, but has agreed not to repeat the gesture in future. He claimed the salute was intended to be 'anti-system' and was a sign of his friendship with Dieudonné. Symbol: Samir Nasri of Manchester City was also pictured doing the quenelle and has since apologised . It has emerged that other sportsmen, including Manchester City's Samir Nasri and basketball star Tony Parker, have been pictured with the comedian performing the gesture. They all say they were unaware of any anti-Semitic connotations, and Dieudonné himself claims the quenelle is a symbol of defiance. The comedian has multiple convictions for anti-Jewish hate speech, and has been accused of using his act for 'professional anti-Semitism'.

The BBC has snubbed the 50th anniversary of Top of the Pops because the programme has been tainted by the Jimmy Savile scandal, it has been claimed. The long-running series, which was on every week for 42 years and still appears in Christmas scheduling, was first broadcast on New Year's Day 1964, presented by Savile from a church in Manchester. The DJ opened the show with the words 'It's number one, it's Top of the Pops'. The show played host to iconic acts over the years, from the Rolling Stones - the first band to play the show - to the Beatles, The Clash, Cliff Richard, the Bee Gees, David Bowie and Sir Elton John. But, unlike Dr Who, which celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, Top of the Pops will receive no special programming at all. The sci-fi series was honoured with a feature-length anniversary episode as well as a dramatised documentary about its creation. But Top of the Pops, which at its 1970s peak was watched by a quarter of the country, has no anniversary TV or radio shows, and prompted only a trivia article on the BBC website. The decision is thought to be a direct result of the scandal following Savile's death in 2011 aged 84. Victim after victim came forward to reveal that the DJ had abused them when they were children. It is suspected he could have abused as many as 450 children. He has since been branded Britain's worst ever paedophile. Debut: Jimmy Savile appears on the first ever Top of the Pops, on New Year's Day 1964 . Famous faces: Iconic artists, including The Beatles, shown in 1964, performed on Top of the Pops . Long-running: This picture, from 2011, shows Savile with former presenter Jamie Theakston . Continuing: Top of the Pops still appears in Christmas scheduling, such as the pictured episode, shown last night, which featured Tinie Tempah . BBC executives have previously axed . programmes featuring Savile and has pledged never to show footage of the . presenter in re-runs. However, not everybody is pleased by the decision, which some say does the show a disservice by ignoring its contribution to music history. Patrick Humphreys, who has written a book about the show's history for the anniversary, said: 'It’s upsetting because I think the show deserves to be remembered for what it was, the excitement it created and what it went on to become.' A BBC spokesman said: 'Although there are both the Christmas and New Year’s Eve Top of The Pops specials, there are no current plans for a TOTP 50th anniversary programme.' 1. The programme was originally commissioned for six weeks, but ran for 42 years.2. The fee for the first ever Top of the Pops appearance - by the Rolling Stones - was £86.3. Sir Cliff Richard has performed on the show more than anybody else - an estimated 160 times.4. Pete Townshend, of The Who, admitted it was TOTP which prompted him into his famous 'windmill' style of playing the guitar.5. Status Quo are the group with the most TOTP appearances – 86 in total.6. Elton John’s first TOTP appearances were as a backing musician for Brotherhood Of Man and Pickettywitch in 1970.7. Although the show's theme tune was a version of Led Zeppelin track Whole Lotta Love, the band never actually appeared on TOTP.8. For nine months in 1971, the show featured an album slot.9. When Queen made their TOTP debut, Freddie Mercury didn't own a TV, so had to watch himself in a shop window.10. Punk band The Clash boycotted the show because they’d have to mime - but by 1991 it was compulsory to sing live .","The music series ran for 42 years, and still appears in Christmas schedules .

A mother spent three weeks in turmoil after doctors told her she had terminal cancer - only to discover there was nothing wrong with her. Evelina Powell, 32, was rushed to hospital after collapsing at work and given blood tests and a CT scan. Doctors thought she had suffered a mini-stroke which was later ruled out. An MRI scan then detected a possible tumour, instead. Misdiagnosis: Evelina Powell (with daughter Sophie, four) spent three weeks believing she had terminal cancer after doctors said cancer had eaten away a 50 pence-sized hole in her skull . Mrs Powell claims she she was told that cancer had eaten away a 50 pence sized hole in her skull. Terrified she was going to die, she began to get her affairs in order to ensure her two-year-old daughter Sophie would be cared for. Her family from Poland also made plans to come and visit her. But three weeks later, experts at Charing Cross Hospital in London gave her the all clear. Mrs Powell, who is cancer-free after developing stage three ovarian cancer in 2005, said her life 'fell apart' when she thought the disease had spread. She said: 'The first time I had cancer I was on my own but this time all I could keep thinking about was my two-year-old daughter Sophie. 'She was my miracle baby because I was told I would not be able to have children. 'My world just crashed to pieces when I thought I might not be able to see her growing up. 'I . would start crying when I saw something that reminded me about the . holiday to Disney World we had never booked for her birthday, or the . shopping trips we may never go on when she was older. Change: Despite being told by her local hospital in Kent that she had terminal cancer, Mrs Powell was told by experts at Charing Cross Hospital in London that there was nothing wrong with her . 'I cried when I saw a sign which said 2014 on it, thinking I might not be around then. 'I spent three weeks thinking I was going to die. When I was told there was nothing, there it was just a shock. It only hit me the next day. 'Even now I know I'm going to be OK I'm scared to go back to my doctor.' She added: 'I wasn't angry with them because the NHS saved my life when I had ovarian cancer.'I was disappointed more than anything - I feel like they were playing God. 'I'm still trying to put the pieces of my life back together.' Her husband Danny, 36, a TV aerial engineer, said: 'The doctor was so blasé about it. I said it could be anything else, but he said [to her]: 'No, you have got cancer'. 'It has driven my wife insane. One night she was crying in bed and just said ""am I going to die?"". How can I answer that?' Devastated: Mrs Powell said: 'My world just crashed to pieces when I thought I might not be able to see Sophie growing up. I would start crying when I saw something that reminded me about the holiday to Disney World we had never booked for her birthday, or the shopping trips we may never go on when she was older' The couple, of Maidstone, Kent, have complained to Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust about the misdiagnosis in September. They claim they were given a lack of information about her condition, which left them relying on the internet. Mrs Powell says the only explanation the doctor could give for the confusion was a lesion on her head from an accident when she was a newborn.

In . an extraordinary report, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said . strengthened immigration policies designed to prevent health and benefit . tourism could leave immigrants feeling stigmatised. The . measures have been introduced by the Government to verify migrants' immigration status before they receive health and housing benefits. Angry Tory MPs branded the report foolish, irresponsible, Left-wing . garbage. Meddling: Antonio Guterres, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has focused on Britain . They also questioned why commissioner Antonio Guterres was focusing on Britain when two million Syrian refugees are in desperate need of help. The spat comes three months after the UN provoked a furious row by announcing an inquiry into whether changes in housing benefit in Britain nicknamed the bedroom tax broke human rights law. UN official Raquel Rolnik was branded 'overpaid, over-mighty and unaccountable' after visiting Britain uninvited to carry out an inspection of housing conditions and check they provided 'an adequate standard of living'. The latest attack was made in a paper delivered to the Commons Public Bill Committee examining the Immigration Bill – key Coalition legislation intended to discourage illegal immigration. Delivered in the name of former Portuguese prime minister Mr Guterres, it said the new law's proposals 'could negatively affect the reception and integration' of refugees and asylum seekers. But Tory Vice-Chairman Bob Neill said: 'Antonio Guterres is best known for boosting benefits in Portugal and quitting just before his party was booted out. We will not take lectures about how to manage our borders from a failed Portuguese socialist turned unelected bureaucrat. Interfering: The UN's Raquel Rolnik . 'While he tries to score cheap political points, this Government is taking the difficult long-term decisions needed to ensure it is easier to remove illegal immigrants and stop abuse of public services.' The report said plans to ask landlords, banks and GPs to check the immigration status of new tenants, account holders and patients were 'likely to result in asylum seekers, refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection being stigmatised in the public mind and in their being denied access to housing or bank accounts'. It added: 'Such measures could contribute towards a climate of misunderstanding and ethnic profiling that could undermine the longer-term prospects for integration of such persons and prove detrimental to social cohesion.' Among its demands is that Home Secretary Theresa May drops her plan to instruct courts to give 'little weight' to claims made by illegal immigrants that they should not be deported because they have established families in Britain. Ministers declined to comment on the UN intervention yesterday but there was deep anger among senior Tory MPs. Priti Patel, MP for Witham, said: 'This is an over-reaction, using emotional language which I regard as irresponsible. It is important that Parliament and British law determine immigration policy.' Clacton MP Douglas Carswell said: 'There is absolutely nothing inappropriate about a sovereign country deciding who should be allowed to come and live within its borders and be entitled to benefits and who should not.' Peter Bone, who represents Wellingborough, said: 'This is Left-wing garbage. It should be treated with utter contempt.' The High Commissioner's report attacked David Cameron's immigration reforms.

A senior Eurocrat attacked Britain yesterday for having a ‘too generous’ welfare system and insisted there will be no tightening of the rules on EU immigration. Theresa May travelled to Brussels to demand changes to the free movement directive that has allowed more than a million Eastern Europeans to move to the UK since 2004. In a combative intervention, the Home Secretary suggested the idea of a ‘cap’ on the number of EU workers that Britain should be expected to take. But her pleas were immediately rejected by EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding – who also vowed to block Britain’s attempts to end ‘benefit tourism’. EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding (left) rejected the pleas of Theresa May to 'cap' the number of workers that Britain should be expected to take . In a stinging response, Mrs Reding said that only Britain was to blame for any abuse of its welfare system by migrants. She hit back: ‘It seems that some national systems are too generous. Don’t blame the Commission or EU rules for national choices and national regulatory systems. ‘If member states want to restrict the availability of social benefits to EU citizens they can do two things. First, change their national systems to make them less generous. ‘Second, apply the existing EU rules which provide safeguards to counter abuse, fraud and error: for example possible expulsion orders and re-entry bans in case of abuses.’ Mrs Reding ruled out any change to the EU free movement rules – despite the pressure on UK ministers to make changes ahead of the lifting of controls on Romanians and Bulgarians next month. ‘Our EU rules are good and they are here to stay. Member states need to apply them to tackle abuse.’ Upon her arrival at a meeting of EU justice ministers in Brussels yesterday, Mrs May called for reform of free movement, a proposal with support in Germany, the Netherlands and Austria. Ministers were last night accused of running scared from a gathering Tory rebellion over the lifting of controls on Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants. Some 63 MPs have signed an amendment to the Government’s Immigration Bill demanding that existing controls on workers from the two countries should not be lifted on January 1. However, in a move which provoked anger on the Tory backbenches, Leader of the House Andrew Lansley yesterday ‘delayed’ debate on the legislation until the New Year. By that time the migrants will already be allowed to work in the UK and the rebel Tory amendment could no longer apply. Tory MP Mark Reckless said: ‘It would surely make sense for the House to vote on whether to extend immigration restrictions for Bulgaria and Romania in advance of them being lifted?’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage accused the Government of ‘desperately trying to bury the news’ by delaying the vote on the same day that Westminster was focused on the Autumn Statement. Mr Lansley insisted the overall progress of the Bill – which would make it easier to deport foreign criminals – would not be delayed. ‘It is simply that I have announced in the future business before Christmas, progress on five Bills.’ She said: ‘For future accession treaties, we must be able to slow full access to each other’s labour markets until we can be sure it will not lead to mass migration. ‘This could, for example, be achieved by requiring new member states to reach a certain level of income or economic output per head before full free movement is allowed. Second, looking ahead, we must seize the opportunity presented by the Prime Minister’s plan to reform the EU and address the problems caused by free movement. For example, why shouldn’t national governments be allowed to impose a cap on numbers if European immigration reaches certain thresholds?’ Earlier this week, Mariana Campeanu, Romania’s labour minister, said Britain should be grateful to Romanians and Bulgarians for taking jobs shunned by locals. Ministers insist they are powerless to maintain existing restrictions on citizens from the two countries on January 1. Instead, Mrs May is now focusing on changing the rules in the long-term. David Cameron is expected to raise the idea of a cap on EU migrants in future negotiations over the UK’s membership of the EU. n Romania and Bulgaria have by far the highest poverty levels in Europe, said a report yesterday. Half of Bulgarians and 41.7 per cent of Romanians qualify as poor, compared to a European average of about 25 per cent. The EU’s statistics arm Eurostat said more than four out of ten children in the two countries are also poor. Some 44 per cent of Bulgarians and 30 per cent of Romanians are ‘severely materially deprived’. The UK figu re is 7.8 per cent.

A jury deciding whether to sentence a convicted cop killer to death today saw a CCTV recording of the 31-year-old and a 29-year-old prison guard rendezvousing in the prison 'activity room'. The CCTV video shows a two-minute incident between Ronell Wilson and Nancy Gonzalez, 29, which occurred at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center on July 15, 2012 in New York. The prison guard has pled guilty while on trial for the affair and . possesses the full evidence of her crime: in March this year she gave . birth to Ronell Wilson's son, whom she named Justus. Two minutes: Nancy Gonzalez (left) and Ronell Wilson (right) disappeared for two minutes in July 2012; in March the following year, Gonzalez gave birth to their son . Jailhouse affair: Ronell Wilson has been in prison since 2003 but has managed to father a child . The affair was reportedly carried on between March and August of that year before Wilson was moved to solitary confinement. According to the New York Daily News, an inmate called Kevin Johansen described an incident between the prisoner and his jailer, who reportedly often kissed and hugged one another. Johansen said he saw Gonzalez holding open Wilson’s cell door while the other prisoners were locked down for a headcount. 'When she walked away I saw Mr. Wilson’s pants around his ankles and his genitals were exposed,' Johansen said. Jurors also heard a recording of Wilson and his new girlfriend, also called Gonzalez, discussing her pleasuring him with her hand when his mother and sister were present at prison visiting hours. Ronell Wilson's execution-style murder of two police officers in 2003 during a gun-buying sting operation led to the first federal death sentence in New York City for more than 50 years. The sentence was overturned, and a new jury has now been assembled to decide Wilson's fate in the murders of Rodney Andrews, 36, and James Nemorin, 34. Slain: James Nemorin (left) and Rodney Andrews (right) were undercover cops on an illegal weapons sting when they were killed by Ronell Wilson . According to The New York Times, Gonzalez admitted that the two had sex repeatedly, with the goal of having a child together. She explained her motivations to an inmate: 'Why not give him a child, as far as giving him some kind of hope?' In a letter to another inmate, Wilson wrote, 'I just need a baby before thiz pigz try to take my life. I need to have something behinde.' Mother: Nancy Gonzalez gave birth to her son Justus a few months ago, but she faces up to 15 years in prison for her affair with the convicted murderer . Gonzalez faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in the case against her. An inmate cannot legally consent to sex, so she is charged with sexual abuse of a person in custody. According to The New York Times, after her affair with Wilson, Gonzalez took up with another inmate, who has been transferred to a different jail. The second inmate has offered to raise Wilson's baby as his own when he is released from prison. Meanwhile, Ronell Wilson's sentencing trial continues. In Federal District Court in Brooklyn, lead prosecutor James G. McGovern told the packed courtroom what happened the night Andrews and Nemorin died. On March 10, 2003 Wilson was a member of the notorious Bloods gang. He led James Nemorin and Rodney Andrews, detectives who were in Staten Island as part of a sting operation to buy illegal guns, in a car to a secluded neighborhood where he shot them in the back of the head. He dumped the bodies from the car and drove off, covered in blood. It's not known if he murdered the officers because he knew they were police or for another reason. According to prosecutors, he was trying to impress his fellow gang members, and planned to rob the men after he'd shot them. Jurors have also been shown video of Wilson resisting prison guards and prosecutors are arguing he should be executed rather than face life in prison because he poses a threat even in jail.","A jury deciding the fate of Ronell Wilson today saw a video of a two-minute rendezvous between him and a prison guard .

A former Ohio doctor accused of killing a pregnant woman last year by injecting her with heroin after she answered a Craigslist ad pleaded guilty today for her death and that of her nearly full-term unborn child. Ali Salim, 44, entered the pleas in Delaware County Court, north of Columbus, ahead of his trial scheduled for next week. He faces 37 years in prison at a December sentencing. Ali Salim (pictured right in court today) entered guilty pleas to two counts of involuntary manslaughter, as well as a count each of tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse . Salim pleaded guilty to two counts of involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of Deanna Ballman and her unborn daughter, who was to be named Mabel Lilly. Ballman, 23, was nine months pregnant when she died. Salim also pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse, described as 'inhumane things'. He also entered a type of guilty plea to a charge of rape under which he maintains his innocence but acknowledges prosecutors had enough evidence to convict him. The tampering with evidence charge alleges Salim erased photos and video of Ballman from his phone, though the images were later recovered by investigators, said Kyle Rohrer, assistant Delaware County Prosecutor. Lori Ballman holds a tribute to her late daughter, Deanna, at her home in Pataskala, Ohio, in May 2013 . The guilty pleas avoid any uncertainties from a trial and gave Salim the chance to take responsibility in court, Rohrer said. Ballman's mother and sister attended the hearing but declined to comment. The family appreciates the work of investigators and will speak at sentencing, their lawyer Greg Helser said today. Salim remains free on house arrest on $1 million bond. Ballman was last seen alive on July 31, 2012, when she left her home in suburban Columbus, telling her family she was answering a Craigslist ad for a housecleaner. She called her mother a few hours later saying she was feeling dizzy. The call was then lost and her family couldn't reach her again. Ballman's body was found in the back of her car the next day on a rural road a few miles from Salim's house in an upscale neighborhood. Deanna Ballman, pictured, was killed by Salim in the summer of 2012 . Tragic: Ballman, pictured left and right, was nine-months pregnant and a mother-of-two kids, pictured right . Salim's attorney, Sam Shamansky, has . said Ballman was prostituting herself to feed a drug habit. Messages . were left with Shamansky on Thursday. Authorities . say there's no evidence that Ballman was a drug user, but they have . said she was responding to a personal ad, not a job ad. Rohrer . declined to discuss the allegations Thursday. He said a full . presentation of the state's case would be made at sentencing. Women . who previously answered ads placed by Salim reported being accosted, . sexually assaulted or asked to be alone in the house while he painted . the human digestive system on their abdomens, according to police . records. Salim is also the target of a $40 million lawsuit filed by Ballman's family earlier this year blaming him for her death. That lawsuit, which also named Salim's employer and Craigslist, has been on hold during the criminal case. Previous reports suggested she may have met with Salim after he put a call out for models. In court: Dr. Ali Salim, pictured in May 2013, waits for deputies to escort him from the courtroom after he pleaded not guilty to charges of killing Ballman (he changed his plea today) Unclear: Ballman's family claim she was responding to a housecleaning ad though reports suggest she met with Salim to model for him . Assistant county prosecutor Kyle Rohrer . said in February that Salim treated Ballman's body 'in a very inhumane way,' but wouldn't . elaborate on how. Prosecutors believe the doctor has gone by the cyber handle 'extremephotoenthusias' on Craigslist. According . to an email obtained by 10TV in September 2012, the doctor wrote that . he was willing to pay $300 if young women can keep their work 'drama . free,' adding 'I just don't need the drama.' He also told women that they could 'wear . anything but black or brown bra, and panties are essential. I will take . most shots from the back.' Ballman died of a heroin overdose but also had morphine and codine in her blood at the time of her death and her urine contained morphine, monoacetylmorphine, codeine, acetylocodine and diacetylmorphine. Licensure information from the state . indicates Salim was born in Pakistan and trained there at King Edward . Medical College, graduating in 1993. He told the State Medical Board of . Ohio that his specialties were internal medicine, emergency medicine and . psychiatry. Salim . was working at a health care facility in neighboring Knox County but . lost his privileges there once the case became public, Shamansky said.

Two sisters testified against their own father on Thursday as the trial of the former Utah doctor accused of murdering his wife continued. Dr Martin MacNeill, a former Mormon Sunday school teacher, is accused of drugging and drowning his wife Michele MacNeill. 'Ever since the day my mom died, I was concerned that my father killed her. I've been fighting to get justice for this case ever since then,' Alexis Somers told the courtroom in Provo, Utah. Scroll down for video... A tearful Rachel macNeill, left, and her younger sister Alexis Somers, right, both testified in court against their father who is accused of murdering their mother in April 2007 . Martin MacNeill bows his head and listens to his daughter Rachel MacNeill's emotional testimony during his murder trial on Thursday . Her father, Dr Martin MacNeill, showed little emotion during the testimony. Prosecutors have painted a picture of MacNeill as a liar who was hell-bent on making his wife have a facelift so he could dope her up with a cocktail of drugs during her recovery and then drown her in the bathtub. The motive was a woman named Gypsy Willis, who MacNeill had met online more than a year and a half before he allegedly killed his former beauty queen wife. Willis was hired on shortly after his wife's death as a nanny, but oldest-daughter Rachel MacNeill testified that she knew that her father had a relationship with the new woman. 'It was obvious,' she said. 'She was just goo eyes at my dad and didn't do anything a nanny should do.' During her testimony today, MacNeill talked about how she used to be close to her father. 'Growing up, my father was my best friend,' she said. 'We were a close family.' But that relationship changed when he started acting strange following her mother's death. Hours after Michele MacNeill's death, her father started 'continually' bringing up an autopsy that would clear him of suspicion in her death. Alexis Somers, left, and her sister Rachel MacNeill hug outside the courtroom during the trial of their father . Michele MacNeill's husband is accused of making his wife have a facelift so he could dope her up with a cocktail of drugs during her recovery and then drown her in the bathtub . 'He didn't want anyone to think he murdered my mother,' said the oldest of eight siblings. She said she found her father's effort to clear himself jarring in 2007 when she was grieving her mother's unexplained death. 'It was so shocking to me,' Rachel MacNeill testified. 'I said, ""Why would anyone think that?'"" She spoke haltingly, trembling as she tried to maintain her composure. The judge had to call a break early in her testimony when she was unable to speak. She avoided looking at her father in the courtroom. Rachel MacNeill also described a family lunch after their mother's funeral that turned sour. Her father was 'commenting on how he's a single man now, and he kept it very casual,' Rachel MacNeill said. 'He was making jokes about being single, and he was laughing. It made me sick. I left.' Earlier on Thursday, Somers - who is also a doctor - said her father's account of how he found his wife unresponsive in the tub conflicted with other eyewitness accounts. She is a guardian for the family's youngest daughter, a key witness in the case whose appearance at the trial awaits a ruling by the judge. Somers said she never coached the then-6-year-old sister about what to tell police in Utah after the child found their mother in a bathtub. Somers said she has kept the now-12-year-old sheltered from the news coverage of their mother's death. 'She is just a little girl, she shouldn't have to be expose to that,' But Somers also knew that her little sister's testimony would be important and she believes that Ada suspects their father carried out the crime. 'Ask her, maybe she doesn't know,' Somers said. Happy family? Martin MacNeill, second from right, stands accused of murder in the 2007 death of his wife and the mother of his eight children . Her testimony came during a special hearing held by the trial judge to determine if he'll allow Ada MacNeill, now 12, to take the witness stand. Fourth District Judge Derek Pullan issued no immediate ruling as he resumed the trial on Thursday. He is trying to determine if Ada MacNeill has her own independent memory of what happened when she was the first to find her mother unresponsive in the bathtub in 2007. Jurors were not present during the hearing. MacNeill, 57, is accused of hounding his wife Michele MacNeill to have a face-lift then mixing a lethal combination of drugs for her recovery and helping her into the tub. The trial is in its second week. It's expected to last at least one month. Rachel MacNeill, daughter of Martin MacNeill, tries to keep her composure on the witness stand during her father's murder trial . On Wednesday, an emergency room doctor testified that MacNeill offered him $10,000 to keep trying to save his wife even though he was already working furiously to revive Michele MacNeill. Scott Vanwagoner called the comment 'off-the-wall' and the oddest experience of his medical career. Other witnesses have testified that MacNeill was acting erratically at the house, too, as paramedics worked to revive her before taking her to the emergency room. Police previously testified to MacNeill's erratic behavior that night. 'He . was hysterical. He was blurting out things like why did you have to . have this surgery? Why were you on so many medications? Why God,' Dan Beckstrom with Pleasant Grove Police Department told the court. Police . and paramedics have testified that he had cursed his 50-year-old wife . after they arrived for insisting on getting a face-lift then taking too . much medication and falling into a bathtub. The 2007 death shocked the Mormon community of Pleasant Grove, about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City, because the suspect was a doctor and had been a church leader. MacNeill has since surrendered his medical license. After . MacNeill’s arrest in August 2012, sisters Alexis Somers and Rachel . MacNeill told Good Morning America that they knew their father killed . their mother, even when her death was first ruled to have been from . natural causes. ‘We know he's guilty. We know he'll harm again. If he's let out he will come after us,' Rachel MacNeill said. Plot thickens: The trial of Dr. Martin MacNeill, a Utah father of eight and Mormon bishop, will heat up Thursday as his children prepare to take the stand against him. First up is Ada MacNeill, who was 6 when she found her mother dying in the bathtub . Family divided: Ada MacNeill (left), 12, will take the stand . against her father, Martin MacNeill (right), who is accused of murdering . his wife in 2007 by drugging her and coaxing her into the bathtub . The . women had long fought for police to re-open the case into their . mother's death, certain their father had murdered after Michele . MacNeill, 50, who was found drowned in the bathtub at their Pleasant Grove . home in 2007. 'It's . horrible to be happy about the arrest of your father, but finally he is . being held accountable for murdering my mother,' Alexis Somers said. Plotted: Prosecutors say MacNeill convinced his wife to get a facelift then drugged her and coaxed her into the tub, where she drowned . Vindicated? MacNeill's daughters Alexis Somers and Rachel MacNeill will testify against their father, whom they have long believed to be responsible for their mother's death, but prosecutors say Ada is up first . Safe haven: Michele MacNeill was found floating fully clothed in a tub in the family's home in Pleasant Grove, Utah, in April 2007 . 'Off the wall': Emergency room physician Dr. Leo Scott Van Wagonere told the court Wednesday that MacNeill offered him $10,000 to continue resuscitating his wife .

A mom is facing assault charges after nearly pulling off her six-year-old son's genitals during a rage and then trying to repair his wound with superglue. Jennifer Marie Vargas, 34, is a civilian living at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, where the boy's father is in the Army. She was arrested on Wednesday and has been charged by the FBI with assault within maritime and territorial jurisdiction resulting in serious bodily injury. Jennifer Marie Vargas, 34, is facing assault charges after nearly pulling off her six-year-old son's genitals during a rage and then trying to repair his wound with superglue . Vargas remains in custody pending a bail hearing on Monday in federal court in San Antonio and faces up to 10 years in prison. The incident happened on Sept. 27 at the family's home at the military base. Prosecutors say the father returned home from work and found his injured son crying in his bedroom. The father noticed bloody tissue in the boy's underwear and the severe injury to his scrotum. He took his son to the San Antonio Military Medical Center, where doctors found that the boy had a four centimeters long laceration to his scrotum and bruising to his penis area. 'Due to the child's extreme physical pain, the medical staff had to administer medication,' the affidavit said, reports the Houston Chronicle. The accused mom is a civilian living at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, where the boy's father is in the Army . 'The child was taken into surgery to repair the damage to his scrotum.' The boy is currently recovering from surgery and remains in his father's custody. Vargas, the affidavit said, admitted to agents that while angry with the boy she grabbed him by the scrotum and pulled him to her as hard as she could, 'thereby ripping his ""sack"" and causing a laceration.' Vargas told FBI agents that she cleaned the wound with alcohol and then tried to fix it with superglue. 'She applied superglue to the (boy's) scrotum until the bleeding stopped, stuffed his underwear with paper towels, and then told him to go to bed,' the affidavit said. 'Vargas did not seek any type of medical treatment for the child.' The boy's father took his son to the San Antonio Military Medical Center, where doctors found that he had a four centimeters long laceration to his scrotum and bruising to his penis area . Vargas was not charged until now because the matter still was under investigation. She is currently being detained with bond and at Monday's bail hearing prosecutors will argue that she continue to remain jailed. Federal investigators are looking at previous states where the couple have lived to see if there have been any prior interactions with child protection agencies, but the CPS said it hasn't dealt with the family before.","Jennifer Marie Vargas, 34, a military wife living at a base in San Antonio, Texas, faces up to 10 years in prison after being arrested on Wednesday .

An attorney says a nursing home has agreed to provide long-term care for a 13-year-old girl, who has been declared brain dead but whose family maintains is still alive. A southern California facility agreed after another nursing home backed out, the family's lawyer, Christopher Dolan, said Friday. He wouldn't provide its name, saying 'we're afraid they'll be inundated with press' and decide to back out as well. Time is short for the family, as Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo on Tuesday ruled that the Children's Hospital Oakland may remove Jahi McMath from life support at 5pm Monday unless an appeal is filed. Next steps: Jahi McMath, 13, was declared legally brain-dead after undergoing a routine tonsil removal. Her parents found a nursing home willing to keep her on life support yesterday after it was ruled Tuesday that the hospital no longer needed to care for the girl . Unthinkable: Jahi McMath's mother Nailah Winkfeld has an emotional moment in court on Tuesday as a judge announces the Oakland Children's Hospital may take her daughter off life support next Monday. Pictured with her husband and Jahi's stepfather Martin Winkfield . Jahi underwent tonsil surgery at Children's Hospital on December 9 to treat sleep apnea. After she awoke from the operation, her family said, she started bleeding heavily from her mouth and went into cardiac arrest. Doctors at Children's Hospital concluded the girl was brain dead on December 12 and wanted to remove her from life support. The family said they believe she is still alive. Before Jahi can be transferred, she must undergo two more medical procedures — the insertion of a breathing tube and a feeding tube, both of which would be necessary for her long-term care but which the nursing home is not equipped to perform. The hospital has refused to perform the procedures. 'Children's Hospital Oakland does not believe that performing surgical procedures on the body of a deceased person is an appropriate medical practice,' David Durand, its chief of pediatrics, said in a statement Thursday. Last photos: Mrs Winkfield snapped this picture of daughter Jahi the morning she took her to the hospital to undergo a tonsillectomy that ended up all but ending her life . Unexpected: But after coming out of surgery, Jahi started bleeding for the mouth and was eventually ruled brain-dead. The hospital that performed the procedure no longer wants to keep the girl on life support . Still hope? Last week, Jahi's family released this picture of Nailah Wakefield holding her daughter's hand. The family has until January 7 to get the girl transferred to a facility that will take her or face pulling her plug . Douglas Straus, a lawyer for the hospital, said in a letter made public Friday that before the hospital would comply with the family's request to move Jahi, it would need to speak directly with officials at any nursing home to make sure they understand her condition, 'including the fact that Jahi is brain dead' — and to discuss needed preparations, including transportation. 'Children's Hospital will of course continue to do everything legally and ethically permissible to support the family of Jahi McMath. In that regard, Children's will allow a lawful transfer of Jahi's body in its current state to another location if the family can arrange such a transfer and Children's can legally do so,' Straus wrote in the letter. He also said the Alameda County coroner needed to sign off on the move 'since we are dealing with the body of a person who has been declared legally dead.' The letter was sent to Dolan after Dolan said he was preparing a federal civil rights lawsuit to force the hospital to outfit Jahi with breathing and feeding tubes. He said the hospital's refusal to cooperate violated her family's religious, due process rights and privacy rights. Upsetting: Makhai McMath, 8, blows a bubble with her gum as she marches in support of her 13-year-old sister . Dede Logan, of Oakland, adds red stars to a poster in support of Jahi McMath in front of Children's Hospital Oakland in Oakland, Calif., on Monday, Dec. 23, 2013 . Hope: Jahi's family believe she is still alive, despite being pronounced brain-dead by an independent doctor . In fulfillment of the hospital's request, Dolan said he had held a three-way conference call Friday with Straus and the director of the nursing home. Dolan also told the Associated Press on Friday that he had already obtained signed consent from the coroner for Jahi's transfer. The Alameda County Coroner's Bureau said it had no comment. Jahi's uncle, Omari Sealey, said earlier on Friday the family was in talks with three nursing homes — two in Los Angeles and one in New York — that might be willing to take her. The girl's relatives had announced on Thursday that they had found a nursing home in the San Francisco Bay Area that was willing to care for the girl if she had the tubes. Within hours, the hospital's chief of pediatrics issued a statement saying Children's would not cooperate because it 'does not believe that performing surgical procedures on the body of a deceased person is an appropriate medical practice.' Upon learning of the hospital's position, that facility backed out. Dolan said he is hoping the hospital officials will change their mind about the surgery after speaking with the nursing home officials. If they don't, he said, the family's options are slim, but he is hoping the Alameda County judge will give them some more time Monday to find a doctor willing to perform the surgeries.","Jahi McMath, 13, experienced complications following a tonsillectomy and was officially declared brain dead on December 12 .

A lot of married couples talk about being 'saved' by each other, but newlyweds Kyle Froelich and Chelsea Clair mean it literally. If Kyle had never met Chelsea there's a good chance he wouldn't be alive today since she provided a much-needed kidney transplant when his had almost completely stopped working. The two were married this past October 12, four years after they first met and three years after that life-saving organ donation. Commitment: Kyle Froelich married Chelsea Clair in a ceremony earlier this month. The couple met four years ago and on the day they met, Chelsea offered to donate her kidney to the ailing Kyle . In an interview with the Indianapolis Star, the couple talked about the day they met - September 12, 2009. At the time Kyle was in his last year of high school in Brownsburg, Indiana, and what doctor's believed was his last year of life. He met Chelsea at a car show, when the 22-year-old friend of a friend was going through a divorce. After hanging out with Kyle that day, Chelsea offered him her kidney as they were parting. He didn't think much of it though. Many people had offered him a kidney in the past and he learned not to get his hopes up. Meant to be: The kidney donation was a success as the two were a near perfect match, medically and, eventually, romantically . Chelsea was different though. She followed through and got tested and it turned out that the two were 'an almost perfect match'. Part of her commitment to donating her kidney was the fact that her father passed away after never finding a bone marrow transplant. But it wasn't an easy road to donation. After watching a video of a kidney operation, Chelsea's mother told her not to do it and that caused the mother and daughter to become distant. 'I felt like I had nobody,' Chelsea said. The two went into surgery six months after first meeting, and Kyle drove Chelsea to Indiana University hospital that day. A perfect match: The surgery was a success and Kyle's body accepted Chelsea's kidney immediately . Once at the hospital, Chelsea started to panic. She was going to be the first one operated on, and before being wheeled away into the OR, she grabbed onto Kyle and said 'Please don't let go'. The donation that brought them together: The two officially started dating after the kidney operation . Despite Chelsea's fears, the operation was a success and Kyle's body accepted the new kidney immediately. When they both awoke after the procedure, their first words were about each other. 'Is Kyle OK?' Chelsea asked. 'How's Chelsea?' Kyle said. While . recovering the two had to be kept separate so Kyle wouldn't get an . infection but he kept asking the nurses to wheel him past Chelsea so he . could wave into her room. It wasn't until after the donation that the two became an item. 'There's a bond that no one else, unless they've done it, can know. She's my best friend,' Kyle said. In . addition to other milestones of their relationship, the two now . celebrate the anniversary of the kidney transplant, a day they call . 'Sparkypalooza' (they named the kidney Sparky). It's become a sort-of inside joke between the two. Chelsea often threatens to take back the kidney. 'He's carrying around my kidney. I have to make sure he takes of that,' Chelsea said. Three years after Chelsea gave Kyle her kidney, the two exchanged vows at the Danville Conservation Club . At . their wedding ceremony on October 12, the couple opted out of the . traditional vows of 'in sickness and in health' and wrote something . meaningful to them: 'I offer you my hand, my heart and my soul, as I . know they will be safe with you.'","When his kidneys practically stopped functioning at the age of 19, Kyle Froelich was desperate to find a donor .

A judge ordered on Tuesday that a 13-year-old Northern California girl declared brain dead after suffering complications following a tonsillectomy be taken off life support. But Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo gave Jahi McMath's family until 5pm on December 30 to file an appeal. She will remain on life support until then, with the family saying they 'remain unsure' whether to press on with their fight to keep her on a breathing apparatus. The issue was ordered after Dr Paul Graham Fisher, from Stanford University, testified earlier in the day that Jahi meets all the criteria of brain death - the second expert to reach such a conclusion. The Children's Hospital of Oakland filed court papers on Tuesday morning asking that the girl be taken off life support after doctors there also concluded she was brain dead. The family had asked for a third evaluation, believing there is 'still time for a miracle'. Heartbreak: Nailah Winkfield, mother of Jahi McMath, sobs during a court hearing to discuss the treatment of her daughter in Oakland, California, with the judge ruling on Christmas Eve that the little girl will be removed from life support on Dec. 30. Her family have fought to keep her on a ventilator, arguing that 'miracles happen' and requesting new evaluations . Jahi McMath (pictured) has been on life support at Children's Hospital Oakland in Northern California since December 12, three days after undergoing standard tonsil surgery. her family have fought to prove there is a chance she will wake up while doctors have said it isn't possible . Christopher Dolan, attorney representing the family of 13-year-old Jahi McMath, wipes his eyes as a judge announces his ruling on Tuesday that the little girl will be taken off child support . Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo announces his ruling on 13-year-old Jahi McMath in Oakland, California December 24, 2013. Judge Grillo on Tuesday denied the McMath family's petition to keep their daughter on ventilator at Children's Hospital Oakland past December 30 after doctors declared her brain dead . 'Prayers are more important than ever before,' Omari Sealey, Jahi's uncle, said Tuesday night. 'Because the clock is ticking.' Jahi's mother, Nailah Winkfield, didn't attend the court hearing Tuesday, staying by her daughter's side in the hospital. 'Room 325 of Children's Hospital is our new home,' Sealey said. Earlier in the day, Fisher provided his conclusions in open court that Jahi has no brain activity. 'Because Ms. McMath is dead, practically and legally, there is no course of medical treatment to continue or discontinue; there is nothing to which the family's consent is applicable,' the hospital's Tuesday court filing stated. Dr. Robin Shanahan, a Children's Hospital doctor, was next called to testify in the judge's chambers. Alameda County Judge Evelio Grillo has previously ordered Jahi to remain on life support until Dec. 30, or until further order from the court. He is considering the hospital's request to immediately remove the teen from life support, as well as the family's demand for a third opinion and that Jahi remain on a machine to keep her breathing. Jahi was declared brain dead after experiencing complications following a tonsillectomy at Children's Hospital in Oakland.

Upsetting: Makhai McMath, 8, blows a bubble with her gum as she marches in support of her 13-year-old sister . The judge on Monday had called for Jahi to be independently examined by Fisher, the chief of child neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine. On Dec. 12, doctors concluded the girl was brain dead and since then have wanted to remove her from life support. Jahi's family wants to keep her hooked up to a respirator and eventually have her moved to another facility. The family said it believes she is still alive and that the hospital should not remove her from the ventilator without its permission. 'They failed her,' said Sandra Chatman, Jahi's grandmother and a registered nurse, who sat in Grillo's courtroom for more than three hours Tuesday during the closed door testimony. 'Jahi could have been saved. Miracles happen.' The family's attorney Christopher Dolan said he would file an emergency appeal to keep Jahi on life support if the trial judge orders her removal from the ventilator. Dolan also wants the third evaluation done by Dr. Paul Byrne, a pediatric professor at the University of Toledo. The hospital's attorney objected to Byrne, saying he is not a pediatric neurologist. Byrne is the co-editor of the 2001 book Beyond Brain Death, which presents a variety of arguments against using brain-based criteria for declaring a person dead. In a phone interview, Byrne said he could not comment in detail because he had not seen any of Jahi's medical records. But the fact that her ventilator is still functioning properly is a sign that she is alive, he said. Heartbroken: Jahi's mother Nailah Winkfield (pictured in court on December 20) is seen crying as the judge ordered a second opinion on the case . 'The ventilator won't work on a corpse,' he said. 'In a corpse, the ventilator pushes the air in, but it won't come out. 'Just the living person pushes the air out.' Jahi's family says the girl bled profusely after a tonsillectomy and then went into cardiac arrest before being declared brain dead. Outside the courtroom on Monday, Dr. David Durand, chief of pediatrics at Children's, said staff have the 'deepest sympathy' for the family, but that Jahi is brain dead. 'The ventilator cannot reverse the brain death that has occurred and it would be wrong to give false hope that Jahi will ever come back to life,' he said.

Dede Logan, of Oakland, adds red stars to a poster in support of Jahi McMath in front of Children's Hospital Oakland in Oakland, Calif., on Monday, Dec. 23, 2013 . Durand said Jahi's surgery was 'very complex,' not simply a tonsillectomy. 'It was much more complicated than a tonsillectomy,' Durand said. He refused to elaborate, citing health care privacy laws. Arthur L. Caplan, who leads the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center and is not involved in Jahi's case, told The Associated Press that once brain death has been declared, a hospital is under no obligation to keep a patient on a ventilator. 'Brain death is death,' he said. 'They don't need permission from the family to take her off, but because the little girl died unexpectedly and so tragically, they're trying to soften the blow and let the family adjust to the reality.'","Jahi McMath, 13, experienced complications following a tonsillectomy at the Children's Hospital in Oakland and was officially declared brain dead on December 12 .

Two Pakistani students married mentally handicapped British women so they could stay in the UK with one being deported but the other now claiming he has a human right to family life with his young son, High Court judges have heard. The first man, who is in his 20s, began a relationship with a woman in her late teens two months after exhausting his rights of appeal. They were married in a Muslim ceremony in June 2012, but last month the judge declared that marriage a sham and the man was deported. In both cases, it has been claimed that . the women's disabilities meant they did not have the capacity to enter . into a sexual relationship or consent to marry . The second man, who is in his 30s, married a woman, also in her 30s in a Muslim ceremony in late 2011 about six weeks after his application to stay in the UK was refused by immigration authorities. An anonymous informant had called to tell officials that the woman's stepfather had received £20,000 'in consideration' of that marriage. The woman became pregnant 'almost immediately' and gave birth to a son in the summer of 2012. The man is now demanding to stay in the UK, basing his claim on his right to family life enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. But in both cases, it has been claimed that the women's disabilities meant they did not have the capacity to consent to marriage. Details have emerged in written rulings published on a legal website following separate hearings in the Court of Protection in London. Judges said no-one involved in either case could be named. In the first case, a local authority had asked Mr Justice Keehan to make rulings about whether the teenager had the mental capacity to make decisions about her life - including the capacity to decide about entering into a 'contract of marriage'. Mr Justice Keehan concluded that one of the . women had the capacity to consent to sexual relations but said she did . not have the capacity to enter into a marriage contact . He said social workers became aware that she had begun a relationship with a Pakistani man in his 20s. Local authority officials and police had warned that the man might commit an offence because the woman was unlikely to have the capacity to consent to sex and marriage. Nevertheless the couple had 'entered into a purported Islamic marriage ceremony' at the man's home about 18 months ago. Mr Justice Keehan said the man had arrived in the UK to study in 2009 but an application to stay was refused after an immigration tribunal concluded that he had submitted forged documents and attempted to deceive officials. 'His rights of appeal were exhausted in June 2011,' said the judge. 'It is in this context that he began a relationship with (the woman) in August 2011.' The judge said that days after the marriage ceremony the man had claimed asylum because 'he feared he would be killed by his family who disapproved of his marriage to a white British woman'. He said the man had been refused asylum and deported in August 2012. Mr Justice Keehan concluded that the woman had the capacity to consent to sexual relations but said she did not have the capacity to enter into a marriage contact. And he ruled that the wedding ceremony she had been involved in was a 'non-marriage'. In the second case, a local authority had asked Mrs Justice Parker to make decisions about whether the woman in her 30s had the capacity to consent to marriage and sexual relationships. 'A Muslim marriage, not recognised in this jurisdiction, was performed between them,' said Mrs Justice Parker. 'An anonymous informant had telephoned to state that the (woman's stepfather) had received £20,000 in consideration of the marriage.' She said six weeks earlier the man's application to stay in the UK following the expiry of a two-year student visa had been refused. He had subsequently applied for 'leave to remain on the grounds of his marriage'. The judge said 'immigration proceedings' were 'as yet unresolved'. The judge concluded that the woman lacked the capacity to consent to sexual relations and lacked 'sufficient understanding' to consent to marriage. Mrs Justice Parker said the man was basing a claim to remain in the UK on his right to family life enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. 'The reality is that he is now relying on his married and fatherhood ... in support of his claim to remain,' said the judge. 'So, the reality is that whatever his original motivation, (the woman) is being used.' She added: '(The man's) position is bound to be self- serving.' Mrs Justice Parker said the case had been about the woman - not her son. She was told that man wanted stay in England with the baby. She said plans for the little boy's care would need 'rigorous evaluation'.","Both women were married in Muslim ceremonies .

Relatives of a 13-year-old girl who was declared brain dead after complications from a tonsillectomy are debating whether to accept the aid of nursing homes and outside groups that have proposed moving the child so she can be kept on life support, a family lawyer said on Thursday. A religious group that has a facility in New York is among the organizations that have offered to care for Jahi McGrath, said the lawyer, Christopher Dolan. He declined to identify those making the offers but described them as 'people who are firmly committed to the concept of life.' 'Offers are coming in, and there's a real demonstration of support,' Dolan said, adding that strangers have been prompted to contact the family by publicity surrounding Jahi's case and her mother's fight to keep Children's Hospital Oakland from removing the ventilator and IV fluids that are keeping the girl's body functioning. Jahi McMath's family are debating whether to accept the aid of nursing homes and outside groups that have proposed moving the child so she can be kept on life support . Among the factors relatives will be weighing are the potential costs of ongoing specialized care out-of-state and whether any of them would be able to go and stay with Jahi, Dolan said. The family also is discussing if it should accept the opinions of doctors who say Jahi has no chance of recovering, or if it should appeal a judge's decision that allows the hospital to take her off life support Monday, he said. 'They are going to start having those discussions as a family today,' Dolan told the Oakland Tribune on Thursday morning. 'They are very difficult, heart-wrenching decisions, obviously, and they need time among themselves to figure out what they're going to do. They'll come to those decisions in their own time.'

A Jewish woman saved nearly 70 years ago from a Nazi concentration camp has finally met the man that set her free. Marsha Kreuzman, 90, and living in New Jersey, never forgot the US Army liberated her in 1945 from Mauthausen, in Austria, and two months ago found one of her liberators by chance – an anniversary notice. The notice published in the Newark Star-Ledger celebrated Joe and Anne Barbellas 65th wedding anniversary – Joe Barbella’s unit, the 11th Armored Division liberated Mauthausen. Fast friends: Joe Barbella, 93, of Union, and Marsha Kreuzman, 90, embrace for awhile after she brought him a Christmas present to his house . She called the family in tears telling of her ordeal and gratitude, and the rest was history. ‘From the first day I was liberated, I wanted to thank them, but I didn’t know who to thank,’ she told the Star Ledger during a recent interview. Ms Kreuzman weighed only 68 pounds when an American soldier picked her up and carried her to safety, she recalled – by that point her mother, father and brother had already died or been killed. She ended up in Mauthausen after her family was taken from a Jewish ghetto in Krakow, Poland. The innocent girl felt as if death was calling, that she had no hope. Guards beat her with a wet horse’s whip for not finishing a road – the scars are still visible. 'He deserves to be honored': Ms Kreutzman brought Mr Barbarella a Christmas gift because she says he's a hero . She was hung upside down on a door for hours once for trying to visit her brother. Her father was executed along with dozens of others while she was forced to watch. Her brother was then sent to the notorious Auschwitz concentration camp where German SS killed him in January, 1945. She was shuttled among a few camps before ending up a broken girl with all hope lost at Muathausen. Salvation: Liberated prisoners in the Mauthausen concentration camp near Linz, Austria, give rousing welcome may 6, 1945 to Cavalrymen of the 11th Armored Division of the US Army . By the time Joe Barbarella and his unit arrived in May, the prisoners were in dire straits. ‘When we got there, we saw all these people were skin and bones,’ he told the paper. A soldier walked up to Ms Kreuzman, picked her up and said ‘you’re free.’ She searched for that soldier for 68 years. ‘I always look for liberators,’ she told the paper. ‘I wasn’t giving up.’ As it is today:  Stones of remembrance are pictured earlier this year on the main square of former concentration camp Mauthausen . The Barbarella’s wedding announcement brought everything full-circle. ‘A veteran of World War II, Joseph served in the 11th Armored Division which liberated the Mauthausen concentration camp,’ said the announcement. Ms Kreuzman called the Barbarellas the next day, a meeting was arranged for later that month. She quickly praised Joe Barbarella as a hero, but he deferred, telling the paper ‘I’m just an ordinary solider.’ They have become good friends, she even brought him a Christmas present because ‘he deserves to be honoured.’","Marsha Kreuzman was 12-years-old and weighed only 68 pounds when freed from Mauthuasen .

On Christmas Eve, a father of two died after heading into a river to rescue his Labrador while his family were shopping. Primary school teacher Nick Mutton, 46, was with his family at an Asda in Newton Abbot, Devon, getting last-minute supplies for Christmas, when his dog ventured into the river near to the store. He dived into the freezing water in a bid to save his pet, but soon got into difficulty. Three police officers and several firefighters managed to drag him from the water, before taking him to hospital, where he later died. At the time, resident Martin Bignel tweeted that the river, which runs at the end of his road, had been 'about 7ft higher than usual' following stormy weather and persistent rainfall.

With its dark panelled walls and shelves crammed with books, there are hardly any clues to suggest this cosy study isn't at the heart of Oxford University and its dreaming spires. But the seemingly old-fashioned room has only just been installed at Ashton Sixth Form College in Greater Manchester to encourage its students to set their sights on the UK’s top universities. A room at the college has been completely made-over to resemble an Oxford Don's study as part of a new initiative launched this year to send more state pupils from the area to Oxford and Cambridge. Spot the difference: The replica at Ashton Sixth Form College (left) bears more than a passing resemblance to a real Oxford University don's study area (right) Inspiring: The make-over is part of an initiative to send more state pupils to top universities . Lecturers from Oxford’s Pembroke College and leading local universities, including Manchester, will travel to Ashton Sixth Form College to hold lectures and tutorials with A-level students. They will also coach them in the daunting admission process. College principal Janet Nevins, herself an Oxford graduate, said that for too long elite universities had recruited disproportionately from private schools. She said: 'As someone totally committed to the furthering of academic skills and a love of learning, I am so pleased that we have been chosen.' Ms Nevins added: 'I think we are doing something really quite special here.' Pembroke College tutors, including Dr Peter Claus (pictured), will hold lectures at the College . The idea that Oxbridge-esque surroundings may help to inspire pupils from poorer backgrounds is nothing new. In 2012, Brooke House Sixth Form College in Hackney spent £10,000 building a room based on that of an Oxford don in order to put students at ease during the interview process. A-level students at the college found themselves surrounded by leather bound books in the room, and elaborate statues were placed outside the windows to mimic top universities' ornate gardens. The Brook House scheme was another partnership with Pembroke College and has seen a number of tutors hold seminars designed to increase pupils understanding of what to expect at a top university. Headmaster of Brooke House, Ken Warman, said: 'If you go to Oxford it is a daunting experience. But if our students have already done it, they will be much more able to cope without being thrown by the unfamiliar surroundings. 'The pupils here really like it and are wowed every time they step inside because it’s something different to what they usually see, especially with all the books around the room and the cosy atmosphere.' The room is also used for teaching, with tutors from Pembroke college holding seminars. Students can apply for Easter and summer schools to help with Oxford interviews, and visit the university to get used to the environment.

Mr Warman added: 'One or two of our . pupils go to Oxford every year for interviews. Last year, one attended . Oxford and another went to Cambridge. 'We spoke to former pupils who had been intimidated by going to the Oxbridge interviews and they helped us with the design. 'In total, including the building work, the whole project cost about £10,000 but we think it’s worth it.' Figures from Brooke College reveal 319 students went to university in 2011, with 75 per cent of them the first in their family to do so.","Ashton Sixth Form College's Oxbridge make-over designed to inspire pupils .

He said: 'We promised ourselves not to name any pigs as we knew that occasionally some would have to go to the butcher, but we haven't managed to do that. 'The pigs are much more intelligent than people appreciate so it's hard not to build a relationship with them. 'As Churchill said, ""Cats look down on you, dogs look up to you, but pigs look you straight in the eye!"" 'All pigs love to have their tummies stroked, but the Mangalitsas especially so.

Mangalitsa pigs are much hardier than normal pigs and moult in the summer to prevent them getting too hot . The sheep-pig used to be a common sight in Lincolnshire and was shorn once a year to make sweaters, but it became extinct in Britain in 1972. In the early 1900s, many Lincolnshire curly coats were sold to Austria and Hungary where they were crossed with the Mangalitsa, creating the Lincolista. Three years ago, this cross-breed were found thriving in Austria and a small number were brought back to create a herd in Britain. They are worth around £1,000, five times the value of an ordinary pig and are fond of fruit and the odd tipple. Mangalitsa pigs are much hardier than normal pigs and moult in the summer to prevent them getting too hot. Unlike normal commercial pigs, they do not get sunburnt. Hair from the pigs is particularly popular in the U.S. as it retains air bubbles under water, making it ideal for tying fishing flies. They come in three colours, bright red, blonde and black with a cream stomach and they are lardier than most breeds, making them perfect for Parma ham-style cuts.","Mangalitsa is rare breed of pig .

Relentless rains pounding Hawaii’s ‘Big Island’ led to a truck being swallowed Monday in a sinkhole. Velma Deluz was driving to work around 5:30am when the road opened up and swallowed her truck whole – she fortunately escaped without any serious injury. The island received almost half a foot of rain from the storm. Officials told local media the freak accident likely happened because the culvert the section of road was paved over likely shifted, causing the road to collapse. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Ms Deluz told KHNL about her terrifying plunge. ‘When I made the turn, the road just sucked me right in,’ she told the station. ‘I fell in and I tried to climb out the window because [the truck] fell on its side.’ The lucky woman climbed up out of the sinkhole and to safety before another car drove by, she said she suffered only minor rib injuries and is thankful to be alive. Hawaii County Civil Defense spokesperson Darryl Oliveira blamed the collapse on a storm battering the island for most of Monday.

It's been drier than normal and now we're having heavier than normal rainfall.’ More than five-and-a-half inches was recorded Monday at Hilo Airport, almost a full inch more than the previous record set more than 60 years ago.","Hawaii's 'Big island' received almost six inches of rain Monday .

In the dock: Shareholders hope the legal tussle will force Goodwin to answer for his disastrous stewardship of RBS . Fred Goodwin and his former entourage at Royal Bank of Scotland have been served with a £4bn lawsuit by shareholders. Herbert Smith – the law firm representing both the bank and former directors, including Goodwin – received court papers marking the beginning of a civil suit today. RBS shareholders are hoping the legal tussle will put Goodwin in the dock for the first time since the financial crisis, forcing him to answer for his disastrous stewardship of RBS. Some 100 institutions and 12,000 private shareholders have signed up to the RBoS Action Group suit, which claims investors were misled into taking part in the bank’s disastrous 2008 rights issue. The bank encouraged investors to buy £12bn of shares, which plummeted in value when the bank flirted with collapse, before being rescued with £45.5bn of taxpayers’ money just months later. Lawyers at Bird & Bird will argue that information given to investors billed the cash call as a ‘capital strengthening exercise’ rather than an emergency effort to raise money. They are understood to believe their claim is different from two failed cases against RBS in the US. Shares in RBS were down 1 per cent or 3.45p at 280.25p in late morning trading. A spokesman for the action group said: 'Today represents a giant step forward for the many thousands of ordinary people who lost money as the result of inexcusable actions taken by banks and their directors in the financial crisis. 'Now, for the first time, some of these directors will have to answer for their actions in a British court.' RBOS said its claim was lodged with the taxpayer-payer backed bank and in London's High Court today. Alongside Goodwin, the group is also starting proceedings against former RBS chairman Tom McKillop, former investment bank boss Johnny Cameron and ex-finance director Guy Whittaker. The claim is the second in recent days to be lodged against RBS after a group of 21 claimants launched a multimillion-pound lawsuit last week, also over its 2008 cash call. The RBOS claim alleges the bank's directors 'sought to mislead shareholders by misrepresenting the underlying strength of the bank and omitting critical information from the 2008 rights issue prospectus'. As a result, it argues the 81 per cent-state-owned bank is liable for losses sustained by investors who participated. RBS declined to comment.","Legal tussle could put Goodwin in the dock for first time since bank crisis .

A Maine man stands accused of beating his high school sweetheart wife to death on Christmas Day. Hilary Saenz, 29, was found dead by paramedics after husband Christopher Saenz, 30, called them to their home Christmas Day. The couple married in their teens and have two children together - they found their mother's lifeless body. One neighbor told a local television station the violent man has a drug problem that likely led to the woman’s murder. Happier times: Hilary and Chris Saenz flash smiles in a recent picture . A family shattered: Ms Saenz is dead, her husband sits in jail and their two children are with relatives . The children stayed at a neighbor's house while paramedics rushed to the Ellsworth home only to find the young mother dead, according to Bangor Daily. Christmas will never be the same for that poor 12-year-old girl and her eight-year-old brother. A subsequent autopsy found that Ms Saenz died from blunt force trauma, the paper said. Mr Saenz was arrested and charged with murder, his children taken to relatives. A long-time friend and neighbour of the couple told WLBZ of the man’s issues. ‘He struggled with, I guess, drugs his whole life,’ Chris Card told the station. ‘She never did anything like that – she didn’t drink, she didn’t smoke – and he took advantage of that. ‘She just kept taking him back.’ House of horrors: Ms Saenz was beaten to death in her home by her husband on Christmas Day, police say . A great loss: Ms Saenz was said to be a great mother, hard worker and always happy person . Mr Card described Ms Saenz as ‘a super mom… who always had a smile.’ The devoted woman worked two jobs to support her family, he added. ‘I spoke to quite a few people, and the people who know him know what happened,’ said Mr Card, ‘we all know what happened.’ A Facebook page set up as a tribute to Ms Saenz is filled with an outpouring of grief for the murdered mother. 'No words can express my heartfelt sympathy for those that are left behind,' wrote one person. Heartbroken: Ms Saenz's devastated brother wrote a poem for his sister that was posted to her tribute page . A poem written by Ms Saenz's brother Chance was also posted. ''Cause there's holes in the floor of heaven and her tears are pourin down that's how you know she's watchin, wishing she could be here now. and sometimes if your lonely, just remember she can see,there's holes in the floor of heaven, and she's watchin over you and me.' Coworkers of hers at a local Walmart also posted condolences. 'My heart and my prayers are with the family through this terrible tragic act. Hillary was such a sweetheart. I worked with her at walmart. always had a smile on her face and always there to help when even needed.' Mr Saenz is due in court sometime this week, a remembrance service will be held Friday for his dead wife.","Cops say Christopher Saenz, 30, beat wife Hillary Saenz, 29, to death on Christmas Day in their Ellsworth, Maine home .

'Client': Eliot Spitzer, pictured, enjoyed violence in the bedroom, pinning a former call girl to a bed and clutching at her throat until she struggled to breathe, she claims . Eliot Spitzer lusted after violence in the bedroom, pinning a former call girl to a bed and clutching at her throat until she struggled to breathe in a kinky role play, the ex-hooker claims. In a new explosive book, Rebecca Woodard tells of the alleged tryst with the politician who she claims lusted after rough and tumble, forcing her to pretend she had just taken a self-defense class in the posh, Murray Hill apartment they had just met for their tawdry tryst at. In graphic detail, the $1,500 hooker describes how Spitzer pretended to test her karate skills, exclaiming, 'Well, then, let's see if you learned anything,' before pouncing on her. 'The more struggle there was, the more he was into it,' the blonde writes in the book, 'Call Girl Confidential,' according to the New York Post. 'When he grabbed my throat, that was too much.' Spitzer vehemently denies the claims. 'This is an old story, a complete fabrication, that is unequivocally untrue,' his spokeswoman, Lisa Linden, told MailOnline on Sunday. 'As the NY Times and NY law enforcement have already debunked the lies in this book, anyone who reprints it is knowingly repeating falsehoods. Eliot has no ties whatsoever to the person in question.' Woodard, who writes for Simon & Schuster under the alias 'Rebecca Kade,' claims she worked for two notorious New York madams and eventually became a police informant, helping prosecutors take down Anna Gristina, known as the 'Soccer Mom Madam.' Rebecca Woodard has recalled acting out the violent fantasies of former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer. The former call-girl claims Spitzer would enjoy strangling her and wrestling her before they had sex in her new book, Call Girl Confidential . Tell-all: Woodard wrote the book, Call Girl Confidential pictured, under the alias 'Rebecca Kade' 'He wasn't squeezing,' Woodard . recalls of the then-governor's bedroom antics, according to The Post. 'He was pushing down. I was on my back. I don't know if he was trying to . really hurt me, but he was... 'I was nervous. I was worried. This is not OK, I thought... 'It got rough. And then he put his . hands around my throat, strangling me. He wasn't pretending to be a . rapist. But he was like an attacker.' She said she still had her lingerie on but he was naked and aroused at the time. 'I thought, What do I do to get this part over with? What can I do? At some point, we have to get down to having sex and move on,' she recalls. Woodard does not mention whether Spitzer kept his calf-length black socks on - which he notoriously did in other encounters with prostitutes. Woodard claims she was warned by the madam who booked the appointment that the at first anonymous client was 'important,' 'definitely wanted a struggle' and that 'mainstream intercourse' wouldn't be enough. The now 37-year-old who describes herself as having a 'slim waist' and 'natural breasts' waited for the exploit to begin at an apartment in the Corinthian on Manhattan's East 38th Street. Arriving in a shirt and tie, Spitzer told her he didn't want to use a condom, she writes in the book, but she replied that was 'not negotiable.' Scene: The now 37-year-old who describes herself as having a 'slim waist' and 'natural breasts' claims to have met Spitzer at the Corinthian, pictured, on Manhattan's East 38th Street .

She said she was in charge at first but he gained control. 'It was all about restraint and holding me down until I was nearly helpless. He really put on a lot of pressure, pinning me to the bed,' she writes. 'It takes a lot to scare me. I've been through a lot. But at this point I was starting to get worried...' Woodard writes that he ignored her when she begged him to stop and never said 'I'm sorry' or 'Are you OK?'

The body of a man found washed ashore in San Francisco last month has been identified as that of a Brazilian man who has been missing since October. Paolo Netto, 22, made several frantic phone calls on the evening of October 28, saying there were people following him. A badly decomposed body washed up at McCovey Cove on November 9. Police identified it as that of Netto on Friday. Deceased: Paolo Netto, a Brazilian art student disappeared in October . Followed: Netto's family distributed missing person posters in their search for the student after he called saying he was being followed . Netto was an art student living in Los Angeles. He had made the trip to San Francisco to look at art schools in the city. He arrived in San Francisco on Friday 25 October. He checked into the Adelaide hostel, planning to stay the weekend in the city. He spoke to his family on the Saturday night, telling them he would be taking a Greyhound bus back to LA on Sunday. But he never caught the bus he was booked on. CBS reports that Netto called his sister Ana Reis in Brazil on the night of Monday 28 October. 'He said, ""Ana, I’m in trouble. There are some people following me and I need help. Call the police. Call a taxi. Send someone to find me,""' she said. 'He sounded terrified, afraid, frightened.' Desperate search: His sister Ana last spoke to him on the night he went missing, when he called to say he was being followed . Last location: Netto was near 505 Shotwell Street when he made the frantic call to his sister . She called the San Francisco police from Brazil but when officers arrived on the 500 block of Shotwell St where Netto had been, there was no one there. According to KTVU, Netto also called his Los Angeles friend and classmate Kevin Viriato. 'It was like, ""Kevin, please please help me, please help me, please help me,""' recalled Viriato to KTVU. He urged Netto to call authorities. 'I told him, ""If you're in trouble, call the police, they're the best people to help you."" He's like ""Oh, oh, oh,"" then he hung up.' Reis says San Francisco police told her that Netto also called emergency services, but they have not released the 911 recording. Shortly after his disappearance, an unidentified man used Netto's credit card at a McDonald's at 16th St and Mission. Police have released security footage of the man and are asking anyone with knowledge of his identity to contact them. Suspicious: Police have released this image of a man who was caught on camera using Netto's credit card days after his disappearance . Identified: Police confirmed Friday that a body washed ashore in San Francisco in November was Netto's . Following his disappearance, Netto's family flew to San Francisco from their home in Rio Verde to look for him, putting up posters in the Tenderloin and Mission neighborhoods. A corpse washed ashore in McCovey Cove on November 9, but police were unable to identify the badly decomposed body. The San Francisco Medical Examiner said Friday that following the results of the autopsy, the body has been identified as that of Netto. Authorities have not yet disclosed how Netto died.

Senior judges are to ban the secret jailing of defendants for contempt of court, the Daily Mail can reveal. The decision comes after emergency talks over the way a woman was given a prison sentence for trying to take her father out of a care home. Wanda Maddocks, 50, was handed a five-month jail term by the Court of Protection in her absence – and without being represented by a lawyer. Shock: Wanda Maddocks, left, was jailed 'in secret' by the Court of Protection for trying to remove her father John, right, from a care home . New instructions for judges will lay down that no one should be sentenced to prison for contempt of court behind closed doors. A judge ruled that Miss Maddocks’ efforts to remove her 80-year-old father from the care home where she believed his life was in danger amounted to wilful defiance of the court. The sentence was imposed by Judge Martin Cardinal at the Court of Protection in Birmingham without naming any of those involved. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling asked for a review into the dealings of the Court of Protection following the Mail's highlighting of the Maddocks case . No record of his ruling was published, . and secrecy rules forbade anyone to name Miss Maddocks, her father, the . local council that asked for her to be imprisoned or the social worker . who gave evidence against her. Judge . Cardinal opened his court to the public for the sentencing, but the . unlocking of the courtroom doors was announced  only to passers-by who . happened to be in the corridor outside. The . Mail’s report of the Maddocks case provoked a major row over the Court . of Protection, which decides on the affairs of individuals too ill to . make decisions for themselves. The Court habitually sits in secret and . few of its hearings have ever been subjected to public scrutiny. The depth of political concern became clear yesterday when it emerged that Justice Secretary Chris Grayling wrote to Sir James Munby, the judge in charge of family justice, to ask him to include the Court of Protection in a review currently under way into the workings of the family courts. The family courts – which handle cases of divorce and child custody, and which rule when children are taken into care or put up for adoption – are rarely open to the public and usually publish only anonymous details of judgements. Sir James is currently exploring ways to make them more open. The talks on the Maddocks  case and secret imprisonment involved both Sir James, who is head of the Family Division of the High Court, and Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, who is the head of the judiciary. Their decision to ban secret sentencing for contempt was taken before Sir James received the  Grayling letter. Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice (left) and Sir James Munby , the head of the Family Division of the High Court (right) have decided to ban secret sentencing for contempt cases . Judge Cardinal sentenced Miss Maddocks last August after hearing that she had repeatedly broken orders not to interfere with her father’s life at the care home. He found she had helped take her father to a court hearing and had also taken him to see a solicitor; that she had tried to publicise the case; had left offensive messages for social workers; and that she had given the 80-year-old former painter and decorator a wooden cross to ward off evil at his care home. The judge said she had ‘the attitude of someone who is simply not going to obey court orders’. Miss Maddocks was arrested 11 days after her sentencing by police and court officials who waited for her when she visited the care home. She has said she was assaulted in Foston Hall prison in Derby by a fellow inmate who would  not believe she had not committed a serious crime or had a public criminal trial. Judge Cardinal, left, also imposed a suspended prison sentence on Miss Maddocks' brother Ivan, right . She served six weeks before being released after apologising to Judge Cardinal. The judge also imposed a two-month suspended sentence for contempt on Miss Maddocks’ brother Ivan for his role in taking their father to a court hearing and to see a Birmingham lawyer. The suspended sentence, which was also imposed in secret, was handed down at a separate hearing in July. Last week, after the Mail learned of the case, Judge Cardinal agreed that Miss Maddocks and her brother could be named, along with the council, Stoke-on-Trent. The judgment in which sentence was handed down was also published for the first time. Miss Maddocks’ father John died in January. Miss Maddocks is thought to be the first person imprisoned by the Court of Protection. However no one can be certain because of the secrecy under which the court regularly works. Family courts also have powers to sentence those who fail to obey court rulings with imprisonment. However the power is rarely used, not least because in family separation cases judges believe that to jail a mother who defies a court would harm her children. One notable recent case of a family court imprisonment involved fixer to the rich Scot Young, jailed for six months by a High Court judge in January for persistent failure to account during his divorce case for the disappearance of his £400million fortune. The sentencing decision was made in open court. Current civil procedure rules which govern the operation of the courts say that anyone sentenced to jail should be named. Sir James Munby yesterday replied to Mr Grayling to say he would consider the Justice Secretary’s letter about the Court of Protection. Sir James is expected to wait before sending a more detailed response.","New rules for judges after the Mail revealed Wanda Maddocks case .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . UPDATED: . 11:30 EST, 22 October 2011 . A man who owns a website claiming to 'name and shame' allegedly underperforming solicitors has lost his slander action against the chief executive of Law Society - after claiming his own reputation had been damaged. Rick Kordowski had sued Desmond Hudson over a brief exchange between Mr Hudson and Professor John Flood in which methods used by Mr Kordowski - who runs the Solicitors From Hell website - were described 'criminal'. The comment was made as Mr Hudson and Professor Flood were leaving the BBC studios in July this year after taking part in Radio 4's You and Yours. Rick Kordowski runs the Solicitors From Hell website, which 'names and shames' allegedly underperforming solicitors . The conversation, as posted by Prof Flood on his weblog, went: 'As I came out of the BBC yesterday with Des Hudson, the chief executive of the Law Society, he said Rick Kordowski was a criminal. I reminded Des that the police didn't think so. He wasn't happy.' Mr Hudson's case was that he did not say Mr Kordowski was a criminal but told Prof Flood that Mr Kordowski's methods of collecting payment to remove comments from the website amounted to criminal behaviour. His defence to the claim at London's High Court also included a plea of justification. Mr Kordowski, who had originally claimed £1 million damages, then applied for summary judgment in his favour and a declaration that Mr Hudson's statement was false and defamatory plus an apology and £10,000. Striking out the claim as an abuse of process, Mr Justice Tugendhat said it was not a case for summary judgment as there was a conflict of evidence and it was impossible for him to say that the defence had no real prospect of success. He added that, although the allegation of criminality was in principle very serious, the alleged wrong in the present case was of a relatively low level of seriousness. Mr Kordowski lost his slander action against Desmond Hudson (pictured), chief executive of the Law Society . He concluded that it would not be just to allow the case to proceed, given that the words complained of were spoken to a single person and that there was no evidence of any real or substantial harm to Mr Kordowski. Mr Kordowski, who claims he is bankrupt, now faces a £14,000 costs bill. It is not the first time Mr Kordowski has appeared in the press. Last year a female solicitor who discovered defamatory postings about herself on the Solicitors From Hell website won her battle to have the allegations removed from the site. Anna Mazzola, a solicitor with London law firm Hickman Rose, won the rare ‘interim injunction’ against Rick Kordowski, who runs the website. Mr Justice Edwards-Stewart granted the order against Mr Kordowski in the High Court following an application by barrister Guy Vassall-Adams who represented Ms Mazzola. Mr Vassall-Adams argued that the . material about Ms Mazzola on the website - www.solicitorsfromhell.co.uk - . was undoubtedly defamatory and that there were no grounds that it might . be true. Mr Kordowski had not pleaded a proper . justification defence, or produced evidence to support the allegations, . but had simply argued that they might be true, and there was also . evidence of his intention to continue publishing the defamatory . material, Mr Vassall-Adams said. The barrister explained that . Solicitors From Hell was a ‘grievance website’ which allowed members of . the public to post anonymous complaints about solicitors, and he said . that Mr Kordowski had published serious defamatory allegations without . checking their truth or accuracy. He added that Mr Kordowski, who . represented himself in court, asked for payment from solicitors in . return for removing articles from the website. Postings: The homepage of the Solicitors From Hell website, which urges people to name and shame solicitors publicly . Similarly, in a another case last . June, solicitor Scott Eason of Eason Law in the North East, brought a . libel action against Mr Kordowski. Mr Eason said he launched his libel . action because he felt so strongly about the allegations published and . could not allow them to remain on the internet. Mr Kordowski had refused to take the . allegations down without payment, Eason said, adding: 'As a matter of . principle, I refused to pay Mr Kordowski any money and he left me with . no option but to issue libel proceedings against him.' Subsequently Mr Kordowski removed the . material from his website, sent Mr Eason a personal apology, and gave an . undertaking not to re-publish the allegations.","Rick Kordowski's methods described as 'criminal'

Ukip now has 32,500 members – up from 19,500 last January. Nigel Farage’s party has been advancing in the polls and has been tipped to beat the Conservatives in the European elections to be held in May. Conservative constituency membership has almost halved since David Cameron became leader in 2005 – from 253,600 to just 134,000. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has hailed a rise of two thirds in his party's membership in the past 12 months . Nigel Farage's eurosceptic party said it was finishing 2013 with 32,500 members - up from 19,500 at the start of a year which has seen its profile rise significantly . Mr Farage said Ukip was re-engaging people who had given up on politics. He . added: ‘Many of our members are those who have never been a member of . any political party before, but who see that it is Ukip who is . challenging the establishment on issues such as open-door immigration, . grammar schools and green taxes.’ If . Ukip has a similar surge in membership over the coming  year, it could . overtake the Liberal Democrats in its grassroots’ support. The number of Lib Dems is at 43,000, more than a third lower than the 65,000 it had in 2010.Support for Labour has also slipped back to 187,537, down from when Ed Miliband became leader in 2010. A UKIP supporter holds up a banner in Eastleigh ahead of the by-election to replace Chris Huhne . Ukip chairman Steve Crowther said: 'The narrative in Westminster seems to be that falling party membership is inevitable. 'Well in Ukip’s case the opposite is true: our membership is growing faster than ever. 'In May alone, the month that the council elections were held, Ukip membership went up by 2,500. We will now aim to continue that momentum and growth as we head into next year’s European Elections and the 2015 general election as well.' Mr Farage - who has predicted a political 'earthquake' in May when his party is tipped by some to win the election - said it was re-engaging people who had 'given up on politics'. 'Many of our members are those who have never been a member of any political party before but who see that it is Ukip who is challenging the establishment on issues such as open door immigration, grammar schools and green taxes.'","Eurosceptic party said it was finishing 2013 with 32,500 members .

West Ham face a tough task to persuade Rickie Lambert to leave Southampton. Chairman David Sullivan has moved to save his club by changing tack on their initial transfer policy and putting an offer to Southampton for the 31-year-old England striker. West Ham were planning to just bring in two strikers on loan mindful that relegation would leave them with a financial headache. Now they have opted to take a gamble and make a bid that would be attractive to Southampton and the player. Goal threat: Rickie Lambert (right) may bolster West Ham's goal-shy attacking line-up . Lambert is very settled at Southampton but, as he isn't starting every week, Sam Allardyce senses an opportunity to bring him to Upton Park with the prospect of regular football every week in the build up to the World Cup. Should Andy Carroll make his return, it could also prove an England audition for a rumbustious partnership which few defences would fancy facing. West Ham are still lining up other options in case the plan fails. They have asked about Papiss Cisse at Newcastle although that has been rebuffed but loan deals are ready to move over the next week should they get the ok on finance. They have considered Ishak Belfodil, 21, from Inter Milan but he is expected to move elsewhere. Everton's John Heitinga will be announced as a West Ham player in the next few days. Thomas Ince may yet turn down Swansea's overtures when they make a move for him this week. Manager Michael Laudrup is considering a £4million bid for the England U21 forward but Ince may yet see out his contract. Crystal Palace have also made approaches for Ince, who has been watched by Ajax and Inter Milan. Blackpool have made the 21-year-old a new contract offer but, if he goes abroad, the Championship side will get around £155,000 in compensation, as opposed to a few million if he moves in England. Snub? Blackpool forward Tom Ince may turn down Swansea's advances in the January window . Chelsea's Michael Essien could be the latest Premier League export to the MLS. The 31-year-old is ready to leave Stamford Bridge with clubs in the Middle East and across the Atlantic alerted by comments from his agent Fabien Piveteau early this week. Essien has been linked with Middlesbrough but he has grander ambitions . The west London club, who formally completed the signing of 18-year-old midfielder Bertrand Traore on Wednesday, are monitoring Lokeren winger Ayanda Patosi but are unsure about a bid as the player looks a few years short of development. The 21-year-old South African has impressed scouts but seems more likely to move to Holland with Ajax among his potential suitors. Frozen out: Michael Essien has spent much of this season on the bench for Chelsea . Manchester City are continuing to develop their youth ranks and will hold talks with another Nigerian teenager on Thursday. Chidibere Nwakali is from the Shuttle Sports Academy in Lagos and is a teammate of striker Kelechi Iheanacho from Nigeria's U17 World Cup squad. Nwakali is a left-sided midfielder who can also play behind the striker or as a left-back. He is due to fly to England with his parents tomorrow for talks in the hope of concluding a dream transfer to City. Iheanacho's deal with City now looks back on after hitting a hitch, seemingly over money, last week.African football website MTNFootball.com reported: 'Both the agents in the US and those in London are now co-operating to get visas to the UK for the Iheanachos so that they meet with Manchester City officials on the contract they have signed. You could therefore say the transfer is back on track.' Winning feeling: Manchester City, who are after 17-year-old Nigerian Chidibere Nwakali, beat Swansea 3-2 with Aleksandar Kolarov (right) scoring the third . Issues to be discussed would include the January 2015 payments to the player, his father and the Taye Football Academy in Owerri. The Iheanachos recently signed for City in Madrid, Spain, after Kelechi passed a medical attended by City’s chief scout Gary Worthington. However, when they discovered they would not be paid immediately due to his age, they explored the possibilities of reviving interest at Porto. There were rumours too that Iheanacho’s US-based agent tried to offer the 17-year-old to Spanish La Liga club Getafe. Newcastle have made an enquiry for St Etienne defender Nathan Dekoke. The 17-year-old has also been a target for Fulham. The France U18 star can play at centre half and full back and Newcastle may make an offer this week. They are continuing to work the French market with success and, as reported previously in Sportsmail, are ready to have another go for Lyon striker Bafetimbi Gomis who is out of contract in the summer and attracting interest from Marseille and Crystal Palace. On his way? Bafetimbi Gomis could be the latest France star to sign for North East club Newcastle . Newcastle defender Steven Taylor is still keen to get back playing top-level football and is looking to leave St James' Park on loan. The 27-year-old defender has not figured since being sent off against Manchester City in August and has been urged to wait for his chance by manager Alan Pardew but although he could figure in the FA Cup this weekend, his patience could run out if the situation continues. Even though Taylor is a supporter of the club, he is prepared to leave on loan to revive his career. Meanwhile, Newcastle winger Sylvain Marveaux is wanted by Greek side Olympiacos. Which . Premier League star is looking to leave the country after running into . trouble with too many female friends? The powerful midfielder is a . popular figure at his club in more ways than one. Although not married, . he has three regular girlfriends on the go and is keen for a fresh . start. Burnley's opening bid for Brighton striker Ashley Barnes could trigger a reaction from their rivals. The Championship promotion chasers want cover with Danny Ings subject of interest from Premier League clubs. Barnes, 24, is out of contract in the summer and is also wanted by League One Wolves but if a deal is agreed with Burnley other Championship sides may yet come in with rival bids and better wages. Wolves manager Kenny Jackett would like to team Barnes with Bradford City's £3m-rated striker Nahki Wells. Burnley and Wolves also enquired about Chelsea's Patrick Bamford who is to join Derby County on loan and Coventry City's Leon Clarke. Celtic are keen on Wolves striker Leigh Griffiths but have other options also. Manager Neil Lennon is also poised to make an offer for Huddersfield Town midfielder Oliver Norwood, formerly of Manchester United, but Town will not sell cheaply . Cover: Ashley Barnes could fill in for Danny Ings if Burnley are successful in their bid for the Brighton man . Hull face surprising competition for Celtic striker Georgios Samaras in the shape of Atletico Madrid. Steve Bruce remains keen on Manchester United's Nick Powell also as do Swansea and is continuing to monitor developments with Shane Long and the more expensive target, Steven Fletcher of Sunderland. In demand: Georgios Samaras is sought after by both Hull City and, surprisingly, Atletico Madrid . Crystal Palace are hoping to tie up a deal for Blackburn Rovers defender Scott Dann amid talk he is leaving his long-time agent. Blackburn are keen to lose Dann's estimated £35,000 a week wages and have other eyes on other defenders. The return of Lucas Neill, who has been training with the club, on a short term deal has not been ruled out. Blackburn also hope to complete a permanent deal for Cardiff striker Rudy Gestede. Dann the man: Crystal Palace are lining up the Blackburn defender to help in their relegation battle . Fulham are awaiting a response over their enquiry for 6ft 7in Danish striker Simon Makienok. Crystal Palace and Stoke have also watched the Brondby striker, who is available for £3.5million, but have yet to follow up with a bid. The 23-year-old scored six goals in 12 games last season and turned down a move to Russian side Terek Grozny. Fancy it?

David Cameron must reimpose controls on Bulgarian and Romanian migrants or risk social unrest, senior Tories demanded last night. In a letter to the Prime Minister, seen by the Daily Mail, 90 activists and constituency chairmen demanded that he tear up plans to end transitional controls on January 1, saying the Government's position was untenable. In a challenge to Mr Cameron's authority, the Conservative Grassroots group rubbishes claims by ministers that the Government is powerless to prevent what they call a 'destabilising wave of mass immigration'. Romanian immigrants huddle around Marble Arch in London as a mass influx of Romanians is expected as the new year approaches . They demand that the Prime Minister uses a little-known clause in European Union law which allows governments to continue with border controls if their country is 'undergoing or foresees serious labour market disturbances'. The loophole – known as a 'safeguard clause' – was used by Spain in 2011 to reimpose controls on Romanian migrants at a time when youth unemployment was running at 50 per cent. The activists also call on Mr Cameron to stage an 'emergency' recall of Parliament to pass an amendment to the Immigration Bill, tabled by Tory MP Nigel Mills and supported by 70 Conservative MPs, to continue the restrictions on new arrivals from Romania and Bulgaria after Wednesday. The attack from the grassroots comes as a previously secret report published yesterday revealed that Bulgarians and Romanians will flock to Britain in far greater numbers than forecast as our economy races ahead of the rest of Europe. The report by the University of Reading – which was commissioned by 74 councils and paid for by the Home Office – warns that after immigration controls are lifted this week, Britons could find their jobs squeezed in some areas. The report, released under Freedom of Information laws, also predicts community tensions could rise as the new wave of migrants fight for work with other Eastern Europeans who have been settled in Britain for a decade. Activists are demanding that the Prime Minister uses a little-known clause in European Union law which allows governments to continue with border controls if their country is 'undergoing or foresees serious labour market disturbances' In the letter to Mr Cameron, Conservative Grassroots chairman Robert Woollard says that action to strip the new arrivals of full working rights is 'a matter of economic necessity'. He warns: 'How are local authorities going to be able to support unrestricted new immigrant individuals and entire families without additional financial support or increased local taxation? The fiscal position is simply untenable, irrational and grossly unfair – and may lead to social unrest.' He demands that transitional controls are extended until 2018, the year after Mr Cameron has promised an in-out referendum on Britain's relationship with Brussels. Describing the Government's position that it cannot act as 'perplexing', the letter continues: 'Long-term UK youth unemployment – at 21 per cent – is the third highest within EU & OECD countries. 'As such it is only logical for the UK – invoking the Spanish example of “exceptional circumstances” – to unilaterally exercise its opt-out on immigration matters under the Lisbon Treaty and extend the original restrictions to 2018 to allow the UK economy the space and time to reverse the long-term high youth unemployment trend.' Attacking the Government's refusal to budge, the letter continues: 'You must be aware that this is an untenable political position given the widespread opposition of the British people – from all walks of life including ethnic minorities. 'It is also an unsustainable economic position in view of the huge pressure already placed on public services at a time when the country is still facing acute challenges within the economy.' Conservative Grassroots say they took advice from European lawyers. They admit that an indefinite ban may not stand the scrutiny of the European Court, but a time-limited ban would 'almost certainly' survive any legal challenge given the Spanish precedent. Mr Mills told the Mail: 'I've spoken to the Conservative Grassroots lawyers. They believe there is a precedent here – the job market is not strong enough to sustain a whole load of new arrivals. I hope all this pressure on the Prime Minister will mean the Government brings forward further measures.' Downing Street refused to comment on the letter, but a senior Tory source said the Conservatives had sustained the transitional controls on Romania and Bulgarians as long as they could and were already limiting EU migrants' access to benefits and protecting public services.","90 activists and constituency chairmen demand that PM tear up plans .

Monica Lewinsky’s clothing has gained national attention in the past- with her semen-stained blue dress playing a role in the Clinton sex scandal- but now it is her lingerie that is up for sale. A collection of her old clothes, handwritten notes, and gifts signed pictures of former President Clinton are now up for sale for thousands of dollars. Before she became notorious for her sexual relationship with President Clinton, Lewinsky also had an affair with her married former high school drama teacher Andy Bleiler. The whole lot: A collection of letters, cards and gifts that Lewinsky gave her high school drama teacher, who she had a five-year affair with during the time when she had a sexual relationship with President Clinton . Mr Bleiler gained momentary international recognition during the investigation into Lewinsky's affair with President Clinton, as he came forward and told about their lengthy affair. Though it is unclear when or how his marriage to then-wife Kathy ended, the two have since split and for some reason, Kathy ended up with a collection of clothes and gifts that the couple got from Monica over the years. All of these items were included as part of the evidence gathered by Kenneth Starr, the independent counselor pursuing the impeachment charges over the affair. Mr Bleiler's ex-wife, who now goes by Kate Nason, handed the lot over to an unidentified third party, who has since put the goods up for auction. Personalized photos: As a staffer, Lewinsky would have been able to have arranged a photo with a friend's name that was then signed by the autopen of the President's signature .

'Monica was friends with the couple, . so I think she gave some of her clothes to Kathy, just to wear they may . have exchanged some of the clothes,' Laura Yntema, an auction manager at . Nate D. Sanders, told MailOnline. Included . are eight pieces of clothing that was ‘gifted to Kate Bleiber’ including a sheer floor-length negligee. Lewinsky’s weight has been the . subject of ridicule in the past, and the clothes that she gave the . Bleilers are all sizes large and extra-large. The infamous blue dress is not included in the group of items up for sale. Lookbook: A number of jackets that Monica gave to Bleiler's wife- all of which were size L or XL . While her old baggy jackets may not seem . directly related to the presidential affair, there are a number of other . gifts and items that Lewinsky gave her former teacher from her time . working as a White House intern. Weight struggles: Monica appears to have given some of the clothes to Bleiler's now-ex wife . There are two auto-pen signed photos of Mr Clinton- and one with him alongside Hillary- that Monica sent to Mr Bleiler. In her role as a White House staffer, . it would not have been unusual for her to submit a request for a . personalized photo to be signed in the style of the president. She . also arranged for the president to write a birthday note to Bleiler, . who Monica carried on a five-year affair with including some time when . her relationship with the two men overlapped. ‘Dear . Andy: Hillary and I want to personally extend our warmest wishes to you . as you gather with your family and friends to celebrate your birthday.

All of that correspondence would likely have gone through the proper channels at the White House- and were not a result of the sexual relationship with the president- given that they were composed on official letterhead. She also gifted a pack of White House matches and boxes of M&Ms with the seal of the president. The lot is being sold by Nate D. Sanders, a memorabilia collector, and has received one bid of $2,500 so far. The sale will close in three days time. Ms Yntema told MailOnline that the auction house expects the final sale of the lot to be anywhere between $250,000 and $500,000. 'Most of the bidding happens on the last day,' she said.","Monica Lewinsky had an affair with her former high school drama teacher during the time when she had a relationship with President Bill Clinton .

Message: Senior Roma official Damian Draghici has said that Britain should be more worried about bankers 'stealing' than beggars from his country . Britain should be far more worried about bankers 'stealing' billions than Roma who will come to beg on the streets from the New Year, a senior Romanian official has said. Damian Draghici, an adviser to the country's prime minister, believes migrants from his nation should be given the chance to settle in the UK. The 43-year-old, who is also a Roma, said he expected . relatively few would make the journey to the UK when the . restrictions on the movement of Romanians and Bulgarians in the EU are . lifted on January 1. Mr Draghici said they did not like Britain because it was too cold and . predicted that only around 2,000 to 3,000 would travel to the UK this . winter. 'The Roma begging in the streets are obvious because we see them, they ask for one pound or one euro and they bother us. Yet some of the people in the banks are stealing billions of euros but nobody sees them because they are on the 60th floor,' he told The Times. 'Seventy per cent of Roma that left from Romania in the last 10 years are integrated. They have kids that go to school and they act like active citizens and taxpayers in the places where they are.' He added that groups who set up camp on Park Lane on several occasions this year were the 'exception'. Romania has around two million Roma and there are 750,000 in Bulgaria, although many have already left for Western Europe seeking work since the countries joined the EU in 2007. Estimate: Mr Draghici says that Britain's cold weather will put off migrants, and he expects around 3,000 to enter after Britain after January 1 . Migrants from these countries coming to . Britain in the New Year could put huge pressure on housing, schools and . hospitals, a major report warned last week.

Cassanda Verity Green sent a model down the catwalk with accessories containing a real life goldfish. And while she may have been applauded by the audience for her quirky style, the RSPCA have hit out at the show claiming her bags encourage people to treat living things as 'replaceable ornaments'. While the runway event is famous for pushing the boundaries of fashion, the animal charity claims that the goldfish-bowl shaped bags, containing the designer's own pet goldfish, is a step too far. Complaint: The RSPCA have hit out claiming her designs encourage people to treat living things as 'replaceable ornaments' An RSPCA spokeswoman said: 'While we understand that a graduate fashion show is about grabbing attention and headlines, we do have concerns that using a living creature to create a novel or unusual accessory encourages people to see them as replaceable ornaments, rather than living creatures in need of care and commitment.' The charity explained that the fishy handbag designs could lead to poor water quality and a lack of oxygen for the orange fish. Course director Willie Walters told the Evening Standard: 'When Cassandra Verity Green first said that she would like to use her goldfish in the bags the subject was discussed at length to ensure that the fish would be comfortable.' 'They were brought to the show in their usual bowls, and placed into them and fed between catwalk runs', she added.

The newest champion of football handicapping is a Chicago trader who consults for a major professional team and lectures on sports modeling. David Frohardt-Lane won the premier sports handicapping contest Sunday, taking home $557,850.The 36 year-old numbers guy beat out more than 1,000 competitors to win the sports betting SuperContest run by the LVH casino-hotel in Las Vegas. He plans to donate half the winnings to GiveWell, a nonprofit that evaluates other charities. Mastermind: David Frohardt-Lane took home almost $560,000 by winning the SuperContest sports handicapping tournament . Frohardt-Lane got into sports betting while studying math at Carleton College. As a sophomore, he used NFL statistics as the basis for a project, and realized that if he had used his model to place bets, he would have won 60 percent of the time. 'I was like, ‘Oh my God, I’m going to be a professional gambler,' he said. Instead, a friend convinced him to go into the more stable world of finance. The Detroit native, who holds a graduate degree in statistics from the University of Chicago, has spoken about sports statistics to students at Boston University’s Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists. He won the Cantor Football Handicapping Contest in 2011, walking away with $75,000. Last summer, he began consulting with a professional sports team, using predictive modeling to help with scouting. He said his employer asked him not to identify the team. The SuperContest, established in the 1980s, has more than doubled in size in recent years. It drew 517 entries in 2011, 745 entries last year and 1,034 entries this summer. Family man: The numbers whiz will keep only half of his winnings, he said he will donate the other half to charity . 'It’s really become popular over the last few years, mainly because social media is helping get the word out,' said LVH sports book head Jay Kornegay, who attributes most of the growth to Twitter. While other Las Vegas handicapping contests charge about $25 to enter, the SuperContest has an entry fee of $1,500. Only 34 contestants finished in the money this year. Frohardt-Lane had two entries in the contest, meaning that he is taking home about 200 times what he put up. Each week, SuperContest entrants select five NFL games against the spread, the pinpoint outcomes casinos expect for the game. Frohardt-Lane spent Sunday at his brother-in-law’s all-day wedding reception, checking scores on his iPhone. The contest came down to a San Francisco 49ers game. Frohardt-Lane needed the 49ers to win to oust the contest leader. They started out in the lead, but the Arizona Cardinals tied the game with two minutes remaining. The main even: The contest is run by the LVH Hotel Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada . At that point, Frohardt-Lane got the restaurant to turn on the game. He was just in time to see the 49ers line up to kick a field goal. 'It doesn’t make any sense from a psychological perspective, but just seeing the game, I started to regain my confidence a little and felt more in control. Just looking at my iPhone, I felt helpless. When they were lining up for the kick, I just told everyone, ‘Don’t worry about it, the kick’s going to be good and I’m going to win,’ he said. Phil Dawson made a 40-yard field goal, giving the 49ers the win. Frohardt-Lane said his wife of six months was OK with his distraction at the celebration. 'It’s kind of a stupid little hobby, this obsession with sports betting that I have, so I’ve been really lucky to find someone who thinks it’s really cool,' he said.","Finance pro David Frohardt-Lane beat out more than 1,000 competitors .

A couple at the centre of an international five-year manhunt over an alleged £1million NHS fraud have been arrested in Cyprus. Deborah Hancox, 44, and John Leigh, 53, are charged with eight counts of fraud and conspiracy to defraud the Greater Manchester Deanery, a teaching organisation. They allegedly moved to Cyprus after . police interviews in 2008. The pair were only able to be arrested when . they moved from the Turkish-controlled north side of the island to . Republic of Cyprus in the south. Arrested: The pair were taken in by Cypriot police and appeared in court in Manchester on Tuesday . Unlike the north side, which has no extradition treaty with the UK, the Republic of Cyprus does, and allowed Hancox and Leigh to be taken in. The couple stepped over the . border to the Republic of Cyprus at the end of last year where they were . taken into custody on a European Arrest Warrant. The couple were flown back to Britain by Cypriot police and appeared before Manchester Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday. Ms Sarah Johnson, from the CPS, said with a little research the couple would have discovered northern Cyprus to be a ‘non-convention’ country, and so has no extradition treaty with the UK. Appeal on Crimewatch: The pair allegedly moved to Cyprus in 2008 . A Crimewatch appeal to help trace the pair was made by the National Crime Agency in October. They were wanted in a joint investigation by Greater Manchester Police and the NHS’s counter fraud unit, NHS Protect. Leigh was employed by the NHS as an IT manager from 2000 until 2009. He was questioned by police over claims he had interests in three IT companies used to supply equipment, services and goods to the NHS. The couple are suspected of being involved in a fraud that led to the NHS being defrauded out of more than £1million. The case has been transferred to Manchester Crown Court for a preliminary hearing later this month. Criminals have been able to take shelter in northern Cyprus for years thanks to diplomatic tensions over the area. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, dozens of criminals began fleeing there to take advantage of the fact that the Turkish-controlled part of the island has no extradition treaty with the UK. The situation came about because the UK government does not recognise Turkey’s claim to the land. The Turkish government has offered to sign a treaty with the UK, but so far the Government has refused to avoid offending Cyprus or Greece. Fears have been raised that the situation means the area could become the equivalent of Spain's Costa de Sol in the 1970s and 1980s, where criminals would often go to escape extradition. Authorities in northern Cyprus have said they will co-operate with UK police. This, however, has not stopped the island being a problem. Last year the Serious Organised Crime Agency released a ‘most wanted’ list of nine wanted men who were believed to be in Cyprus, in the hope that it would help them be brought to justice.","Deborah Hancox, 44, and John Leigh, 53, were extradited back to the UK .

Sea views, a beachfront location and a very competitive price tag makes this house look like a bargain at £25,000. But there's just one catch – it's about to collapse into the North Sea. However, any potential buyer might not be as mad as you think, because the council has promised to help the next owner build a new home in a safer spot after this one is demolished. Now: The house for sale is about 26ft from the edge of the cliff following December's surge tides at Easton Bavents near Southwold . In 1998: The house, near the centre of this picture, was on firmer ground before neighbouring buildings disappeared . The house, in Easton Bavents near Southwold, Suffolk, was a mile inland in the 17th century but is now just 26ft from the crumbling cliff edge. There has been continuous erosion over the centuries, with the house 'moving' 2ft closer to the sea during storms which lashed the cliffs last month. It's up for sale with a guide price of between £25,000 and £50,000 – and the new owners will be given financial help and planning permission to demolish it and build another house on a different plot. Waveney District Council said assistance would be available under its scheme for new owners of blighted houses. Andrew McTear, whose insolvency firm is selling the house, said: ‘It may sound crazy to try selling a house that close to the edge of an eroding cliff. November 2010: Waveney District Council said assistance would be available under its scheme for new owners of blighted houses . October 2009: Waveney council's Pathfinder scheme has offered nine Easton Bavents landowners up to £25,000 towards building and moving costs . December 2008: The council said it expected the owners of clifftop properties to have them demolished before they fell on to the beach and financial help was available . ‘But by owning this property you could potentially get planning permission for another plot of land that you wouldn't otherwise be able to. Coastal erosion is the wearing away of rock by destructive waves hitting the coastline. There are four major forms: . ‘Plots of land near Southwold with planning permission are clearly highly sought-after, so we hope to be able to sell the clifftop home, even in the knowledge that it will have to be demolished.’ Waveney council's Pathfinder scheme has offered nine Easton Bavents landowners up to £25,000 towards building and moving costs. Coun David Ritchie, chairman of the Pathfinder board, said: ‘If you are in danger of losing your property to erosion and you sell it, the new owner would still have planning rights to build elsewhere. ‘The whole policy is an attempt to deal with coastal blight, so it could work to buy a house on a clifftop and move inland and take their planning permission with them.’ The council said it expected the owners of clifftop properties to have them demolished before they fell on to the beach and financial help was available for this. Laura Martin lives next door to the home which is for sale, and admitted she could not afford to buy or build another house elsewhere. She added that her long-term plan was to live in a caravan in her back garden, which is further inland than her house. The 57-year-old said: ‘I've got no plans to try and demolish my house because it's not in immediate danger but you can't make predictions about the future rate of erosion - nobody can.’ Other examples of major coastal erosion have happened across Britain over the past few years. Last April a house bought for £154,000 in a telephone auction by retired police officer Ann Diamond in February 2010 fell 300ft into the sea off Torquay, Devon. In parts of East Anglia, the fast receding coastline has been severely damaged - with 6,000 truckloads of sands washed away in just three years at Hopton-on-Sea beach in Norfolk. Worried owners of a holiday park overlooking the beach said the damage threatens the future of the seafront.","House in Easton Bavents near Southwold, Suffolk, was a mile inland in 17th century but is now just 26ft from edge .

The first ever example of a moon orbiting a planet outside our solar system may have been discovered 1,800 light years away. And the body, called MOA-2011-BLG-262Lb, is even more unusual considering it appears to be drifting alone in the cosmos. It is believed to consist of a 'rogue' planet - untethered to a star - around four times the mass of Jupiter and a moon about half the mass of Earth, substantially larger than our own lunar neighbour. The body, called MOA-2011-BLG-262Lb, could be of a planet and the first ever moon detected outside our solar system . In a paper posted this week, David Bennett of the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, and colleagues outline how they used an unusual method of detecting planetary bodies called gravitational microlensing. 'This is the first serious candidate from any survey that I am aware of,' astronomer David Kipping of Harvard University, who was not involved in the discovery, told New Scientist. The researchers detected a large object passing in front of the star, followed by a smaller one. Alone: The body may also be a 'rogue' planet, travelling through space, outside the orbit of a sun. File picture . However, the body could be a very small or failed star and its orbiting planet. But if it is an exomoon, it is further . interesting because it would be orbiting at around 12.5million miles . from its planet. By comparison, Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, the . largest in the solar system at two per cent the earth's mass, is about . 621,000 miles out. Normally, exoplanets are detected by . careful analysis in changes of the light coming from their star. Gravitiational microlensing detects them when they pass in front of a . distant star, as the object's gravity bends the light from the star, . focusing it similar to the way a lens works. Perhaps strangest of all, the moon and planet aren't near any other objects, and are definitely too far from the star that was used to detect them to orbit it. This suggests they have been ejected from their original star system. Astronomers have previously seen such rogue planets but they have never had accompanying moons. 'It almost begs the question as to whether we can really call these objects 'moons' or whether some other name is more apt,' adds Kipping. The team says gravtitational microlensing is dependent on chance, but say the exciting data means humanity should be on the lookout for more.","Massive body could be a moon orbiting exoplanet - the first we've seen .

His father Luke asked him to be best man months before doctors discovered the youngster had cancer. Alex Vaughan, seven, moved guests to tears during his best man speech at his parents' wedding . It was uncertain whether he would be well enough to fill the role as he underwent aggressive treatment during the course of the year. But when the day arrived, Alex proudly took his place by the side of his father and handed over the rings during the wedding between Mr Vaughan and Alex's mother Kim Cocker. Alex, who has recently returned full-time to primary school, later read out the speech, which he had written himself, at the ceremony in Preston. During the speech Alex explained how 'when I decided to do a speech it was to tell my mum and dad how much I love them'. He goes on to say how he was scared at the thought of doing a speech, but describes how his father told him: 'You shouldn't be scared of anything because you've been through the scariest thing ever'. His mother said: 'He wrote it himself and it was amazing. The speech went really well, Alex was so confident, and everyone was crying.' Alex's father Luke asked him to be best man months before doctors discovered the youngster had cancer . She went on to say: 'I was really proud of him when he gave the rings to me and his dad. 'It was a big surprise when he gave us both a gift. He had gone out and bought them himself, a watch and cufflinks for his dad and a Pandora bracelet and charm for me.' Alex's two-year-old brother, Dylan, was guest of honour for the day, and the four were back at home in Chadderton in time for Christmas. When my dad asked me to be best man, I felt special because I didn't think he would pick me as well as my uncle Lewis.

Sorting through public documents, philanthropy databases and other records, the New York Times says Bloomberg spent about $62,400 in 12 years for weekly cleanings of two large saltwater fish tanks in City Hall. He also made $23 million in campaign donations and has given a cool $30 million to the Metropolitan Museum of Art since 2002. Bloomberg famously took a $1 annual salary as mayor. Bloomberg issued a series of tweets marking his last day, the first noting his resolve to resurrect a city still wounded by the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks when he first took office. 'On my first day in office, I visited the World Trade Center site and vowed NYC would rebuild stronger than ever. Today I can say we have,' he tweeted.

On Tuesday morning, the mayor hosted his 13th and final interfaith prayer breakfast at the New York Public Library.

'I have always been envious of you,' he said at an interfaith breakfast at the New York Public Library. 'Because you work at the real level where the real problems are. Big numbers are easy to deal with. It’s much tougher when you deal one on one, looking at a person right in the eye who has a problem.' Bloomberg turned more lighthearted when he spoke about the clock winding down on his tenure. 'As you may know, I’ve been mayor now for 11 years, 364 days and about nine hours, but who’s counting?' he said. He also cited remarks by Pope Francis about the importance of cities, then quipped, 'The fact that a Jewish kid can quote the Pope in a secular building built by Protestants in front of Hindu, Muslim and Sikh leaders really says all you need to know about New York City.'

A man who attacked his 'terrified' neighbour with an axe because of his barking dog has avoided jail. Peter John Tames, 47, was incensed after being disturbed by Andrew Palmer's dog's continuous barking, so recorded the noise and played it back through the wall in retaliation. When Mr Palmer went round to apologise, Tames attacked him – first with a punch and then with an axe. Agoraphobic Tames, from Macclesfield, admitted criminal damage and assault at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court on October 10. He received a five-month jail sentence suspended for 12 months. The court heard that the incident happened on September 10 when Mr Palmer came home from work at 4.45pm after picking up his son. Mr Palmer said he began to hear a dog barking next door a short time later, and eventually recognised the sound to be a recording of his own dog. He says he decided to go next door to apologise for the noise, but claims to have found the defendant 'rambling' and 'sounding drunk'. Bev Dobson, prosecuting, said 'He had an aggressive posture. Mr Palmer thought he was about to be head-butted and in self-defence pushed the defendant away. Tames then swung a punch and hit the victim’s upper ear. At that stage Mr Palmer’s wife came home. He pushed the defendant back so he could get his wife inside the house.' She added added: 'Five minutes later there was a knock on Mr Palmer’s door. As he opened door he saw the defendant had a wooden-handled axe above his head. He swung it in the direction of Mr Palmer from a couple of feet away. It was clearly aimed at him. He managed to close the door in time but the axe came into the house and hit the meter box.' Mrs Dobson went on to describe the victim as 'absolutely terrified'. Peter John Tames received a five-month sentence suspended for 12 months at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court (pictured). He was also given a 12-month community order with alcohol treatment and supervision . The court heard police found a large axe at Tames’s address and that the defendant was staring and growling at the officers, apparently shouting 'I love pain. Give me some more'. 'He told police his lack of sleep had made him irritable. The dog was constantly barking. He said he didn’t aim the axe at the victim but just wanted to scare him.' Anthony Derbyshire, defending, said: 'He has suffered two recent bereavements in the last three years, his partner and his father. 'It has affected his mental health and he has become agoraphobic and alcohol-dependent. He is ashamed and sorry for his actions, which are very out of character.' Tames was also given a 12-month community order with alcohol treatment and supervision. He was ordered to pay £700 court costs and £1,500 compensation.","Peter John Tames, 47, was incensed after being disturbed by the noisy dog .
