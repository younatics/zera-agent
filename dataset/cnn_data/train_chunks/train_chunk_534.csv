Giving workers shares in their companies in return for losing some employee rights could cost £1billion, it emerged today. George . Osborne has been warned his ‘shares for workers rights’ plan will leave . a big hole in Treasury coffers at a time when other parts of government . are clamping down on tax avoidance. Critics accused the Chancellor of putting ‘another billion pound lollipop on the table’ which could be used as a tax dodge. Chancellor George Osborne, who joined children to paint a money box at a Christmas party at Number 11 Downing Street, has been warned his 'shares for rights' plan will cost £1billion . Today Mr Osborne was hosting his annual Christmas party in Number 11 Downing Street for children's charity, Starlight. Earlier the Office for Budget Responsibility . raised concerns about a ‘number of uncertainties’ surrounding the plan . to give staff a tax break on profits they make on shares awarded under . the scheme. The idea is . already deeply controversial in government, seen as a spin-off from a . plan by venture capitalist and Tory donor Adrian Beecroft to slash . employee rights to encourage firms to hire more staff. Announcing the policy in his conference speech, Mr Osborne said it was a ‘voluntary three-way deal’. Chancellor George Osborne announced his 'voluntary three-way deal' for employees in his party conference speech in October . ‘You the company: give your employees shares in the business. You the employee: replace your old rights of unfair dismissal and redundancy with new rights of ownership. And what will the government do? ‘We'll charge no capital gains tax at all on the profit you make on your shares ...Owners, workers and the taxman, all in it together.’ But in documents published by the OBR, it has emerged that desk break could cost the taxpayer £1billion by 2017-18. ‘First, it is difficult to estimate how quickly the relief will be taken up; this could make a significant difference as the cost is expected to rise towards £1 billion beyond the end of the forecast horizon, OBR costing documents state. ‘Second, it is hard to predict how quickly the increased scope for tax planning will be exploited; again this could be quantitatively significant as a quarter of the costing already arises from tax planning.’ Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the policy of not charging capital gains tax on the shares was at odds with the purported crackdown on tax avoidance, which has seen multinational firms like Starbucks, Amazon and Google in the headlines. ‘Just as it is berating those who have picked up the tax sweeties currently lying around, it is preparing to put another billion-pound lollipop on the table,’ Mr Johnson wrote in the Financial Times today. ‘There may be a case for more flexible approaches to employment legislation. But as a tax policy, “shares for rights” always looked pretty questionable. At a time of increasing scrutiny of tax avoidance schemes, it has all the hallmarks of another avoidance opportunity.’ Under the plans, employees will be given the choice of a traditional contract or one that does not afford them the usual employment rights. The alternative 'owner-employee' contract will not give the employee rights on unfair dismissal, redundancy, the right to request flexible working and time off for training. Mothers will be required to provide 16 weeks’ notice of a firm date of return from maternity leave, instead of the usual eight, in return for shares in their company. Last week the results of a consultation on the policy showed that from 209 responses only a ‘very small number’ thought it was a good idea.","Employees urged to sacrifice rights in return for shares in their firm .

Commuters in China saved the life of a man who had fallen onto the tracks in the path of an approaching train by frantically signalling the driver who pulled up in the nick of time. The dramatic rescue comes just a week after a New York resident was shoved onto the tracks and filmed by fellow passengers struggling to get back onto the platform before being hit and killed by a train. Reports of 58-year-old Ki-Suck Han's  horrifying death, including the use of a picture - taken seconds before he was hit - on the front page of a popular New York newspaper, sparked a sharp outcry. Seconds from death: Commuters managed to save the life of this Chinese rail passenger who fell onto the tracks in at a metro station in Beijing . Some people were shocked that no one had gone to . help Mr Han while others dubbed the coverage 'gratuitous, not news' and . 'sickening rubber-necking'. In the latest incident at Beijing's Sihui . Metro Station it was reported that the . man fell onto the tracks just as the train started to pull onto the . platform, meaning there would have only been a small amount of time for . his fellow passengers to warn the driver. In the New York incident, Mr Han reportedly stood on the . tracks for 22 seconds as he tried in vain to get back up onto the platform before being hit. The comparative speeds of the two trains have not yet been released. Commuters frantically signalled the driver who managed to pull up in time.

The teenage victim of a Rabbi who subjected her to years of systematic rape and sexual abuse has described her joy at his conviction, declaring: 'Now he'll learn how it feels to be helpless.' Rabbi Nechemya Weberman faces over 25 years in jail after he was found guilty of fondling the teen, forcing her to perform oral sex on him, and making her act out porn films, over the course . of many years beginning when she was 12. The girl's parents, now 17, sent her to Weberman, an influential religious counselor in New York, for extra tuition after she broke various rules of their ultra-orthodox and secretive Satmar Jewish sect. But instead the 'master manipulator' subjected her to a campaign of sadistic abuse convincing her parents that she was a 'rebellious liar' who needed strict re-education. Trusted: Rabbi Nechemya Weberman as convicted of 59 counts related to sexually abusing a girl he was being paid to counsel . And today, as Weberman awaited sentence in a New York prison cell, the girl told the Daily Post: . 'I can’t wait until someone stronger, who weighs 350 pounds more, holds . him down, lets him know how it feels to be so helpless.' The depths of Weberman's sexual perversions appeared limitless and his cruel and premeditated programme of abuse grew into evermore painful and humiliating acts of domination. They culminated one day during a 'lesson' in his study when he began burning her bare stomach with a lighter, simply because 'he found it arousing', she said. 'He told me, ""When you go home, you put on peanut butter,""' she . said. 'I stayed in my bed for three . days. I didn’t get out of bed. I didn’t eat. I just wanted to die... I was 13, I think.' She told how he turned her mother against her, threatening to cast the family out of the religious order if she didn't improve. With no one left to turn to, she had no choice but to internalise the pain and live in silence. 'I didn’t love, I didn’t hate,' she said. 'I felt nothing. I froze my emotions. I wouldn’t let myself feel anything.' The abuse finally stopped when she moved to a less religious school and was able to tell teachers of her ordeal. Weberman, was yesterday led away in handcuffs after he was found guilty of 59 counts of sexual abuse. He faces 25 years in prison for the worst of the charges and two to seven years on lesser charges. Pillar: The insular orthodox Jews Weberman leads fiercely supported the rabbi, holding fundraisers for him . It took jurors a day and a half to decide the case, and defense attorneys are already vowing an appeal. 'We firmly believe that the jury got an unfairly sanitized version of . the facts,' said attorney George Farkas. 'As a result, the truth did not . come out and the struggle continues in full force to free this innocent . man.' Weberman was charged with 88 counts of sexual abuse and assault. The trial cast a harsh light on the rules of the secretive community. Prosecutors . say the girl's parents sent their rebellious daughter to him for . counselling after she broke several rules of the . sect, including reading magazines like Cosmopolitan and People and . wearing stockings that were too thin. Rabbi Weberman was supposed to be re-indoctrinating the girl and . bringing her back to the ultra-conservative standards of the community . after she was branded a 'heretic.' Instead, she told a counsellor years later, that he was abusing her. 'When you think about it,' assistant district attorney Kevin O’Donnell said, the alleged victim's parents 'were . actually paying the defendant to have sex with their daughter.' O'Donnell added that Weberman abused the girl, now age 17, 'over and over again.' Her family paid him $12,800 in . counseling fees during that time, the victim's mother testified Monday. 'I wanted to die rather than live with myself,' the accuser, who's identity has not been made public, testified. 'I didn't know how to fight. I was numb.' Circus: Weberman's trial was not smooth, with his supporters taking photos of his alleged victim during her testimony and posting them to Twitter . The rabbi's lawyers fiercely denied the allegations. They say the girl made up the story to retaliate against him. They . claimed the girl went to police only after Weberman and her parents set up . hidden cameras to secretly record the girl having sex with her boyfriend . when she was still underage. Weberman turned the tapes over to police in the hopes that the boyfriend would be prosecuted. The charges against the boyfriend were later dropped. Weberman's . lawyers also claim that he had been business partners with the girl's . parents and that the families had a falling out. The . Satmar Hasidic community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, rallied around . the rabbi - sponsoring fundraisers to pay for his legal defense. The community numbers around 250,000 - the largest sect of its type outside of Israel. Weberman's supporters were so protective of him they disrupted the course of the trial when they allegedly photographed the accuser during her testimony. Four men were led out of a New York . court room and arrested in late November after jumping up to take pictures of her on their phones while she gave evidence. Each was a  members of the strict . Satmar sect in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, of which Rabbi Weberman is leader. One image of the girl was even posted to a Twitter account. Caged: Weberman faces faces 25 years in prison for the worst of the charges and two to seven years on lesser charges. The judge criticised the men for outing the young woman, according to the Post. 'You . know about the Torah, you know about rabbinical courts. This is a civil . court,' Supreme Court Justice John Ingram told them. 'Your phones will be held for possible criminal prosecution. You may wish to avail yourself of counsel.' The . four - Lemon Juice, 30, Joseph Fried, 23, Yona Weisman, 23, and Abraham . Zupnick, 23 - were taken from Brooklyn Supreme Court to the Brooklyn . District Attorney’s Office for questioning. They face criminal contempt . charges that could carry up to a year in prison, a source said. Mr . Weisman denied taking a picture, according to the Post. All spectators . at the trial were then ordered to hand over their phones by the judge. One source is quoted as describing the move as being similar to what . happens in a gang trial.","Rabbi Nechemya Weberman, from New York, faces over 25 years in jail after he was found guilty yesterday of abusing the teenage girl over five years .

A man born with a medical condition which causes huge folds of skin to hang down over his face is celebrating becoming the proud father of a healthy baby girl. Latif Khatana, 32, who has been dubbed the Man With No Face, suffered years of abuse over his disability and was terrified his unborn child would inherit the same condition. But he and wife Salima, 25, from Jammu and Kashmir in the Indian Himalayas have been able to enjoy every moment with newborn daughter Ulfat after she was given a clean bill of health. Scroll down for video . Baby joy: Latif Khatana, who suffers from an extreme skin condition, and wife Salima, with their healthy newborn daughter Ulfat . Ulfat, whose name means love in Urdu, was born naturally at home in Reasi district, on November 10th, weighing a healthy 5lbs 5oz, with the help of female relatives and a midwife. As soon as Latif held his new daughter he quickly checked her over for any visible marks. But the new parents were overjoyed to find their little girl was healthy and unmarked. Latif suffers from the skin disorder, . Neurofibromatosis, which causes multiple flaps of skin to cover . his entire face, imparing his vision and effectively making him almost faceless. He said: ‘I was extremely worried about my baby’s facial features. When I saw that she was pretty and fine, it was a great relief. She has a fair and beautiful face, just like an angel.’ Happy family: The proud parents pose with members of their family near their home in Jammu and Kashmir in the Indian Himalayas . Latif explained his new daughter has brought joy into his life after years of misery because of his own facial features. He said: ‘I want to forget about my past life. Being a father is a new chapter in a man's life and I am embracing every second of it. I will enjoy it and I’ll now be a lot more worried about her than myself. I don’t care so much about me anymore.’ When his wife Salima found out she was expecting, the pair suffered many sleepless nights worried whether Latif would pass on his condition. Salima, who was born with just one foot, married Latif in August 2008. Latif struggled to find a wife for many years but when he met Salima, they bonded over their disabilities, and finally agreed to marry. Mother Salima, 25, was born with just one foot. She and Latif bonded over the disabilities before deciding to marry . Latif said: ‘We had always wanted children but we were always too scared. In the end we took a chance but I prayed throughout the pregnancy that we had a healthy child. I didn’t care if it was a boy or girl as long as he or she didn’t have to hide its face in shame. ‘When I finally heard my daughter’s cries, it was such a special moment, my heart was full of happiness.’ Even though Latif cannot see enough to get involved fully in his parenting duties he has been helping where he can. He said: ‘I can't see properly, so I can’t do much to help my wife. My wife is much more organised anyway, she knows how to handle a baby. 'Fathers are not trained but I do what I can. I sometimes hold her while my wife is in the kitchen or doing other work.” Latif and Salima would like more children, but their financial problems might not allow it. ‘I thank god for blessing me with a beautiful daughter and we’d love more children. 'But I don’t earn enough. No parent would want their child to suffer any health problems, but they do not want them to suffer financially either.’ Latif has taken to begging to support his family. His condition has meant he can’t see properly so is unable to secure a job. He travels to Kashmir's capital city, Srinagar, every year for several months to make enough money to send home. ‘I don’t want to leave my daughter but I don’t have much choice and I will have to leave in the Spring. I have to earn money to support my family and this is the only way I can make any,’ he added. Salima said Latif has been a wonderful husband and believes he will go on to make a great father. ‘We were worried for a long time about what our children would look like but now I’m sure all our children will be healthy,’ she added. ‘No matter what Latif looks like, I love being married to him. I don’t regret one day as his wife. I like him just the way he is. His face is god’s wish, we can't do much with it so we accept it and live our lives. 'But thankfully it was not the same wish for our daughter. Our prayers were answered and our baby is fine. We refuse to waste another minute worrying about it now. We will live our lives, happily.’ In its mild form the condition typically causes harmless coffee-coloured patches on the skin . Neurofibromatosis is the name for a group of conditions that cause lumps to grow on the coverings of nerves. There are two main types - the most common being Type 1 or NF1. This affects around one person in 2,500. There is no known cure. NF is caused by a mutation in one of the genes. About half of the people who have it have no family history of the condition. This is called a spontaneous gene mutation. The other half of people will have inherited NF from their mother or father. It often lays dormant until adulthood. Symptoms can vary from one person to another even in the same family. Some people have a very mild form and may not realise they have it – developing six or more harmless coffee-coloured patches on the skin. However, other sufferers are affected by neurofibromas, which usually appear during adolescence. These may first appear on the skin as a purplish mark, before a small fibrous lump appears. They can also grow along deeper-seated nerves inside the body, which can be painful if knocked. The lumps can increase in number during a person’s lifetime. There is no treatment to stop the lumps from appearing  although surgery or laser treatment can sometimes be used to remove them. Richard Taylor, chairman of the Neuro Foundation said: 'NF1 is a debilitating genetic illness that causes benign tumours to grow in 25,000 patients in the UK. 'The condition often leads to social isolation as many people simply do not understand or appreciate the condition.'","Father Latif's condition causes folds of skin to hang over his face .

The disappearance of the ice is likely to further affect the wider ecosystem and could threaten species of fish adapted to living in waters kept cold by the glaciers, he added. The USGS yesterday warned as much as 44billion tons of nitrogen and 850billion tons of carbon could be released into the environment as permafrost thaws over the next century. This release of greenhouse gases could make much worse and threaten delicate water systems on land and offshore, the scientists said. Their warning came after the UN last week warned of record levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which will likely remain trapped there causing temperatures to continue to rise for centuries.

Heating up: The glacier has shrunk greatly and only patches remain . Chilled: The Harrison glacier, the largest in the park, spreads out across the Rockies . Global warming: The glacier is still the park's largest, but its disappearance now leaves massive sections of mountain visible . These photographs, known as glacier pairs or repeat photographs, show the tangible effects of the rising climate believed to be caused by the accumulation of so many pollutants. They have been taken from the same vantage points or fields of view, but with some of the originals dating back as far as 1900, to document how global warming is affecting glaciers. And the same phenomenon is being repeated all over the world, according to Dr Jonathan Bamber, a glacier expert from the University of Bristol. 'The retreating glaciers seen in these photos are common to most mountain glaciers around the world including examples from the European Alps, the Himalaya and tropical glaciers in the Andes,' he said. 'Part of the retreat is likely due to natural causes but part is also likely due to human induced warming of the planet over the last century.'","A century ago the Montana nature reserve had 150 glaciers; now only 25 remain within its borders .

"By . Jan Moir . PUBLISHED: . 19:45 EST, 9 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:27 EST, 10 December 2012 . Winner: James Arthur may have been victorious in last night's X factor final, but Jan Moir says that this has been the worst series of the show yet . Well, in the end that was quite the X Factor series, wasn’t it? For all the wrong reasons rather than the right ones. From Tulisa’s fag ash breath to Gary Barlow storming off in a toddler-style strop at Ella’s early exit, to Christopher ‘Baloney’ Maloney withdrawing from last night’s show in a huff, surely this will go down in history as the showbiz car crash at the end of the rocky road for the X Factor. How could it get any worse? Two million viewers have already escaped, bolting like rampaging wildebeest, probably never to return. Why? For a start, Simon Cowell’s natural authority at the top of the X Factor Christmas tree is much missed. Louis, Gary, Tulisa and Nicole can blather on all they want, but without Simon there to wave his magic wand and turn Cinderellas into stars, what is the point? There isn’t one. This year, the rise and rise of the ghastly cruise ship yodeller Baloney, a chancer hosed down in fake tan and onion tears, made a mockery of the whole process. Yet the greedy X Factor bosses only have themselves to blame. The change in the voting rules, which meant that viewers could vote all through the show rather than just at the end, after they had watched everyone perform, making their judgement on that basis, turned the whole thing into a popularity contest rather than a talent show. Into a joke, really. Yes, it must have increased their lovely, scrumptious revenues from the phone lines, but look what happened! With voters in his Liverpool hometown swinging behind him every week, the talent-free Baloney sailed through every round. For this we all suffered – and the X Factor lot only have themselves to blame that their audience is 20 per cent down on last year. And was it my imagination, or was the natural cruelty of the show much more pronounced this year? Fake: Jan Moir says that the 'friendships' between judges (left to right) Louis Walsh, Tulisa Contostavlos, Gary Barlow and Nicole Sherzinger and the contestants makes for uncomfortable viewing . Finalist: Contestant Christopher Maloney, a 'ghastly cruise ship yodeller' according to Jan Moir . Certainly, the judges were more involved in the mentoring process this time around, but this has a downside. Namely, it seems callous of them to pretend that their relationship with their acts is anything more than fleeting. And professional. With his best smile pasted onto his face, Gary told phoney Baloney that they were ‘friends’ and that he could duet with him ‘anytime’ – anytime he didn’t see him coming first, is what I think he meant. Lacking: The X Factor isn't the same without Simon Cowell says Jan Moir . Meanwhile, Nicole gushed on  about Jahmene being a ‘lamb chop’, a ‘lamb shank’ and yes, ‘a true  friend‘, too. ‘She really gets me,’ said Jahmene, this sweet-voiced, church-going, virginal Asda shelf-stacker and his Pussycat Doll pal. It all makes for rather uncomfortable viewing. X Factor judges must tread rather more carefully, for they tread on dreams. In a shameless bid to make themselves seem nicer people, they give these susceptible kids a taste of stardom and a glimpse of celebrity camaraderie that is perhaps unrealistic. Acts such as Jahmene and James, who were keen to show us the drudgery of their hopefully former lives, might have to live forever with that ‘could have been’ moment. Or perhaps, with the advent of every X Factor series, even the contestants are more knowing? For win or not, after an initial burst of stardust, more and more of these wannabes just seem to disappear into the blackness without trace, just another firework on a winter afternoon. Although some of them will never give up on livin’ the desperate dream. ‘Its massive. I’ve never wanted anything so much in me entire life,’ chirruped Christopher Maloney on Saturday night, as if that was somehow a valediction. The show’s producers are already joyfully airbrushing Baloney out of X Factory history, and yes, the two final shows were well produced. But the damage has been done. This was the worst series in the history of the show, one which was marred by mediocrity and mired in scandal. You know what really hurts? The ghastly Rylan Clark, booted out in week eight, is going to be the biggest star of them all. Things have to improve next year. If there is going to be a next year.

"By . Robert Verkaik . PUBLISHED: . 16:11 EST, 13 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:14 EST, 13 October 2012 . Speaking out: Soldier Andy Julien, pictured, survived a friendly-fire attack and has accused Ministers of covering up the Army's failure to issue equipment that could have saved the lives of his colleagues . A soldier who survived a friendly-fire attack has accused Ministers of covering up the Army’s failure to issue equipment that could have saved the lives of his colleagues. Andy Julien has made his claims ahead of a landmark court ruling that could pave the way for wounded servicemen or grieving families to sue the military over ‘avoidable’ deaths or injuries. The former trooper was in a Challenger II tank when it came under fire from another British Challenger II on the fourth day of the 2003 Iraq War. Corporal Stephen Allbutt and Trooper David Clarke died in the attack, while Trooper Julien and Lance Corporal Dan Twiddy suffered severe injuries. All four were serving with the Queen’s Royal Lancers attached to 1st Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. Court papers seen by The Mail on Sunday show that the Ministry of Defence had leased 47 state-of-the-art satellite recognition sets from the US which were capable of tracking friendly tank movements, but it failed to deploy them in the conflict. The surviving servicemen and Cpl Allbutt’s widow Debbi claim the Government tried to cover up this failure by denying them information. They allege they were obstructed from seeing witness statements by other tank crews that revealed breakdowns in communication. Later this month the Court of Appeal will rule on whether 27-year-old Mr Julien – who was medically discharged from the Army in 2004 – L/Cpl Twiddy and Mrs Allbutt have the right to sue the MoD for negligence. Mr Julien, from Manchester, who is now an accounts manager and is speaking for the first time about the friendly fire incident, says there was a lack of equipment, ranging from the high-tech tank-identification units to simple desert combat uniform. He remembers how, after he was injured, a corporal delivered a brutal assessment of his condition: ‘The good news is you are still alive but the bad news is that I can see your bones protruding through both your legs.’ And he can recall in vivid detail the horror and confusion as the first round struck his tank while he and  L/Cpl Twiddy were resting on top of the vehicle because of the heat. ‘People were shouting, “Get in the tank,” ’ he said. ‘Someone was saying, “Come on, quick get in the tank, he’s dead, he’s dead.” I suspect they were making reference to me because I couldn’t move and I couldn’t talk. ‘I just remember a buzzing noise in my ears and loads of screaming and shouting around the tank. I couldn’t hear Stephen [Allbutt, who had been inside the tank with Trooper Clarke] any more. I was just hearing Daniel [Twiddy] shouting and screaming. Corporal Stephen Allbutt, left, and Trooper David Clarke, centre, died in the attack, while Trooper Julien and Lance Corporal Dan Twiddy, right, suffered severe injuries . ‘I was on the back deck of the tank at that point. I wasn’t in any pain but I knew there was something up with my legs because there was like a warm sensation. Daniel shouted at me and called my name.’ Then he remembers his attention turning to the tank, where the turret was engulfed in flames. ‘I was focused on Trooper Clarke and Stephen [Allbutt]. I started calling their names but there was no response. While I was trying to crawl off the tank I remember hearing an explosion, like a second round, which blew me off the tank and caused me an injury to my head.’ As he lay on the ground he could see another tank coming towards him. ‘If I had remained there the likelihood is it would have run over me. I just had to crawl out of the way of the tank. There was a third round, which hit our tank. ‘This one exploded right near the hull, near the hatch, which then caused all the ammunition in the tank to go up. At first I thought we were under enemy attack but then a sergeant said, “It’s friendly fire, it’s friendly fire.” ‘I thought it was the Americans. When I heard it was another British tank I was really angry, because all this training that they said they were supposed to provide, plus the kind of tank we were in, someone should know how to spot one of those tanks at night-time. ‘There was a lack of equipment, even standard gear like desert combats. We were going out in green combat gear. Friendly identification tracking equipment was not in place although it was available.’ The American army was actually using it. There was other equipment that was readily available, which came to light after further investigations by his solicitors that could have been provided – identification and orientation equipment. Horrific: The soldiers were in a Challenger II tank similar to this pictured when it came under fire from another British Challenger II on the fourth day of the 2003 Iraq War . ‘It has always been a struggle to get information and documents from the MoD. While I was in the forces it was, “Anything that happens in the Army stays in the Army.” Everything has taken place behind closed doors. 'When I was trying to get information on the equipment, there were people who had expertise in that field who could provide that information but weren’t able to do so because they had contracts with the MoD.’ Mr Julien’s allegations were echoed at Stephen Allbutt’s inquest in 2007, in which coroner Andrew Walker concluded the deaths and injuries were ‘completely avoidable’ and blamed the Army for poor communication. The injured soldiers and Mrs Allbutt were given permission by a High Court judge to bring a claim of negligence against the MoD. But the Government has instructed top barristers, at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds, to block this in the Court of Appeal. The claimants also now fear that controversial plans to bring in ‘secret courts’ to hear cases involving sensitive material will serve only to further obstruct their fight for justice. Shubhaa Srinivasan, of Mr Julien’s solicitors Leigh Day & Co, said: ‘Families of soldiers are frustrated in their attempts to seek truth and justice at the very outset under the Army’s Board of Inquiry rules, which preclude victims and their families from participating. Frustration: The injured soldiers were given permission by a High Court judge to bring a claim of negligence against the MoD. But the Government has instructed top barristers, at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds, to block this in the Court of Appeal, pictured . ‘In the Allbutt inquest the soldier’s family and the two injured soldiers were not provided with a full unredacted copy of the Board’s findings and an accompanying explanation. This is fairly common.’ She said that at the inquest the MoD had taken an obstructive approach by censoring nearly all of the Board of Inquiry material and other relevant investigations. Accusing the MoD of ‘a lack of openness and transparency’, she said: ‘We had to fight hard to get crucial material unredacted and it was only done after the coroner also insisted. ‘For example, the Royal Military Police had interviewed several soldiers [who were the crew in the firing tank] as they had been investigated for gross negligence. ‘The interview transcripts were withheld under the pretext the MoD needed to get permission from the soldiers before providing them. ‘Although such documents were ultimately provided, this was very late in the day. The victims are left with a feeling that they need to fight for every bit of information.’ The MoD, which declined to comment on the case, argues that the questions surrounding military equipment and operational deployment are matters for Parliament rather than the courts. It also says that if the court finds in favour of Mr Julien and the others, it will have a damaging effect on morale.","Claims made ahead of court ruling that could pave the way for wounded servicemen .

The UK may be in the grip of the worst economic crisis in history - but at least we haven't lost our sense of humour. A new exhibition showcases a series of unintentionally hilarious sights captured by Londoners in their city during 2012. S*** London originally started out as a Facebook group which invited members of the public to send in funny photos of everyday mishaps such as clever shop names or unfortunate council signs. Unintended irony: This entry features a shop called Smokers Paradise next door to a Cancer Research UK charity shop . Surely they did this on purpose? Another entry for the Best/Worst shop name in the S*** London awards . Dark humour: This picture has been entered into the Best Picture category for the S*** London awards . All of a flutter: Another hilarious snap which was sent in to the blog captured this stark warning about one of London's most populous residents . Now a popular blog, the best entries will be shown at an art exhibition in Hoxton. Creator Patrick Dalton writes on his blog: 'S*** London began life as Facebook group for Londoners to post their pictures of strange and unusual things they spotted on their travels around the city. 'These are photographs of the unintentional human comedy that surround us in the city. 'It’s the flotsam and jetsam of city life, the overlooked minutiae, the tragic, the grotesque and the basest of base. Unfortunate: A mischievous vandal has given this stall a rather more sinister sound name . Spelling lesson: This entry caught a restaurant which offers an unusual sitting between breakfast and dinner . Blunt: Another entry for Best Picture which captures the darker side of London humour . Sinking feeling: An entry sent in for the best shop name which makes great use of a pun . 'There are so many unintentionally amusing things around the city if you just choose to notice them.' Some of the funniest submissions which have been nominated for the S*** London Awards 2012 include a shop called Smoking Paradise next to a Cancer Research charity store and a dumped mattress daubed with the notice 'Free Matress, No Visible Stains'. Genius: This billboard headline caught the eye of one bemused Londoner . Protest: Someone has taken strong objection to the orders of Lambeth council . Inspiring: This animating landscape was sent in as an entry for the Most Depressing View from Work category . Lonely hearts: This Londoner looking for love has kept his requirements to a minimum . Spokeswoman Danielle Pender for KK Outlet in Hoxton, where the exhibition runs from 7 December said: 'The images, no matter how grim, are life affirming and reassuring that underneath the modern day desire for perfection and the homogeny of the Tesco filled high street - people are still people, they sometimes make mistakes and life is all the better for them.' Dalton added: 'What I really like about the site and the whole project is that it encourages people to notice their environment around them a little. I've learnt a lot more about this city from walking about hunting a good shot.' Organisers are also asking for entrants for the S*** London Awards, with categories including Best/Worst Christmas Decorations, Ugliest London Building, Best/Worst Business Name and Most Depressing View From Work. Appropriate: An entrant spotted that this particular restaurant has been aptly-located . Enticing: An eagle-eyed Londoner spotted this unfortunate pavement marking that lost some its letters .

The images are a collaboration between the artist and photographer Alexander Khokhlov, who named the series Weird Beauty. Make-up artist Kutsan creates the distinctive designs by first coating a model's face with white paint before applying layers of black paint.

Islands escalated today as two Chinese patrol ships arrived near the . islands known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. The Beijing-sent vessels are a display of China’s outrage over Tokyo's . £16.4m purchase of the largely barren islands from their private owners last week. The quarrel over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, which are also claimed by . Taiwan, . has been heating up in recent months after the governor of Tokyo . proposed buying the islands and developing them. Senkaku or Diaoyu: The islands in the East China Sea have long been the centre of a dispute between China and Japan which has escalated after the latter's purchase this week . Swift response: In reaction to the news of the Japanese central government's £16.4m purchase of the largely barren islands from their private owner, Beijing sent two patrol boats to the area . But Japan's central government announced its own deal this week with the . Japanese family it recognizes as the owner. Chief Cabinet Secretary . Osamu Fujimura told reporters the government budgeted 2.05 billion yen . (£16.4 million) for the purchase ‘to maintain the Senkakus peacefully . and stably.’ The central government does not plan to develop the islands, going against Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara’s plans. ‘Ishihara put the national government in a very difficult spot. He . pushed them into doing this now,’ said Sheila Smith, a senior fellow at . the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. But she said this was a ‘good outcome’ as Japan cannot afford to let the . dispute hinder its vital ties with China, its top trading partner. Ms Smith said Tokyo needs to be able to work through problems with Beijing in order to maintain that trade serves both nations . But Beijing sees the purchase as an affront to its claims and its past . calls for negotiations and, despite Tokyo’s attempts to calm the dispute, responded with fury. Property of Japan: Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara has previously said that he wants to see the islands developed . ‘The determination and the will of the Chinese government and military . to safeguard their territorial integrity are firm,’ Chinese Defense . Ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng said in a statement. ‘We are closely . monitoring the development of the situation and reserve the right to . take necessary measures.’ Carlyle Thayer, an expert on regional security at the University of New . South Wales in Australia, said the sending of the Chinese patrol boats . ‘ups the stakes’ although it is unlikely that the Chinese boats would go . within the 12 nautical miles around the islands that are considered Japanese territorial waters. ‘It's a tit-for-tat response because China is extremely sensitive about sovereignty matters,’ he said. Japan's coast guard said it has not taken any special measures in . response to the Chinese patrol boats although it continues to monitor . the situation. 'Japan has a pretty robust navy, a very strong and active professional . coast guard. It's all posturing. It's a game of who blinks first,’ Thayer said. Beijing's anger has been accompanied by heated reporting in China's . state media with a commentator in the People's Liberation Army . Daily called Japan's move ‘the . most blatant challenge to China's sovereignty since the end of World War . II.’ China on Tuesday also started broadcasting a daily marine weather . report for the islands. About a dozen protesters gathered outside the Japanese Embassy in Beijing chanting, ’Japan, get out of China.’ The protests have spread, with a number of people waving placards and . the Chinese flag and shouted ‘Defend the Diaoyu Islands’ outside the . Japanese Consulate General in southern Guangzhou and about 200 people . marched in Weihai in Shandong province, singing the national anthem, . local media reported. Rising tensions: Protesters in Hangzhou, China, . hold placards and banners at a demonstration against Japan's claim of . the disputed islands last month . Top Japanese government officials maintain that the flare-up hasn't . affected official ties with China, although Deputy Prime Minister . Katsuya Okada acknowledged that emotions on both sides were being fanned . by activists. China also has announced coordinates marking out the waters off the Diaoyu Islands that it considers its territory. The coordinates are another step, along with recent announcements of . China's intention to use law enforcement vessels, to defend its . sovereignty claim, said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, northeast Asia . project director for the International Crisis Group. ‘It's primarily about being seen as taking action to pave the way for further actions to assert China's sovereignty,’ she said. In Tokyo, Gov. Ishihara renewed his calls for the islands to be developed for future use by fishermen. ‘It appears that the matter is decided,‘ he told reporters. ‘They say . they won't do anything, but China's leaders are still criticizing the . plan."" Ishihara said he was freezing the 1.4 billion yen (£11.2 million) donated toward his purchase plan for the islands and would only release . the funds to the government once it was clear whether a port or other . facilities would be built. He also suggested that Japan cooperate with the Philippines and Vietnam, . which also have disputes with China in the South China Sea. ‘We shouldn't see this as an issue that only concerns Japan,’ he said.

After decades of embarrassing the neighbours, the scruffiest house in Britain has, well, turned over a new leaf. The previous owner went 20 years without trimming the ivy that covered the outside of the property – until eventually it started to invade the inside too. By the time the house went on the market last year, it had an asking price of just £120,000 in a street where better-kept homes often fetch three times as much. Engulfed: Ivy covered the entire front of the house, including the garden and the wall, and had become a 'tourist attraction' in the area . But fortunately for fed-up residents, the new owner was not so content to rest on his laurels. The house has been stripped of the . ivy, renovated inside and out at a cost of tens of thousands, and is now . up for sale for £350,000. Hard work: Once all the ivy had been removed from the outside and inside of the house, the owner faced thousands of pounds of further refurbishment to make it inhabitable . Extreme home makeover: After massive restoration work, the house is now for sale for £350,000 - nearly three times the original price . One neighbour said: ‘We are so relieved. 'People would stop their cars to . stare at it and whilst it may have looked amusing, I honestly believe it . was having an impact on the house prices along the road.’ It took a team of workmen more than a . week just to strip the ivy from the three-bedroom house in Chelmsford, . Essex, after insurance company chairman Neil Utley bought it in August . last year. At the time, he said: ‘I could not even see the house – just a house shape underneath the ivy. 'There was as much ivy on the inside as well so the house was completely dark, with no lights and no power.’ Then: The ivy-covered house looks tattered and scruffy next to the neighbours . Now: With the ivy removed the house has nearly trebled in value, much to the joy of both owner and neighbours . Before: Neighbours were complaining that the 'Ivy House' was dragging down the value of their properties . After: The house now matches the others built in the same style on the street .","The 'Ivy House' is on the market for £350,000 after makeover .

Approachable: Ms Trierweiler, 47, chatted with the protestors in Angers, western France, this weekend and was even asked to deliver a letter to her partner, President Francois Hollande . French First Lady Valerie Trierweiler is at the centre of a fresh political scandal after meeting opponents of a new airport - in defiance of the prime minister's support for the project. Ms Trierweiler is accused of trying to undermine PM Jean-Marc Ayrault's authority by consorting with the protestors in Angers, western France, this weekend. The new multi-billion pound airport in Nantes is due for completion in 2017 and has even been dubbed the 'Ayrault-port', a play on the prime minister's name, because of his fierce backing. But socialist President Francois Hollande's 47-year-old partner was happy to chat to three opponents' representatives, who also asked her to deliver a letter of protest to her boyfriend, activist group Greenpeace said. It is the latest in a catalogue of blunders by Ms Trierweiler, who was recently branded a 'meddler' and 'nothing more than the president's mistress' by one right-wing MP. Opposition MP Xavier Bertrand has now described her meeting with airport opponents as 'very serious'. He added: 'This was not an innocent gesture. What is she trying to do, further undermine the position of Jean-Marc Ayrault? 'And if so, was it her idea or the president's?' Last week, outspoken French MP Bernard Debre issued another dramatic put-down of Ms Trierweiler after she gave her public support for gay marriages. He wrote on his website: 'Madame Trierweiler, self-proclaimed First Lady, is nothing more than the President's mistress. 'What is she meddling in? What right does she have to speak out? 'When one is in her position, after the blunders she has already made, it would be much better it she shut up.' Ayrault-port: Ms Trierweiler was accused of trying to undermine the authority of PM Jean-Marc Ayrault, pictured, who is fiercely backing the project . The 68-year-old MP for Paris also said her job as a journalist was 'incompatible' with her role as the President's partner. He added: 'She might well want to get into politics, but she should stop being a journalist and define her position at the Elysee Palace.' The First Lady has been the target of repeated media attacks since her boyfriend was elected president in May. She was at the centre of accusations she tried to wreck the political career of Segolene Royal - the mother of Mr Hollande's four children - by tweeting her support for a candidate standing against her in the parliamentary elections. Ms Royal lost the election and later said she had been 'stabbed in the back' by Mr Hollande's girlfriend. The French leader's former partner of 28 years went on to accuse Mr Trierweiler of costing her a place in Mr Hollande's cabinet. Environmentalists: Ms Trierweiler met with the protesters in Angers, western France, They have erected barricades, pictured, to block building work in Notre-Dames-des-Landes . Ms Trierweiler also faced humiliation last month when her boss at a French magazine said she would be sacked at the end of this year. Unpopular: The First Lady has been the target of repeated media attacks since Mr Hollande, left, was elected president in May. Glossy weekly Paris Match's owner Arnaud Lagardere described her as 'an unpinned grenade' who has caused him 'nothing but trouble' and said he would not be renewing her contract in January. Mr Lagardere's comments were published in a biography of the millionaire media tycoon by journalist Jacqueline Remy. Ms Remy said it was suggested to Mr Lagardere in June that having the French First Lady as an employee would surely help him get 'the ear of the president'. But he is quoted as replying: 'Are you kidding? Up until now, she's caused us nothing but problems.' He went on: 'She's like an unpinned grenade.' Paris Match would be 'letting her go' next year to avoid any 'conflict of interest', he added. She is also demanding £70,000 in damages over a book that alleges she cheated on her husband with two lovers at once. Ms Trierweiler was the shared mistress of left-wing President Francois Hollande and a right-wing minister while she was married, the biography called The Troublemaker claimed. A separate book about Ms Trierweiler called Between Two Fires, by investigative journalist Anna Cabana, describes her 'a cocktail of jealousy, vengeance and political calculation'. In a third book about her called The Favourite, journalist Laurent Greilsamer writes: 'As I see it, you have shown yourself to be not normal, snooty, infatuated, explosive, unpredictable. And visibly dangerous.'","Francois Hollande's girlfriend met the protestors in Angers, western France .

'Sending strong signal': U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta gave the go-ahead today for two Patriot missile batteries and 400 troops to be sent to Turkey to defend against the threat of Syrian rocket attacks . U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta gave an order today to send two Patriot missile batteries to Turkey with 400 American personnel to operate them in a move by NATO members to bolster Turkey's defences against the threat of Syrian rockets. The go-ahead was signed shortly before Panetta arrived on an unannounced visit to Turkey to meet American troops stationed at the Incirlik Air Base, the last stop on a week-long trip that took him to Afghanistan and Kuwait. 'The purpose of this deployment is to signal very strongly that the United States, working closely with our NATO allies, is going to support the defense of Turkey, especially with potential threats emanating from Syria,' spokesman George Little said. NATO-member Turkey has repeatedly . scrambled jets along the countries' joint frontier and responded in kind . when shells from the Syrian conflict came down inside its borders, . fanning fears that the civil war could spread to destabilise the region. The widely expected U.S. move follows . similar steps by Germany and the Netherlands, which also said they will . send two Patriot batteries. The three countries are the only NATO . nations with the most modern type of Patriots. Little declined to say where the U.S. batteries would be located and said the systems would be deployed to . Turkey for an unspecified amount of time. 'We expect them to be deployed in the coming weeks,' Little said. NATO approved Turkey's request for air . defence batteries on December 4, in a move meant to calm its fears of . coming under missile attack, possibly with chemical weapons, from Syria. The Patriot system is designed to intercept aircraft or missiles. NATO says the measure is purely . defensive, but Russia, Syria and Iran have criticised the decision, . saying it increases regional instability. The decision comes days after the Syrian government escalated hostilities with rebel forces by firing more than six scud missiles. Scroll down for video . Rising tensions: The decision to send Patriot missiles (seen here during the Iraq war in 2003) to Turkey comes amid fears the civil war could spread to destabilise the region . Escalating conflict: The decision comes days after the Syrian government escalated hostilities by firing more than six scud missiles (like these Iraqi ones seen in 2003) at rebel forces . The . attacks are thought to have been the first time President Bashar . Assad's military has used missiles to attack insurgents during the . two-year conflict. U.S. officials said Assad's troops fired several missiles over the last few . days, suggesting the embattled president's forces are attempting . new ways to stop opposition fighters. The missiles were fired from the city of Damascus towards northern Syria on the same day . that more than 100 countries recognised a . new Syrian opposition coalition. The political move will further alienate Assad's . regime and will allow more humanitarian assistance to be given to the . forces battling to oust him. Carnage: Syrian cities, such as Homs (pictured), have been left in ruin by the two-year conflict between President Assad's government forces and rebel fighters . Escalating violence: The use of Scud missiles are thought to have been the first time President Bashar Assad's military has used missiles to attack insurgents during the conflict . The . bloody battle in Syria has already resulted in 40,000 deaths and the . conflict has threatened political stability in the Middle East. The U.S. official who revealed the missile use said there was no indication . that chemical weapons were aboard the missiles. There had been fears . over the past week that rebel advances were prompting Assad . to consider using chemical weapons. The official said that more than six missiles had been fired so far - believed to be scud missiles. Violence: Smoke rises after an air strike apparently carried out by the Syrian Air Force in Erbeen near Damascus . Scuds are most often used as a defensive weapon and were often employed by Saddam Hussein's forces during the Persian Gulf War. Meanwhile, Russia's foreign ministry has denied reports that a top diplomat said Syrian president Bashar Assad is losing control of his country. It said in a statement today that deputy foreign minister Mikhail Bogdanov 'has not made any statements or special interviews recently' on Syria but was simply citing the stance of the Syrian opposition while giving a speech yesterday. Russian state-owned news agencies had quoted Mr Bogdanov as saying that rebels might win the civil war, a comment that appeared to dramatically shift Russia's stance on Syria. The US later commended Russia for 'waking up to the reality' by acknowledging the regime's impending fall. Analysts viewed the diplomat's statement as Russia's attempt to begin positioning itself for Assad's eventual defeat.","Two Patriot missile batteries and 400 personnel to bolster NATO operation .

A mother-to-be was stunned when 'barbaric' passengers on a packed tram refused to give up their tram seat - even though she is eight months' pregnant and needs crutches to walk. Meenakshi Minnis, 31, found all the seats were taken when she boarded the service at Deansgate-Castlefield on her way home to Timperley. Mrs Minnis asked passengers on the tram if they would give up their seat - but no-one moved.

Mrs Minnis, who is expecting her second child, says she had asked Metrolink staff to find her a seat but they failed to help her. Mrs Minnis said: 'I am a regular customer with Metrolink and I need a seat because the movement of the tram causes problems with my balance. It was very busy and I let one tram go by because it was packed. 'There were about 10 staff on the platform and when the second tram arrived it was also busy, so I asked a member of staff if she would help me find a seat. She looked at me as if I was being unreasonable.' Mrs Minnis, who needs crutches to help her walk because of a pelvic condition linked to her pregnancy, complained to tram bosses after the journey on November 11. She says she has not had an official response. Mrs Minnis, who lives with husband David and their three-year-old son Dilan said: 'I think it is important to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else. This needs to be addressed. 'I ended up standing and nearly most my balance - if I had fallen it could have been really serious.' Mike Mabey, head of passenger services at Metrolink, said officials had reviewed CCTV and found a member of staff did ask passengers to give up their seats, but no one was willing to do so.

Frustration: Mrs Minnis, who needs crutches to help her walk because of a pelvic condition linked to her pregnancy, complained to tram bosses after the journey on November 11.

'Mrs Minnis should not have had to ask for a seat in the first place - but the fact she did and still no-one got up is frankly barbaric. 'There may be set conventions about standing up for the elderly or pregnant which were common 30 years ago, but people are selfish and glued to their mobile phones now.

A knifeman who tried to kill two police officers with a meat cleaver after storming into a butchers and demanding ‘Give me a chopper!’ faces being sent indefinitely to Broadmoor. Christopher Haughton lashed out with a knife at policemen who cornered him in the shop and continued to injure the officers after they tried to restrain him. Haughton, 33, of Wembley, north London, was convicted at the Old Bailey of the attempted murders of PCs Alistair Hinchliff and Thomas Harding. He was also found guilty of assaulting six other officers. Judge Peter Beaumont, the Recorder of London, said Haughton would be ordered to remain at Broadmoor hospital without limit of time, later this week. Haughton, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, injured three officers during an incident in October, last year. He was allowed bail but in November, he caused chaos when he launched his knife attack at a halal butcher’s in Kingsbury, north London, the following month. He was heard chanting ‘God help me to kill my enemies’ moments before the attack. The police were called and when two officers tried to speak to him, the 33-year-old, who was armed with a ten-inch butcher’s knife, refused to calm down and bit one of them on the arm before throwing bricks at him injuring his hand. As back-up arrived, Haughton made his way towards the butcher’s shop but stopped to throw a breeze block at the patrol car’s windscreen and tins of baked beans grabbed from a shop at pursuing officers. He then stormed into a Halal butchers screaming 'Give me a chopper! Give me a chopper!' before he grabbed the knife and turned on officers who feared he may attack innocent workers or shoppers. Attacked: Pictured left to right are Alastair Hinchliff, Andrew Robb, John Charlton, Tom Harding and Sham Haque who were involved in the incident in a butcher's . One officer, PC Thomas Harding, tried to . pin him down with a riot shield but Haughton managed to straddle him . and repeatedly stabbed the officer who wore a stab proof vest until one . blow pierced below the protection into his bowel. As another officer, PC Alastair . Hinchliff, pushed Haughton off PC Harding, he too fell to the floor and . Haughton slashed him across the left side of his face from temple to ear . with the knife penetrating his cheek into the mouth. He then stabbed PC Hinchliff in the . upper and lower arm exposing the muscle and tendons of the arm as other . officers struck him with their batons with no effect. Haughton then lashed out twice cutting across PC Andre Robb’s knee. 'Despite . his continued violence' officers managed to pin him against the meat . counter but as they tried to cuff him, Haughton attempted to stab PC . Shaun Haque in the neck but an officer managed to grab his wrists. Incident: Police cordoned off the scene after the stabbings in Kingsbury, north west London. Medical supplies can be seen strewn across the road . Evidence: PC Stephen Barker, seen arriving at the Old Bailey, said Christopher Haughton bit him and tore his sleeve off with his teeth . Prosecutor Ed Brown QC said: 'The . scene was a dreadful one - officers very badly injured, some critically . so and blood everywhere from their injuries, with police and ambulance . personnel doing what they could to give first aid to the officers before . they were rushed to hospital' Uninjured officers succeeded in handcuffing the defendant, placing him in leg restraints and he was taken to a police van. As he was bundled into it he shouted . 'Kill me, kill me, I want to die. I want to come back as Freddie Kruger . and added 'F*****g pigs, I hope you all die, and all your children die.' After he was finally subdued by . officers with riot shields, Haughton spat mouthfuls of blood at them and . said he was HIV positive, boasting: ‘I love giving women AIDS.’ Edward Brown, QC, prosecuting, told . the court that some of the officers now found it difficult to attend . incidents where a knife might be involved. Previous attack: Haughton allegedly bit WPC Vicky Vincent in her thigh drawing blood and spat blood into WPC Alison Spruce’s face when they visited his home following a noise complaint . PC Harding had 9inches of intestine removed after he was stabbed in the stomach through a shield. He suffered 'unspeakable pain' and thought he was going to die. PC Hinchliff, who was stabbed in the . face and arm when he went to help his colleague, said he had been left . with scars on his face. Mr Brown said: 'He tends to shy away from incidents when mention is made of someone carrying a knife.' Mr Brown told the trial: 'Some of the . officers suffered very significant injuries indeed, all the result of . this defendant’s violence. 'It was perhaps only a matter of very good fortune that some of the police officers escaped with their lives.' The Police Federation said the case highlighted the need to speed up the roll-out of Taser stun guns to frontline officers. Currently only officers with specialist firearms training can use the weapons in the Met. As police tried to put Haughton into handcuffs he attempted to stab another officer in the neck . Paul Davis, secretary of the . organisation operational policing sub-committee, said: ‘We believe that . all frontline officers should have access to Tasers while on duty and . have requested that the number available be trebled from 12,000 to . 36,000. ‘The reduction of police officer . numbers has meant officers are less likely to have backup, making them . more vulnerable to attack. ‘It is therefore imperative they have the equipment needed to protect themselves and the public.’ Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said . he wanted to see the 50,000 volt weapons carried in day-to-day response . cars following Haughton’s attack. In pre-trial legal hearings Haughton . claimed he was Jesus Christ and police were trying to stop him in his . work of urging gang members to lay down their arms. Haughton claimed he was insane and had acted in the way he did because police were trying to kill him. Haughton was also convicted of ABH on . WPC Vicky Vincent and common assault on WPC Alison Spruce just a month . before in October 2011. Police had been called to Haughton’s . bedsit in Streatham, south London, as he played loud music, brandished a . samurai sword and threatened other residents forcing them to flee. When one resident complained about the . music, Haughton pushed him down the stairs and then tried to kick in all . the bedsit doors, causing £2,500 of damage. When officers arrived he charged at . them armed with a broom and in the violent struggle officers had to use . CS spray to subdue him. Before launching his attack, Haughton went into a butcher's shop where he took a ten-inch knife, it was claimed in court . However, he still managed to bite WPC . Vincent in her thigh drawing blood and only let go when another officer . whacked him on his shoulders with a baton. He then spat blood into WPC Alison Spruce’s face. Psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph said . Haughton had been suffering from mental illness, but he would have been . aware what he was doing was wrong and was in control of his actions. Haughton denied assaulting PC Alison . Spruce and causing actual bodily harm to PC Vicky Vincent during the . arrest in Streatham on October 9 and was convicted by unanimous . verdicts. He was also convicted of the attempted murder of PCs Harding and Hinchliff by a majority verdict of 11-1. He was further convicted of wounding . PC Robb with intent and attempting to wound PC Haque with intent, also . by majority verdicts of 11-1.

The potential end of the world on December 21, as predicted by the Mayan calendar, has generated a mixture of different reactions from people. For some the famous date is an excuse for a party, others are simply treating it as another day, while one group of people - known as 'preppers' - have been stocking up on supplies in expectation of the apocalypse. Now British authorities, in a bid to quell fears of doomsday, have issued light-hearted advice on how best to respond to the potential crisis, such as installing a fire alarm and listening out for weather forecasts. End of the world? Opinion is divided about an apparant Mayan prediction that the world will end on Dec 21 . On it’s website, NASA has posted the following explanation for why the world won’t end on December 21, 2012: . Contrary to some of the common beliefs out there, the claims behind the end of the world quickly unravel when pinned down to the 2012 timeline. The story started with claims that Nibiru, a supposed planet discovered by the Sumerians, is headed toward Earth. This catastrophe was initially predicted for May 2003, but when nothing happened the doomsday date was moved forward to December 2012 and linked to the end of one of the cycles in the ancient Mayan calendar at the winter solstice in 2012 - hence the predicted doomsday date of December 21, 2012. The world will not end in 2012. Our planet has been getting along just fine for more than four billion years, and credible scientists worldwide know of no threat associated with 2012. The deadpan advice comes with less than two weeks to go until the date of the apocalypse, according to some interpretations of the Ancient Mayan calendar. It follows an official US government . blog this week, which described the prediction that a planet is on a crash course with Earth as 'just rumours' and insisted that 'the . world will not end on December 21, 2012, or any day in 2012'. What form annihilation will take remains the topic of hot speculation on the internet, with possible scenarios ranging from a Noah-like great flood to a rogue planet smashing into Earth. The UK institutions confirmed they had the necessary capacity to deal with any unusual events that might occur and, with tongues firmly in cheeks, put forward some specific suggestions for survival. A London Fire Brigade spokesman said: 'Fit a smoke alarm on each level of your home, then at least you might stand a chance of knowing that the end of the world is nigh ahead of those who don’t. 'If you survive the apocalypse you’ll be alerted to a fire more quickly should one ever break out.' The AA advised: 'Before heading off, take time to do the basic checks on your car and allow extra time for your journey. 'Local radio is a good source of traffic and weather updates and for any warnings of an impending apocalypse. Should the announcer break such solemn news, try to remain focused on the road ahead and keep your hands on the wheel.' An RSPCA spokesman added: 'Luckily for animals, they do not have the same fears of the future - or its imminent destruction - as us humans, so it is unlikely that our pets will be worrying about the end of the world. 'However, should the Mayans prove to be right, our message would be to spend whatever time you have left with your animals wisely. Lighthearted advice for coping with the end of the world includes fitting extra smoke detectors and listening to weather forecasts on the radio . Ancient signs: The doomsday fears are based on misinterpretations of the Mayan calendar, say NASA . 'Take them for a long walk or give them a cuddle. Enjoy every second you have with them as if it was your last!' Other bodies including British Transport Police and Dorset Fire and Rescue Service confirmed they were prepared for any event that may occur on December 21. However, one expert offered reassurance that the prediction was a misinterpretation of ancient artefacts. Professor Mark Van Stone, the author of 2012: Science And Prophecy Of The Ancient Maya, traces the start of the 2012 apocalypse prophecy back to 1904, when German scholars said a Mayan picture of a sky dragon pouring water from above proved they were predicting a great flood. Other predictions then made it into subsequent academic books on the Maya and soon became enshrined in popular mythology. The RSPCA has recommended spending quality time with pets should a Mayan prophecy about the end of the world come true on Dec 21 . Prof Van Stone, who teaches art history at Southwestern College, California, said the speculation comes down to a few inscriptions that indicate the Ancient Mayan calendar has been counting down since 3114BC and will hit zero on December 21. He told the Press Association: 'The Maya indicated there was a 5,000-year cycle that ended on a creation date. Scholars, and eventually everyone else, inferred that when the calendar reached that date again in 2012 that it would stop. 'When I started writing my book, I thought that I would find evidence to support the scholarly idea that the clock would actually stop this time. It seems very reasonable. But in fact I found no evidence the Maya ever thought that. I found several examples that suggest the opposite.' When the calendar reaches zero on December 21 it will just restart, according to Prof Van Stone. He added: 'I say this to people who are believers: Okay, have a great time, I’ll see you in 2013. 'The Maya did not predict any end. The Maya expected the future to go on for ever. So don’t worry.' NASA scientists say fears about the impending end of the world are based on misinterpretations of the Mayan calendar . Numerous websites and Facebook groups promoting the Mayan prediction and providing so-called evidence can be found online. A small French village called Bugarach has been earmarked by some as the only place to go to guarantee surviving the apocalypse. The December 21 apocalypse is not the first prediction and it is unlikely to be the last, if Prof Van Stone proves correct. The countdown to the millennium was awash with fears that the Y2K bug would send computer systems into meltdown with devastating consequences. Such was the uncertainty over what would happen when the clock struck midnight that then president Bill Clinton signed into law the Y2K Liability Bill to help businesses prepare. Then there was American pastor Harold Camping, who predicted Armageddon not once but twice last year. Yet both May 21 and October 21, 2011 passed without incident. The Scouts are renowned for always being prepared for a crisis. Here Simon Carter, assistant director of the Scouts, gives his top tips for surviving an apocalypse. Get into a team: 'You need to work with others to . survive. You are stronger together as a team because you have . complementary sets of skills. 'One person might be particularly good at . building shelters, another setting traps. It is about pooling skills and . experience. If you are thinking about setting off alone, find some . friends and quickly. 'Not only does your physical condition depend on it, . your mental health will too. Humans are tribal people and they work . better in teams having people to talk to.' Brush up on basic skills: 'If you are a Scout, you know how to . light a fire, how to cook, how to make a shelter. Those basic skills are . really important and you can learn them very quickly. 'There are . probably going to be no computers or electricity in the post-apocalyptic . world so get a basic essential guide, there are loads around in the . library. 'Scouting For Boys was written in 1908 but it will . still be relevant after the apocalypse. It is the most likely tool for . survival that people can find easily.' Come up with a plan: 'You need both a short-term plan and a . long-term plan. In the short term, it is about getting food, water and . shelter. In the long term, you need to think about what you are going to . do in two, three, four, five years’ time. 'Having enthusiasm and a plan . gives hope, and hope keeps you alive. The longer-term plan is about . creating a better and more tolerant world. I know that sounds terrible . esoteric if you’re in a world that has just finished, but that is what . gives you hope for the future.'","In a bid to quell fears about a possible doomsday scenario, British authorities have issued some not very serious advice .

Three car parking spaces in the exclusive Cornish resort of St Ives have been sold at auction for a staggering combined total of £161,000. The two remaining parking bays in the same lot, all measuring just 20ft  (6.1m) by 8ft (2.4m),  attracted offers of £50,000 each - but failed to sell as the bids did not meet the reserve prices set by the owners. The three that did sell went for £55,000, £56,000 and £50,000. The princely sum paid for each is more than double the average £22,000 a year wage in the county. Pricey: Three of the spaces sold individually for £55,000, £56,000 and £50,000. The remaining pair attracted bids of £50,000 each but failed to make the reserve price and will now be sold by private negotiation . For the two lots which didn't reach their reserves individual sales are expected to be agreed privately within the next 24 hours. The open-air parking spaces on  Barnoon Terrace - overlooking the picturesque Carbis Bay . - were sold with the condition that they must be used solely as a car . park, with no scope for building, the auction was told. Expensive: Bradleys Estate Agents brochure detailing the five parking spaces for sale in St. Ives . Chris Baxter, director of Bradleys estate agents, said the going price for each of the lots indicated the importance of a parking space in the town, a preferred holiday destination for thousands of people every year. The spaces are roughly 30 seconds walking distance from the beach and the town centre. Mr Baxter said: '(The auction) tells me that despite the recession and credit crunch, if you look at the last 30 years, property prices pretty much without fail have gone up in price. 'Clearly in St Ives, it’s a diminishing asset with a higher demand so in effect you’re looking at a price that’s going up yearly. 'We are talking about an area where property is happily fetching £500,000 - £700,000 - if not more. 'If you haven’t got a car parking space, £50,000 is a small price to pay for that extra amenity.' Successful bidders were also made to pay a premium of £5,000 plus VAT. Mr Baxter added: 'It was slightly unusual, but I think it was quite a successful day.' But in a time of austerity the move has less than impressed everyone in the area. Speaking about the lots when they went up for auction, town councillor Andrew Mitchell said: 'It sticks in the throat of local people. 'It . shows the mismatch in St Ives and many other Cornish villages and towns . between the local population on low wages and seasonal jobs and second . home owners. 'It is ridiculous that many of those that live here can't afford a home. They can't even afford one of these parking spaces.'. The five parking spaces on Barnoon Terrance, pictured, overlook the sea. Three have been sold at auction for a combined total of £161,000, while private deals are expected on the remaining two . The guide price for each space was set three months after another space was bought for £55,000 in the town. Located . on Tregenna Hill, it is thought to have been sold to a second home . owner in desperate need for an additional space in town. And that was not the first space to go up for sale. Not much for your money: The parking space which went for an astonishing £55,000 a few months ago .

Two years ago, another parking space in the town went for a whopping £60,000 and one three years before that sold for a comparatively meagre £24,000. All of the sales in the seaside resort pale in comparison to what is thought to have been the most costly space - which went on the market for an incredible $1million in New York earlier this year. Buying that bay would be equivalent to paying a $115 ticket for illegal parking every day for 24 years.","The spaces in St Ives sold for £55,000, £56,000 and £50,000 at auction .

Motorists are breaking down in cold weather because of a possible contamination problem with some diesel fuel, says the AA. They are investigating to see how widespread the problem is – most critically whether a rogue batch of contaminated fuel is to blame or whether the problems are limited to one or more specific filling stations. The AA said it had received call-outs from a number of stricken motorists complaining that their cars suddenly felt ‘sluggish’ soon after a fill-up. Fuel contamination: AA said it had received call-outs from a number of stricken motorists complaining that their cars suddenly felt 'sluggish' soon after a fill-up . The problem is centred around the north east of England, it said. One woman driver from Ripon in North Yorkshire who contacted the Mail said her problems began not long after she had filled up at a Morrison’s supermarket in the town. She said: ‘I left home at ten past eight on probably the coldest morning yet this year. ‘My car felt a bit sluggish for about 2 miles particularly going uphill. It then lost power completely. Fortunately I was able to steer into the side of the road so I was relatively safe. ‘But the AA said that due to the high volume of calls that morning, it was unable to get to me for two hours. I was freezing by that time. ‘I must say that the AA man was fantastic – both friendly and extremely efficient.’ She said the AA patrol told her there had been a spate of similar incidents, that they all caused the vehicles to lose power and slow down and that the fuel was the suspected source of the problem. Too cold for cars: Motorists are breaking down in cold weather because of a possible contamination problem with some diesel fuel, says the AA . An AA spokesman said: ‘It is true that we have been getting reports of this problem of cars driving sluggishly after a fill-up. We don’t know exactly what’s causing it. ‘Sometimes the garage fuel tanks get contaminated. In more serious cases it can be a contaminated batch. ‘It does happen from time to time. This time it seems to be emanating from the north east. We are investigating. Our technical have been getting calls about it and it is being investigated.’ He said: ‘It’s not always killing cars completely. It seems to make them sluggish. We’re keeping tabs on it.’ The solution is to clean out the fuel tanks of cars affected by contamination and clean the filters. The AA spokesman added: ‘Our advice to drivers is to keep your receipt so you can be reimbursed or compensated for any work that is needed to repair the car.’ Morrisons said it was unaware of any complaints from its customers in the north east or Ripon in relation to fuel but would investigate further. Filling up faults: In 2007 a batch of rogue contaminated fuel caused widespread problems and drivers were angry when their cars developed faults after filling up at Tesco, Morrisons and Asda forecourts across the south east of England and East Anglia . In February 2007 a batch of rogue contaminated fuel caused widespread problems across the south east of England and East Anglia. Drivers reacted with fury when their cars developed faults after filling up at Tesco, Morrisons and Asda forecourts across the region. The supermarkets were faced with compensation claims running into millions of pounds. Many drivers said their cars started 'kangaroo jumping' or ground to a halt shortly after taking on the petrol. Most of the affected motors suffered damaged sensors, which are used to regulate emissions, with repair bills ranging from £200 to £1,000. The fuel was found to have been contaminated by high levels of silicon and the rogue batch was traced to a storage depot in the Thurrock area of Essex. At the time, the Daily Mail revealed exclusively how petrol wholesaler Harvest Energy - which supplied Asda - was at the centre of the investigation into tainted fuel. It shared its refining and storage tanks at the Vopak refinery on the Thames Estuary in Essex with rival wholesaler Greenergy, which supplied Tesco and Morrisons.","AA said it had received call-outs from a number of motorists complaining that their cars suddenly felt 'sluggish' soon after a fill-up .

Generous benefactors who lent treasures to a British museum have discovered they may have been sold by the museum which has since closed. The relics were loaned to the British and Empire Commonwealth Museum as part of an exhibition telling the story of Britain's colonial heritage. But it has now emerged that 144 items are unaccounted for and at least one, a 19th Century maritime oil painting belonging to Lord Caldecote, has been sold for £61,000. Sold: This painting of the Honourable East India Company's ship Dunira passing Funchal Bay was sold at Christie's . Trustees of the museum, which has now closed, are currently in talks with eight owners about compensation. The embarrassing situation appears to have arisen from a mix-up over whether the items were given or just loaned to the museum in Bristol. Lord Caldecote said he had only learnt of the sale after he asked for the painting to be returned following his father's death. He said: 'I contacted the museum and asked, ""Could we have the painting back?"" and unfortunately, they said ""No, this painting was given to the museum"". 'We subsequently discovered it had been sold by Christie's on behalf of the museum. 'I said ""No, this is not right because we have a document here that clearly shows it was loaned to the museum, not given"".' Now closed: The former British Empire & Commonwealth Museum at Temple Meads, Bristol, shut in 2008 . Relics of former glory: The museum was set up to tell the story of Britain's colonial past . Lord Caldecote said his later father had loaned the painting to the museum, which opened in Isambard Kingdom Brunel's original Temple Meads station in 2002. The artwork depicts the East India Company ship, the Dunira, and was painted by sailor-turned-artist Thomas Buttersworth - Lord Caldecote's great, great grandfather who captained the ship. The artwork was sold at auction by Christie's to the government of Portugese island Madeira - pictured in the background - when the museum closed in 2008. Telling our story: Plans to move the museum to London fell through . Lord Caldecote said: 'I suppose the museum is to blame, because they didn't have a proper stock check and maybe somebody in the museum went, shall we say, off-piste rather than follow all the correct procedures.' The situation was exposed in an investigation by the BBC's Inside Out West programme, to be aired tonight. Bristol City Council, which is in charge of the museum's exhibits after its closure in 2008, said they could not say how many items were missing because they did not have a full audit to compare the past and present collections. However the museum's trustees revealed that 144 loan items were still unaccounted for. The latest accounts for the museum show that former director, Gareth Griffiths, had undertaken a number of 'unauthorised transactions' but said there was no suggestion anyone had made personal profits from the sales. Griffiths, who was dismissed in February 2011, insisted that the care and security of the collection was the trustees' responsibility. He added that any objects were disposed of with the knowledge and agreement of the trustees and that the receipts were fully audited. He said: 'I never benefited from any sales of material and will regard any such inference as actionable.' The BBC programme also traced several other items that went missing from a collection gifted to the museum in 2003 by the former Commonwealth Institute. One item, a statuette of John Robert Godley, the founder of Christchurch in New Zealand, was sold alongside others by an unknown dealer. A report by the Metropolitan Police, which investigated claims that the statue and other items were being sold by a dealer in London, said the trader took about 150 items and paid the museum £115,000. Missing: Bristol City Council is now in charge of the former museum's exhibits . The trader has since returned some items including the statue. Sir Neil Cossons, who took over as chairman of the board of trustees, said there was no authorisation for the sales and the trustees had not known. He said: 'There was no authorisation at all of any of the material that went to the London dealer and certainly not of the Dunira painting. 'These are items that went from our possession without the knowledge or the authority of the trustees and a large part of the time the trustees have been spending since our director was dismissed has been trying to get to the bottom of those issues. 'The difficulty is that trustees are not generally speaking in the day-to-day management and operation of the enterprise for which they are trustees. 'And in our case we delegated to a responsible, paid director with some staff and all the indications were that this was a professional doing a professional job.' He added that it was fair to say that 'dozens' of items were unaccounted for, but also admitted that the total may never be known precisely. The museum opened in 2002 in Isambard Kingdom Brunel's original Temple Meads station and won a string of awards. However the museum struggled to attract enough visitors to make it financially viable, and plans to rescue it by moving it to London fell through. The site in Bristol was chosen because of the historic connection with the empire, through voyages of exploration, trade - including slavery - piracy, shipbuilding and the railways.","British & Empire Commonwealth Museum closed four years ago .

One year after Trista Reynolds was told her then-20-month-old daughter Ayla had gone missing, the Maine mother says her pain while still not knowing where her baby is, hasn't grown much dimmer. 'It’s still painful, but I have been able to cope a lot better lately,' she told the Bangor Daily News this week. 'There are days I can’t even hear her voice anymore ... That’s not OK.' The case of Ayla Reynolds – which drew national attention as hundreds of searchers looked for her last December in the central Maine town of Waterville – remains open despite police earlier this year determining, without a body recovered, that she's dead. Recovering from heartbreak: Mother Trista Reynolds expresses her lasting heartbreak in losing her then 20-month-old daughter Ayla, one year ago this week . No end: Trista Reynolds, looks through a family photo album at her home in Gorham, Maine, showing her daughter, Ayla Reynolds, 2, who went missing on December 16 of 2011 . 'Sometimes I feel like they're just kind of giving up on it,' said Ms Reynolds. 'You know, Ayla has been missing for a year, and what answers do they have for anybody? None.' Today Ms Reynolds' daughter Ayla would be . the same age as her 20-month-old son, Ayla's younger brother, Raymond. She credits him for keeping her . together. Nationally, about 800,000 children and teens are reported missing each year, said Robert Lowery from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Most are soon resolved in all states, but the number of unresolved cases is uncommonly low in Maine, a mostly rural state with a low crime rate. Ayla, a toddler with bright blue eyes and a bright smile, was at her father’s home on December 17 when first reported missing. Mystery: Ayla Reynolds, of Waterville, Maine, . was reported missing by her father . Justin DiPietro, who told police he last saw her when he put her to bed . the previous night . The disappearance prompted a massive . search by Waterville and state police, game wardens, and FBI agents who . canvassed neighborhoods and lowered several streams. Police . announced that they didn't think Ayla was abducted from her bedroom. They also confirmed the presence of her blood in the home and said the . father, Justin DiPietro, and two other adults in the home that night . know more than they've told detectives, creating an air of suspicion. DiPietro declined to comment for this story. Each . month in Maine, police receive more than 100 calls about missing . children, most of whom are runaways and return home in a day or two. Over the past four decades, that adds up to thousands of runaways, along . with kids who become lost or are abducted. Only . Ayla's and two other cases involving young children remain unsolved in . Maine, said Stephen McCausland, state police spokesman. Three-year-old . Doug Chapman was last seen playing with his toy trucks in a sand pile . behind his family's home in 1971 in Alfred. When his mother went outside . to check on him, he had vanished. Road workers nearby didn't see . anything. Two bloodhounds tracked his scent to the road. Mom: Ayla, right, was in her father's custody while her mother, Trista Reynolds, left, checked into a 10-day rehab programme . Carole . Anne Allen, Doug's mother, sympathizes with Trista Reynolds because . she's been there. Wardens and police searched the woods but found no . evidence of Doug, not even his loafers, which he had trouble keeping on . his feet. The first year, she said, was the worst. Someone . stayed near the phone at all times. She didn't know how to act. She . didn't want to give up. But law enforcement gave her little hope. 'That's . the worst thing. There is no closure. It's like every day you think you . see a person who's about the age he would be now. And you think, `Could . he be my son? Is my son in the woods where he died? Or is he alive . somewhere?' Forty-one years later, I'm still looking,' she said. Another . child, 4-year-old Kurt Ronald Newton, of Manchester, disappeared four . years later from a campground near the Canadian border. That case also . led to a massive search, but the boy was never found. He father declined . to talk about it for this story. Part . of Trista Reynolds' healing was to move to a small town outside of . Portland, where she lives with her toddler son and her boyfriend. She . said she's no longer confronted with daily reminders of Ayla, as she was . in Portland, where the two had lived. She's also seeing a therapist. She's addressed her substance abuse – which led to Ayla being placed . with DiPietro in Waterville, 75 miles away – and she's in a better place . as she cares for 20-month-old Raymond. Grim discovery: Ayla's blood was found in DiPietro's home during a police investigation, but no one has been charged in the case . 'I'm . trying to keep in the spirit of things,' she says of her home, which is . decorated for the holidays. 'Even if my sprits aren't way up, I've got . to be up for him,' she said of Raymond, a blond bundle of energy who . enjoys dancing to Maroon 5's 'Moves like Jagger,' just as his sister . Ayla did. While Ayla's disappearance remains a mystery, Reynolds questions whether 'mystery' is the right word. Reynolds . said police confirmed to her that DiPietro walked out of an interview . when he was confronted with photos showing Ayla's blood in the basement. They also confirmed that before dialing 911 the morning that Ayla was . reported missing, DiPietro called his friend, an insurance agent who . wrote a life insurance policy on Ayla. State . police have declined to comment, other than to say they're not giving . up. Police planned to discuss the case at a news conference Friday. It's difficult for Reynolds to accept that Ayla may be dead, as police now believe. In . Alfred, Allen still thinks daily about her son. She wonders if he was . taken by someone who wanted a child, or became a victim of a crime, or . simply became lost in the woods. Anguish: Trista Reynolds, right, is overcome by grief as she is hugged by friend Laurie Boissonneault during a vigil for Ayla . She said she has a window into how Reynolds must feel. 'Don't . tell me my boy is dead unless you have a body, because I don't want to . go there,' she said. 'You don't want to give up hope.' In May, law . enforcement officials said for the first time that they believe . Ayla is no longer alive. The toddler had last been seen wearing polka dot pajamas with the words 'Daddy's Princess' on them. She had a cast on her broken left arm. Before a news conference that would announce police's tragic conclusion for the girl, detectives called Ayla's parents to deliver the somber news that they no longer believe she'll be found alive. Asked if police believe a crime was committed, Maine State Police spokesman Stephen McCausland said: 'We believe foul play has been involved ... this is a criminal investigation.' Father: Justin DiPietro, left, told cops he last saw Ayla, right, when . he put her to bed. He said she was wearing green . pyjamas with polka dots and the words ‘Daddy's Princess’ on them . Father and daughter: Ayla's blood was found in the partially finished basement that DiPietro used as his bedroom . In Portland, Ayla's mother, along with her own father and mother, burst into tears while watching the news conference. 'Everybody broke down. I'm still crying. I'm still hurting now,' said Ronald Reynolds, Ayla's grandfather, in Portland. 'Why Ayla? She never bothered anybody. She never hurt anybody. Why hurt Ayla?' 'My worst nightmare has come true,' said Trista Reynolds on video captured from her father's home. Ayla's . father, Justin DiPietro, told police he was thankful for the . information, Mr McCausland said, adding, 'His reaction was no reaction.' Mr . DiPietro has said he thinks Ayla was abducted, but police say there's . no evidence of that. No arrests have been made in the case. State . police confirmed that Ayla's blood was found in Mr DiPietro's house and . said he, his girlfriend and his sister - who were there the night Ayla . disappeared - know more than they're telling police. Denial: Mr DiPietro, 24, says that he is not involved in his daughter Ayla's disappearance, but police believe he's not telling them the full story . Police . repeated that assertion on Thursday when asked about the father. 'We . believe he knows more than he's told us,' Mr McCausland said. Neither Mr DiPietro nor a lawyer hired by members of his family returned a call. There was no answer when a reporter knocked on DiPietro's door. After Ayla was reported missing, dozens of game wardens, FBI agents and local and state police officers participated in the search in this central Maine city of 16,000 residents about 20 miles north of the state capital, Augusta. Police checked trash bins and FBI agents knocked on doors. Officials even went so far as to drain a stream so wardens could get a better look. Recently, divers searched the Kennebec River and retrieved some items. Investigators declined to comment on those items Thursday. Investigators said that they have received more than 1,100 tips and that people shouldn't expect it to be solved overnight, Mr McCausland said. 'This isn't 'CSI' where everything is solved in 60 minutes,' he said.

News that this year's nativity scene was paid for by donations has fuelled rumours of corruption in teh Vatican . The Vatican's decision to use a donated nativity scene in Rome's St. Peter's Square this Christmas has fuelled rumours of corruption following the publication of leaked documents that suggest it had paid companies over-inflated prices to produce similar displays in the past. This year's larger-than-life . Christmas tableau depicting the biblical scene of Jesus's birth, said to have cost . about £73,000 was donated by the southern region of . Basilicata, one of Italy's poorest. Much of the money was reportedly . provided by local businesses including oil giants Shell and Total which . operate in the petroleum-rich region. It means that the Vatican will pay just £15,000 this year, mostly towards the cost of assembling the structure, compared to the massive £445,000 it spent in 2009. Yesterday a Vatican spokesman denied a link between its decision to accept this year's display as a gift and allegations that it had previously paid inflated prices to have them built. Some of the documents that sparked this year's 'Vatileaks' scandal indicated that in 2009 the Vatican paid an Italian company six times that amount, about 550,000 euros ($720,000), to build its nativity scene in the square. The letters, leaked to the media, mentioned the payment as an example of corruption in the city state's business dealings. Monsignor Giuseppe Sciacca, deputy governor of the Vatican City, was asked by reporters whether accepting a donated crib was a response to the scandal. Pope Benedict XVI prays in front of the nativity in St.Peter's Square in 2009 which cost the Vatican £445,000 . 'This is exclusively the result of the . offer by the Basilicata region to give us this gift, which, with a . minimum of good sense, has been accepted,' he said. In the leaked documents, Sciacca's predecessor, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, said the exorbitant cost of the 2009 crib was an example of how the Vatican was losing money through corruption. Vigano said he had managed almost to halve the cost of the 2010 crib. He was subsequently transferred to the United States, despite an appeal to his superiors to be allowed stay in his job, in what he saw as punishment for doing his work too well. Thousands flock to St. Peter's Square in Rome every December to see the life-size nativity scene and hear the Pope's annual blessing (file picture) Two people were convicted by a Vatican court over the leaks of documents. Paolo Gabriele, the Pope's former butler, is now serving an 18-month jail sentence in a Vatican jail cell for stealing sensitive papal documents and leaking them to the media. A computer expert was given a suspended sentence for obstructing justice in the case.","This year's display donated by one of Italy's poorest regions .

The Navy SEAL team who carried out the mission to kill Osama bin Laden laughed out loud at their superiors 'preposterous' suggestion of a cover story in the event that the mission didn't even reach the al-Qaeda head's Pakistani compound. That is the latest revelation from former Navy SEAL Matt Bissonette in his first hand account of the bin Laden raid, 'No Easy Day' and he makes it clear that not one member of the ultimately successful mission trusted the excuse to work with their supposed allies. In the event of being apprehended by any Pakistani forces the men of SEAL Team 6 were instructed to say that their secret mission was to locate and extract a missing unmanned drone. Scroll Down for Video . Former Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette talking to US TV show 60 Minutes this week about the Osama bin Laden Pakistan raid which he claims to be part of. CBS . said they disguised his appearance for his safety . 'We all laughed,' wrote Bissonette in his book which hits bookstores on September 4th. 'The story was preposterous. We were allies with Pakistan on paper, so if we did lose a drone, the State Department would negotiate directly with the Pakistani government to get it back. Commando: A photo purported to be of Matt Bissonnette was published by Business Insider on Thursday . 'The story didn't wash and would be very difficult to stick to during hours of questioning. 'The truth is, if we got to that point, no story we could come up with was going to cover up twenty-two SEALs packing sixty pounds of hi-tech gear on their backs.' Bissonette, who has caused political waves with his decision to document the bin Laden raid a little more than a year on from its successful conclusion had other insights into the mission. He writes how the night before the raid some of the SEAL Team 6 took Ambien because they could not sleep. The 36-year-old, he wrote his book under the pseudonym Mark Owen - but whose real identity was leaked by Fox News also tells how the team had to a battle with the CIA not to take an extra sixty-pound box of cellphone-jamming equipment. Watching: In this undated image from video . seized from bin Laden's compound, the Al-Qaeda chief watches a TV . programme showing an image of President Obama . Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad . compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the . Situation Room of the White House . The special forces soldier did take along $200 to use for bribes in the case of mission failure and a digital camera which he used to photograph bin Laden's body and face - photographs which are now under lock and key in the White House. Wearing night vision goggles that cost $65,000, Bissonette admitted to dozing on the helicopter ride to bin Laden's Abbottabad compound with his legs dangling out of a top secret stealth helicopter. Indeed, during the landing, Bissonette was yanked to safety by a fellow SEAL as the helicopter he was in crashed on landing at the compound. He described how the the Navy SEALS killed bin Laden's son Khalid as they made their way through the compound towards the terrorist leader's private quarters on the third floor. Mission: The Al Qaeda leader was killed at this compound in Abbottabad by U.S. Special Forces - and Matt Bissonette claims that if SEAL Team 6 had never made it there they were to explain that they were searching for an unmanned drone to their Pakistani allies . Before revealing the moment a teammate opened fire on a man who had peered through a doorway as they made their way up a flight of stairs. He wrote: 'We were less than five steps from getting to the top when I heard suppressed shots. BOP. BOP. Cover: No Easy Day is scheduled for release on September 4 . 'The point man had seen a man peeking out of the door on the right side of the hallway about ten feet in front of him. The man disappeared into the dark room.' Bissonnette alleges he was the second man to step inside the room and find a man lying on the ground, surrounded by two hysterical women - later revealed to be two of his wives. Three children, likely to have been bin Laden's own offspring, were cowering in the corner. He wrote: 'He was wearing a white sleeveless T-shirt, loose tan pants and a tan tunic. The point man's shots had entered the right side of his head. Blood and brains spilled out of the side of his skull. In his death throes he was still twitching and convulsing.' Bissonnette and his teammate, named 'Tom' in the book, then fired a series of rounds into his chest to ensure he was dead. Examining the body, the pair became convinced they had killed Bin Laden. Bissonnette wrote: 'The man's face was mangled from from at least one bullet one and covered in blood. his chest was torn up. 'I started to wipe blood away from his face using a blanket from the bed. With each swipe, the face became more familiar. 'It was strange to see such an infamous face up close. Lying in front of me was the reason we had been fighting for the last decade.' Despite alleging that his superiors handed the men of SEAL Team 6 a lame cover story, Bissonette does outline the incredible level of detail that the American intelligence community went to in planning the mission. A full scale model of bin Laden's house was mocked up in the North Carolina woods and analysts from the National Geospatial- Intelligence Agency were aware of every detail of the al Qaeda chief's hideout. However, the Pentagon is considering legal action against a former Navy SEAL whose book describes insider details of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, but it has not made a final judgment on whether the book actually reveals secrets, a spokesman said Friday. This undated file photo shows al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, in Afghanistan. A firsthand account of the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden contradicts previous accounts, raising questions as to whether the terror mastermind presented a clear threat when SEALs first fired upon him . Pentagon press secretary George Little said Matt Bissonnette, who wrote under the pseudonym Mark Owen, was deemed to be in violation of two nondisclosure agreements that he signed in 2007 by failing to submit the book for an official security review before it was published. Bissonnette's lawyer on Friday disputed this, saying he believes the decorated former SEAL has 'earned the right to tell his story.' Little would not say what options the Pentagon is considering or when it might act. 'I write to formally advise you of your material breach and violation of your agreements, and to inform you that the department is considering pursuing against you, and all those acting in concert with you, all remedies legally available to us. . .,' Jeh Johnson, the Pentagon's top lawyer, wrote in a letter faxed to the author Thursday through his publisher. Robert D. Luskin of the law firm Patton Boggs wrote to Johnson on Friday that his firm is representing Bissonnette and that the author is not in breach of nondisclosure agreements. The publisher, meanwhile, said Friday that it will begin public sales next week. 'We see no reason to change our plans,' Christine Ball, a spokeswoman for Penguin Group (USA)'s Dutton imprint, said in a statement.","Former SEAL Matt Bissonette revealed that SEAL Team 6 were told to tell any Pakistani forces they encountered that they were hunting for a downed unmanned drone .

Britain could be stripped of the power to give serial killers 'life means life' jail terms in a new showdown with Strasbourg. A group of killers will insist the European Court of Human Rights grants them the right to demand their release from jail. If the court rules in their favour, ministers will be forced to give 43 of the most dangerous serial killers and rapists behind bars in this country the right to apply to get out of prison early. KIller's rights: Douglas Vinter (left) and Jeremy Bamber (right) are among the group appealing the European Court of Human Rights . The list of those who would benefit is a roll call of evil, and includes Rose West, Peter Sutcliffe, Levi Bellfield and Steven Wright, all of whom have been given a 'whole life' sentence, meaning they will die behind bars. Each would be granted a new 'human right' to have their case put before the Parole Board to argue that they had reformed and should be let out. The case is brought by killers Jeremy Bamber, Peter Moore and Douglas Vinter, all of whom were given whole life terms because of the seriousness of their crimes. It comes before the Strasbourg court tomorrow, with a judgment expected in weeks, at a time when relations between it and the Government are at a historic low. Writing in the Mail today, former policing and justice minister Nick Herbert advocates withdrawal from the court, which he says has contributed to the spread of a 'rights contagion' in which 'everyone knows their rights, yet few admit their responsibilities'. Tense: The relationship between the court and the UK parliament is already at an all time low and could be strained if the court rules in favour of the criminals tomorrow . Strasbourg first ruled against the three killers in January by a knife-edge vote of four judges to three, and the court has allowed an appeal to its Grand Chamber. The dissenting judges said denying a parole hearing amounted to 'cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment'. Were the court to rule in the killers' favour, as some Strasbourg observers predict, it would be a direct challenge to the authority of Parliament to decide the law – and of our courts to rule on it.","Killers set to insist European Court of Human Rights allows them right to demand release from jail .

Christopher Tappin, 65, always maintained his innocence, saying he was a victim of an FBI sting. It is now claimed he will change his verdict . A former golf club president extradited to the US on charges of trying to sell missile batteries to Iran is set to plead guilty – and could be back in the UK within months. Christopher Tappin, 65, is expected to return to Britain to serve his sentence if a plea bargain deal with US prosecutors goes ahead. Last night his wife said she hoped the agreement would lead to his ‘swift and safe return’. Elaine Tappin, who is seriously ill with chronic Churg-Strauss syndrome, a rare auto-immune disease, said: ‘From the moment Chris was put on a plane all we ever wanted was his swift and safe return. 'However upsetting, this is the beginning of that process. It would be inappropriate to comment further whilst the court has yet to establish Chris’s fate.’ Tappin, from Orpington in Kent, protested his innocence throughout his two-year battle against extradition. He was due to go on trial next month but on Thursday he is expected to admit charges of conspiring to sell batteries for Iranian missiles at court in El Paso, Texas. If, as expected, the judge accepts the deal, he will be sentenced within weeks. The agreement could also include an assurance from the US Department of Justice that it will not resist efforts to return him to a prison in the UK. His lawyer in the UK indicated her client had little choice but to accept a deal. Karen Todner, who also represented computer hacker Gary McKinnon, said: ‘The odds are so heavily stacked against a defendant who chooses to plead not guilty and then is subsequently found guilty that the vast majority of people facing trial in the US opt to take a plea agreement.’ Tappin, with his wife Elaine, before being handed over to the US to face arms dealing charges .

Britain could give convicts life bans which prevent them from voting even after they have left prison. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling published a draft bill containing three options for resolving the UK’s long-running stand-off with Strasbourg over granting prisoners the vote. These were giving votes to inmates who have been imprisoned for up to four years, for up to six months or, crucially, maintaining the UK’s existing blanket ban. Scroll down for video . Offenders imprisoned for five years or more could lose their votes forever, if a new system were to be brought in . He is establishing a joint committee of MPs and Peers to scrutinise each of the proposals - a move which could boot the issue into the long grass until 2014. However, Mr Grayling said he also wanted the committee to consider other ideas, including the system operated by the Italian government, which has been ruled lawful by the European Court of Human Rights. Under this regime, prisoners given shorter sentences are entitled to vote while behind bars. But anyone sentenced to five years or more - such as rapists and killers - are stripped of their right to vote forever, subject to a right of appeal. It would mean MPs swallowing the idea of . thousands of convicts voting by post while in jail, in return for far . tougher treatment of Britain’s worst criminals upon release. Dominic Grieve, Attorney General, has warned Britain could become a ¿pariah¿ . Currently, ex-offenders are free to take part in elections as soon as they are released. In a Commons statement, Mr Grayling said: ‘The Italian system, found to be compliant by the Court, disenfranchises prisoners post-release. The Committee will I am sure consider evidence on this and other approaches.’ The British government had been given until today by Strasbourg - dubbed a ‘Mickey Mouse court by MPs yesterday - to respond to a 2005 ruling that it is unlawful to ban all convicted prisoners from voting. MPs - led by the Prime Minister, who said prisoner voting made him feel ‘physically ill - have repeatedly made it clear they want to defy the court and keep the blanket ban in place. Mr Grayling is hoping to end the stand-off - or at least buy more time - by giving MPs a fresh vote on what happens next. But Nick Herbert, the former policing minister, said Britain should withdraw from membership of the European court, as it is ‘doubtful that any of the three main options presented to Parliament will actually be acceptable to Strasbourg. He predicted that the ECHR would start awarding prisoners compensation, and the public would find that even harder to ‘stomach’. Thousands of prisoners are lining-up to claim compensation, worth £1,000 each, if Strasbourg rules it is not satisfied with Britain’s response. Mr Grayling suggested he could block prisoners getting access to legal aid to help them mount their legal challenges. However MPs fear that will not prove a deterrent to ‘ambulance chasing’ lawyers who are prepared to offer their services on a no-win, no-fee basis. Labour said it did not want any inmates to have the vote. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is considering a variety of options in regards to the thorny subject of prisoners' votes . But Lord Lester, a Liberal Democrat peer and prominent barrister, said the UK must be seen to comply with the law. He claimed: ‘This diminishes our reputation across the world, whether in Beijing or Moscow, and makes me feel sick.’ Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General, has himself warned Britain could become a ‘pariah’ if it does not obey Strasbourg. But Mr Grayling hit back: ‘Some people have suggested that if Parliament chooses to exercise its right of sovereignty the United Kingdom will become a pariah state. I simply do not accept that. ‘I believe that Parliament has the right to exercise its sovereignty, it will be for Parliament to decide in this situation whether it wishes to exercise that sovereignty. ‘But I do not believe that if it chooses to do so somehow Britain will turn into a nation with an appalling human rights record. Our human rights record stands comparison with anyone.’ Mr Grayling said it would be up to MPs whether to pay any compensation ordered by Europe. Tory MPs made stinging attacks upon the court for meddling in Britain’s affairs. Robert Halfon said the European Convention on Human Rights was drafted to ensure that the horrors of Nazi Germany could not be repeated. He added: ‘It was never the intention of the framers to give Albert Speer and Rudolf Hess the vote.’ Fellow backbencher Peter Bone applauded Mr Grayling for seeking to make ‘this Parliament sovereign and ignoring a Mickey Mouse court in Europe.’ However, the Council of Europe’s Human Rights Commissioner made it clear the court was in no mood to tolerate further delays. Nils Muiznieks said: ‘It’s been seven years since the initial judgment, so a long time has passed since the ruling and the Government has asked for extensions, so we would like to see the judgment implemented. ‘The UK decided to delegate some small part of its sovereignty to the Council of Europe when it joined and when it agreed to abide by the rulings of the court.’ The committee is expected to begin examining the options next year - a process that could take a year or more. When MPs finally get a vote, Cabinet ministers have been told to abstain by Mr Grieve, who does not want to further infuriate Strasbourg.","Chris Grayling is considering a system where those who are jailed for five years or more lose the right to vote forever, subject to appeal .

Fears are now growing that the entire region could be destabilised. Warning: Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country would not shy away from war if provoked . Erdogan said on Friday his country did not want war but warned Syria not to make a ‘fatal mistake’ by testing its resolve. Syria has said its mortar shells hit Turkey accidentally. A local governor in Turkey said the two rounds fired from Syria appeared to have been aimed by government forces at rebels along the border. There were no casualties. A Turkish border post retaliated with six rounds of mortars. Turkish artillery bombarded Syrian military targets on Wednesday and Thursday, killing several Syrian soldiers. The United Nations Security Council condemned the original Syrian attack and demanded that such violations of international law stop immediately. Syria has ordered its warplanes and helicopters not to enter an area within six miles of the Turkish border and told its artillery units not to fire shells in areas close to the border, according to Turkish broadcaster NTV.

Terror suspect Abu Qatada is 'scraping the barrel' in an appeal against deportation which 'bears all the hallmarks of a last-ditch argument', a tribunal was told today. The radical cleric, described by a judge as Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe, would receive a fair trial in Jordan if deported, lawyers for Home Secretary Theresa May said. The Government is satisfied that evidence gained through torture would not be used against Qatada in any trial over terror charges, Robin Tam QC, for the Home Secretary, said. Qatada, described by a judge as Osama . bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, is facing a retrial on terror . charges. Uncertain future: Abu Qatada is facing a retrial on terror charges after Home Secretary Theresa May was . given assurances by Jordan that no evidence gained through torture would . be used against him . Discussing the case as the hearing began, Mr Justice Mitting, president of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac), said: 'The evidence seems extremely thin.' He made the comment as he began a 'factual review' of the 51-year-old radical cleric's case. Qatada, who is also called Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman, has challenged and ultimately thwarted every attempt by the Government over the last decade to put him on a plane and is fighting against deportation at the immigration tribunal appeal in central London. Mr Tam said statements from Qatada's . former co-defendants - Al-Hamasher and Abu Hawsher - which were alleged . to have been obtained by torture could no longer be used by the . Jordanian courts. Review: . Mr Justice Mitting, president of the Special Immigration Appeals . Commission (Siac), said: 'The evidence seems extremely thin' He also rejected suggestions by Qatada's legal team that the pair would . suffer ill-treatment or otherwise be unduly pressured if called to give . evidence under oath in any retrial. He said: 'It is submitted that this assertion of future ill-treatment of the . former co-defendants bears all the hallmarks of a last-ditch argument.' Mr Tam also rejected a new claim by Qatada's lawyers that the radical . cleric would be taken into administrative detention if returned to . Jordan. 'This contention simply illustrates the extent to which the appellant is scraping the barrel in this appeal,' Mr Tam said. He went on: 'In reality, the position is clear: as a matter of Jordanian . law, the previous statements made by Al-Hamasher and Abu Hawsher will . not form part of the evidence which is considered by the court in the . retrial of the appellant. 'The two men will be called to give fresh evidence, and if they do so, . will be able to give their evidence freely and without fear of . reprisal.' In a written skeleton argument handed to . the court, Mr Tam said the Home Secretary 'will highlight the new . information and assurances which she has received' from Jordan. Anthony Layden, 66, the former British . ambassador to Libya who specialises in negotiating diplomatic . assurances, will give evidence to the appeal, in front of Siac president . Mr Justice Mitting, tomorrow. He will describe how the Jordanian authorities 'have given all possible . assistance in terms of establishing in more detail precisely what . procedures would be followed in the appellant's retrial', Mr Tam said. However, Danny Friedman, representing Qatada, said: 'I think there are some serious issues with the allegations made against Mr Othman.' He was referring to terror charges which Qatada was convicted of in Jordan in his absence and for which he faces a retrial. Mr Friedman also insisted Qatada’s lawyers’ aim was not simply to delay proceedings further by launching yet more appeals. 'That was not necessarily our aim, two more appeals and 10 more years,' he said. Involved: Qatada is facing a retrial on terror . charges after Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) was given assurances by Jordan . that no evidence gained through torture would be used against him . But even if Qatada loses when the . decision is handed down next month, it could still be many months before . the Government can send him to Jordan as he could eventually appeal . again to Europe’s human rights judges. Qatada, who is in custody, did not attend today’s hearing. Repeated . failed attempts by UK governments over the last 10 years to deport .

No . figures have been given for how much Qatada has received in legal aid . and some estimates put the cost of keeping Qatada in the UK, either in a . high-security jail or closely monitored under strict conditions in the . community, along with the legal costs of the fight to deport him, at . more than £3m. At the High . Court this summer, Edward Fitzgerald QC, representing Qatada, said the . cleric has now been in detention for seven years - 'the longest period . of administrative detention as far as we know in modern English . history'. He was last . refused bail over the Olympics, when police and security services were . fully stretched, with judges also ruling that the risk of him absconding . in the run-up to today’s hearing justified his continued detention.

Fitzgerald’s 'gloomy prognosis that another year or more of litigation . is to be expected after the fortnight’s hearing in Siac'. Qatada could appeal against the Siac ruling, the judges said, but any appeal 'would have to be on points of law' and it was not 'an inevitability' that the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg would want to hear the case again. Qatada, who is said to have wide and high-level support among extremists, was convicted in his absence in Jordan of involvement with terror attacks in 1998 and faces a retrial in his home country. He also featured in hate sermons found on videos in the flat of one of the September 11 bombers. Europe’s human rights judges ruled in January that Qatada could only be deported if evidence gained through torture would not be used against him in his trial. The appeal will test whether Mrs May has secured assurances from Jordan to ensure a fair trial and whether deportation proceedings can continue, rather than only the strength of the case against him. Anthony Laydan, the former British ambassador to Libya who specialises in negotiating diplomatic assurances, will give evidence tomorrow. He is expected to be followed by a Jordanian lawyer who advises the British Embassy in Amman.","Tribunal told Qatada appeal against deportation 'bears all .

A ‘pacemaker’ has been implanted in to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient in a bid to reduce memory loss. The device, which uses deep brain stimulation, has already been used in thousands of people with Parkinson’s disease as possible means of boosting memory and reversing cognitive decline. Now the first patient in the US has undergone the delicate surgery to try and halt the effects of dementia, which slowly robs its mostly elderly victims of a lifetime of memories and the ability to perform the simplest of daily tasks. A diseased brain- showing the effects of dementia. The new device appears to keep brain neurons active and help prevent cognitive decline . Instead of focusing on drug treatments, many of which have failed in recent clinical trials, the researchers at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine are looking at the use of the low-voltage electrical charges delivered directly to the brain. As part of a preliminary safety study in 2010, the devices were implanted in six Alzheimer’s patients in Canada. The trial showed that patients with mild forms of the disorder showed sustained increases in glucose metabolism - an indicator that brain neurons are working - over a 13-month period. Most Alzheimer’s disease patients show decreases in glucose metabolism over the same period. Paul B. Rosenberg, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said: 'Recent failures in Alzheimer’s disease trials using drugs such as those designed to reduce the build-up of ""plaques"" in the brain have sharpened the need for alternative strategies. 'This is a very different approach, whereby we are trying to enhance the function of the brain mechanically. It’s a whole new avenue for potential treatment for a disease becoming all the more common with the aging of the population.' Some 40 dementia patients in the US are expected to receive the deep brain stimulation implant over the next year (posed by model) Some 40 patients are expected to receive the deep brain stimulation implant over the next year or so at Johns Hopkins and four other institutions in the U.S. The procedure involves drilling holes into the skull to implant wires into the fornix on either side of the brain. The fornix is a brain pathway instrumental in bringing information to the hippocampus, the portion of the brain where learning begins and memories are made, and where the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s appear to arise. The wires are attached to a pacemaker-like device, the 'stimulator,' which generates tiny electrical impulses into the brain 130 times a second. The patients don’t feel the current, said Dr Rosenberg. For the trial, all of the patients will be implanted with the devices. Half will have their stimulators turned on two weeks after surgery, while the other half will have their stimulators turned on after one year. Neither the patients nor the doctors treating them will know which group gets an early or later start. 'Deep brain stimulation might prove to be a useful mechanism for treating Alzheimer’s disease, or it might help us develop less invasive treatments based on the same mechanism,' said Dr Rosenberg. By 2050, the number of people age 65 and older with Alzheimer’s disease may triple, experts say, from 5.2 million to a projected 11 million to 16 million, unless effective treatments are found.","Device already used in people with Parkinson’s disease as possible means reversing cognitive decline .

Serious charges: John David Mahaffey, 19, was indicted for allegedly forcing a fellow SMU student to perform oral sex on him twice in September . A Texas college sophomore has been indicted on Friday for allegedly forcing a classmate to perform sexual acts on him in September, according to court records. John David 'J.D.' Mahaffey, 19, is facing sexual assault charges stemming from two incidents in which the Southern Methodist University student allegedly attacked another young man. On September 23, Mahaffey allegedly forced the other student to perform oral sex on him first in a campus parking garage, and then outside the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity at 3050 SMU Boulevard, where Mahaffey is a member. According to an affidavit made public in September, the alleged victim told Mahaffey 'no' and 'stop' several times, but feared that the 19-year-old would get violent. The document states that after the acts, Mahaffey, a fourth-generation SMU finance sophomore, told the young man, 'You better not tell a soul,' according to the Dallas Morning Star. The following day, the alleged victim met with SMU police and agreed to record a phone conversation with his assailant. During the call, the SMU student told Mahaffey, 'You know I did not want to do that?' to which the 19-year-old reportedly responded, 'I know you didn't, but we have to say it was consensual or lawyers, parent and the school will get involved.' Impressive resume: Mahaffey, right, pictured here with President George W. Bush, left, was a Hunt scholar and student senator . Legacy: Mahaffey is a fourth-generation SMU student whose great-great grandfather was among the college's founders and its first professors . Mahaffey was arrested on September 25 and charged with second-degree felony sexual assault. He was released from jail after posting a $25,000 bond. In the aftermath of the incident, Mahaffey was suspended from the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and temporarily banned from SMU campus pending an investigation. Mahaffey had a prominent status on campus, NBC DFW reported. The Springfield, Missouri, native was a Hunt scholar, a student senator, a scholarship committee chairman and an officer on SMU's inter-fraternity council, according to the university website. Abuse: An affidavit released in September revealed that Mahaffey allegedly forced a male student to perform sexual acts and then tried to cover it up . According to a 2011 article in SMU's student newspaper, the Daily Campus, his great-great grandfather was a co-founder of the school and one of its first professors. Mahaffey is a second SMU student to be arrested and indicted on sexual assault charges this fall. Precedent: In September, Donald Cuba, 20, was indicted on sexual assault charges for allegedly raping a female SMU student in February . In September, Donald Cuba, a 20-year-old junior, was indicted on sexual assault charges related to the February 10, 2012, on-campus rape of a female SMU student. Cuba is set to go on trial March 25, 2013. Cuba's was the first case where a grand jury has charged a SMU student for sexually assaulting another student, reported the Fort Worth Weekly. The university has traditionally relied on a system of secret hearings for students suspected of sexual assault. Over the past 25 years, more than 100 SMU students have reported being sexually assaulted. Yet in only one case - the three men who raped Monika Korra in 2009 - were the suspects successfully prosecuted and they were not SMU students. SMU officials say the system - where all records are kept secret - works well. 'The university is confident in the integrity of its process and its procedures,' said SMU spokesperson Kent Best. Serious questions have been raised in the past about the fairness of the university’s approach. In 1990, a secret panel found an SMU student guilty of sexually assaulting another SMU student only to have a second panel overrule that decision in 1991, a decision upheld by then-President A. Kenneth Pye.","John David Mahaffey, 19, is accused of forcing another male SMU student to perform oral sex on him twice .

Payout: Sami al Saadi was given £2.2m to 'buy his silence' A dissident abducted and handed to Colonel Gaddafi’s torturers with the alleged help of Tony Blair’s government was given £2.2million last  night to buy his silence. Sami al Saadi, 45, was dispatched with his wife and four young children back to his native Libya where he was imprisoned and maltreated. The ‘rendition’ operation – conducted with apparent MI6 support – took place only three days after Mr Blair visited Libya for the now infamous 2004 ‘deal in the desert’. Evidence of Britain’s role emerged in documents found after the fall of the Gaddafi regime. For years, Labour ministers denied involvement in rendition. Mr al Saadi sued MI5, MI6, the Foreign Office and Home Office as well as ex-foreign secretary Jack Straw and Sir Mark Allen, a former senior MI6 spy. Yesterday the High Court was told a settlement had been reached under which he and his family will receive £2.23million. The Government released a short statement insisting there had been ‘no admission of liability and no finding by any court of liability’. It did not address any of the allegations made. Mr Straw released a carefully worded statement, in which he did not deny sanctioning the operation. He said: ‘At all times I was scrupulous in seeking to carry out my duties in accordance with the law and I hope to be able to say much more about all this at an appropriate stage in the future.’ The hush money – thought to be the biggest ever payout to a former terror suspect – prevents the exposure of embarrassing secrets about Britain’s alleged role in the kidnap and ‘rendition’ operation. Kat Craig, a director of the legal campaign group Reprieve, said: ‘We now know that Tony Blair’s deal in the desert was bought with ugly compromises. Evidence of Britain’s role during the reign of Blair (left) has emerged in documents found after the fall of the Gaddafi (right) regime . ‘Perhaps the ugliest was for MI6 to deliver a whole family to one of the world’s most brutal dictators.’ In 2004, Mr al Saadi, also known as Abu Munthir, was a leading member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, and living in China. He and his wife and four children, then aged six, nine, 11 and 13, were lured to Hong Kong where they were abducted by the CIA, flown to Tripoli and handed over to Gaddafi’s henchmen. They were handcuffed, hoods were placed over their heads and their legs were bound with wire. His wife and children were released after two months but Mr al Saadi was jailed for six years, brutally beaten, given electric shocks and told he was facing death. After he was released from six years in prison he took a leading role in the downfall of the regime in 2011. Evidence of Britain’s involvement was found in the ruins of the headquarters building of Libya’s infamous security chief, Musa Kusa. A CIA fax read: ‘We are ... aware that your service had been co-operating with the British to effect (Sami al Saadi’s) removal to Tripoli.’ Two days after the fax was sent Mr Blair arrived for ‘deal in the desert’ which secured lucrative oil deals for BP and brought Libya in from the cold. It also paved the way for the hugely-controversial release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi. The rendition operation took place three days later. Earlier this year Mr al Saadi launched the legal action with another tortured Libyan fighter, Abdel Hakim Belhadj, which accused Mr Straw and Sir Mark of liability for false imprisonment, complicity in torture and mistreatment, misfeasance in public office and negligence. Mr Belhadj and his pregnant wife were seized in Malaysia in 2004 and flown to Tripoli on a CIA jet, which it is claimed flew via Diego Garcia, the British territory in the Indian Ocean. Abdul Hakim Belhaj, now a Libyan military . commander, also claims he was a victim of UK-backed  illegal rendition, . but former Labour Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has dismissed the claims . as 'conspiracy theories' A letter from Sir Mark to Kusa, also found in Tripoli, said: ‘I congratulate you on the safe arrival of [Belhaj]. This was the least we could do for you and for Libya.’ Last night Mr al Saadi said he had accepted the payment to help pay for his medical care and his children’s education. He added: ‘I started this process believing that a British trial would get to the truth in my case. But today, with the government trying to push through secret courts, I feel that to proceed is not best for my family. ‘I went through a secret trial once before, in Gaddafi’s Libya. In many ways, it was as bad as the torture. It is not an experience I care to repeat.’ The Justice and Security Bill, which contains the secret court plans, will go before the Commons next week. Critics say it will undermine open justice and allow embarrassing secrets to be buried. Last year Britain agreed a multi-million pound settlement with 16 terror suspects, including former Guantanamo Bay detainee Binyam Mohamed, over alleged British involvement in their mistreatment. Former MI6 boss Sir Richard Dearlove has described the decision to cooperate with Libya on terror suspects as a ‘political decision’. A public inquiry into rendition and complicity in torture was shelved indefinitely last year, after Scotland Yard launched its investigation into the Libya cases. The second case is set to continue because Mr Belhadj has insisted he will ‘fight to ensure the truth is told’. Others who claim they have been tortured or mistreated with the complicity of the security services include: . BINYAM MOHAMED Last year 16 terror suspects received around £1million each over Britain’s alleged role in their mistreatment. One, Binyam Mohamed, a Guantanamo Bay detainee, has claimed British agents were complicit in his torture and that the Security Service handed information to the US government about him.Ethiopian-born Mohamed, 33, arrived in the UK in 1994 as a schoolboy seeking asylum. He travelled to Afghanistan in 2001, and the US claimed he received weapons training at an Al Qaeda camp and plotted to detonate a radioactive bomb in America. He was arrested in 2002 and sent to a CIA prison in Kabul, then transferred to Morocco, where he says he was repeatedly beaten and had his genitals cut. In 2004 he was sent to Guantanamo Bay where he was held until his return to the UK in 2009. BISHER AL RAWI Arrived at 16 from Iraq but overstayed a visitor’s visa. Spent more than four years in Guantanamo after being seized in the Gambia. Al Rawi, 41, was also accused of being associated with radical cleric Abu Qatada. RICHARD BELMAR London-born Belmar, 30, converted to Islam in 1999 and travelled to Afghanistan in 2001.

Britain is turning into a ‘walk-on-by’ society in which two-thirds of the public will not confront troublemakers in the street. In the past two years alone, the number of citizen’s arrests has halved, according to a report by Policy Exchange. At the same time, a YouGov poll carried out for the influential think-tank found 64 per cent of Brits would carry on walking past a gang of teens who were drinking and verbally abusing passers-by. 'Walk-on-by' Britain: Two thirds of people say that they would not confront troublemakers in the street (file picture) Apathy: Less than 20 per cent of people in London said that they would step in if they saw a gang drinking and abusing passers by according to a YouGov poll (file picture) Nationwide, only 27 per cent would step in, and in London, the figure slumped below 20 per cent. Scots are the most likely to intervene, with nearly a third of people saying they would take action. The report paints a depressing picture of the public’s lack of willingness to participate in the fight against crime. In millions of cases, they do not even report crimes – potentially because they do not believe they will be solved or taken seriously. About 9.5million offences were measured by the Crime Survey for England and Wales last year, which is based on interviews with households. By contrast, only four million offences were formally reported to the police. In the survey by Policy Exchange, 74 per cent of chief constables thought the public could do more in terms of reporting crime and disorder and 94 per cent thought the public could provide more intelligence. Researchers say the figures for citizen’s arrests, which are based on a Freedom of Information request submitted to London’s Met, are particularly stark. Between 2002 and 2011/12, the number of people intervening to hold a suspected criminal slumped by 87 per cent. Report: A string of experts, including the previous Government's anti-social behaviour tsar Louise Casey, pictured, have previously warned that Britain is becoming a 'walk-on-by' nation . In the past two years – during which David Cameron’s Big Society was supposedly taking shape – the figure has halved, from 3,755 to 1,816 citizen’s arrests in London. Policy Exchange, widely regarded as the Prime Minister’s favourite think-tank, calls for the police to make it easier to report crime. It says that, by 2020, it should be possible for the public to report crimes by ‘text, emails and social media’. The author, Edward Boyd, also wants Citizen Police Academies to be set up to train the public – using a mixture of police officers and voluntary groups with relevant expertise – on how to play their part in the fight against crime. They would be taught everything from how to perform citizen’s arrests safely to how to avoid  danger when walking home alone. Mr Boyd said: ‘The police will always play the central role in the fight against crime, yet the public still has a part to play. ‘It’s quite understandable that most people feel reluctant to be a “have-a-go” hero and it is important that they have the confidence to intervene and know when it is appropriate.’ There have been a string of warnings by experts, including the  previous government’s anti-social behaviour tsar Louise Casey, that Britain is in danger of becoming a ‘walk-on-by’ society. In a report ordered by Downing Street, Miss Casey said people are terrified they will either be attacked themselves or face arrest. She said the change in attitudes – blamed on a loss of trust in the police – could allow crime to ‘strangle whole neighbourhoods’. But criminologists say one of the reasons for the fall in citizen’s arrests is a fear of being thrown in jail. Paul Catlow, 25, was prosecuted for standing up to local teenagers in Sidcup, while George Lonsdale, 27, was locked up after a female mugger he caught in Burnley complained that she had been assaulted. Both cases were eventually thrown out.","In the past two years alone, the number of citizen's arrests has halved according to a report by Policy Exchange .

The newly-estranged wife of stunt motorcyclist Eddie Kidd has been questioned by police over allegations of assault, fraud and theft, it emerged today. Sami Kirli, 44, was arrested and questioned by Sussex Police. She has been bailed until January 31 while detectives investigate the claims against her. News of her arrest comes a day after it emerged that the former Grange Hill actress, who married Mr Kidd, 53, two years ago, was no longer living with her paralysed husband. So happy: Eddie Kidd and his third wife Sami Kirli before the split . As revealed by Richard Kay yesterday, Ms Kirli moved out of their home in Seaford, near Brighton, while Mr Kidd changed his Facebook status from 'married' to 'single'.  Friends said he was consulting lawyers about a divorce. Initially friends believed the strain of caring for Mr Kidd, who was left severely disabled after a 1996 motorcycle jump over 13 buses went wrong, was to blame for the marital breakdown. But it emerged today this was not the case. A friend of the motorcycle daredevil said: 'Sami has been asked to leave the marital property and is living elsewhere.  She is not allowed to go to the house.' He added: Eddie is shocked and disgusted by these allegations.' Marathon man: Mr Kidd completed the London marathon in 43 days last year . A spokesman for Sussex Police said: 'A 44-year-old woman from Seaford has been arrested for common assault, theft and fraud. 'She has been questioned and bailed until January 31, 2013 while investigations continue.' Ms Kirli wrote on her Facebook page that she was being 'misjudged at the mo'. Mr Kidd, who was also previously married to Hot Gossip dancer Debbie Ash and ex-Stringfellows nightclub waitress Sarah Carr, first met Ms Kirli in 1988 when they had a brief relationship. He left her heartbroken and she said she turned down six proposals from other men before she and Mr Kidd met by chance at a party in London's Mayfair in 2004. They met again three years later and began a relationship.  Ms Kirli said: 'To me, he was the most gorgeous man who'd walked this earth'. She abandoned plans to emigrate to Texas and six weeks later he proposed.  They married in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, in 2010 and Eddie said: 'I am the luckiest man alive'. Last year Ms Kirli told a journalist that the paraplegic Mr Kidd was 'the only person I've truly been in love with'. She added: 'If he died tomorrow, there'd be nothing left for me to carry on for.' Mr Kidd has three children: Candie, 29, with his first wife Debbie, Jack, 18, with second wife Sarah, and Callum, now 10, with physiotherapy worker Olive Reynolds, whom he met after his accident at a rehabilitation centre in Hertfordshire. A former James Bond stunt man, Mr Kidd was left in a coma for three-and-a-half months after breaking his neck and pelvis and suffering brain damage when a stunt went wrong in 1996. It was at the Bulldog Bash, an annual motorcycle festival near Stratford-upon-Avon, where he landed badly after a comparatively minor jump and hit his head on the motorbike's petrol tank. He is now confined to a wheelchair, unable to walk or even talk unaided and needs full-time care. Eddie Kidd with first wife, Debbie Ash, left, and with second wife Sarah Carr, pictured right .

A plague of ‘super rats’ in the Home Counties can be wiped out only with considerably stronger poisons, it was claimed yesterday. Council experts say the number of mutant rats, which are resistant to conventional poisons, is rising drastically after flooding drove them into homes and created ideal breeding conditions. West Berkshire Council is asking the Health and Safety Executive to change the rules on how poison is used. Mutant rodent: The 'super rat' is immune to normal rat poison which has led to a fear that it may be unstoppable in spreading life-threatening diseases to humans and farm animals . Homes in Berkshire, Oxford and . Hampshire have reported increased numbers of the ‘super-rodent’ which is . resistant to normal poisons and can transmit life-threatening diseases . to humans and farm animals. However, . wildlife experts fear that if stronger poisons are allowed to be used . against the rat-threat it may harm innocent local wildlife. The ‘super-rats’ population is due to increase further as the recent flooding across many parts of Britain has created ideal breeding conditions. West Berkshire Council is lobbying the Health and Safety Executive for permission to use powerful rodenticides, brodifacoum and flocoumafen, which are currently limited to indoor use. Graham Chappell, from Rapid Pest Control in Newbury, who is contracted by West Berkshire Council, said: ‘It’s becoming more of an issue now simply because of the number of rats that are being seen. ‘They’ve also mutated genetically and are bred to be immune to standard poisons. ‘We have to start using different methods such as trapping and gassing, which can be less effective and more costly.’ Close relation: It is hard to distinguish the mutated strain from its cousin - the brown rat - due to their shared genetic makeup and identical appearance . A study by University of Reading’s Rodenticide Resistance Action Group involving testing the tails of hundreds of rats killed in Berkshire and Oxfordshire, found that many of the rodents were resistant to common forms of poison used by local authorities and professional pest controllers, farmers and gamekeepers. Other EU countries allow  use of brodifacoum and flocoumafen . outside, but attempts to make them available in Britain are likely to . lead to all-out war with nature lovers who fear owls, hawks and even . dogs and cats will eat the rodents and ingest the poison. Head of the study Dr Alan Buckle said: ‘We’re not allowed to use them because the regulatory body is worried about their effects on wildlife. ‘My view is that we need to use the stronger poisons but we need to tell people how to use them carefully. If we can do that we can solve the problem.’ The Health and Safety Executive is currently consulting on a European Union proposal to allow limited outdoor use of certain chemicals in pest control. The results will be published next year. Dr Buckle found the super rats look like their non-mutant cousins, which makes it even harder to identify them. He added: ‘All rats tend to carry various diseases. The reason we need to get rid of them is because they transmit diseases from themselves to humans and farm animals. They can be life-threatening. ‘These anticoagulant-resistant rats carry the same diseases as other rats carry but are very difficult to control.’ No harm no f-owl: Wildlife experts are worried that if outdoor usage of brodifacoum and flocoumafen is approved it may harm local wildlife who feed off rats, such as owls . A map was drawn indicating where the rats were found, including areas of farmland around Henley-on-Thames, Caversham and Sonning. Exact locations have not been disclosed. The survey found the rats to be living in both urban and rural areas. Farm buildings were popular habitats because the rats could live off food for livestock. Dr Buckle said this caused the greatest concern because the rats carry illnesses such as Weil’s disease, which can be passed on to humans. It has flu-like symptoms initially but can lead to jaundice in the kidneys. He said ‘If Weil’s disease is not treated it’s very serious. About 40 to 50 people in the UK catch it every year. ‘However, very often people go to the doctor with flu and are given antibiotics and it clears up so there might actually be more cases than we know about' Dr Buckle is also concerned that wildlife including red kites, barn owls, foxes and badgers could be affected even if ‘ordinary’ poisons are put down - because people will use greater and greater quantities in a vain attempt to destroy the super rats, which can’t be killed. ‘They are called super-rats but they don’t look super - they look just like any other rats. ‘That’s the problem because people don’t know they are resistant and carry on using poisons that can’t control them. ‘We’re concerned that more and more of these poisons are getting into wildlife. ‘If the rats have eaten the poison and stay alive, when other animals eat them, they can get secondary poisoning. It can then get passed up the food chain. ‘There’s no danger to humans in the movement of this poison but there’s enough concern about it getting into wildlife.’","'Super rat' plagueing the Home Counties is immune to normal poison .

Ann Curry, pictured at industry awards last month, could be on the move to CNN, according to sources . Ann Curry could yet have her revenge on NBC by joining CNN as an evening anchor, according to reports. The former Today show host is expected to be approached by CNN boss Jeff Zucker to head up its 8pm show as she is the perfect ‘smarty pants foreign affairs type’ that he wants. Anderson Cooper, whose 360 show currently has that slot, will likely be moved to a later time to take on a Christiane Amanpour-correspondent style role. According to the New York Post, Zucker is looking to capitalize on the public sympathy for the way Curry’s exit from Today was handled. During . her on-air farewell in June - after just a year in the job - she . apologized for ‘dropping the ball’ and wept as she said she let the side . down. Critics . said that she had been hung out to dry and in an interview, Curry claimed that bosses fired her because they did not like her . fashion sense and her refusal to wear high heels. A source told the Post: ‘Jeff wants a headliner like Rachel Maddow or Bill O’Reilly in prime time. ‘He . cannot allow the low ratings at CNN to continue... so he can’t hire a . nobody. 'Curry fits that CNN-smarty-pants-foreign-affairs type.' Curry was vindicated when summer ratings at Today dropped seven per cent following her departure. In the ten weeks before Curry left, the Today show had 4.94 million viewers but in the ten weeks after, there were 4.6 million. Sympathy vote: Curry gets a supporting arm from Matt Lauer as she cries live on-air after being ousted from the Today show after only a year . On the move? There is speculation that Erin Burnett (left) and Anderson Cooper could be given new roles during a reshuffle at CNN . She has remained with NBC on her $10million-a-year contract and returned to foreign reporting but Today has stumbled since the arrival of her replacement Savannah Guthrie. According to reports, the show's anchor Matt Lauer has been ‘obsessively’ watching rival show Good Morning America on ABC as he frets about his own future. Shake up: New CNN boss Jeff Zucker is believed to want a big name like Curry for prime-time to boost viewing figures . The Today executive who fired Curry, Jim Bell, also left his post after seven years in charge of the show. Today is also now being beaten by GMA which ended Today’s 16-year run as the number one breakfast programme. The speculation about Zucker's shake-up comes after reports that Erin Burnett could be teamed with a male presenter to front a new morning show. Piers Morgan’s talk show may also be moved to a later slot as part of reshuffling at the network. Were Anderson Cooper to be moved to a later slot, it would be another setback to him after his talk show was cancelled after just two seasons due to poor viewing figures. He has acknowledged that things may change for him and in an interview said that ‘it’s in the slower times that we’ve run into problems, and I hope we figure it all out'. Zucker was appointed as the new boss of CNN after it saw ratings plunge to near record lows. In April the network posted its worst month since 2001 with an average of just 357,000 viewers, a drop of 21 per cent on the previous year. The slump was even higher among the coveted 25-54 bracket where 29 per cent fewer people tuned in. A CNN spokesman said: ‘There is no shortage of rumors about what Jeff will do. He doesn’t start until late January and any speculation at this point is just silly.’ An NBC spokesman added: ‘Ann Curry is under contract with NBC News.

Convicted killer: Kelley Cannon, pictured, is trying to re-open her murder case in an effort to protect her husband's estate for their children . A mother-of-three convicted of strangling her millionaire husband to death is trying to re-open her case in an effort to protect his estate for their children. Kelley Cannon, of Nashville, claims the estate of her dead husband, James Cannon, is being squandered away before her kids, aged 5, 12 and 14, are old enough to inherit it. Under Tennessee law, anyone who murders a relative is banned from inheriting their money but earlier this month Ms Cannon was granted a hearing by the state's court of appeal, which could give her access to the funds. Ms Cannon was sentenced to life in prison in 2010 after a jury found her guilty of murdering her 44-year-old attorney husband, with whom she was in the throws of a bitter divorce. DNA evidence on the tip of a latex glove led prosecutors to believe that she strangled Mr Cannon. A cleaning lady found his body in a bedroom closet in his home. Ms Cannon said she went to the house the night before his body was discovered and found the back door open but no sign of her husband. Mr Cannon, who had full custody, had set up a trust for his three children years ago, which was taken over by a trust company after his murder. The trust company gave access to James Cannon's sister, Anna Kate Stallings, who is now raising the couple's children. Divorcing: Cannon, right, was sentenced to life in prison in 2010 after a jury found her guilty of murdering her 44-year-old attorney husband, James Cannon, left, with whom she was in the throws of a bitter divorce . Crime scene: A cleaning lady found James Cannon's body in a bedroom closet in his Nashville home, pictured . But Ms Cannon has accused Stallings of . misappropriating the trust fund after she spent nearly $1 million on a . home in a well-to-do Nashville suburb. Ms Cannon has maintained her innocence in the case, and her latest legal win could give her access to the trust fund, depending on the outcome of a civil jury trial. Cannon appealed her criminal conviction . after the decision and was denied but she has pursued the case and it . currently sits before the state Supreme Court, The Tennessean reported. Separately, Cannon has sought access to the trust fund and the appeals court said she at least deserves a hearing, reversing a lower court decision. Re-open: Kelley Cannon, pictured right, is trying to re-open her case from behind bars in a fight over the estate of James Cannon, left . It's unclear how much money is in the trust but Mr Cannon's estate has been valued at around $8 million. Stallings purchased the home in 2008, two months before taking custody of the children, for $925,000 with money from the estate. Prior to that, the Stallings were living in a Franklin home valued around $250,000. It is unclear what other transactions have been made or how much of the fund remains but Cannon's lawyer Andrew Cate insists the trust has been misappropriated. 'The terms of the trust state that Kelley needs to be notified before any funds are dispersed,' Cate said. 'She wants to make sure it's not squandered away.' A flurry of lawsuits have been filed since the conviction, including a $40 million wrongful death case Stallings filed on behalf of the three children against their mother. Though most of the civil suits have been put on hold until her criminal conviction is resolved.","Kelley Cannon, of Nashville, found guilty of strangling attorney husband, James Cannon, to death in 2010 .

With the love of his life on his arm and surrounded by doting family members, Michael Ware looks like any other proud and happy groom.

Trouble ahead: Michael Ware on his first wedding day with ex-wife Tina Baker. The couple are pictured with Michael's family Maurice and Dorothy Ware and Mr and Mrs Baker .

Michael has only been back to England twice - the first time six years ago when he introduced his new wife Tatiana and their three children to his dad and late mum Dorothy. Yesterday Maurice, 87, admitted: 'I knew he was making the right decision. I understood that he just needed to get away from everything here.' Frail Maurice said his son had adopted the Russian way of life so much his children - Alexander, 18, and Veronika, 16, and stepson Nikolai - speak virtually no English.

Michael had two daughters and a son by his first marriage but has lost all contact with them since leaving England. His . home now is tiny Dubinka which has a population of just 15, lies 50km . from the nearest road and where temperatures have plunged to minus 45C. Maurice, who also has a daughter Angela living in Devon, has never made the arduous trip to Siberia where his son ekes out a living tending sheep, cows, chickens and pigs. He said: 'Michael was a very private person and didn't like to talk about his feelings but I could see in his face he was devastated about his marriage. 'Tina was the love of his life and I thought that they had been very happily married.' Happy: Michael Ware, 55, uprooted himself from Exmoor and moved 4,000 miles to the remote village of Dubinka after splitting up with his wife of 12 years. He is pictured with new wife Tanya and children Veronika , right, and Alexander, left . Michael Ware's fellow villagers say they can no longer tell him apart from anyone else .

'He grew up on a farm and was fascinated by machinery and different farming methods.'He read about the way they do things over there and wanted to find out about it himself. 'When he came back, he said he'd fallen in love with the place and was going to live there permanently.' Michael's announcement came as a big shock to his mum Dorothy who passed away last year. Maurice, who still lives at Watchet on the edge of Exmoor, said: 'She was worried about him going all that way on his own and he is our only son so she was sad to say goodbye. 'But I wasn't worried about him. He's a big strong lad and I knew he was making the right decision. 'I understood that he just needed to get away from everything here. 'Siberia seems like an odd place to emigrate but he just loved the old fashioned way of doing things there. 'Six months before he left he bought some teach yourself Russian tapes and started to learn the language.' Michael met his wife Tatiana, 37, just a few months after arriving in his new homeland. They married quickly and Michael adopted her son Nikolai before having two children of their own and a third is now on the way. His father added: 'His new wife seems lovely - he's done very well for himself. 'She and the children don't speak much English, but it was nice to be able to meet them face-to-face rather than just in photos. 'I'm so pleased to hear that he has carved out a life for himself there and that he is happy.

'My only regret is that I wish I'd . gone out to see him when I was a bit younger - but Dorothy had a fear of . flying so we never did. 'I . think I would have loved it as much as he does.

'I had a 57-acre farm myself which Michael grew up on so he will definitely know what he's doing. 'Perhaps I'll still make it out there, you never know. 'Until then, we speak on the phone every month or so. It's always good to hear his voice. 'He might speak Russian now but he still sounds exactly the same to me. 'I'm certainly very proud of him and I'm sure his mother would be too.' Michael signed up for Siberia when he joined a group of UK farmers exploring opportunities in post-Communist Russia in 1992. The other nine in the group got cold feet and came back to Britain - but Michael was the only one to stay. He told the Siberian Times: 'I have no regrets. Siberia is beautiful.

Cougar: A new study has found that more Victorian women had toy-boy husbands than today's women . The 'cougar' - or an older women who dates or marries a younger man - may seem like a modern phenomenon but new research shows that there were more women with toy-boy husbands in Victorian times than there are today. A study of census data by genealogy website Ancestry.co.uk also showed that there were more single mothers in 19th century Britain than there are in the UK now. The study shows that while couples with 10 or more years between them nowadays comprise eight per cent of households, that figure was almost double in the 1800s. And while there is no particular trend for either gender to be the older spouse in the 21st century, in 61 per cent of cases the woman was the older partner two centuries previously. But while the modern day cougar might prey on younger men for sport, the Victorian lady had little choice in the matter. In the 1800s high mortality rates, particularly in the workplace, resulted in a greater number of widows, who needed to remarry, often to younger partners, to support families. The study also revealed a prevalence of single-parent households during Victorian times. These days around five per cent of households are single parent families, however a look at 1841 Census results, reveals back then one in six - or 16 per cent - of homes had just one parent. But unlike today, the cause of the breakdown of most relationships was down to the high mortality rate - death from childbirth was far more common than divorce. Many modern parents might bemoan the fact that they are lumbered with their children living at home for longer - but in fact the 'boomerang generation' where adult children move back in with their parents is far from being a new thing. Modern cougars: Both Demi Moore and Caroline Flack have been labelled as cougars, but being partnered with a younger man is not a new phenomenon according to a new study . In the 1841 Census, one in seven households had at least one adult-child aged 25 or older living under their roof, while today that figure is lower at 12 per cent - despite present high unemployment driving many adults back into the family home. Same age: Despite 16 per cent of Victorian women being married to younger men, Queen Victoria was the same age as her husband Albert . One modern development researchers found was the number of non-married, cohabiting couples. During the 1800s women often got married in their teens or early twenties, while today the average woman is 30-years-old before she ties the knot. Cohabiting couples comprised around one per cent of households during the 19th century, compared to 10 per cent today. Miriam Silverman, the website's UK Content Manager, said: 'The millions of census records now online allow for the observation of fascinating social trends - including how today's non-nuclear families are far from a modern trend. 'In many ways, a married couple with 2.4 children is the real 'unconventional' household. 'Census records are the most valuable collections available for anyone looking to begin the enthralling and rewarding journey into their family history - listing the details of millions of people living in England and Wales from 1841 to 1911.'","A study by genealogy website Ancestry.co.uk shows that there were more women with toy-boy husbands in the Victorian era than today .

U.S. Army Sergeant John Russell is accused of shooting five fellow servicemen in Iraq . A U.S. Army sergeant accused of killing five fellow servicemen at a military counselling centre in Iraq has been ordered to undergo forensic hypnosis in a bid to unlock buried memories. Sergeant John Russell, 48, has been deemed to have been suffering from post-traumatic distress disorder and was allegedly psychotic at the time of the shootings in 2009. An Army judge has now ordered the hypnosis to see if it is possible to learn more about Russell's mental state during the shooting frenzy. The military has claimed the incident may have been triggered by combat stress. Russell, a member of the Army's 54th . Engineer Battalion based in Bamberg, Germany, faces five charges of . premeditated murder, one charge of aggravated assault and one charge of . attempted murder in connection with the May 2009 shootings. Two . of the dead were medical staff officers at a combat stress counselling . clinic called Camp Liberty, part of the U.S. military's Victory Base . Complex near the Baghdad airport. The other three were soldiers who . happened to be at the centre at the time. A . forensic psychiatrist who has since examined Russell suggested the . sergeant was 'provoked to violence by the ineptitude and lack of . compassion' he experienced from clinic staff when he sought treatment . for depression several days before the shooting. The . judge in the case, Army Colonel David Conn, cited the psychiatric . opinion verbatim in his defence motions ruling, made public on Tuesday. In . addition to assigning a Stanford University specialist to interview . Russell under hypnosis, Conn ordered a sophisticated brain scan and . battery of psychological tests for the sergeant. Crime scene: The killings happened at a combat stress counseling clinic called Camp Liberty in Iraq, pictured . 'At breaking point': It is alleged that U.S. Army sergeant John Russell was suffering from post-traumatic distress disorder at the time of the shootings after multiple deployments (stock image) Six months ago, Russell was ordered to stand trial in a military court at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington. The court-martial could begin as early as March. But his defence team is seeking to show that Russell was not in control of his actions and thus not criminally responsible. During proceedings last month on his . mental condition, a University of Pennsylvania forensic psychiatrist . said he concluded that Russell was suffering from post-traumatic stress . disorder and psychosis at the time of the shooting spree. The . psychiatrist, Dr. Robert Sadoff, also said Russell suffered from . 'dissociative disorder,' or a lack of memory about the shootings. Moreover, . Saddoff harshly criticized a psychologist and a psychiatrist on the . staff at Camp Victory for what he called 'inexcusable treatment' of . Russell days before the shooting. Locator: Two medical officers and three serving soldiers were killed at the base in Iraq . 'I have never seen a case such as this one where the defendant was provoked to violence by the ineptitude and lack of compassion of two of my colleagues, who were assigned to evaluate and treat Sergeant Russell while he was in an acute state of depression, with suicidal intent, while on active duty in Iraq,' Sadoff wrote in a submission quoted in Conn's ruling. Russell's lawyer, James Culp, said his client had been 'abused' and belittled by the two officers, and that one had chased Russell out of the clinic while screaming at him. They were not the officers killed in the shooting rampage. Culp told Reuters he hoped to prove that his client was legally insane at the time of the shootings. 'The defence and prosecution agree . that Sergeant Russell was psychotic,' Culp said. 'The question is, ""How . psychotic was he?""' He added: 'Not one person in the military has ever . been found not guilty by reason of insanity.' The . case comes at a sensitive time for the Army, which is in the process of . deciding how to prosecute Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, a soldier . accused of killing 16 Afghan villagers in cold blood earlier this year. Culp . has said Russell was at a breaking point from the stress of multiple . deployments, and suffered 'at least one traumatic experience involving . civilian casualties' and 'mass grave sites' while serving in Bosnia and . Kosovo.

A serial killer who murdered an 18-year-old barista waited at the coffee shop where she worked to kill her boyfriend, police have revealed. Israel Keyes, who recently took his own life in his jail cell, abducted Samantha Koenig from the coffee stand in Anchorage, Atlanta, after climbing in through the drive-thru window. Homicide police Detective Monique Doll said Keyes bound Koenig with zip ties and then waited with his victim on the floor of the darkened structure. Scroll down to watch video . Serial killer: Israel Keyes, pictured left, abducted Samantha Koenig, pictured right, from a drive-thru coffee stand where she worked. Police believe he also hoped to murder her boyfriend before changing his mind . Footage of Israel Keyes during an interview with police in which he confessed to having multiple personalities for the last 14 years and that he felt a 'rush' from killing people . Ms Doll said investigators reviewing the abduction captured on CCTV footage initially thought Keyes had Miss Koenig on the floor to wait and see if anyone had seen him climb through the window. But after watching the tapes again, police now believe he was waiting for Miss Koenig's boyfriend who often picked her up from work. Ms Doll added: 'What we found when we interviewed Mr Keyes was that he knew that the coffee kiosk closed at 8pm and he knew that because Samantha didn't have a vehicle there, somebody was going to come and pick her up. 'He was waiting for her ride to come there because he intended to take that person as well.' Abducted: Police believe Keyes also hoped to murder the boyfriend of Samantha Koenig . Keyes, 34, ended up leaving with Miss Koenig shortly before the arrival of her boyfriend, Duane Tortolani II. Ms Doll said she doesn't know why Keyes changed his mind about also killing the boyfriend, as he had also killed a Vermont couple last year. She continued: 'I don't know why he left, but he made it very clear that was part of the plan. It was very fortuitous for Mr Tortolani not to have run into Mr Keyes.' Mr Tortolani reported seeing someone in a mask standing near his truck at about 3am the following morning. He confronted the person, whom Ms Doll said was Keyes trying to steal a debit card from the pickup. Mr Tortolani then ran inside the home he shared with Koenig and her father to get his help. Keyes, who had parked a distance from the house, was gone by the time the men came out, Ms Doll added. A debit card for an account Miss Koenig shared with Mr Tortolani was also missing. Ms Doll said the once-methodical Keyes was losing control before he was arrested. She likened this to a drug addict's need to continue to take more drugs to match the feeling of the initial high. In Keyes' case, this escalation went from single victims to the desire to kill pairs. Shortly before killing the Vermont couple, Keyes came close to killing a couple parked in a car at an Anchorage park, police said. He also considered shooting the police officer who came to shoo the pair away from the closed park, but abandoned his plan when a backup officer arrived. Revelations: Police say that Keyes confessed to killing Bill and Lorraine Currier, pictured, who have not been seen since June 2011 . Stolen: After killing Koenig, police said Keyes stole a debit card from her boyfriend's truck the following morning . Keyes, who confessed to killing Miss Koenig and at least seven others across the country, told investigators he raped and strangled Miss Koenig, leaving her body in a shed for two weeks while he went on a cruise. Keyes was arrested in Lufkin, Texas, in March after using the boyfriend's stolen debit card. Three weeks after Keyes was arrested, Miss Koenig's dismembered body was found in a frozen lake north of Anchorage. Keyes was found dead earlier this month after slitting a wrist and strangling himself with a rolled up sheet in his Anchorage jail cell, where he was awaiting trial next year for Miss Koenig's slaying. Before his death, Keyes also confessed to four murders in Washington state, two in Vermont and one on the East Coast with the body disposed of in New York over the past decade. There also could be three additional victims, for a total of 11 murders, according to the FBI.

A central Indiana girls high school basketball game turned into a rout Tuesday night when Bloomington South High School beat Arlington High School by a final score of 107-2. The shocking score line has sparked outrage, not for the embarrassed losers but for the winners who have been accused of unsportsman-like behavior after running up the massive score. ‘(The score) is probably not what we would like to see,’ said Chris Kaufman, spokesman for the Indiana High School Athletic Association, which doesn’t have a so-called mercy rule. Basketball massacre: Bloomington South beat Arlington 107-2 in girls basketball, but some people think they went too far . Also known by the slightly less polite term slaughter rule, the mercy rule brings a sports event to an early end when one team has a commanding lead over the other. It is called the mercy rule because it spares the losing team the humiliation of suffering a massacre. While extremely rare in competitive sports, it is common at a high school level. Defending his team’s victory, Bloomington coach Larry Winters told RTV6 that he played all nine girls on the team during the game. Lauren Whitlach tallied 30 points for the winning team and the result is their first ever victory by more than 34 points. Arlington's only two points came from free throws in the second and third quarters. The high scoring game has ignited much debate online. ‘Say what you want, but a 107-2 score makes Bloomington South look worse than it does Arlington,’ tweeted Jake Query, a host for 1260 WNDE.

Brooke Mueller is said to have entered rehab due to addiction issues with prescription medication. The ex-wife of Charlie Sheen is apparently hooked on Adderall - a powerful psycho-stimulant used to treat Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It makes it the 19th time the reality star and actress has checked into rehab, according to TMZ. A spokesman for 35-year-old Mueller - . who was rushed to hospital on Friday after reportedly overdosing on the . drug - declined to comment to MailOnline about her rehabilitation. TMZ reports Mueller was admitted to a facility on Monday night for an 'undetermined period of time'. More trouble: Brooke, pictured on Thursday evening, is said to have entered rehab on Monday night following an apparent overdose on Adderall last week . Her lawyer, Yale Galanter, is quoted by the website as saying: 'Brooke was uncomfortable with the way Adderall was making her behave.' He insisted she had no illegal drugs in her system when she overdosed last week. The former wife of Charlie Sheen - who has twins Bob and Max, three, . with the Anger Management star - was taken from her home in Tarzana, Los . Angeles to a nearby hospital on Friday morning after being found . unconscious. According to gossip website TMZ, a very low amount of alcohol was also present in her system when she was tested. Mueller, who pleaded guilty to a . felony drug possession back in May, is not allowed to drink alcohol . under the terms of her one-year probation. But her attorney added that the low level is very unlikely to constitute a probation violation. Safe with the nanny: Brooke Mueller's twin sons Bob and Max, whom she shares with ex-husband Charlie Sheen, were under the care of their nanny when Mueller was rushed to hospital on Friday morning . He said: 'Brooke continues her lifelong battle with drug addiction . by taking these steps herself to prevent a further drug relapse.' After being discharged from hospital last week, Brooke is said to have told . friends she took more than the prescribed dose of her attention deficit . hyperactivity disorder medication (Adderall). Mueller's publicist spoke out at the . time of the incident, insisting no drugs were involved, despite initial . reports over an overdose.

The Prime Minister backed planning minister Nick Boles, who caused fury last month by saying the Government needs to concrete over an area of greenfield land twice the size of Greater London. Mr Cameron said it was not a target to build on 3 per cent more of Britain’s land – the figure outlined by Mr Boles – but he made clear that greenfield sites would have to disappear for new homes to be built. And he said the Government would continue to push for the planning system to be speeded up to allow new development. Mr Boles had said that about 9 per cent of land was currently developed in the UK and ‘all we need to do is build on another 2 to 3 per cent of land’ to solve the housing crisis. He was condemned by Andrew Motion, the former poet laureate who is president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, as ‘incredibly irresponsible’. But Mr Cameron went to his defence yesterday, telling MPs that Mr Boles was ‘honest and honourable’ to make his statement. He said: ‘He was trying to give an exemplification of the scale of the problem. It is not Government policy to set a target of the percentage of land to be built on. That 3 per cent is not going to form a target. ‘He was making an honest and honourable point that if we want to build more houses in Britain – and we have a massive housing shortage – we will on occasion have to build on some greenfield sites. ‘We will have to see planning permissions go ahead. That is a very correct thing to say. We have to be honest about that.’ In another controversial move Mr Cameron also backed the use of fracking technology to extract shale gas, saying Britain should ‘keep an open mind’ about the proposals, which critics fear could cause mini earthquakes and blight the landscape. Firm: Mr Cameron made clear that greenfield sites would have to disappear for new homes to be built . He said: ‘I think it would be a big risk just to ignore what is happening in the gas market. We should have an open mind and we should take part in fracking and unconventional gas because this might be a revolution that we should be involved in. ‘If we ignored it completely, you could be giving your economy much higher energy prices than is necessary.’ Mr Cameron said the Government wanted to hand greater control to local neighbourhoods to decide the number and kind of houses to be built in their areas. But he also said communities should be given incentives to accept new developments such as onshore windfarms – a plan the Government is currently consulting on. Mr Cameron made his comments as he was quizzed by MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee. In the two-hour appearance he also appeared to give ground over the Government’s plans for secret courts. Ministers suffered a series of humiliating defeats in the House of Lords earlier this month over plans to hold civil proceedings behind closed doors in terrorism cases. Peers demanded that judges, not politicians, should decide whether evidence from the intelligence services should be heard in public. ‘We want to accept as many amendments as possible without wrecking the central tenets of the bill,’ Mr Cameron said. He insisted he would not make policy on the hoof, but appeared to accept the principle that judges should be in charge.","David Cameron made clear that greenfield sites would have to disappear .

It's a tiring life for little Bueno after the ordeal of being rejected by his mum only to be adopted by his keeper at the monkey centre where he lives. The woolly monkey was snubbed by his mum Sara after a birth that took everyone by surprise. But the endangered baby monkey has now found himself a surrogate mother in the form of monkey expert Dr Alison Cronin. Full name Bueno Junior, he is one of just a handful of woolly monkeys to be born in captivity in the world. Alison has taken the tiny cuddly creature under her wing and feeds him bottles of milk and handfuls of rice four times a day. Bueno is a long way from his native South American rain forest habitat . Bueno Junior has found a new mum in monkey expert Dr Alison Cronin . She wraps the mite in a fluffy blanket to keep him warm and comforts him by rubbing his lips on her little finger as if it was his mother’s cheek. Staff at Monkey World, near Wareham, Dorset, only realised his mum was pregnant when they found her having contractions. After a difficult labour Sara gave birth to Bueno, who weighed in at just 15ozs. Dr Alison Cronin (pictured) expects Bueno to be hand reared for five months before being joining the pack . 'We had to shake and rub him to get him going, but then he started gasping and wriggling' Alison said: “We came in one morning and . the primate care staff noticed Sara’s abdomen was straining and she was . having contractions. “We tried to give her baby back as she was coming round from the anaesthetic but she (Sara) wouldn’t take him. “This wasn’t too surprising after everything she had been through. “Of course, we would have preferred Sara to have been able to rear her first infant. “As soon as Junior was born there were a few worrying moments. “We had to shake and rub him to get him going, but then he started gasping and wriggling which was great. “We tried to leave him with her but she just ripped him off her. “However, we are hopeful that next time, Sara’s labour will progress properly and she’ll be able to deliver normally. “When that happens, all of the right instincts will be there.” Woolly monkeys facing 'imminent extinction' in the wild . It is thought Bueno Junior will be hand-reared for five months before joining one of the three packs of woolly monkeys at the ape centre. Junior’s dad, Bueno Senior, sadly passed away before his son was born. Woolly monkeys come from the rainforests of South America. Living in relatively large social groups ranging from 10 to 45 individuals, their ideal habitat is humid and mature tropical forests. Alison added: “They are facing imminent extinction and Monkey World is the only place on the planet where you can see groups of Woolly monkeys in captivity.” What a mouthful: Little Bueno sucks Dr Cronin's finger for comfort .","Woolly monkey Bueno is one of only a handful to be born in captivity .

A woman whose estranged husband allegedly pretended to be a medic to lure women to his home for invasive medical exams that he secretly filmed discovered evidence of the sickening scam as she searched for Christmas decorations, police have revealed. Kimberly Gavin-Anderson uncovered a trove of medical pamphlets, supplies, small surveillance cameras and questionnaires filled out by David E. Anderson's victims and contacted police. It came after she had already tipped off authorities after finding nude images of her nieces, aged 10 to 13, on his computer in a  folder entitled 'Family and Friends', police said. The images were taken as the unsuspecting young girls . used a bathroom at Anderson's beach house in Salisbury, Massachusetts over the summer. In court: David Anderson, left, allegedly filmed women undergoing invasive procedures after claiming he was a medic. He is also accused of hiding cameras to film his young nieces in the nude . After that report, Salisbury police obtained a . search warrant for his computers and, with the help of FBI and state . police, allegedly uncovered 'thousands' of video of the girls. In searching the home, . police also found two external hard drives that contained videos of the . 'medical examinations' with time stamps as early as 2008, Chief Tom Fowler told the Boston Herald. The father-of-one is being held on $500,000 bail following his arraignment on Monday on charges of unlawfully recording a nude or . partially nude person and possession of child pornography. Anderson allegedly recruited women through Craigslist and distributed  fliers through the community offering to pay between $25 and $50 to be examined by medical students for research, the Newburyport Daily News reported. Discovery: Anderson's stash of thousands of images and film was found after his estranged wife, Kimberly Gavin-Anderson, right, found them in a computer file entitled 'Family and Friends' Scene: Police discovered images and supplies at Anderson's Massachusetts beach house, pictured . But Anderson said that, as part of . the process, the women would need to undergo a 'baseline internal . examination' first. Police said this included digital probing and other . personal acts. Authorities say he may have lured more than 20 unsuspecting women to his beach house as part of the scam over several years. And as part of the act, Anderson allegedly bought medical devices including as a blood pressure monitor, latex gloves, lubrication jelly and a stethoscope. 'I’ve never seen anything this bizarre,' Fowler said of the crime. For his beach home, he allegedly bought pin-sized cameras and set them up throughout the house. Police said he is being investigated . in other states, including Connecticut, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New . York and Washington, for similar alleged crimes. On the prowl: He allegedly posted ads for women on Craigslist and handed out fliers in the community . Authorities were able to track down one 30-year-old victim who said she . was handed a flyer in New York City and believed the examination was . legitimate. She was paid $50. He is accused of possessing child pornography on at least one computer, as well as the images of his four young relatives 'in various states of undress'. His court-appointed attorney said his bail was excessive and his client is not a flight risk. Additional charges stemming from his luring unsuspecting women into his . beach house and secretly videotaping them are likely to be filed, . Essex County prosecutor Maura Bailey said.

An ecological disaster was narrowly averted today after a British cargo ship was grounded off the coast of Spain. The eight-hour drama began at 4.15am when coastguards for the northern province of Asturias spotted that the 89metre long Beaumont was too close to rocks. It sparked fears there could be a major oil spill - such as . the one that blighted a stretch of Galician coast after the Prestige . oil tanker sank in 2002. The 2,545ton Beaumont ran on to a bank in the Aviles Estuary as it . approached the Aviles port on the Bay of Biscay. Spain's Maritime Rescue Service received a . distress signal at around 4.15am and immediately contacted the vessel. Rescued: The 2,545 ton cargo ship ran aground on the north coast of Spain early this morning but has since been freed . The British-flagged ship, manned by six crew, soon confirmed to the authorities in a radio call that it was in trouble and had sailed too close to the beach in Xago. A helicopter, tugboat and speed boat were dispatched to help with the rescue operation and an investigation is now under way into how the collision occurred. The ship had been transporting wooden pellets from the Galician port of A Coruna for a company called 'Pellets Asturias'. Stranded: The Beaumont had been transporting wooden pellets to the port of Aviles in northern Spain . The tugboat finally managed to dislodge the vessel from the rocks shortly after 1pm. The crew were reportedly unharmed and did not have to be evacuated during the incident. The boat carried on its journey, from A Coruña to Avilés, where it was due to pick up a cargo of wooden pellets. A spokesman for the Coastguard told El Mundo newspaper that damage had been caused to the ballast tank. But he added that there had not been a fuel leak. Despite the claim, environmental activists still took to Twitter to question whether this was true. The newspaper later reported that shipping firm Alvargonzalez told the Ria de Avilés port that the ship may pass through its base for a more thorough investigation.","The Beaumont left stranded on bank near town of Aviles .

Written in the summer of 1969 to his secret lover Marsha Hunt, they reveal a tender side to the Rolling Stones singer rarely seen in public. Jagger is understood to have made it clear to his former girlfriend that he wished to keep them private – but she had other ideas. Jagge-d heart: Mick Jagger wrote the letters in 1969 to American-born singer Marsha Hunt, right, who was the inspiration for the . Rolling Stones' hit Brown Sugar . 'Trade words across the Indian ocean': The rock legend is said to have made it clear that he wanted the intimate notes kept private . Love letter: An envelope containing one of the letters, written by a 25-year-old Mick Jagger during his time in Australia and sent to Ms Hunt's London address, which sold for £187,250 . Yesterday, they went under the hammer for an incredible £187,250 after a three-minute bidding war at Sotheby’s. The 10 letters, said to paint a picture of Jagger as a ‘poetic and self-aware’ 25-year-old, were written to the American-born singer while Jagger was in Australia. In one steamy note, he promises Marsha: ‘I will kiss you softly. And bite your mouth too.’ In other letters, he is more poetic, musing: ‘If I sailed with you around the world/All my sails would be unfurled.’ Miss Hunt provided the inspiration for . the Stones’ 1971 hit Brown Sugar and gave birth to Jagger’s child Karis . in 1972 after a three year love affair. Like father, like daughter: Marsha Hunt in the late 90s with daughter Karis, fathered by Mick during their three-year love affair . Now 66, she said she was selling the letters because she was ‘broke’ and needed to make repairs to her home in France. Asked recently if Jagger supported the sale, she said: ‘I don’t think so but they’re not his.’ The auctioneer is so worried about legal action from Jagger, they have taken the unusual step of not releasing substantial extracts from the letters to the media. Broke: Marsha Hunt, pictured in 2005 when she suffered from breast cancer, sold the letters to repair her home . Speaking after yesterday’s sale, Miss Hunt said: ‘The passage of time has given these letters a place in our cultural history. ‘1969 saw the ebbing of a crucial, revolutionary era, highly influenced by such artists as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, James Brown and Bob Dylan. ‘Their inner thoughts should not be the property of only their families, but the public at large, to reveal who these influential artists were – not as commercial images, but their private selves.’ Written from his film set for Ned . Kelly in the outback just after the Stones’ landmark Hyde Park concert, . the documents provide a glimpse into the singer as a young man. There . are mentions of the events and people of the time such as the first . moon landing, John Lennon and Yoko Ono and the Isle of Wight festival. And . also included are also references to the death of former Rolling Stones . band mate Brian Jones and Jagger’s difficult relationship with Marianne . Faithfull. Gabriel Heaton, . Sotheby’s books specialist, said: ‘Here we see Mick Jagger not as the . global superstar he has become, but as a poetic and self-aware . 25-year-old with wide-ranging intellectual and artistic interests. ‘They . provide a rare glimpse of Jagger that is very different from his public . persona: passionate but self-contained, lyrical but with a strong sense . of irony.’ The letters were sold to a private telephone bidder at around double the estimated price of between £70,000 and £100,000. Not approved: Mick Jagger, on stage with the Rolling Stones at the O2 in London, is said to have told Ms Hunt to keep the letters private . Sotheby’s have said they were not contacted by Jagger before the sale. The auctioneer was able to sell the letters without his cooperation because Miss Hunt is the legal owner of the papers themselves – even though he owns the copyright to their contents. Hunt was a poster girl for the ‘Black is Beautiful’ movement and also the face of ground-breaking West End play Hair. Born in Philadelphia, she arrived in London in 1966 and performed on the blues circuit with Alexis Korner and a young Elton John. She had been asked by the Rolling Stones to appear in a photo shoot for ‘Honky Tonk Woman’ but refused on feminist grounds. But Jagger pursued Hunt, appearing at midnight at the door of her Bloomsbury apartment shortly afterwards.","Love letters between Mick Jagger and Marsha Hunt sold for £187,250 .

Celebrating: The video, which shows cheering rebels and cars driving around the base, was allegedly shot in the early hours of Friday morning . Two Aleppo-based activists and Rami Abdul-Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, also said Jabhat al-Nusra fought in the battle. Abu Firas, spokesman for the .

He said more than 10 Syrian soldiers were captured and many killed, alongside four rebel soldiers. The rebels have set up checkpoints around the base and were able to confiscate 20 different rockets. One Aleppo activist said despite the government raids the rebels . had taken all the munitions they could from the newly captured base, and . he hoped they could find a way to use the missiles against Assad's air . force.

Raid: A spokesperson for the rebels said the Syrian government carried out air strikes this morning , destroying most of the rockets at the base . Western powers worry that Islamist extremists are playing an increasing role in Syria's civil war, which started in March 2011 as a mostly peaceful uprising against President Bashar Assad. Activist say more than 32,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Despite their opposition to the Assad regime, the U.S. and others have cited the presence of extremists among the rebels as a reason not to supply them with weapons. Rebel leaders argue that the lack of military aid leaves a vacuum that extremists can exploit. The base captured Friday is part of the large air defense infrastructure Syria has built across the country over the years, mostly for use in a possible war with archenemy Israel. Last week, the rebels reported seizing another air defense base outside the capital, Damascus, as well as a base in the southern province of Daraa. Online videos shows them torching vehicles and seizing boxes of ammunition in the Daraa base. The storming of such bases by rebels from inside Syria embarrasses the Assad regime, though it is unclear if the rebels have the know-how to deploy these bases' weapons. Nor is it clear if the rebels are holding the bases after storming them. Meanwhile, President Assad has received support from Lebanese politican Michel Aoun. The ex-general and Maronite politician said: ‘Syria will achieve victory over the conspiracy and will turn into a democratic state that will be a model for the rest of the countries currently fighting it,’ he told government news agency, Sana. Interviewed by Syrian television, Mr Aoun said President Assad will put an end to the radical extremist surge in the region and its win of the war would result in a new world order as the U.S. unilateralism is no longer acceptable. He added that he believes that, unlike other Arab countries which saw their governments toppled during the Arab Spring Syria is heading towards democracy and despite losses, both human and economic, the administration in Syria has remained strong. By . Mail Foreign Service and Associated Press . Intercepted: The Syrian passenger plane that was forced by Turkish jets to land in Ankara on Wednesday . The interception of a passenger plane allegedly carrying military gear from Moscow to Damascus is a sign of Turkey's mounting frustration at the drawn-out conflict and its inability to hasten regime change in Syria, according to analysts. Recent cross-border shelling from Syria that killed five Turkish civilians near the countries' 566-mile common frontier may have forced Turkey to act, but its options were limited. ‘There's nothing magical about the timing. It's a coincidence resulting from the build-up of frustration in Ankara,’ said Fadi Hakura, a Turkey analyst at the Chatham House think tank in London. ‘Turkey wants to hasten the demise of the Assad regime in Damascus, but really its hands are tied.’ Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been at the forefront of international efforts to put pressure on the Assad regime and end its 19-month crackdown on the opposition. Last year, Ankara began allowing members of the rebel Free Syrian Army to operate in Turkey and now Syria's civil war has reached a stalemate. ‘Given the current international impasse over the conflict in Syria, practical measures such as the interception of aircraft will become increasingly important for states seeking to restrict Syrian government forces' access to military-related goods from external sources,’ said Edin Omanovic, a researcher with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Turkish fighter jets on Wednesday intercepted the Syrian Air plane they said was carrying Russian ammunition and military equipment destined for the Syrian Defense Ministry. Syria branded the incident piracy and Russia said the action endangered the lives of Russian citizens aboard the aircraft. Russia has been one of Syria's main weapons suppliers, and it has also been shielding the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad from U.N. sanctions. Mehmet Yegin, an analyst with the Ankara-based International Strategic Research Organization, said that it was not yet clear whether the decision to force down the Moscow to Damascus plane was part of a larger drive to change the dynamic of the war. ‘If it is acting with its allies, it's a clear message to Russia to get out of the picture and stop arming Syria,’ he added. ‘It is such a bold move, that one wonders if Turkey acted alone.’ U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland declined Thursday to comment on Turkish media reports that the intelligence on the plane's contents had come from the United States. But she told reporters that Washington backed Turkey's decision to intercept the plane. ‘Any transfer of any military equipment to the Syrian regime at this time is very concerning, and we look forward to hearing more from the Turkish side when they get to the bottom of what they found,’ said Nuland. The exact contents of the cargo are still unclear: Turkey's prime minister described it as ‘ammunition,’ while Yeni Safak, a newspaper close to the Turkish government, reported Friday that the cargo contained 12 pieces of missile parts and ‘trigger devices’ and that intelligence received was that it could be used by Syria against Turkey. The respected Russian daily Kommersant quoted an unidentified source as saying there were 12 boxes of spare parts for radars of the Syrian missile defense units. ‘If the Kommersant report is right, you could speculate about this being part of a build-up to imposing a no-fly zone,’ said Hugh Pope, who leads the Turkey program for the International Crisis Group. Such a move could be the first step toward lending Syria's rebels the same kind of international air support that helped bring down Libya's Muammar Gadhafi last year. But most analysts see no push — either in Turkey or among its Western allies — for outside military involvement in Syria.","Syrian rebels were joined by extremist group Jabhat al-Nusra in the attack last night .

A Canadian hair salon has been attacked and its owners sent death threats after using a model posed as a domestic violence victim to pledge its services could make a beaten woman look beautiful. Edmonton business Fluid Salon said they had made her the 'hottest battered woman' ever and usedthe tagline 'Look good in all you do'. Released on a New York blog it shows the well-groomed but bruised woman as her boyfriend or husband is about to give her an expensive diamond necklace. Fury: A salon in Edmonton is under fire for running a controversial series of ads depicting images of domestic violence . A comment posted by Fluid Hair under the picture on its Facebook site reads: 'hottest battered woman I’ve ever laid my eyes upon.' The image has swept across the internet and led to the premises being vandalised with the words in pink and purple paint 'This is art that is wrongly named violence' and 'That was violence wrongly named art'. 'Somebody had spilled paint and spray painted, and glued offensive messages to the windows of the salon,' Edmonton sergeant Rick Evans said, adding the business has been receiving hate mail and death threats. Salon owner Sarah Cameron said the advert reflects society and should be considered art. 'It might strike a chord, but as the way our society and community is getting, we keep tailoring everything because everyone is getting so sensitive,' she said. 'Anyone who has a connection or a story behind anything can be upset or have an opinion. We are not trying to attack anyone.' 'We wanted to push limits. You see the picture, you think it’s a nice photo and then you see the controversy. 'We just like art, and it’s also objective.' But campaigners have reacted furiously to the advert, which is one of six, saying that it glorified violence against women. Jan Reimer, a provincial coordinator with the Alberta Council of Women’s Shelters said:'It glamorises domestic violence. The ad is disturbing and chilling. 'They may have had the best of intentions, but I don’t think they thought it out much in terms of what the message is. It seems like this is an ad for domestic violence.' 'I was appalled,' blogger Kasia Gawlak said. 'It’s like saying, ""at least you have good looking hair when your boyfriend abuses you."" 'The women who have been abused (deal) with real pain, heartbreak and suffering — it’s not something that should be trivialised to sell a hair salon.'","Controversial advert claims that Canada's Fluid Salon will ensure visitors 'Look good in all you do'

The parents of a 10-year-old boy who was strip searched by an assistant principal after he was wrongly accused of stealing $20 from a classmate are now suing the school district official over his treatment. Clarinda and Lionel Cox, from Fayetteville, North Carolina, said their son Justin was left traumatised after Teresa Holmes ordered him to remove all of his clothes except for his T-shirt and boxer shorts. The $20 note was later found under a table in the cafeteria of Union Elementary School in Clinton, where Justin was a third-grader at the time. The Cox family has filed an 11-page complaint alleging that the search by Holmes, who has since retired, was a violation of the boy's constitutional protection from unreasonable searches. Upset: Justin Cox, 10, was left traumatized after he was strip-searched when a $20 note when missing at his elementary school, his parents said. They are now suing the school . '[Holmes] ordered J.C. to . remove his shoes, socks, pants, and shirt,' the complaint reads. 'When . J.C. was stripped down to his undershorts and undershirt, [Holmes] put . her fingers inside the waistband of J.C.’s undershorts and ran her . fingers around the waistband. '[Holmes] also lifted J.C.’s undershirt and . searched his bare torso.' When Clarinda Cox later returned home that day, she found . Justin waiting outside for her, which 'was unusual,' the lawsuit said. 'She made me take my clothes off,' the boy told his mother on her arrival. 'Too far': Assistant Principal Teresa Holmes, who has retired, said she was within her rights to search him . John Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute, a Virginia-based civil liberties organization, told Fox News that the search was a violation of the boy's Fourth Amendment rights, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. In 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded school officials did not have the authority to strip-search a 13-year-old girl without evidence the item she held she posed a danger, Whitehead said. 'School officials often don't know the law,' he said. 'There's sort of this mentality that all kids are dangerous today... What you're talking about here was a $20 bill, not a gun or a knife.' He added: 'The boy was traumatized and his parents were traumatized. There is direct Supreme Court precedent and they violated it.' Aspokeswoman for Sampson County Schools referred inquiries to attorney Benjamin Wright, who did not respond to a request for comment. Holmes no longer works at the school and retired in June, shortly after the Cox family stepped forward with their complaints. Justin was searched after he came across money in the cafeteria and gave it back to the student. But the $20 bill went . missing again, and the girl told Holmes and . accused the boy of stealing it, WRAL reported at the time. Holmes then confronted the boy about the theft claim. 'She didn’t ask me if she could, she told me, she said, ""Now I have to strip-search you"",' Justin said. Taking a stand: Clarinda and Lionel Cox, pictured, are now suing the school over searching their son . Anger: The parents, pictured, said the boy was visibly distressed following the incident in June . Holmes took the little boy to the men's room and ordered him to take off his clothes in the presence of a male janitor. The assistant principal did not find the money, Cox said, and hugged Justin and apologized to him afterward. Cox said she was upset that the . school failed to notify her about the incident. When she came home from . work, she learned about the strip-search from Justin, who was visibly . distraught. Sampson . County Schools spokesperson Susan Warren admitted that Cox should have . been informed about the search, but noted that Holmes did nothing wrong.

But Holmes offered her side of the . story, saying that Justin was seen diving under the table after the . money, and several students and two teachers saw him pocket the . banknote.

Acclaimed: Louis le Brocquy, pictured during his 90th birthday celebration at the National Gallery of Ireland, died at home in Dublin after a long illness . Famed Irish painter, Louis le Brocquy, whose works can be found in some of the world's best-known museums, died yesterday at the age of 95. The self-taught modernist, who critics regard with the same respect as contemporaries Francis Bacon and Lucien Freud, had been struggling with illness for the past year. His wife, the renowned artist Anne  Madden, was by his side when he passed away at his home in Dublin. Best-known for his abstract portraits of literary and artistic personalities, the father-of-three had until the time of his death been considered Ireland’s greatest living artist. Irish president Michael D Higgins led the tributes today, saying: ‘Louis le Brocquy’s pioneering approach to art, influenced by the European masters, was highly inspirational. His works, including the Tinker paintings, broke new ground and opened dialogue around the human condition and suffering. ‘Through painting, tapestry and print, le Brocquy has provided us with individual works and collections that give the insight and response of an artist of genius to Irish history, culture and society.’ Unique vision: Louis le Brocquy painted this portrait of his friend, the writer Samuel Beckett in 1979 . His works regularly reach the €1m mark at auctions – still a rare achievement for artists during their lifetimes. His A Family was the first ever piece by a living artist to be acquired by The National Gallery of Ireland, which paid €2.75m (£2.25m) for it. The painting had initially been rejected when it was first presented to the Dublin Municipal Gallery in 1952 and led to protests by other artists. It was labelled by its critics as ‘unwholesome and satanic distortion of natural beauty’ and ‘bewildering and repulsive’. Star struck: U2 singer Bono at the unveiling of Image Of Bono by aritst Louis le Brocquy at the National Gallery in Dublin in 2003 . The painting went on to receive international acclaim at the Venice Biennale in 1956, and was given historical recognition in Cinquante Ans d’Art Moderne. It remained out of the country for nearly 50 years before finally being hung in the National Gallery. As one columnist said at the time: ‘The prophet has finally been honoured in his own land.’ Jimmy Deenihan, Minister for Arts said: ‘Louis was the first truly internationally successful Irish modernist. ‘His work has received due international attention and many accolades in a career that spanned a remarkable seven decades of creative practice. ‘There always was a daring in the subtlety with which he addressed his subjects over a blessedly long creative career, and this was recognised throughout the art world.’ History maker: A Family by Louis le Brocquy was not only the first piece by a living artist when it was acquired by the National Gallery in 1951 - but they paid ¿2.75m for it . Pat Moylan, chairman of the Arts Council, said: ‘The council is deeply saddened at the passing of Louis le Brocquy. ‘Louis was one of the most important visual artists that Ireland has produced.’ Colm O’Gorman of Amnesty International Ireland – which le Brocquy’s mother Sybil helped found – also paid tribute. Of the artist, Mr O’Gorman said: ‘Throughout an artistic career characterised by innovation and genius, Louis le Brocquy retained a passionate commitment to people facing persecution and to doing what he could to support those struggling against oppression in the world’s darkest corners.’ Le Brocquy was born in Dublin in November 1916, the eldest son of Albert and Sybil. As a boy, his first art teacher was Elizabeth Yeats. Happy family: Louis le Brocquy with wife Anne Madden and son Pierre in the Fenton Gallery, Cork in 2006 . While at school in St Gerard’s in Bray, Co. Wicklow, Stuart Dodgson Collingwood – one of the teachers and a nephew of Lewis Carroll – tried to encourage him to become an artist. Le Brocquy ‘light-heartedly’ took up art while at college, creating a number of works which he entered into the Royal Hibernian Academy exhibition of 1937. Two were accepted by the prestigious academy. He later claimed that studying Dutch master Rembrandt gave him ‘the deepest insight’. By 1956, he was representing Ireland at the Venice Biennale, where he won the Premio Acquisito Internationale, and at the historic Fifty Years of Modern Art exhibition at the 1958 Brussels World Fair. Later work was mainly taken up with his famous head paintings, which included portraits of W.B. Yeats, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, Francis Bacon, Seamus Heaney and Bono. In 2007, he received the Freedom of Dublin. He is survived by his daughter Seyre, and Pierre and Alexis, his sons with Anne Madden. A public service commemorating his life will be held on Saturday at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin.","First living artist to have picture bougth by National Gallery in Dublin .

A mass brawl erupted at the Christmas party of a top City investment firm after a broker discovered his fiancée was cheating on him with a colleague, a court was told. Robert Nicolson, 27, is accused of attacking IT worker Anthony Field after a friend pointed him out. His actions allegedly ignited a fight that tore through staff from the prestigious financial house Brewin Dolphin. Accused: Robert Nicolson, left, and Graham Sutherland, right, pictured arriving at Snaresbrook Crown Court have been charged with ABH and affray . When police arrived at the Queen of Hoxton bar in Shoreditch, East London, they discovered the victim with two black eyes and facial injuries. Snaresbrook Crown Court was told Nicolson acted as the ‘fire-starter’ in the punch-up during which Mr Field was punched, kicked and glassed. He was joined in the violence by his 27-year-old data analyst co-worker Graham Sutherland who threw a flurry of punches. A third colleague, Gary Jones, 33, has already admitted smashing the glass bottle over Mr Field’s head during the fight. Prosecutor Tyrone Silcott said violence flared after the stockbroker discovered Mr Field was having an affair with his future wife Alex Miller. He said: ‘Nicolson was the fire-starter, the spark that gets it all going. He walks across the dance floor and grabbed Mr Field. ‘When Mr Field fights back, his friends beat him up. Sutherland’s role is a minor role. He is seen to point out the victim to Nicolson and stands back. ‘Then others - but not Sutherland - join Nicolson and start beating the victim. ‘At that point, Sutherland steps forward and seeks to pull Nicolson away, but while he is there, he throws at least one punch, possibly two.’ The mass brawl took place after highly-paid staff at Brewin Dolphin, which controls assets worth £26bn, gathered at the cocktail bar on December 9 last year. After he was arrested, Nicolson told police that a friend told him his fiancée had slept with Mr Field. He said he confronted the young man and claimed he responded by head-butting and punching him. He added: ‘The argument was between Anthony Field and I, and no one else. No one else was supposed to get involved.’ Giving evidence in court, Mr Field said the party was in good spirits and he was ‘merry’ after drinking four shots and four vodka and lemonades. Brawl: Snaresbrook Crown Court was told Nicolson acted as the ¿fire-starter¿ in the punch-up at the Queen of Hoxton, pictured . The pair appeared at Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured, today . Dressed smartly in a navy blue suit, Mr Field told the jury: ‘I first became aware of a problem when I was struck. ‘I was standing there at the bar talking to a colleague when someone from my work punched me in the face. ‘I tried to defend myself. I was defending myself against a lot of people. I was being punched from every angle. I got hit over the head with a sharp object, I got punched and grabbed.’ Michael Roque, defending, said Nicolson simply grabbed Mr Field and did not punch him. He accused Mr Field of responding by head-butting him. Mr Field replied: ‘No, that did not happen’. Mr Roque said: ‘I’m going to suggest that you punched Robert Nicolson three times without receiving a blow in return. Is that right?’ Mr Field replied: ‘I would say no. I tried to defend myself and before I knew it I was hit from all angles.’ Mr Field also insisted he did not know that Alex was Nicolson’s fiancée before the brawl. In his police interview, Nicolson said: ‘I arrived at the venue by cab with my fiancée Alex. ‘I noticed her crying, Lee was speaking to her. ‘Lee told me he heard a rumour that Alex slept with Anthony Field. I left Alex and Lee to ask Graham Sutherland. Graham said the rumour was true.’ When asked by Mr Roque whether he knew Alex was his fiancee, Mr Field replied: ‘I didn’t know that before this particular evening. I didn’t really know him.’ Nicolson, of Grays, Essex, and Sutherland, of Holloway, North London, deny assault and affray. Jones, of the Isle of Dogs, East London, admitted assault.

A four-year-old boy died after he was hit by a car driven by his mother's friend while he crossed the road, an inquest heard yesterday. James Robinson had just visited an ice cream van to buy sweets and lollies when he was mown down by a driver who knew his family. His mother described the boy as 'my little soulmate' and said she would struggle to continue without him. Tragic: Four-year-old James Robinson was killed after being hit by car while crossing the road . The schoolboy was playing with friends in Stockton-on-Tees on August 5 last year when the tragic accident happened. James was with other children on the local green while his mother Emma Oram was in a friend's front garden nearby. His mother's friend gave him money to buy ice cream from a van across the road, and the children went alone to buy the treats. Moments after leaving the van, James was struck by a Ford Fiesta being driven by his mother's friend Jane Ford. Geoffrey Burdon, the ice cream van driver, dialled 999, but paramedics were unable to save the boy and the was pronounced dead at the University Hospital of North Tees an hour later. Horror: The scene of the accident in Stockton-on-Tees on August 5 last year . Mr Burdon told Tuesday's inquest: 'Three children walked up to the van. The youngest was about three and the eldest was six or seven. 'There weren't any adults with them.' Julie Ford, the driver's cousin, said she had asked Jane Ford to drive her to a local shop. 'As the front of Jane's car went forward we hit something,' she told the inquest. 'I saw a child in the road and knew from the clothing it was James.' Accident investigator Peter Gowland said the car was in good condition, adding that Ms Ford could not see James, who was small for his age, before the collision and would not have had the chance to stop. Tribute: The area where James died was covered in flowers and toys in memory of the little boy . Much missed: James's mother said she 'cannot be apart from him' as she called the boy her 'soulmate' The inquest heard that the boy probably lost consciousness immediately and died of head and internal injuries. Assistant deputy coroner Claire Bailey, recording a verdict of accidental death, said: 'James will not have felt any pain and this hopefully will give some comfort to those loved ones left behind. 'Taking into account all the evidence, James's tragic death came about as the result of an accident.' Ms Oram paid tribute to her son at the time of his death, describing him as 'our pride and joy' and adding that the four-year-old - who was nicknamed Spider-Man because he often wore a superhero outfit - was 'always boisterous, loud and fun-loving'. She continued: 'He was well and truly spoilt by all the family, but he was such a loving little boy that we did not care. 'As a mother, I used to do everything with James.

The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF from July to September 1940. It was one of the turning points of World War Two and prevented Germany from invading Britain. The battle began in mid-July with Luftwaffe concentrating on attacking shipping in the English Channel and attacking coastal towns and defences. From August 12, Hermann Goering, one of the leaders of the Nazi regime, shifted his focus to the destruction of the RAF, attacking airfields and radar bases. Convinced that Fighter Command was now close to defeat, he also tried to force air battles between fighter planes to break British strength. However, Goering grew frustrated by the large number of British planes that were still fighting off his attacks. Luftwaffe switched tactics again and, on Hitler's orders, set about destroying London and other major cities.

Keyes, 34, was arrested in Koenig's death in March in Texas, after using her stolen debit cards at ATMs there and in Alaska, Arizona and New Mexico. After his arrest, Keyes confessed to killing Koenig and at least seven other people across the country over the past decade.

Keyes told authorities he also sexually assaulted and strangled Lorraine Currier. The couple's bodies have not been found. Tristram Coffin, U.S. Attorney in Vermont, said during a news conference on Monday: 'He provided some motivation, but I don't think it's really [possible] to pigeonhole why he did this.' Mr Coffin added: . 'It was something that he could control and he liked to do it. Why . someone likes to act like that, nobody knows.' Confessions of a killer: U.S. Attorney Tristram Coffin, pictured, told reporters on Monday that Keyes killed 'because he liked to do it' Keyes confessed to other killings without identifying the victims or saying where their remains were, other than that four were killed in Washington state and one in New York. Keyes, who faced a March trial in Koenig's death, was found dead in his Anchorage jail cell Sunday after he apparently killed himself.

Police said Tuesday a license plate, green toolboxes and a ladder rack had been removed from the pickup truck before the abduction, then reinstalled afterward so Keyes could disguise the vehicle, which had an extended bed. In their investigation, the vehicle appeared twice in a list of 750 local white trucks of the same kind, but police scratched it off the list of possibilities because it looked so different. Authorities say Keyes traveled extensively in the U.S., landing at one location and targeting victims randomly hundreds of miles away. In the Koenig case, he stuck to his own town. 'He broke his own rule,' Doll said. Samantha's family said that despite the proximity, there was no apparent previous connection between the teen and the suspect.

A village green in a Cotswold beauty spot has been partly replaced with artificial turf after the grass was being ruined by crowds of tourists. A 100sq ft patch of public land between a path and the river Windrush in the picture postcard Gloucestershire village of Bourton on the Water was dug up and replaced with imitation grass. Councillors in the village, known as the 'Venice of the Cotswolds', voted to approve the scheme in September after spending £1,000 each year repairing grass which had been trampled by hordes of visitors. Popular spot for sightseers: This patch of grass was often left threadbare by tourists jostling to take pictures . This is the view they're after: Locals say photographers like to stand in this spot to capture the pretty bridges . They considered several different areas in which to trial the long-lasting fake grass before choosing one small patch most popular with sightseers photographing the river where it is crossed by several attractive low bridges. Richard Johnes, chairman of Bourton on the Water Parish Council, said the patch had been looking 'threadbare' before the work. He said: 'I think it's a very good selection for a particularly problematic area. 'The feedback we've had so far has been very positive. The fact people have been walking past without noticing it is artificial is excellent. 'I think it's blended in remarkably well. We will just wait and see how the trial period progresses before we make a decision about other problem areas.' The installed turf, made by Easigrass, won a gold medal at the Royal Horticultural Society Chelsea Flower Show earlier this year. No need for mowing: Bourton on the Water's grass should last for a decade, despite the hordes of sightsteers . Close up: The imitation grass is designed to look as real as possible,complete with paler 'dying' grass . It is hoped it will help the council cut down on repair costs as it is expected to last for 10 years before it needs replacing. But Matt Shardlow, chief executive of Buglife, was not so enthusiastic about the new grass. He said: 'I hope they assessed the impact on wildlife because I can't imagine that the beetles and the birds are going to enjoy foraging around among nylon turf very much.' Bourton on the Water is known for its pretty High Street and wide greens, as well as its model village that dates back to the 1930s. Other local attractions include Gifford's Circus, the Cotswold Motoring Museum, and a model railway. Beauty spot: The river Windrush passes through some of the most beautiful places in the Cotswolds, including Burford and Witney, where it was used in the manufacture of the famous Witney blankets .","The grass in Bourton on the Water was being left threadbare by tourists .

A blonde transsexual former escort wailed on the witness stand on Monday that she still loves the New York firefighter accused of beating her. Claudia Charriez, 31, looked longingly at the defense table where Taylor Murphy, 29, was sitting. Murphy, her ex-boyfriend, was a hunky model for the FDNY charity calendar. He is on trial facing charges that he viciously beat Miss Charriez - a flamboyant model - in August 2011. Choked: Charriez demonstrates to the courtroom how she was attacked . Face-off: Claudia Charriez (left) accuses Taylor Murphy (right) of a violent attack in August 2011 . 'I do love him!' Miss Charriez told jurors as Murphy's lawyers cross-examined her, the New York Post reports. Miss Charriez admitted, under questioning, to several inconsistencies in her report to police. She also admitted to sending numerous . love-and-hate text messages to Murphy after the alleged beating - . including telling him after his arrest 'Enjoy sucking your cell mate's . d***.' When she was confronted with these messages, Miss Charriez began sobbing. 'I do love you,' she shouted, looking over at Murphy in the courtroom. Murphy did not make eye contact and stared at his hands instead. Murphy is accused of punching, biting and spitting on Miss Charriez during a fight in their Manhattan hotel room. 'Grilled': The transgendered model responds to fierce questioning during the trial at Manhattan Supreme Court . Transgender: Claudia Charriez who was kicked off American's Next Top Model in 2006 for being born a man . On Tuesday Kristin M Davis, the madam . at the center of the prostitution scandal that brought down New York . Gov Eliot Spitzer, is expected to testify. Miss Davis will reportedly recount . two phone calls she received in which Miss Charriez made threats against . Murphy. Miss Davis knows Murphy from his work on her 2010 gubernatorial . campaign. On Thursday, Miss Charriez was . questioned about her sexually-transmitted disease, experiences as an . escort and deceased ex-boyfriend as defense lawyers went on the attack. Attorneys for Taylor Murphy, 29, attempted to damage Charriez's . credibility during fierce questioning. Their client stands accused of a . vicious attack on the transgender model in August 2011. According to the New York Daily News, Murphy's defense attorney Jason Berland began by asking the former call-girl, who was kicked off American's Next Top Model in 2006 for being born a man, about her venereal disease. 'You (worked as an escort) knowing that you could potentially transmit that disease?' asked Berland. 'I was an escort, not a prostitute. I do not have sex for money,' Charriez replied. 'Whether . or not I chose to engage in sexual activity with someone - protected - . was my choice,' she said. 'What does this have anything to do with him . hurting me?' 'Hunky': Taylor Murphy is best known for his topless firefighters calendar. In court yesterday a woman burst into court with the image, screaming 'I love you Taylor.' Berland asked the model as to why she . charged her clients $300 per hour if she wasn’t offering sex. The . defense claims that at one point her hourly rate jumped to $600. 'Dinner dates. Accompanied them on many different occasions,' replied Charriez. The defense inquired if the model had been taking estrogen over the period in question. 'I don’t need hormone therapy because at a very young age I was castrated,'  Charriez claimed. Berland then asked her about a deceased former boyfriend, allegedly the subject of tension between Murphy and Charriez. The model was upset by this line of . questioning and screamed 'You shouldn’t talk about dead people' as she . was escorted out of the courtroom.

Obesity has become the leading cause of new recruits being rejected from the US Army as they struggle to meet fitness standards. And military officials have warned . expanding waistlines in the warrior corps are causing a national . security concern as the Army is being forced to dismiss a rising number . of overweight soldiers. During the first 10 months of this . year, the Army, under pressure to cut the number of troops, kicked out 1,625 soldiers for being out of shape - around 15 times the number discharged for that reason in 2007. Unfit: Obesity has become the leading cause of new recruits being rejected from the US Army as they struggle to meet its fitness standards . Between 1998 and 2010, the number of . active-duty military personnel deemed overweight or obese more than . tripled, reported the Washington Post. In 2010, 86,186 troops - 5.3 percent of the force - were diagnosed as overweight or obese, according to the . Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center. The increase in overweight personnel has prompted the military to reexamine its training programs. Military commanders are being told to . weed out soldiers deemed unfit to fight in a response to the Army facing . intense pressure to trim its tightly squeezed budget. Commander Leslie Hull-Ryde, a Pentagon spokeswoman told the Washington Post: 'A healthy and fit force is essential to national security,' 'Our service members must be physically prepared to deploy on a moment’s notice anywhere on the globe to extremely austere and demanding conditions.' Under a mandate to reduce the active-duty force from 570,000 to 490,000 by 2017, the Army has instructed commanders to make few exceptions in terms of fitness and weed out substandard troops. Tougher criteria: The increase in overweight personnel has prompted the military to reexamine its training programs, making them more selective . This was a strategy employed during the period after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The following year the Army discharged more than 3,000 soldiers for being overweight, the highest since 1984. But as the Iraq and Afghanistan wars strained the military, the Army accepted recruits who would not normally be eligible. This included the obese. In 2007 just 112 soldiers were let go for being overweight. According to the Post, Army Secretary John M. McHugh wrote in a Feb. 2 memo on . retention initiatives: 'We will use the drawdown as an . opportunity to shape our Army by ensuring that we retain only the very . best soldiers.' Retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling said he was astonished when he found out in 2009 that 75 per cent of civilians who wanted to join the force were ineligible, with obesity being the leading cause. He said: 'Of the 25 percent that could join, what we found was 65 percent could not pass the [physical training] test on the first day.' Tipping the scales: Servicemen and women must complete a fitness test that involves a height and weight measurement . Soldiers have taken to blogs and forums to complain their obesity was caused by the injuries they suffered while on duty and despite putting their lives on the line in combat they are being treated as expendable. Currently the fitness test involves a physical endurance test where troops will have to perform a number of sit-ups, push-ups and a brief run. The second part is a height and weight measurement.","During first 10 months of this year, Army kicked out 1,625 soldiers for being out of shape - 15 times number discharged in 2007 .

In the months before her killing,  Ivan Esack, 38, had chillingly told Natalie, 33, ‘You’re a dead woman walking – tick tock, tick tock’, a court heard yesterday. He eventually fulfilled his alleged threat by knifing her up to 11 times in an attack that was so ferocious the blade bent. Murder case: Ivan Esack, 38, knifed Natalie Esack, 33, at Esack Hair and Beauty in Ashford, Kent, in April up to 11 times with such ferocity that the blade bent and the tip broke off, Maidstone Crown Court was told . Mrs Esack’s 17-year-old salon . assistant Chelsea Ford wept as she told how after the killing, Esack . strode out on to the High Street, saying: ‘She deserved it, the bitch.’ Prosecutor Philip Bennetts described . Esack as ‘a violent and controlling person who was unable to deal with . the separation from his wife’ and killed her because he did not want her . to be with anyone else. The court was told of this chilling exchange between Esack and his wife on the day before her death. Tragedy: Floral tributes left at the scene of the stabbing at Esack Hair and Beauty in Ashford, Kent, in May . Esack: ‘I’ll catch up with you, don’t worry. You can’t ****ing hide from me, can you?’ Natalie: ‘What are my options?’ Esack: ‘Death, death or death.  You will see in the morning, and what I’m going to ****ing do to you won’t be funny.’ Cocaine-user Esack admits stabbing . his wife but denies murder, claiming he is guilty only of manslaughter . while his mind was unbalanced by ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ and . ‘substance abuse’. On location: Esack Hair and Beauty is pictured on Ashford High Street in Kent. As Ivan Esack strolled into the salon armed with the knife, his wife was on a computer at reception, the court heard . Maidstone Crown Court heard Esack and . his wife met around ten years ago and married in 2006. She later opened . Esack Hair and Beauty in Ashford, Kent, and counted Nancy Sorrell, 37, . wife of comedian Vic Reeves, among her clients. Although she ran her own . business, Mrs Esack’s husband was bullying and controlling, the jury . heard – never allowing his wife out without knowing where she was. One Christmas a few years ago she . suffered a badly swollen cheek and eye, Mr Bennetts said, after her . husband punched her. In July last year Mrs Esack told a relative he had . threatened her with a knife. Investigations: Forensic police officers take away the body of Natalie Esack from Esack Hair and Beauty in April . In October last year Mrs Esack left . the marital home and went to live with her brother. Mr Bennetts said . Esack then made such frightening threats to use his legally-held shotgun . to kill his wife, himself, and their dog, that she called the police. Esack voluntarily handed over the gun but continued with his abuse and threats, the court heard. During the separation, Mrs Esack . began a new relationship but just before last Christmas was persuaded to . return to her husband after he broke down crying. On Boxing Day, she went on a . make-or-break holiday to Mexico with Esack – but returned with a massive . bruise on her thigh, saying he had kicked her. The couple separated again and . abusive calls continued, the jury heard. Some were recorded by Mrs Esack . and were played in court. Esack was heard saying: ‘You’ve signed your . own death warrant’. Matters came to a violent end in . April after Mrs Esack went to a party with her new boyfriend and . accidentally called her husband. He heard the pair talking and became . aware of how serious her new relationship was. The next day, the court heard, he . bought a knife and went to her salon, stabbing his wife at the reception . desk. As she tried to flee, he grabbed her and continued to knife her . in the back.

One of the world’s biggest tobacco firms lost a Supreme Court battle today to openly display cigarettes on sale in Scotland. The UK’s highest court dismissed an appeal by Imperial Tobacco against the Scottish Government’s attempts to ban the open display of cigarettes in shops. The ban, already in place in England, Northern Ireland and Wales, is now expected to be in place in Scotland by April 2013. At a hearing in London, lawyers representing Imperial, which is based in Bristol, asked a panel of five Supreme Court justices to analyse the issues after twice failing to persuade Scottish judges to set aside legislative provisions. Imperial, the firm behind Lambert & Butler and Richmond cigarette brands, also opposed a ban on tobacco vending machines. On display: Tobacco giant Imperial Tobacco lost a Supreme Court fight to openly display cigarettes on sale in Scotland . Ministers say display bans are needed to protect future generations from the 'devastating effects' of smoking. Imperial argues that there is no credible evidence that display bans have cut tobacco consumption. It argued that the legislative provisions dealing with display bans fall outside the scope of the Scottish Government and are matters reserved for the UK Parliament in London. The company's civil court challenge has delayed the implementation of measures aimed at stopping people smoking. Ministers intended to introduce the display ban in large shops in Scotland - the first part of the UK to adopt a ban on smoking in public places - in April. Imperial initially sought a judicial review of ministers' plans for display bans.A judge in Scotland ruled against the firm in September 2010. Imperial appealed but three judges rejected the challenge in February. That decision was welcomed by Scotland's public health minister Michael Matheson, who said the proposals would play a 'crucial role' in preventing youngsters from starting to smoke. He sadi: 'Today's judgment removes the final barrier to fully implement the Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2010 and maintain Scotland's position as a world leader on tobacco control. 'We know that reducing the number of people that smoke will have wide benefits for Scotland's health and these bans will play a crucial role in preventing young people from taking up smoking. 'We will be looking to recover the legal fees incurred to the taxpayer as a result of this court case. 'Given that this legislation was passed over two years ago and is already in force in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, there are strong arguments to introduce it immediately. However, I have always been clear on the need to allow retailers sufficient time to make the necessary changes and so we have decided that April 2013 represents a fair timescale for implementing the display ban. 'The introduction of the ban on vending machines will be in line with our commitment to provide a four-month implementation period.' But Imperial voiced disappointment and appealed to the Supreme Court. At the Supreme Court, Imperial argued that sections 1 and 9 of the Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2010 were 'outside the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament'. Section 1 prohibits the display of tobacco products in a place where they are offered for sale and section 9 prohibits vending machines for the sale of tobacco products. Anti-smoking initiative: The UK Government banned public display of cigarettes on sale in large shops in April to discourage young people from taking up smoking . Today, the justices unanimously dismissed Imperial's appeal, ruling that the two sections ""are within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament'. Announcing the decision of the court, Lord Hope said: 'The purpose of section 1 is to enable the Scottish ministers to take steps which might render tobacco products less visible to potential consumers and thereby achieve a reduction in sales and thus in smoking. 'The purpose of section 9 is to make cigarettes less readily available, particularly (but not only) to children and young people, with a view to reducing smoking. The legal effect and short-term consequences are consistent with those purposes.' He said the court 'does not see how it can be said that the purpose of sections 1 and 9 has anything to do with consumer protection'. Lord Hope added: 'The aim of sections 1 and 9 is to discourage or eliminate sales of tobacco products, not to regulate how any sales are to be conducted so as to protect the consumer from unfair trade practices. 'The purpose of sections 1 and 9 also has nothing to do with the standards of safety to be observed in the production and sale of tobacco products. 'Sections 1 and 9 are designed to promote public health by reducing the attractiveness and availability of tobacco products, not to prohibit in any way their sale to those who wish and are old enough to purchase them.'","Ministers say display bans are needed to protect future generations from 'devastating effects' of smoking .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 07:35 EST, 12 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:17 EST, 12 December 2012 . David Cameron today accused Ed Balls of being a bully who ‘can dish it out but he can't take it’ as insults were thrown in a Commons row over government plans to limit rises in benefits to 1 per cent a year. The Prime Minister accused the shadow chancellor of ‘not being able to keep his mouth shut for 20 seconds’ after a stream of heckles about the below-inflation cap on welfare handouts. Mr Cameron clashed with Ed Miliband, who said the real-terms cut in state benefits was a ‘tax on strivers’. David Cameron took aim at Ed Balls' heckling today, after the shadow chancellor's gaffe at the despatch box last week during a debate on the Autumn Statement (left) And in a swipe at the PM’s membership of the infamous Bullingdon Club at Oxford University, the Labour leader asked: ' Have you wrecked a restaurant recently?’ Last week Chancellor George Osborne announced he was ending the link between inflation and benefits rises, and from next April most working age benefits would rise by only 1 per cent, not the 2.2 per cent as planned. The policy will save £3.7billion by 2016-17. But Mr Osborne’s suggestion that it was necessary to curb handouts for the jobless who are ‘still asleep, living a life on benefits’ while others go to work was seized on by Labour who say six in 10 of those affected are in jobs. Defending the policy at Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron said: ‘The fact is this, that welfare needs to be controlled and everyone who is on tax credits will be affected by these changes because we have to get on top of the welfare bill.’ Mr Cameron said a person working full-time on the minimum wage would see their income tax bill halved under the coalition Government. 'We are saying to working people you can earn another £3,000 before you even start paying income tax. This is the party for people who work, his is the party of unlimited welfare.' Labour leader Ed Miliband mocked the PM for his membership of university dining group, the Bullingdon Club, asking: 'Have you wrecked a restaurant recently?' But Mr Miliband claimed more than 60 per cent of those affected by the one per cent cap are in work. He launched a deeply personal attack on the Chancellor saying those affected by the benefit curb included low earners. 'It's the factory worker on the night . shift, it's the carer who looks after elderly people around the clock . and it's the cleaner who cleans the Chancellor's office while his . curtains are still drawn and he's still in bed. 'The Chancellor calls them scroungers, what does the Prime Minister call them?' The Labour leader accused Mr Osborne ‘trying to play divide and rule’. Mr . Miliband added: ‘He said his changes were all about people living a . life on benefits... but it turned out it just wasn’t true – it was a tax . on strivers’ Mr Miliband accused Chancellor George Osborne of targeting his benefits squeeze on the person who cleans his office while he is still in bed . Amid a barrage of heckling from the Labour frontbench, Mr Cameron turned his fire on Mr Balls, who last week blamed his stammer for a blunder in the Commons about whether or not the deficit is falling. The PM said: ‘I'm surprised the Shadow Chancellor is shouting again because we learnt last week, like bullies all over the world he can dish it out but he can't take it. He never learns, he never learns.’ But Mr Miliband responded: ‘I’ve heard everything when the boy from the Bullingdon Club lectures people on bullying – absolutely extraordinary. Have you wrecked a restaurant recently?’ The Bullingdon Club has a reputation for wealthy students donning dinner suits to trash restaurants in Oxford. Mr Balls, described as a serial ‘heckler, barracker and sledger’, was knocked off his stride last week when the Chancellor announced that the Government’s deficit was forecast to fall this year. In an apparent slip, he conceded that the national deficit was ‘not rising’, provoking a wave of Tory cheers. Indeed, Mr Balls, who has spoken in the past about his lifelong battle with a stammer, appeared to speak the words clearly. But the following day he suggested his condition was to blame for his confusion, saying it sometimes ‘got the better of him’. ‘Everybody knows with me that I have a stammer,’ he said. ‘Sometimes that stammer gets the better of me in the first minute or two when I speak, especially when I have got the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and 300 Conservative MPs yelling at me at the top of their voices.

Education Secretary Michael Gove wrote to headteachers, advising a 'robust response' to striking staff, including cutting pay . Headmasters were yesterday told to . slash the pay of teachers taking industrial action after thousands . joined a campaign of disruption. Members of the National Union of . Teachers and rival NASUWT have been working to rule complaining about . pay, pensions and working conditions. But ministers have received legal . advice that teachers are ‘highly likely’ to be breaking their contracts . if they refuse to carry out 25 classroom tasks. The industrial action includes . refusing to cover for other staff, hand in lesson plans or complete more . than one pupil report per year. Education Secretary Michael Gove wrote to headmasters saying they can dock the pay of those taking industrial action. He accused the staff of being ‘highly irresponsible’ and demanded ‘robust action’. Mr Gove warned the work-to-rule . scheme, launched in October, is creating ‘major problems’ in schools . where militant teachers hold sway, threatening the quality of pupils’ education and placing additional burdens on other teachers. Legal advice says that teachers who . are following the industrial action ‘are very likely to be in breach of . their contracts’ and that ‘pay deductions represent a lawful response’. Mr Gove pointed out only a ‘tiny proportion’ of teachers voted for . industrial action, with just a 27 per cent turnout in the case of the . NUT. But while the ‘vast majority of . schools are currently unaffected’, Mr Gove said: ‘A small number, . however, are starting to see a severe impact and where this is the case, . I believe a robust response is needed. ‘This action sets out only to cause . unnecessary disruption in schools, while at the same time threatening to . damage children’s education. ‘I am also concerned about the increased burden on the many hard-working teachers across the country. Mr Gove claims industrial action taken by the NUT and NASUWT teaching unions of 'severe impact' on schools (file picture) Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg condemned the union action but accused Mr Gove of 'playing politics' ‘Industrial action of this kind is . associated with significant damage to pupil outcomes. I believe we . should tackle this action swiftly and firmly before it causes any more . damage in schools.’ The Education Secretary has already . clashed with the unions over Government plans – recommended by the . teaching pay review body – to scrap national pay bargaining and . introduce performance-related pay. That will allow heads to reward . talented teachers rather than waste money on pay rises for those who . have simply served the longest. NASUWT’s Chris Keates said: ‘Any . school which acts on his advice leaves itself vulnerable to extensive . and expensive litigation and escalation of industrial action.’ She . claimed ‘not one single day of education has been disrupted as a result’ of the industrial action. Shadow Education Secretary Stephen Twigg said: ‘We oppose this industrial action being taken by the NUT and NASUWT. ‘It is not right that schools and pupils should be affected in this way. ‘But Michael Gove is playing politics. This is not the way to attract new recruits to the profession.’ A DfE spokesman said: ‘NASUWT and NUT . are trying to intimidate school leaders through threats of strike action . and legal action. ‘We will support any school that takes appropriate sanctions against this irresponsible industrial action.’ Dear Headteachers, . I am writing to you to seek your support in tackling a threat to the quality of pupils’ education which has emerged recently. I am referring to the highly irresponsible industrial action started by the NUT and NASUWT on 3 October. The NUT and NASUWT have issued a series of 25 instructions setting out activities which their members should refuse to undertake. Only a tiny proportion of the profession voted in favour of this industrial action – with a turnout of only 27% in the case of the NUT. An even smaller proportion of teachers are choosing to follow these instructions. The vast majority of schools are currently unaffected. A small number, however, are starting to see a severe impact and where this is the case, I believe a robust response is needed. I respect the right of teachers to take industrial action, but this action short of a strike lacks a clear purpose or even a set of coherent aims. It sets out only to cause unnecessary disruption in schools, while at the same time threatening to damage children’s education. The NUT and NASUWT have instructed their members to refuse to undertake cover for other teachers, creating additional work for their colleagues. The unions want their members to refuse to hand in lesson plans to senior management, making it more difficult for them to manage their schools. Perhaps most unreasonably, the instructions go as far as refusing to provide more than one written report each year to parents. Those are only three of twenty five instructions, which would place unnecessary pressure on headteachers, governing bodies and Academy Trusts. I am also concerned about the increased burden on the many hard-working teachers across the country who are focusing entirely on providing the best education possible for all of their pupils. I am sure that you will agree that this is not a constructive or effective way for organisations representing professionals to work. I believe it is damaging the reputation of the profession with the public, at a time when we have the best ever cohort who are working harder than ever. Feedback from parents suggests they find it difficult to understand why the education of their children needs to suffer. Feedback from teachers suggests they find it frustrating that they need to pick up the work that other teachers should be doing. Furthermore, international evidence shows that industrial action of this kind is associated with significant damage to pupil outcomes, particularly in the long term. The threat to pupil outcomes in affected schools is therefore a real one. I believe we should tackle this action swiftly and firmly before it causes any more damage in schools. In response to requests from headteachers, I have published advice for schools on the Department for Education website about appropriate sanctions, which I have also attached to this letter. The legal position is clear: teachers who are following this industrial action are very likely to be in breach of their contracts. Pay deductions represent a lawful response, and the advice sets out how deductions can be made in a proportionate and reasonable way. I would be very grateful if you could support your school(s) in taking a robust response, including through pay deductions where appropriate. I am convinced that by working together in a coordinated way we can protect the pupils, parents, teachers and headteachers who would otherwise suffer because of this irresponsible industrial action.

A teacher caused shock among her students after penning a Fifty Shades of Grey style novel. Carol Ann Eastman faces the sack after writing erotic novel 'Schooled' about a female high school teacher who seeks revenge on her cheating husband, engaging in several affairs with former students and colleagues. 'Schooled' is written under the pseudonym Deena Bright and the Ohio English teacher's novel has gained mainly positive reviews on Amazon. Ms Eastman returned to Hoover High School in North Canton, Ohio, last week after three weeks administrative leave and five days suspended pay. Official records show her time off was a punishment for a non-related incident where she used a school computer for ‘social networking of a personal nature,’ the Canton Repository reported. It is not clear how students discovered that raunchy novelist Deena Bright was in fact their teacher, but the unveiling of Ms Eastman as the author of 'Schooled' has caused an outrage among parents and fellow teachers at Hoover High. Ms Eastman’s colleague George Baran said he was disappointed that a teacher would write an erotic novel with a school theme as it ‘throws a wrench’ into the perception that teachers have integrity. Mr Baran, who is also the local teachers’ union president, said Ms Eastman was sent home following complaints from parents. He added that he believes the school district is looking for Ms Eastman to resign on her own accord but may have begun proceedings to have her fired. ‘I think she found her own attorneys and has chosen to fight, he said. ‘I was very surprised to see her back at school’ Taught a lesson: Ms Eastman was unveiled as the author of 'Schooled' by her own students at Hoover High School, North Canton, although it is not known how . In a ‘special note’ in the acknowledgment section of the book, Ms Eastman pleads with her school district not to give her any repercussions. “Dear My School District: I love my teaching job.

I love my students: they’re my kids, nothing more.’ In an interview with an online blogger, . done under her pen-name, Ms Eastman reveals that she asked her school . district’s curriculum director for permission to write the novel, but that it . was denied. 'Schooled' has not been printed, but is available as an eBook on Amazon for $3.

A jury has heard the chilling phone call from a man to his estranged wife the night before he is accused of stabbing her to death. The jury at Maidstone Crown Court heard the phone call Ivan Esack, 38, made to Natalie Esack, 33, on April 29 this year, which was recorded by her shocked boyfriend Justin Khadaroo, 31, who was listening in. Esack, a former policeman, asked her: ‘How do you want to f*****g play it then?’ Mrs Esack asked him what her options were and Esack replied: ‘Death, death or death.’ Before the stabbing: Ivan Esack (left) made a chilling phone call to his estranged wife Natalie Esack (right) in which he said he was 'going to absolutely f*****g murder you,' the night before she was stabbed 11 times in her hair salon . The next morning Mrs Esack was stabbed 11 times at her hair salon in front of her horrified teenage colleague in Ashford, Kent. During the recorded phone call, Esack also said: ‘You're f*** [...] a f***ing Afghan behind my f***ing back and you think I am just going to f***ing let that go?’ ‘You are f*****g dead. You are absolutely f*****g walking dead. ‘Seriously babe, I'm going to absolutely f*****g take great pleasure in doing what I'm going to do to you.

I'm going to f*****g murder you, seriously. Is that what you f*****g want? ‘You are a f*****g skanky little f*****g slut. I can't wait till I . f*****g ... ruin ...Do you realise I'm going to f*****g really hurt you? ‘You can lock the doors all you f***ing want in your f***ing skanky house. But you can’t f***ing hide from me can you.’ 'Disbelief': Mrs Estack's boyfriend Justin Khadaroo leaves court today after telling the jury the conversation he recorded was 'chilling' Esack also texted her that night: ‘You really have pushed me to the brink now... You had better phone me or Archie (her baby nephew) will never got to know this.’ Prosecutor Philip Bennetts asked Mr Khadaroo what happened immediately . after the phone call. Mr Khadaroo said: ‘After that phone call, Natalie . just looked at me. I shook my head in disbelief. I couldn't believe . really what I was hearing. How do you react to that? It is just . chilling, it is just not human. ‘She looked at me, I gave her a hug and she said: “It's going to be alright Justin, it's going to be alright.” When asked why he had recorded the conversation rather than act on it, Mr Khadaroo told the court: ‘Natalie didn't want at this stage to go to the police. I decided I would take it upon myself to start building as much as evidence as possible for when the time came. ‘Unfortunately for me it was too late.’ Mr Khadaroo and Mrs Esack spent that night together at her father’s house before Mr Khadaroo left for work at 7am the next morning. He said 'I will see you later' and asked her to call him straight away if anything happened. But . at around 9.30am he had a phone call from her brother Luke Wilkinson  telling him . to go to the police station because ‘something had happened,’ the court . heard. He said: ‘As soon as the policeman . told me I just fell to my knees. I was inconsolable, how do you react to . that? It doesn't happen in real life, stuff like this. You see it in . the movies. ‘I can't begin to describe to you how I feel. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.’ Salon stabbing: Esack's phone conversation was recorded by Mrs Esack's boyfriend Justin Khadaroo who said of the conversation: 'It is just chilling, it is just not human' before she was murdered at her salon (right) Mr Khadaroo told the court he had . pleaded with Mrs Esack to take out a restraining order against the . ‘vile, disgusting monster’ to stop him harassing her with abuse and . threats. Mr Khadaroo said he spoke to Esack during the phone conversation. He . told the court: ‘I said to him that everything he could possibly do . wrong in life as a human being, bar murdering someone, he had done. He’s . a vile, disgusting monster. ‘I . urged Natalie so many times to get a restraining order on him so she . was at least a little bit safe, but it came down to the fact she wanted . to make sure that he was OK. ‘I was very concerned. She was connected to an atrocious creature that was capable of killing her. ‘She said he was particularly controlling. While she was at work all day, he would be at home sleeping with various prostitutes. ‘He didn’t allow her to see any of her friends, because all of her friends were “whores” and were beneath him.’ Tributes as trial continues: Mr Khadaroo said he pleaded with Mrs Esack to take out a restraining order against Esack . Mrs Esack’s 17-year-old salon assistant Chelsea Ford wept as she told the jury earlier how after the killing, Esack strode out on to the High Street, saying: ‘She deserved it, the bitch.’ Mr Bennetts described Esack as ‘a violent and controlling person who was unable to deal with the separation from his wife’ and killed her because he did not want her to be with anyone else. Esack admits stabbing his wife but denies murder, claiming he is guilty only of manslaughter while his mind was unbalanced by ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ and ‘substance abuse’. Her brother told the court today she was ‘the happiest I’d seen her for many years’ when he saw her just two days before she died. Mr Wilkinson credited her happiness to being apart from Esack and in a relationship with Mr Khadaroo. He said he saw his sister on April 28, two days before she was killed. Mr Wilkinson said: ‘She was absolutely excited. She was on her way for a night out and she was the happiest I’d seen her for many, many years. She was going to a party with Justin and his friends.’ The court heard Esack and his wife . met around ten years ago and married in 2006. She later opened Esack . Hair and Beauty in Ashford, Kent. Although . she ran her own business, Esack was bullying and . controlling, the jury heard – never allowing his wife out without . knowing where she was. One . Christmas a few years ago she suffered a badly swollen cheek and eye, . Mr Bennetts said, after her husband punched her. In July last year Mrs . Esack told a relative he had threatened her with a knife. In October last year Mrs Esack left . the marital home and went to live with her brother. Mr Bennetts said . Esack then made such frightening threats to use his legally-held shotgun . to kill his wife, himself, and their dog, that she called the police. Esack voluntarily handed over the gun but continued with his abuse and threats, the court heard. During . the separation, Mrs Esack began a new relationship but just before last . Christmas was persuaded to return to her husband after he broke down . crying. The scene of the crime: Floral tributes outside Mrs Esack's hair salon (left) after her stabbing death which Esack (right) admits to but denies murder, claiming he is guilty only of manslaughter while his mind was unbalanced by 'narcissistic personality disorder' and 'substance abuse' On Boxing Day, she went on a make-or-break holiday to Mexico with Esack – but returned with a massive bruise on her thigh, saying he had kicked her. The couple separated again and abusive calls continued, the jury heard. Some were recorded by Mrs Esack and were played in court. Esack was heard saying: ‘You’ve signed your own death warrant’. Matters came to a violent end in April after Mrs Esack went to a party with her new boyfriend and accidentally called her husband. He heard the pair talking and became aware of how serious her new relationship was. The next day, the court heard, he bought a knife and went to her salon, stabbing his wife at the reception desk. As she tried to flee, he grabbed her and continued to knife her in the back. Mr Khadaroo told the court he had started dating Natalie in October last year after her six-year marriage broke down and she moved in with her father. He said: ‘She was an absolutely beautiful woman.

Jailed: Two brothers used the internet to sexually abuse 110 children around the world . Two brothers who used the internet to sexually abuse 110 children around the world have been jailed for five years. Mohammed Khalaf Al Ali Alhamadi, 35, and his brother Yousef Al Ali Alhamadi, 27, targeted victims aged between 12 and 16 on social networking and instant messaging applications, often pretending to be someone the children already knew. They would then trick victims, including 78 in the UK, into giving them their online passwords using a link, before threatening them into ‘engaging in sexual activities via webcam’, said the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), which led the operation. The brothers, who were arrested last December, were jailed at a court in their native Kuwait today after being convicted of blackmail relating to child sexual abuse offences. Once the abusers were identified and arrested, CEOP worked with Kuwaiti authorities and international law enforcement partners and child protection agencies in Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Jersey, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Sweden and the United States. In order to identify other victims, CEOP launched a media appeal in December 2011, encouraging British victims to come forward. A special helpline number set up by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) as part of the investigation for UK youngsters to report the men. CEOP deputy chief executive Andy Baker said: ‘These two individuals mistakenly thought that they could abuse children in the UK and elsewhere and not be caught for their crimes. ‘Today has seen justice for their victims after a challenging investigation. ‘This illustrates once again how officers from CEOP and other law enforcement agencies will go the extra mile to protect children from abuse, wherever they are in the world. Led operation: The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (pictured) worked with Kuwaiti authorities and international law enforcement partners and child protection agencies in several countries to catch the culprits . ‘This is also another example . highlighting how law enforcement and child protection agencies around . the world will work together to ensure that offenders are identified, no . matter where their victims are located. ‘Offenders who think they can contact, coerce and cause harm to young people via the internet without facing the consequences need to take note of this conviction. ‘Everything you do online leaves a digital footprint and we will use this information to locate you and ensure you face justice for your crimes.’ CEOP is now urging parents buying devices that connect to the internet for their children this Christmas to consider online safety measures.

Speaking about Kate on her wedding day . to Prince William at Westminister Abbey the designer said: 'She looked so beautiful, she’s got such an amazing . sense of grace and style, it was quite easy to make her look good. 'It was a real labour of love and a real collaboration, for me it was a huge highlight of my career.' As the creative director at fashion house Alexander McQueen, Burton spent months making the dress with input from the Duchess. The designer said she never expected to . receive the royal commission: 'It came completely out of the blue, it . was very exciting and I felt very privileged.' Kate's wedding dress had an intricate . train which measured nearly 9ft (2.7m) - modest in comparison to many . previous royal brides. The train and bodice were decorated with . delicate lace applique flowers, handcrafted using the Carrickmacross . lace-making technique which originated in Ireland in the 1820s.

Luxury: Bernard Gray, pictured, Chief of Defence Materiel, has spent £23,000 on luxurious hotels in his first ten months in the job. Shadow defence minister Kevan Jones said Mr Gray needed to 'justify such extravagance' in the face of department cuts . The highest paid civil servant in the Ministry of Defence charged the taxpayer £23,000 for luxury hotel stays in his first ten months in the job. Bernard Gray, the man in charge of the department’s equipment programme, is paid £220,000 a year – far in excess of the £142,500 earned by the Prime Minister. Yet he racked up an astonishing £23,000 expenses bill for 106 overnight stays in London and Bristol - at a time when his department is facing huge budget cuts. The spending on hotels is even more remarkable because Mr Gray’s home is just a 60-mile drive from his offices in Whitehall and the Defence Equipment and Support organisation at Abbey Wood in Bristol. He also has access to a taxpayer-funded official car and driver worth £49,000. Had he decided to get a train home from London Paddington to Newbury, Berkshire, it would have cost just £21 for a single fare. The revelations over the Chief of Defence Materiel’s five-star lifestyle caused outrage as ministers press ahead with controversial cuts that have seen 22,000 troops, warships, fighter jets and tanks axed to save money. Labour defence spokesman Kevan Jones said: ‘People will be as shocked as they are furious to hear Bernard Gray has been living such a luxurious lifestyle funded by hard pressed taxpayers. ‘At a time when our soldiers in Afghanistan are having their pensions and front line allowances cut, ministers at the MoD and Mr Gray will have to justify such extravagance. ‘Mr Gray clearly does not live by the Government’s old mantra that “We are all in this together”. His local MP does not claim a second home allowance, so why has he run up such a high hotel bill?’ Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance pressure group, said: ‘Taxpayers and troops alike will take a dim view of a top MoD official racking up such expensive hotel bills so often. ‘The MoD has handled Bernard Gray’s appointment and contract appallingly badly. The man charged with getting a grip of the procurement budget needs to get a grip of his own expenses.’ Mr Gray, a former businessman and Labour adviser, was appointed in December 2010 to bring the MoD’s chaotic multi-billion-pound equipment budget under control. But between January and October 2011 he spent a third of nights in hotels rather than travelling home. Fury: Mr Gray's expenses are controversial given MoD cutbacks. He earns £220,000 a year. The Mod said Mr Gray had 'an awful lot of meetings' He stayed 88 times in the capital, enjoying the ‘stunning’ hospitality at the £360-a-night five-star Sofitel London St James hotel in Pall Mall, a Grade II-listed former bank a stone’s throw from Buckingham Palace. On other occasions he overnighted in the Grange Holborn Hotel, which is described as ‘elegantly composed’. He stayed over on some nights after being wined and dined by blue-chip defence companies including BAE Systems and EADS or consultants such as McKinsey. Mr Gray stayed in Bristol 18 times at either the Holiday Inn, Thistle Hotel or the Marriott Hotel. The limit for civil servants to claim for staying in London is officially £135 a night, according to the MoD. The row comes just days after it emerged that the MoD had broken Whitehall rules by failing to get Mr Gray’s pay package signed off by the Treasury. The MoD justified his stays on the grounds that he had a shoulder injury and the journey between home and work would cause ‘significant discomfort’ and ‘impede recovery’. However, he was fit enough to travel to Paris, Cyprus, Italy and the US for business meetings. The MoD also said that it would be impractical for Mr Gray to spend nights at home in Newbury if he was extremely busy. ‘He had an awful lot of meetings with people in industry,’ said an insider. ‘If he was getting home at 1am and then getting up at 5am for a breakfast meeting he could not do the job he needed to.’ Since November 2011, Mr Gray has received a £2,000-a-month taxpayer-funded allowance to help him rent a London apartment. The MoD is in discussions with HM Revenue and Customs about whether this is a taxable benefit. An MoD spokesman said: ‘Employees may be reimbursed the cost of temporary overnight accommodation and breakfast when they are absent from their normal place of work on official business and where an overnight stay in a hotel is necessary. ‘Thus it will primarily be when they are away on business but it may also be granted when an employee has to work late, and it is too late to return home.’","Bernard Gray ran up the huge bill in his first ten months in the job .

The body of a missing North Carolina teenager was found in a pond a quarter mile away from her home nearly four days after she disappeared. Kayla Campbell, 16, told her parents that she would be back in a few hours when she left their Mint Hill home on Sunday afternoon, and when she never returned, her father feared that she had been abducted by someone she met online. 'This morning we must release news we had hoped would not become true in this case,' police said in a statement following the discovery of their body after draining the lake overnight. The circumstances surrounding her death are still being investigated and the cause was not immediately clear. Her father Robert Campbell previously told ABCNews.com: 'We were just dealing with the emotions of a teenager, having to do with some online relationships on a Tumblr page. These relationships were not healthy.' He told the network: 'We called her at 5.20pm and she said she was close-by, but we didn't feel like she was telling the truth...

An initial search of the pond earlier in the investigation had proved fruitless, but on Wednesday night the Mint Hill police spent hours draining the pond, with neighbors occasionally stopping by to check the progress. Just after midnight, the police asked all neighbors and press to leave the scene since they found the teenager's lifeless body. One neighbor told The Charlotte Observer that the deepest points of the pond, located just off Pumpkin Way Drive, vary between 10 and 12 feet.

Her family said that would regularly go to the area to hang out and take pictures with her friends from Independence High School. The FBI joined the investigation, though they never officially ruled it an abduction case, always deeming it a missing persons search.

Sargent argued: 'I don't think having it (a preliminary hearing) in public will impact having a fair trial.' Preliminary hearings are where prosecutors present evidence against a suspect, sometimes publicly revealing previously undisclosed information. A judge decides whether to hold a trial or release the suspect. Heartbroken: Jessica's dad, Jeremiah Bryant, pictured, breaks down during a press conference, as Jessica's mother describes their little girl . Police arrested Sigg on October 23. His mother called police and her son turned himself in. Sargent, the prosecutor, said during the hearing that Sigg had not been a suspect prior to his arrest despite hundreds of police scouring the neighborhood and collecting cheek swabs for DNA. Sigg, who turns 18 next month, was charged as an adult and is being held in an adult jail. The original charges included four counts of murder, two counts of kidnapping, and one count each of sexual assault on a child and robbery in Jessica's abduction and slaying. He was also charged with attempted murder, attempted sexual assault and attempted second-degree kidnapping in the attack on the runner and with six counts of crime of violence. Tragic outcome: The family of Jessica Ridgeway gather at a police station in Colorado when they were still looking for the girl in October . If convicted as an adult, Sigg faces up to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 40 years. Prosecutors said he confessed to kidnapping and killing Jessica and attacking the jogger. It's not clear if he has made any comment on the charge of sexually assaulting the girl. The judge issued several orders in the case, including the preservation of evidence and investigator notes and emails sent between prosecutors and law enforcement. Munsinger also barred prosecutors from using the jail's electronic record keeping system to keep track of his defense team's visits to the jail or to get updates on Sigg's medical and mental condition. He granted the request after public defender Katherine Spengler raised concerns that such tracking has happened in other cases. The next hearing in the case will be February 8.","Ten-year-old Jessica abducted as she walked to school in Denver .

They do say dogs will eat anything, but a professional footballer was left stunned after vets found ten Brillo Pads in his hungry hound's stomach. On-loan Southend United midfielder Marc Laird was left with a hefty £800 vet bill after his pet pooch Kia swallowed the wiry wash clothes. The 26-year-old had returned to his home in Brooklands, Manchester, following his team's 1-1 draw at Bury in the FA Cup earlier this month, but was surprised when his five-year-old boxer did not greet him with her usual enthusiasm. X-ray: Kia needed a two hour operation to remove the Brillo Pads she swallowed when the cupboard door in the kitchen was left open while it was being cleaned . Eats anything: The hungry hound has been known to eat some unusual objects in the past, including one of Marc's compression recovery skins . He said: 'She usually goes mad the second I open the door as I don't get home all that much these days. 'But that day I remember she just wagged her tail a little then wandered back to lie down - I knew something was wrong straight away. 'I had to get back down to London to train but my partner was great and rushed her straight to the vets. 'Next thing I knew she told me that Kia had eaten ten Brillo Pads - not just the normal ones but the wiry ones too.' Vets at Southfields Veterinary Surgery in Sale Moor, Cheshire, had first thought X-rays showed a large collection of tin foil before stunned nurses opened Kia up and began removing a whole packet of Brillo pads. Mr Laird said: 'The vets thought it was tin foil at first which left us both a bit confused. 'But when they got them out we eventually worked out that my partner must have left the cupboard door open when she was cleaning the kitchen. 'It could only have been for a few minutes but Kia will eat anything. Wiry: The fine steel wool cleaning pads don't exactly look particularly appetising . 'We had a similar situation when I was at Millwall and she ate one of my recovery skins after I put it on the radiator to dry. 'It was an expensive day but luckily we have pet insurance and everyone at the vets was great. 'Kia is fantastic dog and has never given us any trouble but you just can't leave anything about in our house, even for a second, or she'll eat it.' Mr Laird lives with his long-term partner of six years, Lindsey Crow, 23, who is currently on maternity leave from her job at Marks and Spencers. On the pitch: Marc, left, in action during Southend's 0-0 draw at Fleetwood earlier this month . The Scottish star hasn't let his poorly pooch affect his form though after playing a key role in Southend United's recent 11-game unbeaten run in both league and cup whilst on loan in League Two from his parent club, Leyton Orient. Kia is now recovering at home after her two hour-long surgery. Paula Gallimore, head nurse at Southfields Veterinary Surgery, said: 'Kia came to the surgery with a little vomiting but we were not overly worried by her condition at first. 'She has had foreign bodies in her before so we took a quick x-ray and we were amazed with what we saw. 'You could clearly make out something large and metallic in her stomach on the X-ray. 'The objects were so big we knew they could not have been passed naturally - even by a large dog. 'It was a very serious situation and we knew that if we left them in her stomach she would have died. 'We took her straight into surgery and pulled out a whole pack of Brillo pads - they just kept coming. 'Afterwards we stitched her up and we are delighted to hear she has made a full recovery.'","Footballer Marc Laird's dog became ill after swallowing a pack of Brillo Pads .

A devoted dad died after he fell 10ft out of his loft while he tried to reach a bag of Christmas decorations, it emerged today. Tragic Darren Owen, 35, was found under an open ceiling hatch by distraught wife Becky, 37, when she returned home from an shopping trip on Saturday afternoon. Neighbours revealed Darren, who coached an under-11 football team, was trying to get his home in Dudley, West Midlands, festively decorated to surprise his wife and two sons when they returned from a shopping trip. Loss: Darren Owen fell from the loft of his Dudley, West Midlands, home while trying to get Christmas decorations. Pictured is Darren and sons Luke 11 and Joe, eight . Darren and his wife Becky. The pair had two sons together and were looking forward to a family Christmas . The BT manager was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene. A neighbour today said: 'I heard he got into trouble after he went up into his loft to get a bag of decorations while his wife was out. 'He must have planned on putting them all up for Becky and the kids before she got home but somehow he lost his footing and fell to his death. 'It's a scary thought as there must have been other people on the street doing exactly the same thing at the weekend, it just goes to show that you never know what can happen. 'I can't imagine what his wife and those two boys are going through, it's an awful thing to happen so close to Christmas.' Darren, who had two sons, Luke, 11, and Joe, eight, was manager of nearby Stourbridge FC's under-11 team. He had held the role for two years and yesterday colleagues paid tribute to the 'dedicated and hard-working' manager. Tribute: Darren was a highly-regarded football coach for the under-11 team at Stourbridge FC . Team administrator Simon Westwood said his team had received messages of support from other teams in the league. He said: 'He was a well-regarded bloke throughout the football league we play in and the lads in the team absolutely adored him. 'They were devastated when they found out, he was like a second dad to some of them, he had contact with them three times a week. 'They got to know him pretty well and they formed a strong bond with him. 'It's a testimony to his hard work and dedication that he was so well-respected. 'They (the team) got to know him pretty well and they formed a strong bond with him. 'It's a testimony to his hard work and dedication that he was so well-respected.' - Team administrator Simon Westwood . 'We we led to believe he was on his own and he was just found there by his wife when she got home and the loft hatch was open. 'It's still sinking in - it was only last week that he was there coaching the kids so to get news like this is devastating. 'The one thing that we do know is that Darren would want his team to carry on and go out and achieve whatever they are capable of and the players are determined to achieve whatever they can in memory of their great manager. Assistant manager Peter Thompson added: 'Darren was a great coach and a great mentor to the kids. I never heard a bad word said about him. 'I've had people coming to me saying he was one of the best, if not the best coach the league has. 'My lad's come on leaps and bounds under him, as have other kids.' Respect: Other teams in the league held a one-minute silence out of respect for Darren . In a statement posted on the club's Facebook page, the club paid a further tribute to Darren. It said: 'Daz was a pure inspiration to our boys he gave them the belief in themselves. 'It was an honour and privilege for the boys to have had Daz as their manager. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Beckie and sons Luke and Joe. R.I.P Daz.' Though the under-11s had two fixtures postponed since the death was announced, other teams in the league held a one-minute silence out of respect for Darren. It is understood that plans for an official tribute by parent club Stourbridge FC are being discussed. Worcestershire Coroner has been informed and a hearing will be held next year.","Father-of-two plunges from loft as he searched for festive ornaments .

A cash-strapped police worker joked that he felt like James Bond as he sent secrets about Royal bodyguards to PR guru Max Clifford, a court heard. Jairo Dos Santos, 29, emailed details of more than 2,700 expenses claims made by members of the Met’s Protection Command to a reporter at the Mail on Sunday, it is alleged. The unit guards the Queen and other senior Royals, as well as providing protection for the Prime Minister and other potential terrorist targets. 'I feel like 007': Cash-strapped police worker Jairo Dos Santos joked that he felt like James Bond as he sent secrets about Royal bodyguards to PR guru Max Clifford and emailed details of more than 2,700 expenses claims made by members of the Met's Protection Command to a reporter at the Mail on Sunday, it is alleged . Dos Santos, of Hither Green, southeast London, hired Clifford in a bid to spark a bidding war between the Mail and the News of The World in July 2010, Southwark Crown Court was told. As he allegedly doled out the secrets, he is said to have emailed his partner and quipped: ‘Looking over my shoulder. I feel like 007.’ He is accused of selling the details after he was sacked from Protection Command’s finance department and found himself £1,000 overdrawn. The agency worker showed ‘disregard for the effectiveness of such police operations’ and the sale was the product of ‘opportunism and financial greed’, said prosecutor Gareth Patterson. ‘He had been vetted and allowed access as part of his work to confidential information,’ he added. ‘That confidential information concerned ongoing police operations including the Royal Family, the Prime Minister and others. ‘It was in those circumstances that he sold confidential police information to a newspaper. Sent secrets: Dos Sanos hired PR guru Max Clifford to try to provoke a bidding war between The Mail on Sunday and the News of the World . ‘He deliberately sought to increase the price that he could get for this police information, he encouraged a bidding war by playing off the News of the World against the Mail on Sunday. ‘He also employed the services of Max Clifford Associates, the well-known press relations consultants, in order to help him get a higher price for his sale of police information. He eventually managed to get £32,000. ‘In selling the confidential police information he did not seek the consent of the individual police officers who had been conducting the various operations and whose names and whose personal details he sold to the Press. ‘Nor did he seek the consent of the senior police officers who planned or ran these operations.’ The information Dos Santos sold was used by the Mail on Sunday to write two articles published on successive weekends in July 2010, the court heard. As a result, the police had to assess their ongoing security arrangements and put additional security measures in place. Mr Patterson said: ‘By his actions the defendant caused the release into the public domain of information about how the police managed protection operations in relation to principals, the people being protected, such as members of the Royal Family and former Prime Ministers - information which the police, for obvious reasons, try to keep confidential. ‘As a result of these articles the police had to conduct a number of assessments in relation to the arrangements made for protecting those principals. ‘This resulted in the need for additional security measures and it impacted upon operational deployment and police procedures. ‘The prosecution say that it is significant that the defendant sold this information at a time when he had been given his notice by the police.’ Cash-strapped: Dos Santos is accused at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) of selling the details after he was sacked from Protection Command's finance department and found himself £1,000 overdrawn . ‘His actions showed a disregard for the effectiveness of such police operations and they were born out of opportunism in their timing and quite simply, financial greed. ‘What he did was a serious breach of the trust that was placed in him by the Police, who at the time were paying for his services.’ Under his terms of employment in Protection Command’s finance department he had been granted counter terrorism clearance and made to sign a code of conduct, jurors were told. Mr Patterson said: ‘The particular sensitivity of the information that he would be handling while working in Specialist Operations was emphasised to him by the fact that the terms of the Official Secrets Acts were drawn to his attention. ‘By signing this document in 2008 he was confirming that he understood the importance, was he not, when working for the police of holding certain information in strict confidence and recognised that if he made unauthorised disclosure of such information he could in fact be committing offences as serious as offences under the Official Secrets Acts.’ Confidential: Dos Santos, who worked for the Met's Protection Command's finance department, divulged information about how police managed protection operations for protected people, the prosecutor said . The court heard that Dos Santos emailed 14 spread sheets containing details of more than 2,700 expenses claims to Jason Lewis at the Mail on Sunday on July 1, 2010, having emailed it to his own personal email account the day before. Mr Patterson said that he had been given two weeks’ notice by the police a fortnight earlier and had been due to finish work on July 2. He said that as of June 24 Dos Santos’ bank account was £1,050 overdrawn. ‘It is worth considering a little more closely what the defendant was doing during his final few days at work,’ said the barrister. ‘Because, what is apparent from emails and text messages which he sent in those final days is that he spent a great deal of time and effort communicating with two newspapers and Max Clifford Associates trying to sell Metropolitan Police information for as much money as possible.’ In another sent to Max Clifford Associates he wrote he wanted to get in touch with the News of the World ‘as they usually pay more and of course we would go with the highest offer on the table’. Dos Santos denies one count of disclosing personal data. The trial continues.

The Metropolitan Police are to pay a £15,000 settlement to a teenage rape victim for 'shocking' failings which saw the alleged attacker acquitted. The alleged attacker of the 15-year-old girl was acquitted when the police lost evidence in what a trial judge branded a 'disgrace'. Scotland Yard today admitted failings in the 2005 rape investigation as it agreed an out of court settlement with the young victim and accepted that officers were told to put car crime first. Disgrace: The Metropolitan Police are to pay a settlement to an alleged teenage rape victim for 'shocking' failings which saw the alleged attacker acquitted and car crime made a higher priority . An investigation led to four officers being reprimanded and a shake-up of sexual offence teams after it emerged officers had been told to make car crime a higher priority. The girl's family took legal action, claiming her human rights had been breached, but have now agreed to settle for a reported £15,000. Her mother complained to the BBC that the force fought 'really dirty' against the claim. She said: 'Had they put the same amount of effort into investigating my daughter's rape, I reckon he would probably have been found guilty.' 'To be honest the way they fought it was really dirty and I just think they should have just held their hands up and said, ""we're sorry"".' Detective Chief Superintendent Mick Duthie, who heads the Met's Sapphire sexual offences unit, conceded that rape was not taken sufficiently seriously at the time. Detective Chief Superintendent Mick Duthie, who heads the Met's Sapphire sexual offences unit, conceded that rape was not taken sufficiently seriously at the time . But he insisted that the subsequent shake-up had significantly improved its response. The case had been handled by an 'inexperienced, untrained, poorly-supervised, under-resourced' team, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said: 'I have reviewed the investigation again recently and it is shocking. The trial judge said it was a disgrace and I don't disagree. 'I want to reassure you that the Met now take rape as an extremely serious offence, it is a priority for us,' he said - accepting that officers were previously told to put car crime first. 'Now dedicated staff, dedicated officers, dedicated lawyers - we work in partnership with all out partners across the criminal justice process to make sure that all victims receive justice. 'This case was in 2005 - and that is seven, eight years ago. I am confident that those sort of mistakes that happened then will not happen now.' In a statement, Scotland Yard said: 'In November 2010 the MPS received a claim which stated that the MPS had been in breach of its positive duty under article three by not carrying out an effective rape investigation. 'There are points of law and processes that are gone through with any legal claim received by the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service). 'We are aware of the victim's comments of distress at the legal proceedings, and that some legal arguments may have appeared insensitive to the victim, but that is not the intention of the MPS. 'Following the legal arguments there were discussions with the victim's solicitor with regard to settlement and we came to a mutual agreement on an amount.' A spokesman declined to discuss the size of the settlement.","Officers told to make car crime a higher priority at time of attack in 2005 .

Spared jail: Marie Friendship, pictured arriving at Bristol Crown Court, was given a suspended sentence after admitting an affair with a teenage boy . A married woman who had a six-month relationship with a teenage boy has been spared jail today. Marie Jane Friendship, 38, told people she was in love with the teenager and even sought advice from a solicitor about the legality of the affair. Prosecutor Kenneth Bell told Bristol Crown Court Friendship was wrongly told there was no criminal offence because the boy was over 16 years old. He said the affair, which happened while she was living with her partner of 18 years, only came to light because she told others. Friendship, of Whitchurch, Bristol, admitted one count of having sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. She was given a six-month prison sentence suspended for two years today. Judge Julian Lambert accepted the affair resulted from 'genuine affection on both sides'. Mr Bell said there was no way of knowing how the affair affected the boy as he 'declined to assist police in any way'. The relationship ended when legal proceedings began. Friendship was charged with a position of trust offence, which aims to protect children over the age of consent who have the potential to be vulnerable to sexual abuse by adults in positions of trust. Robert Duval, defending, said . Friendship’s life had been wrecked by her actions and now she could not . even get employment as a cleaner. He said: 'She has never been in trouble in any way, shape or form in her life before these events. 'It is to her credit that she has been as frank as she has to the sexual relationship that has taken place. 'Had she not done so it is probable, . although not certain, that she would not have been prosecuted and this . matter would have made no news and she would not have appeared in the . dock of a Crown Court in this country. 'She was not obliged to do that and she has been courageous for doing that. 'She is deeply and genuinely ashamed for what she has done. She is humiliated by her current circumstances. 'She realises with the benefit of hindsight that she was foolish and irresponsible with her behaviour. Humiliated: Robert Duval, defending Marie Jane Friendship, pictured, said she cannot get a job as a cleaner since the affair . 'This was a genuine case of . infatuation. This was not a case of exploitation and there is no . evidence of coercion or sophistication or manipulation.' Mr Duval added: 'The effect of this . case upon her is irretrievable - they are permanent, they are punitive . and they are humiliating and distressing.' Judge Lambert suspended a . six-month prison sentence for two years, placed her on supervision for . two years and told her to complete 300 hours of unpaid work and observe a . six-month curfew from 8pm to 6am. Friendship was also placed on the sex offenders register for seven years. The judge said: 'The accused should have restrained herself and said no. She has ruined her marriage. 'I have no doubt that he felt very . confused by the whole thing. No-one can blame him that he does not wish . to speak of these events. 'This was a relationship of mutual affection and there was no corruption in this case.' The judge added: 'If you commit any . further offences in the next two years, you would undoubtedly be sent to . jail and I would do that.'

Racing Metro kept alive their bid for a spot in the knockout stages of the Heineken Cup with a hard-fought 15-3 win over Edinburgh in a dire affair at rain-swept Murrayfield. Edinburgh's solitary penalty leaves them with a dismal tally of only 12 points in matches after four Pool One games. The Parisians earned their win by virtue of their better haul from kicks at goal, with Gaetan Germain booting four penalties and Olly Barkley one, while Edinburgh's counter came from Piers Francis. The same two sides had served up a 95-point thriller when they met in the same competition last season, with Edinburgh posting a win that was instrumental in their progress to the semi-finals. Edinburgh's Stuart McInally (centre) is tackled by Racing Metro's Luc Ducalcon . This encounter could scarcely have been further removed, with neither team producing any running rugby of note, and both wasting numerous scoring opportunities with the boot. With three minutes on the clock, Edinburgh were guilty of crossing as they attempted to run the ball out of defence, and Barkley steered the resultant kick between the sticks to open the scoring. The visitors doubled their advantage three minutes later when Germain thumped over a long-range penalty following an offence at a scrum just inside the Edinburgh half. The hosts had barely featured in an attacking sense and their first visit of note to Racing territory yielded a long-range penalty which proved to be just beyond the range of Francis, making his first start for the Scottish outfit. Edinburgh's Piers Francis tackles Racing Metro's Jacques Cronje on a wet night . The 22-year-old had an opportunity to make amends 10 minutes later from a far more favourable position after an offence at the breakdown, but he fluffed his effort. The stand-off opened his account for Edinburgh at the third time of asking, clipping over a penalty from 25 metres after 27 minutes. But he squandered an opportunity to square matters after 32 minutes when he was wide with another straightforward effort after a bustling run by Ross Ford had earned another penalty. Barkley was evidently afflicted by the same malaise, missing a chance to extend his side's lead just before half-time. Edinburgh's Netani Talei is tackled by Racing Metro's Karim Ghezal at a rainy Murrayfield . Germain, too, was off target shortly after the restart when his attempt on goal rattled the woodwork. Francis responded with his fourth miss of the night. The clock ticked past the 50-minute mark without there having been any threat to either try line. Inevitably the next change to the scoreboard came with the boot. A late tackle by Edinburgh number eight Netani Talei on Barkley earned the Fiji international a yellow card and Germain banged over the ensuing penalty from halfway to stretch the lead to six points. The scrappy nature of the contest continued. Edinburgh had another chance to claw back three points after Eddy Ben Arous offended, with the Racing prop earning 10 minutes in the sin bin for his troubles. Greig Tonks assumed the kicking responsibilities from the misfiring Francis, but the full-back fared no better. In response, Germain fired over his third three-pointer of the night, and having found his range he landed another effort with 12 minutes left to play, leaving the Scots 12 points adrift and out of the game. It was even wetter in France, though, where Biarritz beat Connacht 17-0 . In Friday's other match, Connacht were unable to repeat their heroics of a week ago as Biarritz won 17-0 in horrendously wet conditions at the Parc des Sports Aguilera. Man of the match Dimitri Yachvili kicked an early penalty and converted Iain Balshaw's 31st-minute try to give Biarritz the upper hand and a 10-0 interval lead in the Heineken Cup clash. There then followed a stop-start second half during which Tiernan O'Halloran and Eoin McKeon caught the eye for the hard-working visitors. Biarritz were meandering to victory and put the finishing touches to a good night when Damien Traille latched onto his own kick, taking advantage of a fortuitous bounce to put replacement centre Seremaia Burotu over in the final minute. Yachvili converted superbly with the last kick of the match, the result of which sees Biarritz leapfrog over Connacht into second place with Harlequins looking like runaway winners of Pool Three. The saturated pitch contained pools of water in certain areas but the ground staff cleared enough of it for the fixture to go ahead as scheduled. Biarritz's French number eight Imanol Harinordoquy vies with Connacht's forwards . Connacht were expecting a backlash from the French giants, who sacked coaches Jack Isaac and Serge Milhas in the aftermath of their shock 22-14 defeat in Galway. Laurent Rodriguez and Mathieu Rourre were installed as an interim coaching tandem and they would have been pleased with Biarritz's start.Their forwards rumbled into the Connacht 22, winning two early penalties, with Yachvili sticking a third-minute kick through the uprights. As heavy rain continued, Connacht dug their heels in and defended manfully with young full-back Robbie Henshaw secure under the high ball and the mud-covered pack competing in stout fashion. Biarritz had the first sight of the try line in the 12th minute, Takudzwa Ngwenya sliding towards the right corner after set-piece ball was swung wide. However, the United States international failed to get the ball down with the Connacht cover doing just enough. It was a tough night for ball handling due to the wet and slippery conditions . Dan Parks, so influential with a 17-point haul seven days ago, went the aerial route in a bid to give the visitors some momentum. Biarritz were territorially dominant though and exerted more control via clever kicking from Traille, Balshaw and Yachvili. They made a breakthrough on the half-hour mark as they went left from a midfield scrum, with Traille's half break making the initial incision and Jean-Pascal Barraque passing precisely for the supporting Balshaw to splash over in the corner. Yachvili supplied an excellent conversion from wide out. Late on in the first half, Eoin McKeon took out the France scrum-half off the ball, but Yachvili slid his resulting penalty effort to the left and wide. Biarritz's second row Erik Lund (centre) takes on Connacht's fly-half Dan Parks (right) A sin-binning for Biarritz hooker Benoit August, who got involved in some afters with Johnny O'Connor, presented Connacht with an opportunity to launch themselves forward. However, Parks sent a subsequent penalty from a difficult position wide and some handling errors robbed Connacht of precious momentum in an evenly-fought third quarter. An injury to Connacht centre Danie Poolman, who got an accidental knee to the head at a ruck, broke up play for a number of minutes as he was taken off on a stretcher. Aled Brew ruined a good scoring chance for the home side with a sloppy pass, but they remained on the front foot despite losing replacement Thibault Dubarry to the sin bin. Biarritz pressed from a Fabien Barcella surge into the westerners' 22 and a five-metre scrum. Connacht held out until Traille opened the way for Burotu to power past Paul O'Donohoe's last-ditch tackle in the left corner.","Edinburgh 3-15 Racing Metro .

Couldn't remember: Alycia Lane testified that wasn't able to recall when or where she had an Apple store worker clear her laptop's memory . A newsreader who allegedly had an affair with her married co-anchor had the defamation lawsuit that she filed against CBS and her supposed lover thrown out of court because she allegedly lied during her testimony. Alycia Lane sued her former company for failing to investigate her claims that her colleague and alleged lover Larry Mendte was breaking into her email and sending out messages to other journalists from her account. The relationship between Lane and  Mendte, former co-anchors for the Philadelphia CBS affiliate KYW, was exposed in a public he-said-she-said battle where their stories never gelled. Mendte claims that their affair began in 2004 when Lane threw herself at him even though he was married. At one point, Lane allegedly attempted to seduce him by stripping only to her bra after he dropped her off at her apartment one evening. On another occasion, he claims that she began straddling him while he was driving so that he had to pull over in order for the tryst to continue safely. The two would also send each other text messages whilst they were on air with the numbers ‘1-4-3’ which were code for ‘I love you’. The relationship soured when Mendte’s wife, Dawn Stensland, a news anchor on rival broadcaster Fox29, confronted him and he admitted his behavior. Awkward: Seen in 2003 before their alleged affair began, Larry Mendte was married when he said that Alycia Lane attempted to seduce him by making out with him in his car and in her apartment . Lane denies the affair, saying that she . refused his advances at a Christmas party by telling him: ‘A kiss is . cheating, Larry. You're a married man.’ Joint appearance: Mendte, seen here with Lane in 2008, admitted that he did hack into her email account and send damaging emails to other reporters . One aspect of their affair that neither . of them denies is that Mendte, upset about the end of their alleged . affair, broke into Lane's work email and began sending messages to . newspaper reporters throughout the city to damage her reputation. He would pass on details about her personal life and relationship with her then husband just to get back at her. Mendte admitted the email hacking to police, was fired from his $700,000-a-year job and served six months house arrest. The legal spotlight then turned to Lane in December 2007, who was arrested for an unrelated case when she allegedly punched a plainclothes police woman during a trip to New York City, calling the officer a 'f****** dyke b****' during a drunken rage. Those charges were dropped but it also prompted her bosses to drop her, as she was fired shortly after. Emails between Lane and her lawyers following the New York City incident were also said to be some of the ones that Mendte leaked to fellow journalists. The case showed the close-knit world of Philadelphia journalism, as Lane's lawyer tried to have an extensive, flirty string of emails between Lane and NFL Network sportscaster Rich Eisen. Strike a pose: In one of her flirty emails with Rich Eisen, he called Lane a 'rhyming vixen' Men- and their wives- in her life: Larry Mendte is married to Fox anchor Dawn Stensland (left) and Rich Eisen is married to fellow sports journalist  Suzy Schuster (right) Legal issues: Lane, seen with her then-boyfriend Chris Booker, was arrested but never charged with punching a police woman in the face during a trip to New York . Dating back to 2008, the married Eisen . and then-single Lane wrote to each other referring to an encounter in . Miami, and the regularly included extremely friendly phrases, like 'I'm . sweet on you kid' (Eisen to Lane), and 'I'm just glad you're in my life . =)' (Lane to Eisen). Lane maintained that their relationship was platonic, though the pictures that she sent him of herself in a bikini made it difficult for many to believe. The latest legal hurdle- Lane's defamation lawsuit against CBS and Mendte- has also been dropped as the judge claims that Lane lied during her testimony, hiding 'highly relevant' information. Turbulent love life: Lane dated radio show host Chris Booker (left) for four years before they broke up in 2011. She then dated actor George Hamilton's son Ashley (right) for a period of time before ending that relationship in September . New gig: Lane, seen here with a former intern, is now a weekend anchor in Los Angeles . Lane, who currently works as a weekend . anchor in Los Angeles, argued that CBS did not sufficiently investigate . her complaints that her email was being hacked before she found out it . was Mendte behind the leak. As a result, her computer records were extremely important to the case, making it an issue that she could not specifically remember when she went to an Apple store and had the staff clear out her hard drive- whether it was in the spring or summer of 2007, or if it was in New York or in Philadelphia. CBS lawyers obtained records from the Apple store which shows that she had the laptop memory cleared in late 2008, after she filed the lawsuit, suggesting that she was deleting possible evidence. Among the information that CBS lawyers feel was erased from the computer was a novel that Lane was drafting, detailing the incident that led to her arrest- and subsequent firing- in New York City.","Alycia Lane and her co-anchor Larry Mendte 'had affair' and when it ended, Mendte broke into her email account and sent damaging messages .

Google has come under fire from child protection campaigners after its claims to have put effective safeguards on access to porn were called into question. The internet giant had changed its programming after earlier criticism so as to make X-rated pictures more difficult to find. But a trial carried out in the US by the Daily Mail revealed that such images were still easily available.Entering the word 'porn' in a search on Google brought up hundreds of X-rated pictures. Restricted: Google tweaked an algorithm for their image search database in the U.S. making it harder to find explicit images . Giant: Google, based in California, has become the biggest search engine in the world . The result brings into question Google's claim that users in the US would have to be more specific if they wanted to view porn. The changes had affected users in the . US only. Those in the UK do not at present have the supposedly improved . programming and there is no timetable to bring it in. Google has also changed its . 'SafeSearch' filters which allow users to completely block porn. In the . US there are now only two options for pictures – filter all explicit . results or not at all. UK Google users have three options, which are . potentially confusing – no filtering, moderate or strict. John Mann, a Labour MP who has . convened Commons meetings on the misuse of the internet, said the . simpler measures in the US should be used in Britain too. He said: 'Parents need to be able to . make a clear choice so they can do what they need to do. One system . across the Western world, including the UK, seems sensible.' John Carr, secretary of the . Children's Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety, added: 'It's good to . see Google acknowledging the problem but let's hope they get it right . because the evidence so far is not conclusive.' Restriction: Google's search restriction is only in place in the U.S. but the company said it hopes to roll-out the changes internationally . The Daily Mail is campaigning for an . automatic block to protect children. Under the plan over-18s could . access porn only if they 'opt in' after a strict age verification check. A spokesman for Google said: 'We aim not to show sexually explicit results unless a user is specifically searching for them.' Despite Google's aim 'not to show sexually-explicit results unless a user is specifically . searching for them', users will notice little change. The restrictions, which have only been introduced in the US, only apply to Google's 'image search'. Further, Google also said that the change applies on computers that have the 'safesearch' setting . activated - a mode that already attempts to filter graphic content from web . searches. David Cameron last month expressed his desire to introduce restrictions on computers to prevent children from viewing online porn. The . Prime Minister has rejected an automatic block on porn but has . signalled his intention to set up opt-in controls for parents. The move follows increasing concern that children in the UK are being exposed to graphic images at a young age. Under . Google's new US measures, wide searches such as 'porn' will return no . results. But the company said that users could still find what they are . looking for by using more specific terms. Turning on the SafeSearch filter in the US will now entirely wipe clean any results for search words like 'porn' or 'boobs.' Some . internet-users in the US described the change as 'censorship' and took . to website's such as Reddit to criticise the company. One user named okeman wrote: 'You can take away our privacy, but if you mess with porn, the internet is going to be MAD.' Another wrote: 'Oh great, now I have to explicitly . state what I am looking for, which then gets saved to my search history . so I can't pretend I just stumbled on it.'","Search engine fails to makes it more difficult to find pornographic images .

Dutch director Tom Six’s 2011 film, Human Centipede II (Full Sequence), is one of the most repellent exercises in sexual sadism that I have ever witnessed in a cinema. Its 2009 predecessor, The Human Centipede, was an amazingly unpleasant horror film about a mad scientist joining three people together surgically. Evidently, Mr Six thought this hadn’t gone far enough, for last year he came up with the sequel, which is roughly ten times more extreme, filthy and psychopathic than the original. The sadistic anti-hero Martin (played with slobbering relish by Laurence R Harvey) is a huge fan of the first Human Centipede movie. An obese, inarticulate, retarded man who lives with his mother, Martin gets his kicks by abducting motorists from a multi-storey car park and taking them to a disused warehouse, where he attempts to join 12 of them together as a human centipede with one digestive system. To this end, he maims, cuts, slices off pieces of anatomy, indulges in sadistic, unskilled dentistry, rapes them and forces them into other vile acts. The producers of this exercise in extended sexual aggression proudly advertised it as ‘a film so sick the BBFC didn’t want you to see it!’ The British Board of Film Classification did, indeed, initially deny the film an 18 certificate on the grounds that no amount of cuts could overcome the central problem – that the plot revolves around the sexual arousal of the central character by the torture and degradation of others. However, in perhaps the most lily-livered act in its inglorious history, the board reversed that decision after an appeal by the film’s distributors. Too far: Human Centipede II is directed by Tom Six, pictured . Shocking: A scene from Human Centipede II, a 'repellent exercise in sexual sadism' A total of 32 cuts were made, totalling 2 minutes 37 seconds, but these did little to disguise anything that was happening. Gore: Directors such as Eli Roth, pictured, would have seen many of their films blocked by the censors before 1996, says Christopher Tookey . Sadly, The Human Centipede II is not an isolated example, and one movie – A Serbian Film – is even more disgusting in its celebration of sexual torture. The truth is that ever since it let through another exercise in sexual sadism, Crash, in 1996, the BBFC has repeatedly allowed 18 certificates for films that wallow in sexual degradation, rape and torture. Mostly these were abstruse foreign-language films. More recently, however, a new genre of mainstream, English-language films has sprung up, often called ‘torture porn’, in which Eli Roth and other directors have wallowed in the erotic degradation of both sexes. Many of these have had ‘Hostel’ or ‘Saw’ in the title, but there are dozens of them, and as a film critic I have had the misfortune to see them all. None of them would have got past the censors before 1996. If, at long last, the authorities are starting to see sense and realise that films like this do influence people in real life, it’s not before time. Several questions need to be answered much more honestly than they have been. Should the opportunists responsible for films like this be ashamed of themselves? Yes. Do films like this help to brutalise some of those who see them? Of course. Does the British Board of Film Classification care? Not sufficiently. Do we all have to live with the social and criminal consequences? Yes. Degrading: So-called 'torture-porn' films such as Hostel, pictured, have emerged and 'wallow in the erotic degradation of both sexes' according to Christopher Tookey . Slipping standards: Censorship hasn't been the same according to Christopher Tookey since 1996 film Crash, starring James Spader, pictured, made it through the net .","Christopher Tookey describes the British Board of Film Classification's decision to reverse a ban on Human Centipede II as 'the most lily-livered act in its inglorious history'

The Hispanic girl also had a catheter . placed in her heart at Phoenix Children's Hospital - which doctor's now believe could . cause a deadly infection if she is not returned to have it removed.

Google will claim solidarity with thousands of websites preparing to 'go dark' at midnight tonight, Eastern Time, in protest against draconian plans to police the . internet and combat piracy. Some of the world's biggest tech . companies are planning to take part in the blackout, including . Wikipedia, Mozilla, Reddit and WordPress. But the search giant has ruled out the possibility of blacking out itself. Google instead said it would change its home page to show its support. Support network: Google will claim solidarity with websites blacking out on Wednesday but search giant has ruled out the possibility of blacking out itself . 'Like many businesses, entrepreneurs and web users, we oppose these bills because there are smart, targeted ways to shut down foreign rogue websites without asking American companies to censor the Internet,' a Google spokeswoman wrote in a statement seen by the Huffington Post. 'So tomorrow we will be joining many other tech companies to highlight this issue on our U.S. home page.' Wikipedia is to shut down its . English-language site. An estimated 100 million people will be . affected by the one-day closure of Wikipedia alone, which has . become a vital tool for businesses and students. Jimmy Wales, who founded the site, warned students via Twitter to ‘do your homework early’ ahead of the shutdown. The blackout is part of a widespread protest . campaign orchestrated via social sites such as Reddit - and other . internet heavyweights such as browser company Mozilla are to join in. They are angry about the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA), which are going before the U.S. Congress. Twitter is not joining in the protest. Its CEO Dick Costolo said at the weekend that applying single-nation politics to a worldwide service was 'foolish'. However co-founder Jack Dorsey did stand with other top tech companies who wrote an open letter to Congress last month warning of the dangers that SOPA would bring to business and innovation. Unprecedented: The English version of Wikipedia is being blacked out for 24 hours in protest against proposed legislation currently going through Congress - the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect Intellectual Property Act . No show: Twitter Dick Costolo called the blackout 'foolish' The laws are designed to  prevent online pirates from making music, film, television shows and eBooks available  free of charge. However, . critics argue they go much further and amount to an attempt to control . and censor the internet, so curtailing freedom of expression. The Stop Online Piracy Act and the . Protect Intellectual Property Act in Congress - designed to . crack down on sales of pirated U.S. products overseas - has pit internet giants, consumer groups and freedom of speech advocates against film studios and record labels. The . House bill (SOPA) would allow a private party to go straight to a . website's advertising and payment providers and request they sever ties. Supporters include the film and music . industry, which often sees its products sold illegally. They say the . legislation is needed to protect intellectual property and jobs. Critics say the legislation could hurt . the technology industry and infringe on free-speech rights. Among their . concerns are provisions that would weaken cyber-security for companies . and hinder domain access rights. The . most controversial provision is in the House bill, which would have . enabled federal authorities to 'blacklist' sites that are alleged to . distribute pirated content. That would essentially cut off portions of . the Internet to all U.S. users. But congressional leaders appear to be . backing off this provision. Supporters say the legislation is . needed to protect intellectual property and jobs. Critics say the . legislation is too broad and could hurt the technology industry and . infringe on free-speech rights. There are also fears they will give . the U.S. authorities even greater powers to pursue alleged law-breakers . on both sides of the Atlantic. Last week, UK courts decided to extradite British student Richard O’Dwyer to the U.S. on charges of online piracy. In theory, the 23-year-old could be . jailed for ten years for setting up the TVShack website, which provided . links to free pirate downloads of films and TV programmes. His defenders claim he is small fry in . the piracy industry and say Google, which has huge financial and . political muscle, is a major player. Google has never been prosecuted even . though its search engine gives links to many sites that offer illegal . streaming or pirate downloads of films, music, TV shows and eBooks. Wales said in a statement: 'Today Wikipedians from around the world have spoken about their opposition to this destructive legislation. 'This is an extraordinary action for our community to take - and while we regret having to prevent the world from having access to Wikipedia for even a second, we simply cannot ignore the fact that SOPA and PIPA endanger free speech both in the United States and abroad, and set a frightening precedent of Internet censorship for the world.' According to a press release, users of the site have discussed for more than a month whether it should react to the legislation and, in the past few days, tried to decide how. The foundation behind the site, Wikimedia, said it collected input from users over a period of 72 hours before making its final decision on Monday evening based on that feedback. 'This is by far the largest level of participation in a community discussion ever seen on Wikipedia, which illustrates the level of concern that Wikipedians feel about this proposed legislation,' a statement on the Wikimedia Foundation website reads. Protesting: Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales expects an estimated 100 million visitors to be affected by a Wikipedia black out . 'The overwhelming majority of . participants support community action to encourage greater public action . in response to these two bills.' 'Of the proposals considered by . Wikipedians, those that would result in a ""blackout"" of the English . Wikipedia, in concert with similar blackouts on other websites opposed . to SOPA and PIPA, received the strongest support.' Mr Wales told the BBC: ‘Proponents of . the Stop Online Piracy Act have characterised the opposition as being . people who want to enable piracy or defend piracy. ‘But that’s not really the point. The . point is the bill is so over broad and so badly written that it’s going . to impact all kinds of things that don’t have anything to do with . stopping piracy.’ Social news community Reddit has already announced that it will 'go dark' on Wednesday to protest against the bill. High-profile blog BoingBoing has also announced that it will protest. Browser maker Mozilla has . said that it also intends to protest by 'going dark' briefly and . hosting anti-SOPA content, although copies of its Firefox browser will . continue to work as normal. Comedy network Cheezburger (host of Failblog) also said it will join in. Several sites such as SopaStrike offer 'do it yourself' kits for smaller websites to 'go dark' in protest at SOPA. SopaStrike hosts a list of smaller sites that have said they will black out in protest. Not all sites who join the protest will 'switch off' entirely - some will host banners or turn the front page black instead. Facebook has voiced opposition to the bill but has not committed to any form of protest this week. Twitter will not join in - its CEO said that applying single-nation politics to a worldwide service was 'foolish'. He claimed the proposals were part of a wider attempt by governments to regulate the internet. ‘All around the world, we’re seeing . the development of legislation intended to fight online piracy, and . regulate the internet in other ways, that hurt online freedoms.’ Barack Obama has hinted he may water . down the proposals, which would remove the possibility of Google and . others being prosecuted for directing people to pirate websites. Big Brother Watch, the UK civil liberties campaign group, backed the  protest. Its director Nick Pickles said: ‘The . proposals represent a blunt attack on freedom of speech, based upon a . deeply flawed understanding of how the internet works.’ A large-scale blackout is . expected from midnight Eastern Standard Time on Tuesday . until midnight on Wednesday. 'We are looking at a powerful protest,' said Jay Walsh, spokesman for the foundation. Tech . companies such as Facebook, Yahoo and others have also . questioned the legislation and said it poses a serious risk to the . industry. Several online communities such as Reddit, BoingBoing and others have announced plans to go blackout in protest. The Obama administration has also raised concerns about the legislation.

Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar, a massive 500-seat venue  in Times Square, has been doing a busy trade, according to reports. Last month New York Times food critic Pete Wells slated the restaurant with a harsh review which asked: 'Why did the toasted marshmallow taste like fish?' and deemed a margarita a 'combination of radiator fluid and formaldehyde'. Scroll down for video . The ironic choice: Guy's American Bar & Kitchen in Times Square has had crowds of New Yorkers eating there to decide for themselves if a scathing review was really true . However rather than sink the latest venture of millionaire restaurateur Fieri, the review has hard-to-please New Yorkers flocking through its doors to sample the cuisine - albeit in an ironic manner. Locals have been venturing into . the touristy, midtown hub to eat at Guy's place on West 44th Street, checking themselves in on Facebook, Twitter and FourSquare while uploading pictures of food and cocktails to Instagram. Alex Brena, 24, who works in advertising sales and lives on the Lower East Side, went a week after the Times review ran with two friends who also live in New York. Miss Brena told MailOnline she went to the  restaurant mid-week for lunch and described it as 'busy but not packed'.

The group shared appetizers of fries, mozzarella sticks, tacos and wings. Miss Brena told MailOnline that the fries were the 'weirdest' as they were covered in hot sauce, had no potato in them and were just the shell. The mozzarella sticks were 'fine' while the tacos and wings were 'nothing special but edible'. She added: 'It's a lot of fried food and hot sauce. I didn't feel too good after leaving.'

Next to an open casket were collages of photos and mementos from Belcher's playing career. An array of flowers spelled out W.B. for his high school. Chiefs players and staff attended a memorial service for Belcher in Kansas City last week. On a Saturday morning, the day before the team's game against the Carolina Panthers, Belcher shot Perkins multiple times at their home. Police said Belcher and Perkins previously had been arguing.

Tragic: Bailey Ratcliffe died after mistakenly being given an overdose of anti-epilepsy medication . A five-year-old boy died after he was given an 'inappropriately high dose' of a drug when he was taken to hospital suffering an epileptic fit, a coroner has ruled. Bailey Ratcliffe died after he was admitted to Dewsbury District Hospital on May 27 2009, an inquest has heard. Yesterday, senior registrar Dr Helen Moore apologised in court for mistakes made when Bailey was given the drug phenytoin on her orders. West Yorkshire Coroner Peter Straker gave a narrative verdict in which he said: 'Unfortunately, there were a number of individuals who did not recognise this error and, therefore, did not intervene and prevent Bailey from dying.' The two-day inquest heard how Bailey had been fitting for three hours when he arrived at the hospital on May 27 2009. He had been given other drugs by his family, paramedics and A&E staff to try and control the fitting but Dr Moore decided it was time to move on to phenytoin. But the doctor admitted she made a mistake in the dosage instructions when she asked a junior doctor to prescribe the drug. The court heard how other doctors and nurses were involved in the administration of the phenytoin and one nurse did question the large quantity of the drug she was being asked to prepare with Dr Moore. But none of the medical staff stopped Bailey receiving a much larger dose than he was he supposed to. Dr Moore told the court how she thought she got confused in her mind with the procedures for administering a different drug used in cases of severe asthma. She said: 'I just made a mistake.' Overdose: Five-year-old Bailey had been fitting for three hours when he was brought to Dewsbury Hospital . The court heard how Bailey was . transferred to a paediatric ward in the hospital but, later that . afternoon, he began to deteriorate and stopped breathing. A full resuscitation team was called in but could not save his life. The inquest heard Bailey died from phenytoin toxicity complicated by his epilepsy. Bailey had six times the amount of phenytoin in his blood that was expected . Analysis of his blood after death showed it contained at least six times the expected level of phenytoin. Mr Straker's narrative verdict stated: 'On May 27 2009, Bailey Ratcliffe was diagnosed with status epilepticus. 'At hospital, an inappropriately high dose of phenytoin was prescribed. 'There were systems in place to . prevent such a prescription from being given but, unfortunately, there . were a number of individuals who did not recognise this error and, . therefore, did not intervene and prevent Bailey from dying.'

The Crown Prosecution Service has already announced that no-one will be prosecuted in relation to Bailey's death. Anna Bosley, from the law firm Irwin . Mitchell, who represented the family, said: 'Carrianne trusted the . hospital to look after her son and she was badly let down, but she is . reassured that lessons have been learned and steps taken to ensure that . accidental overdoses are avoided in future.

Sexsomnia: Actor Simon Morris, 42, pictured, who is accused of raping a teenage girl told Cardiff Crown Court that he had no recollection of the alleged rape . An actor accused of raping a teenage girl yesterday blamed it on ‘sexsomnia’, a condition which he claims causes him to have sex in his sleep. Simon Morris, who appeared in  a film with Michael Caine and in the TV soap Hollyoaks, is alleged to have attacked the 15-year-old after she drank cocktails at a  birthday party. But the 42-year-old told a jury he  had no recollection of the alleged  rape because he was sleepwalking at the time. When arrested he initially refused to believe that he had sex with the girl until police presented him with DNA evidence, Cardiff Crown Court heard. He told jurors: ‘I have a history of sleepwalking, checking my phone, gyrating against door frames and having sex with partners in my sleep. It’s quite embarrassing but I once engaged in sexual activity with a recent ex-girlfriend. ‘I climbed on top of her in the middle of the night in a blank state. I have also had partial sex with my current partner and gyrated against her leg.’ He told the court he had undergone tests at a sleep clinic in Edinburgh to ‘try to understand’ his condition. Sue Ferrier, prosecuting, called his sexsomnia claim a ‘feeble excuse to escape the inevitable’. She said Morris met the teenager in September 2011 at a birthday party, where she had been given two glasses of champagne when she arrived. ‘Morris took an interest in her – winking at her, helping her pour drinks and even offering her to stay with him in London,’ said Mrs Ferrier. ‘The girl got drunk on cocktails and her father put her to sleep in an upstairs room. Morris then checked on her after she was sick and carried her into another bed. ‘The girl’s father tried to wake his daughter at 6am to go home, but as she was fast asleep he left her in the bed for the night.’ The girl’s statement to police described how she woke soon afterwards to see Morris standing in front of her, touching her sexually. He had sex with her before leaving, when the ‘full horror’ hit, her statement said. Court: Morris is accused of raping the teenager at a party after she had been put to bed by her father. The prosecutor told the court that Morris had winked at the girl and asked her to stay with him in London during the party . Morris told how he was ‘petrified’ to . be handcuffed and arrested later that morning. He said: ‘I’m too much of . a gentleman, I wouldn’t even do this to my worst enemy.’ He added that . he did not believe they had even had sex until he was presented with the . DNA evidence. Morris’s . current girlfriend, Helen Cole, is standing by him and told police he . once tried to have sex with her while he was asleep. Morris appeared with Michael Caine and Andy Serkis in the 2000 film Shiner and on Hollyoaks in 2001. He also appeared on the West End stage during his acting career, which lasted between 1996 and 2006. He later set up a consultancy firm which has since folded and he has also acted as an escort to celebrities. Morris denies rape and sexual assault. The trial continues.

Worrying: Britain's gold-plated triple AAA status came under pressure today after an influential credit ratings agency put it on negative watch. It could prove embarrassing for Chancellor George Osborne . Britain’s gold-plated triple AAA status came under pressure today after an influential credit ratings agency put it on negative watch. Standard & Poor’s (S&P) said there was a one in three chance it could lower Britain’s rating within the next two years, if economic conditions weaken in the UK. It said it expected government debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) to continue to rise in 2015, before declining again, with future employment or growth shocks putting further pressure on Government finances. The agency said: 'In our opinion, many of the factors that have restrained growth in recent years will likely continue to do so in the near term.' S&P was the last of the three major credit rating agencies to maintain a stable outlook for Britain, and the move comes just over a week after Chancellor George Osborne said he would no longer be able to cut Britain's net debt by 2015. A downgrade by one of the big three . credit ratings agencies would drive up the UK's borrowing costs, . potentially jeopardising the Government's deficit reduction plans. 'The outlook revision reflects our view that we could lower the ratings on the UK within the next two years if fiscal performance weakens beyond our current expectations, S&P said in a statement. 'We believe this could occur in particular as a result of a delayed and uneven economic recovery, or a weakening of political commitment to consolidation,' it added. Britain's finance ministry stressed that S&P backed the country's current deficit-reduction plan. 'Standard & Poor's endorse the Government's 'strong commitment to implementing the fiscal mandate' and specifically warn against slowing 'the pace and extent of fiscal consolidation'. It is because we have stuck to that commitment that the deficit is down,' a spokesman said. Concerns: Standard & Poor's said it expected government debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) to continue to rise in 2015, before declining again. The Bank of England is pictured . The Government's bond trading had largely finished for the day when S&P made its announcement. Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotiabank, said that Britain was at risk of a downgrade from one of the major ratings agencies if the economy does not perform better than the government currently forecasts. 'The UK hasn't been downgraded yet, but it is getting closer,' he said. 'The UK needs to stop disappointing on growth and the public finances. However, the UK has suffered persistent slippage since mid-2010 so the odds are skewed towards a downgrade.' A Treasury spokesman said the move brought S&P in line with rival agencies Fitch and Moody's, which both revised the UK to a negative outlook earlier this year. The S&P report comes after Chancellor George Osborne said he will not be able to start bringing down national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015/16, in his Autumn Statement. He said he must extend his fiscal consolidation period by a year to 2017/18 after the independent tax and spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said it expected GDP to fall this year by 0.1%, compared to previous estimates of 0.8% growth.","Standard & Poor’s said .

The Chancellor pledged a crackdown on firms who get out of paying their fair share in corporation tax. George Osborne acted following growing fury over multinational companies like Google, Amazon and Starbucks who paid nothing or very little despite huge sales. In his Autumn Statement, he said he would give HM Revenue and Customs a further £77million to fight tax avoidance by wealthy individuals and global firms. Chancellor George Osborne pledged a crackdown on firms who get out of paying their fair share in corporation tax as he delivered his Autumn Statement to the Commons today . And he claimed the crackdown will raise another £2billion a year which can be used to cut the deficit. The Chancellor told MPs that he wanted a 'tax system where the richest pay their fair share'. 'The vast majority of people, rich or otherwise, pay their taxes and make their contribution,' he said. 'But there are still too many who illegally evade their taxes, or use aggressive tax avoidance in order not to pay their fair share.' Anger over tax avoidance reached a head last month when it emerged that coffee chain Starbucks had paid corporation tax in the UK over the past 15 years despite millions of pounds in sales. Internet companies Google and Amazon have also been accused of 'immoral' tax regimes which means profits are diverted to other jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Facing a higher tax bill: Amazon, whose warehouse in Swansea is pictured, will be one of the firms which pays a relatively small amount of tax to be targeted . A Starbucks worker hands out hot chocolate to shoppers in London's Oxford street today as Mr Osborne pledged to get tough with the company's tax avoidance regime . Mr Osborne said hundreds of millions of pounds of tax loopholes would be closed, and the HMRC would investigate the abusive use of partnerships. He reminded MPs that the government would introduce the first-ever 'anti-abuse rule', and pointed out that a new treaty with Switzerland means that from next year for the first time there will be money flowing from Swiss bank accounts to the UK than the other way round. The Chancellor said he expects to receive £5billion over the next six years from the undisclosed Swiss bank accounts of UK residents. He added: 'HMRC will not have its budget cut over the next two years, unlike other departments. Instead we will spend £77million more on fighting tax avoidance – and not just for wealthy individuals. 'We want the most competitive corporate tax system of any major economy in the world, but we expect those corporate taxes to be paid. 'So today we are confirming that we will put more resources into ensuring multinational companies pay their proper share of taxes. And we are leading the international effort to prevent artificial transfers of profits to tax havens.' He said he would be working with France . and Germany to crack down on companies' tax avoidance. It will be 'an . important priority' of Britain's G8 presidency next year. Cutting some slack: The Chancellor also announced that the main rate of corporation tax will be cut by a further 1 per cent to 21 per cent for April 2014 . 'We expect the action we announce today will increase the amount of money collected from tax evasion and avoidance by a further £2billion a year,' he told the Commons. Starbucks announced today that it will now hand over £10million to the Treasury after finally caving in to pressure. But its decision, after it admitted . 'it needed to do more' on tax in the UK, may not placate boycotting . consumers unhappy about its financial position. The company grips one third of the UK . coffee market but recorded no taxable profits last year and so did not . have to pay any corporation tax. Since 1998 the company has enjoyed . £3billion in sales. Although their new payment of up to . £10million will be seen as a victory for the Government, it is only a . tiny proportion of the amount of cash Starbucks generates in the UK. The Chancellor also announced that the main rate of corporation tax will be cut by a further 1 per cent to 21 per cent for April 2014. Labour Treasury spokeswoman Catherine McKinnell said: 'This funding is welcome, but it's a tiny proportion of the over £2billion of deep cuts to HMRC that George Osborne has pushed through. 'If the Government was serious about tackling tax avoidance, they'd rethink their plan to cut a further 10,000 HMRC staff, which risks being a false economy. 'Despite all the rhetoric about tackling tax avoidance, the progress made by this Government is limited at best. The deal struck with Switzerland is less transparent than a similar deal struck with Liechtenstein by the last government. 'The latest National Audit Office report showed what can be achieved when a government is serious about tax avoidance and praises Labour's disclosure laws for closing down avoidance opportunities and bringing in £12billion of extra tax since they were introduced.'","George Osborne claims move will raise another £2bn a year to cut deficit .

German leader Angela Merkel is reported to be 'losing her patience' with the UK over Europe as an EU commissioner challenges London to decide whether or not it wants to remain in the bloc. Respected German news magazine Der Spiegel also said on Friday that Brussels is reaching the end of its tether over British attitudes to the union as the budget squabbling which threatens to split prime minister David Cameron's conservatives once more brings the UK role in the club under the spotlight. Britain is adamant in its refusal to accept the budget proposal of €1 trillion (£800million) made by the European Commission and has demanded that it be slashed by up to 20 percent. On Friday, European Commissioner for financial programming and budget Janusz Lewandowski, Poland's representative in the EU's executive, said it was time for Britain to make a 'fundamental decision' regarding its future in the European Union. 'Of course there are limits,' he said in an interview with the German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung. 'We can't finance more Europe with substantially less money.' When asked if he was referring to budgetary criticism coming from London, Lewandowski said: 'Of course I am also referring to Great Britain. Either they see their future in the European Union in the long term or they don't. 'You should not forget that in the course of recent years, leaders have handed the EU new obligations. Unfortunately it is often the case that the financial aspect is forgotten.' European leaders gather in Brussels on November 22 to pass the budget. Tough talk: EU Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski, left, said it was time for Britain to make a 'fundamental decision' while David Cameron, right, said Britain was 'taking the toughest line of all in the budget negotiations' 'This government is taking the toughest line in these budget negotiations of any government since we joined the European Union,' Cameron said. 'At best we would like it cut, at worst frozen, and I'm quite prepared to use the veto if we don't get a deal that's good for Britain.' Lewandowski is not the only one losing his patience with the tone of the debate. Several European leaders have waded into the budget debate in recent days and some have used language similar in its firmness to that coming out of London. German Chancellor Angela Merkel on . Thursday asked for all sides to calm down. 'I don't want to throw more . vetoes into the room,' she said at a press conference. 'It doesn't help . bring about a solution.'

He earned the zoo millions during his short life and this week the statue funded by fans from across the world and the statue called 'Knut the Dreamer' was unveiled at Berlin Zoo not far from where he captivated 11 million visitors during his short life.

'Knut will stay in the hearts of many visitors, this memorial will create something for future generations so that the unique nature of this animal celebrity will live on,' said the Friends of the Capital Zoos association. At the peak of his fame Knut even appeared on the front page of Vanity Fair magazine. But the dark side of celebrity meant that he literally became hooked on stardom, only becoming animated when the cameras clicked and the audience cooed. Animal welfare specialists went so far as to dub him a 'psycho bear' who was driven mad by his own fame. The statue of him is of a more innocent time, when he was still young and adored. 'The most popular animal in the history of our zoo had left traces of love behind,' said the zoo’s commercial director Gabriele Thoene.

An Army handbook advising American soldiers to not speak badly of the Taliban, advocate women's rights or criticize pedophilia in Afghanistan has been leaked, to particular disapproval by the U.S.’ commanding Afghan general. The proposed 75-page document, obtained by the Wall Street Journal, suggests soldiers' ignorance of Afghan culture is partially to blame for a rise in deadly insider attacks, with more than three dozen reported this year. 'Many of the confrontations occur because of [coalition] ignorance of, or lack of empathy for, Muslim and/or Afghan cultural norms, resulting in a violent reaction from the [Afghan security force] member,' a portion of the draft obtained by the Journal reads. Leak: A proposed handbook intended for U.S. soldiers that briefs them on how to properly handle Afghan culture has been leaked to the ardent disapproval of the U.S.' commanding Afghan general . Of those attacks, around 63 members of the U.S.-led coalition were killed by Afghan soldiers. But reacting with ardent disapproval to the handbook's advisory is top military commander in Afghanistan, U.S. Marine Gen John Allen. 'Gen. Allen did not author, nor does he intend to provide, a foreword,' Col. Tom Collins, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan told the Journal of the draft.

A German pensioner hit the jackpot at his local fleamarket when a $25 book of old stamps contained a single rare specimen which he believes is worth an incredible $3 million. Reinhold Hoffmann, 70, wants to fly to experts in America with the one cent stamp dating from 1861 and bearing the portrait of Benjamin Franklin. Only 3,100 of them were ever printed during the American Civil War and stayed in use until 1867. Reinhold, from Dresden, said it was actually his partner Baerbel, 71, who bought the book containing 4lbs of stamps. German pensioner Reinhold Hoffmann,with the U.S. one cent stamp he believes could be worth $3million . 'When I laid them out on the table and saw the one cent stamp I stopped breathing,' he said. 'Since then I have shown it to experts and consulted all the literature I can find about it. There is only one other example known about, in a New York museum, and dealers have told me it is worth at least three million US dollars.' Rare US stamp dealer Craig Selig from Fort Wayne told a German newspaper; 'A certificate of authenticity can be issued in this case only by the Philatelic Foundation in New York. It is very exciting.' Mr Hoffmann discovered the rare specimen at a Dresden flea market . But Reinhold, who lives from a $750 a month pension, doesn't have the money to fly to America. He is offering anyone who sponsors him on his trip the money in full plus interest - and has put down another album of not-so-rare stamps in his possession valued at $25,000 as security. Minor differences in the most minute details, such has variations in paper and the types of ink used can have a dramatic effect on the value of stamp. While some one cent stamps from the civil war era are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, others can change hands for around $20. The most highly-prized of all the one cent stamps is the 1868  'Z' grill - the grill being a pattern of tiny squares embossed into the paper and visible on the back. The 'Z grill' was introduced as it allowed ink to be fully absorbed into the paper and stop cheapskates from washing their stamps clean and reusing them. But they were found to be impractical and quickly discontinued. There are only two known 1968 Z-grills in existence one of which fetched $930,000 when it was sold in 1988. The world's most valuable object by weight: The Swedish Treskilling Yellow . In 2010, a Swedish 'Treskilling Yellow' broke the record for the most expensive stamp ever sold. It is believed that the rectangular treasure went for £1.6million, though it has never been confirmed. The world's most valuable object by weight, the first owner is said to have been a Swedish schoolboy, who found it in 1885 among a pile of letters left by his grandparents. The Treskilling Yellow is 'one of about a half dozen highly notorious stamps in the world,' according to noted U.S. stamp expert Robert Odenweller. Others include the 1856 British Guiana 1 cent Magenta which has been locked away in a vault since 1980 when it was bought for nearly one million US dollars by chemicals fortune heir John du Pont. Another is the 2 Penny Post Office Mauritius Blue that sold for £970,000 in 1993, it was one of the first stamps issued by the British colonial government. A series of rare Hawaiian stamps known as the 'Hawaiian Missionaries' which were printed from 1851 are also highly prized. They get their name from the fact they were used by American missionaries on the islands to send letters back to the continental United States.

Dozens of historic spitfires set to be dug up after they were discovered buried in the Burmese jungle could be flying again within three years, according to the man who spent 16 years searching for the planes. British farmer David Cundall, 62, spent over a decade and more than £130,000 of his own money working to track down the aircraft, after being told by a group of U.S. veterans they were buried there at the end of the Second World War. In January archaeologists will begin digging for the planes so they can be painstakingly packaged up and transported back to the UK for restoration, and Mr Cundall has said he believes the spitfires - which have been underground for 67 years - will take to the skies once more. Scroll down for video . David Cundall, from North Lincolnshire, has said he hopes the spitfires will fly at air shows in the future . Saved for posterity: The historic planes were buried in the Burmese jungle in August 1945 . At least 36 - and potentially as many as 60 - of the British fighter planes are believed to have been buried in the Burmese jungle towards the end of the Second World War in 1945. iN 1996 aviation enthusiast Mr Cundall, from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, was told the rare Marx XIV Spitfires were buried there in crates in August 1945. He subsequently spent two years researching the project, eventually gathering eight eye-witness reports backing up the claims. Surveys undertaken at one of three sites in Burma have indicated the presence of large areas of electrically conductive material around 10 metres beneath the surface of the ground. The location matches the eight eye-witness reports collected by Mr Cundall, who has made 16 visits to Burma over the years conducting surveys and negotiating with authorities. His project reached a landmark junction earlier this year when sanctions blocking the movement of military materials in and out of Burma were lifted, according to a report in The Daily Telegraph. 'Hopefully they will be brought back to the UK and will be flying at air shows,' he told the newspaper. 'We have had offers from British companies to restore them and put their logos on them which is acceptable to me. 'It should take two to three years to restore them so we should see something in the next three years or so,' he added. One of the Spitfires (pictured: the tail fins) being crated up in Burma in 1945 ready to be buried . In all three groups have been given permission to look for the planes, but only Mr Cundall - who eventually located the planes using ground penetrating radar equipment - was able to find anything. After being led to the area by an eye-witness, the farmer's team dug a borehole and sent a camera down to capture footage of the crates, which were found to be in 'really good condition'. Mr Cundall has now been given exclusive rights to all three sites under investigation in Burma. Andy Brockman, the archaeologist leading the January dig, said the team will removing and examining a layer of soil at a time. He said that, whatever the outcome of the project, the team would have a 'cracking story' to tell. An excavation agreement was signed last month by Mr Cundall, Burma's civil aviation chief Tin Naing Tun and . the Shwe Taung Paw company boss Htoo Htoo Zaw, Mr Cundall's partner in . the country . Mr Zaw said at the time: 'This will be the largest number of Spitfires in the world. We want to let people see those historic fighters.' Mr Cundall's treasure hunt was sparked . in 1996 by a throwaway remark from a group of U.S. veterans who said . they had once buried Spitfires in the Burmese jungle. The Spitfires, of which there are only . around 35 flying left in the world, were shipped to Burma and . transported by rail to the British RAF base in August 1945. A place in history: A poster unveiling the Spitfire from around 1939 . Mr Cundall persuaded the country's notoriously secretive regime to . allow him to search for the lost aircraft, winning their trust over several . visits. The married father-of-three doggedly . pieced together their possible location by speaking to the declining . number of Far East veterans . He said at the time: 'I’m only a small . farmer, I’m not a multi-millionaire and it has been a struggle. It took . me more than 15 years but I finally found them. 'Spitfires are beautiful aeroplanes . and should not be rotting away in a foreign land. They saved our neck in . the Battle of Britain and they should be preserved.' Permission to excavate the planes was granted because of the strengthening relations between London and Rangoon. In the past year, Burma has turned . away from the repressive policies of the previous military regime and . has taken a reforming democratic stance. A Downing Street spokesman said: 'We . hope that many of them will be gracing the skies of Britain and as . discussed, some will be displayed here in Burma.' Mr Cundall said the government had promised him it would not be making a claim for the aircraft. A law passed by the British when they . granted Burma independence in 1948 meant that anything left behind . automatically became the property of the Burmese government. Mr Cundall is understood to have struck a deal with the Burmese president to take 60 per cent of the profits.","Farmer David Cundall worked for 16 years to find where the planes were buried in crates .

Weighing her options: Hillary Clinton is likely to command hefty fees on the speaker circuit after she leaves her post as Secretary of State, though it is unclear if she will run for president again in 2016 . Should Hillary Clinton be the Democrat nominee for 2016? 'If their competitor in 2016 is Hillary Clinton, supported by Bill Clinton and presumably a still relatively popular President Barack Obama, trying to win that will be the Super Bowl. And the Republican party today is incapable of competing at that level,' Gingirch said during an appearance on Meet The Press. The assessment was particularly surprising considering that Gingrich and Bill Clinton famously sparred when they were rivals in the 1990s, and Gingrich was the one to push for the investigation of the then-President's affair with intern Monica Lewinsky. 'First of all, she's very formidable as a person. She's a very competent person. She's married to the most popular Democrat in the country; they both think (it) would be good for her to be president. It makes it virtually impossible to stop her for the nomination,' he said. His prediction is backed up by numbers, as a recent Washington Post poll reports that 57 per cent of Americans would support a Hillary Clinton campaign. According to multiple reports, Mrs Clinton has echoed her denials of plans to run for office in both private and public, but that doesn't mean that she can just go ahead and truly let loose in her new-found state of unemployment. With any and all positions that she decides to take, she will have to weigh the optics of if it would look appropriate for a presidential candidate. That said, another concern is shoring up a steady income, because it doesn't come cheap to live like the Clintons. The good life: The Clintons have been frequent visitors to the Hamptons in the summer, seen here this past August, though it is now thought that they may be buying a place there . Longtime fans: President Clinton (seen here in 1999) has previously rented homes and stayed with some of their famous friends- like Kate Capshaw and Stephen Spielberg . The New York Times . reports that one of her first moves out of office would be to look into . buying a home in the Hamptons, as she and former President Bill have . frequently vacationed in the tony beach getaway. A . home befitting two of the country's biggest political heavyweights . would easily run in the multi-million dollar range, any the couple are . known to enjoy the benefits of a lifestyle that allows private jet use. Much of her hesitation in deciding about 2016 comes from the failed bid in 2008, and it comes as little surprise that those mistakes are also influencing her financial decisions. As recently as September 30 of this year, Hillary still has $73,000 remaining of her campaign debt. Politico reported that her husband sent out multiple emails to supporters in hopes of earning back some of that money to have that number decreased- if not deleted- by this month. Aides to Mrs Clinton say a continued working partnership between she and Bill is one of the likely steps after she takes some immediate time off from her taxing travel schedule following her leave of office. The Clinton Foundation, which has occupied much of the former President's time since he left the White House, is seen as an ideal place for Hillary to ease her way back into public life and find a way to work on causes closest to her. Fighting for women's rights has always been at the top of her agenda, and it is considered a given that she will be working for that cause in some form for the rest of her career. Time together: Aides think that Hillary will spend some time working with her husband's foundation as she finds her footing outside of the constraints of formal political office for the first time in decades . Who knows: She reportedly thinks that one of her biggest mistakes in her last presidential bid was announcing too early, so if she goes for it again, she likely won't say so publicly until mid-2015 . Speaking engagements and a new book about her time as Secretary of State are two other options for the ways to fill the time- and her bank accounts- but the frankness of those potential opportunities will be limited if she does eventually decide to run for president again. If her words are being seen as keys to a possible political agenda, as opposed to candid reflections on her time as the American emissary abroad, she will be forced to leave the candor for private conversations. Realistically though, such a decision will not come for some time, as she has told insiders that one of the biggest mistakes she made in her last campaign was announcing her candidacy too early, effectively making the race longer and less manageable. That time, she announced two years before the election, so if she heeds her own advice, that means that she likely will not publicly discuss the option until mid-2015. For now, however, she continues to keep all of her options open- and decidedly vague. 'I’m frankly looking forward to returning to living a life that enjoys a lot of simple pleasures and gives me time for family and friends and other pursuits,' she said during her latest trip to Ireland.","Recent poll found outgoing Secretary of State with 57 per cent support .

Now, three decades on, the duo behind eighties classic Gregory’s Girl are living a somewhat quieter life, as a new documentary about their lives reveals. John Gordon Sinclair and Clare Grogan, now both aged 50, became Hollywood stars after the unlikely success of their coming of age film set in the town of Cumbernauld. Classic: Clare Grogan and John Gordon Sinclair in Gregory's Girl, released in 1981 . Thirty years on: The actors will appear in a documentary, which sees them going back to Abronhill High school . Soon they were partying with Spandau Ballet and being transported from hotel to hotel in a limo – all at the age of just 18. Speaking to the BBC, Grogan admitted they did not realise their luck in achieving instant success and said they ‘took it for granted’. She said: ‘It was the naivety of youth and the arrogance of youth as well. ‘All you really felt like was that wee person from Glasgow. From the moment I left school my life was extraordinary.’ The documentary takes them back to Abronhill High, the school now earmarked for closure where director Bill Forsyth shot the film. In the film, released in 1981, Gregory is infatuated with Dorothy (Dee Hepburn), the football team female striker, but it is Susan (Grogan) who is the girl he should be looking for. Sinclair, who had been a member of the Glasgow Youth Theatre, was not sure about taking the role as he had started as a trainee apprentice electrician when Forsyth offered him the part of Gregory. Original: A poster for the film that shot both actors to fame upon its release in 1981 . Grogan was working as a waitress, and was approached in a Glasgow restaurant by Forsyth who said he wanted her in his film. By this time Grogan was also enjoying success with her band Altered Images, which led to a string of hits including Happy Birthday and I Could Be Happy. The pair were living a superstar lifestyle hanging out with pop stars of the day such as Spandau Ballet and Wham. As they grew older, they carried on acting but also turned to writing, with Sinclair publishing crime thrillers and Grogan composing children’s stories. Grogan’s book, Tallulah and the Teen Stars, is written for her daughter Ellie to explain the joys and pitfalls of success. She said: ‘I wanted to explain to . Ellie that it was all right to have fantastic dreams and aim for them, . as long as you recognise there is some work involved in that.’ Sinclair’s first novel Seventy Times Seven is a crime thriller set in Northern Ireland and America. Naivete of youth: Miss Grogan admitted that the pair initially took their success 'for granted' He added he likes writing as it allows him to ‘call all the shots’ like a director and ‘play all the characters’ like an actor. Sinclair has also since won an Olivier award for the stage musical She Loves Me and starred in The Producers and made the Gregory’s Girl sequel in 1999. Next year he can be seen in Brad Pitt’s World War Z, which was partly filmed in Glasgow. Grogan, who appeared in shows such as Red Dwarf and EastEnders, will play the mother of Glasgow gangster in The Wee Man. She says that after filming finished on Gregory’s Girl all those years ago she felt ‘bereft’ and ‘wanted to keep it going’. Hepburn, meanwhile, went into broadcasting in Scotland, presenting It’s a Knockout and appearing in drama Crossroads.

A new phase of drilling for shale gas, which the Government hopes will revolutionise Britain’s energy supply, was given the go-ahead yesterday. The controversial technique of extracting the gas from subterranean rock – known as fracking – was suspended last year after it was believed to have caused two small earthquakes in Lancashire. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said new conditions had now been imposed to minimise the risk of seismic activity. Scroll down for video . However, he did recognise the environmental concerns of those living near shale gas wells, which could soon spring up in many parts of the country. Fears have been expressed over possible water pollution and nuisance from lorries transporting equipment, but Mr Davey pledged to address them. ‘It is essential that shale gas development should not come at the expense of local communities,’ he said. ‘Fracking must be safe and the public must be confident that it is safe. ‘We are strengthening the stringent regime already in place with new  controls around seismic risks. And as the industry develops we will remain vigilant to all emerging evidence to ensure the local environment is protected.’ Advocates of fracking – the process by which water and chemicals are pumped into shale deposits at high pressure to release trapped pockets of gas – say it will end our dependence on expensive imports and protect consumers from rising prices, as North Sea gas reserves dwindle. David Cameron this week backed the technology and said Britain should be at the heart of the shale ‘gas revolution’, claiming it could bring down the price of household energy bills. Lib Dem Mr Davey was more cautious yesterday, saying only that shale gas would hold down future gas price rises rather than slash them, as has happened in the US. Nearly two-thirds of the country could be sitting on estimated gas reserves of up to 300trillion cubic feet, according to industry experts – enough to supply Britain for 120 years. But it is not yet clear how much of the trapped gas is recoverable, with drilling so far restricted to Lancashire, where energy firm Cuadrilla Resources has dug four exploratory wells. When it announced its finds last year, Cuadrilla said it would drill up to 800 wells over 16 years and, if production was successful, it could create thousands of jobs and generate £5billion-£6billion in tax revenues. The Department of Energy and Climate Change has granted 176 exploration licences across Britain, although holders still require further consent before fracking can commence. It is thought fracking will not begin again until late March at the earliest because Cuadrilla will need to secure fresh planning permission for its wells. There is growing local concern about fracking in Lancashire, as well as other areas thought to be rich in shale gas such as Sussex and South Wales. The Campaign to Protect Rural England yesterday warned of a greater backlash if large areas of countryside were ‘transformed into industrial sites’ with a steady stream of lorries transporting gas and polluted water away from drilling sites. Controversial: Drilling in the Blackpool area last year caused a small earthquake but the Government wants to expand the use of fracking in Britain . Paul Miner, the CPRE’s senior planning officer, said: ‘The Government doesn’t appear to have recognised the potential for major landscape damage, or the need to properly consider this at the local level.’ The rural splendour of George Osborne’s constituency in Cheshire could be blighted by his enthusiasm for shale gas exploration. Tatton . includes unspoilt countryside, the historic towns of Knutsford and . Wilmslow, and villages such as Alderley Edge – said to have more . millionaires per square mile than anywhere else in the country. Professor . Peter Styles of Keele University said the rocks in Tatton are of . interest to energy firms as they are from the same period as those in . Lancashire, where exploratory drilling suggests there could be enough . shale gas to power Britain for decades. He added shale gas exploration . requires ‘around a football pitch worth of land’ per site. A . report from the Royal Academy of Engineering also lists Cheshire as an . area of interest for ‘fracking’ – the technique used to extract the gas. But . exploration in the area could be opposed by residents, who have been . swift to protest against threats to the countryside in the past . Concerns have also been raised that fracking could pose a threat to Bath’s world-famous hot springs if a test-drill for gas was allowed in the area by the local authority. In the US, households near to wells have complained of increased traffic and polluted water supplies. But the Institute of Directors stressed that if the environmental fears could be allayed, shale gas offered great potential for the future. Its senior economic adviser Corin Taylor said the UK’s energy mix must include more gas, along with green energy and nuclear power, to meet carbon targets. And energy minister John Hayes added that the Government had taken ‘the very best’ scientific advice on fracking and said: ‘We have out every safeguard in place; this is the most rigorous regime in the world, I think.’ However, some in Mr Davey’s party remain unconvinced that shale gas will provide the predicted energy revolution. A senior Lib Dem source told the Daily Mail: ‘There is no principled objection to shale gas. But all these Tories calling for it could be in for a rude awakening. 'Shale gas wells will generate a lot of traffic and disruption. It could make objections to onshore wind look like a picnic.’ Environmentalists fear a ‘dash for gas’ could also prevent Britain meeting its climate change targets. But Mr Davey said these would be met, despite resumption of fracking. He said: ‘Shale gas represents a promising new potential energy resource for the UK. It could contribute significantly to our energy security, reducing our reliance on imported gas.’ The new controls will include a ‘traffic light system’, requiring operators to stop if seismic activity reaches 0.5 on the Richter scale. An industry source said: ‘The new threshold is very conservative – it’s the equivalent of a large vehicle driving past on the road.’ Last year protestors attached themselves to the Cuadrilla shale gas exploration site near Hesketh Bank in Lancashire . So how serious are the environmental concerns? By David Derbyshire . Shale gas could become the greatest contribution to Britain’s energy supplies since the North Sea boom of the 1970s. But those against fracking say the environmental consequences outweigh the benefits. So what are those concerns and how serious are they? Earthquakes . Much has been made of the suspension of exploratory fracking at Blackpool last year after two small quakes of Richter scale magnitude 1.5 and 2.2 were recorded. The Cuadrilla drilling company said that its operations were probably responsible. But they were too minor to do any damage – and according to the British Geological Survey there were nine tremors in the UK of the same magnitude in the past two months alone. A follow-up study by the Department for Energy and Climate Change concluded that the risk of earthquakes caused by fracking was low, and structural damage to buildings, bridges and roads was extremely unlikely. POLLUTION . Millions of gallons of water and chemicals are forced into the ground during fracking operations, and there are concerns that some of the residue could leak into the water table. However, Parliament’s Energy Select Committee says there is little risk to water supplies in the UK, as long as the drilling is done correctly. Anger: Demonstrators hold placards in front of their mock fracking rig in protest outside the Houses of Parliament . Leaks . in America have been caused by badly maintained wells which haven’t . been lined properly. British supporters of shale gas development say . rules are tougher here. US . companies are also allowed to store dirty water from fracking wells in . open tanks, whereas in Britain fracking companies will have to store the . water in sealed containers on site. Concerns . have also been expressed about chemicals leaking from gas wells into . underground water aquifers and reaching the domestic supply. However, . most fracking is done thousands of feet deep – far below the water . table. Energy Secretary Ed Davey made a statement to Parliament on the Government's new policy on shale gas . US . protesters have complained about methane getting into their drinking . water. Again, the industry says this was caused by bad fracking. If . wells are lined, there is no reason why methane should escape. THREAT TO THE LANDSCAPE . The Department of Energy and Climate Change says nearly two thirds of Britain lies over shale gas reserves. If the predicted boom materialises, gas wells could spring up across the countryside. While they are not as imposing as wind farms, pylons or power stations, this would represent some industrialisation of rural Britain. Cuadrilla concedes that drilling and fracking rigs would be visible from a distance, but would be on site for only a few months. After that, they say wells could be screened from view. NUISANCE . Fleets of lorries will be needed to bring in excavation, drilling and storage equipment to create the well, and to bring the sand and chemicals for the fracking process. In the short term, shale gas would also be taken away by lorries, though it is cheaper to pipe it out. Over time, however, gas companies will almost certainly create a network of new gas pipes. THE BENEFITS . In America, fracking has slashed domestic gas prices and there could be similar major effects on household energy bills in the UK. David Cameron believes shale gas will eventually bring down prices here. Energy Secretary Ed Davey is a little more cautious, however, saying only that it will hold price increases down – but even that would be a relief to the long-suffering consumer. What is beyond doubt is that shale gas would reduce our reliance on imports, particularly those from Russia.The UK could also reduce reliance on piped gas from overseas by investing in desperately needed storage. In environmental terms, shale gas is deemed to be cleaner than coal and oil, though slightly less clean than North Sea gas.

"By . Charles Sale . PUBLISHED: . 17:54 EST, 12 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:51 EST, 13 December 2012 . English football will introduce quotas for referees and coaches as part of an unprecedented campaign to tackle racism. The plan will be adopted early in the new year and include the demand that at least 10 per cent of entry level officials and coaches throughout the game are from ethnic minorities. There will also be moves to increase the involvement of women, ethnic minorities and disabled people in all forms of football, while Asian role models will be sought to encourage Asian children to play the game. Confidential hotlines will be set up for players to report any form of bullying and discrimination, and fans will be able to text, email or maybe even tweet their complaints about any form of racism. Race disgrace: John Terry (covering mouth) was banned for abusing Anton Ferdinand . The Professional Footballers’ Association will support the FA proposal of a minimum five-game ban for racist abuse. PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said: ‘We want to illustrate the seriousness of our approach to this issue.’ In addition, the latest video and . audio technology will be used to identify supporters guilty of racist . gestures or chanting at matches. The . far-reaching plan comes after a period in which football has been . scarred by the racist behaviour of John Terry and Luis Suarez, and by . the false accusation of racial abuse levelled at referee Mark . Clattenburg. The extent of the fight against racism can be revealed by Sportsmail, who have seen the FA’s 92-point Football Inclusion and Anti-Discrimination Action Plan. FA chairman David Bernstein has also given his personal guarantee in a letter to Culture Secretary Maria Miller, copied to Prime Minister David Cameron, that all the recommendations will be carried out once they have been rubber-stamped by football’s stakeholders. The anti-racism education process being introduced will not just involve cultural lessons for overseas players and managers coming to England. All sections of the game, including match stewards, will be given advice on how best to combat discrimination and the procedures to follow when it happens. The FA will also establish an Inclusion Advisory Board to provide guidance on all equality matters and monitor the implementation of the plan. Flashpoint: Luis Suarez (left) was in an ugly clash with Patrice Evra last season . The document has been distributed to all 92 League clubs, who will be expected to sign the charter for action against homophobia and transphobia launched by the Government last year. Contracts with players and managers will have a mandatory reference to behaving in an inclusive and non-discriminatory manner. A timetable has been set out as far ahead as the 2017-18 season as to when the 92 points will be implemented. They start this month with the football organisations publicising the roles and responsibilities of each body — FA, Premier League, Football League, clubs, League Managers’ Associations,  Professional Footballers’  Association and County FAs — in promoting inclusion and dealing with discrimination in football. Also beginning immediately is the FA mandate that the proportion of ethnic minority coaches starting at the lowest level of qualification does not fall below 10 per cent. And by season 2015-16: ‘The FA in conjunction with county FAs will ensure that 10 per cent of the  referee workforce is from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic  communities, which is reflective of national demographics.’ Shirt shrift: Manchester City's Joleon Lescott refuses to wear a Kick It Out top . The proposals are the FA’s response to . the Prime Minister calling for the game to take tougher action after an . anti-racism-in-football summit last February. Bernstein is making the fight against racism his personal FA legacy before he stands down next May. In his letter to Miller he writes: ‘Let me give you my own personal reassurance that this is an issue at the very top of my agenda. ‘It is one that I know we are all determined to address both speedily and collaboratively subject to the approvals processes of our respective organisations. ‘There is no doubt that recent events have brought into sharp relief the impact that race and other forms of discrimination can still have on the game. Incidents involving high-profile players cast a shadow over the sport and can undermine much of the collective good work achieved. ‘Despite the substantial progress English football has made in this area over many years we fully recognise that the work to eliminate discrimination based on race, ethnic origin, colour and nationality is still not complete.’ Official inquiry: The FA want more non-white referees to follow Uriah Rennie . Bernstein was referring to the Terry, Suarez and Clattenburg cases and the FA plan seeks to prevent any repetition. The hotline strategy follows Jason Roberts’ complaints about some black players not trusting the authorities to fight racism. To counter that lack of faith in the authorities, the planned support structure will ‘ensure those who wish to report incidents of discrimination or bullying within the game, whether trainees, players, coaches, managers, other employees or fans, can do so in confidence and receive the support they may require’. Ironically Bernstein also puts on record his strong support for anti-racism group Kick It Out, whose chairman Lord Ouseley has  threatened to quit the FA Council in protest at their ‘mealy- mouthed’ response to the Terry and Suarez issues. The recommendations may be tweaked after feedback from stakeholders. But they are broadly expected to be introduced following club meetings next February. It is envisaged that the final version will be presented in a ‘more user friendly and punchy format’. Crackdown: Chelsea banned this supporter for making a gesture at Manchester United's Danny Welbeck . Other key proposals include: . The FA are not just attempting to eradicate racism in their grand plan. The commitment is to ‘promote inclusion and eliminate discrimination whether by reason of race, nationality, ethnic origin, colour, age, gender, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, marital status, religion or belief, ability or disability’.","The FA will introduce ethnic quotas for referees and coaches early in the new year .

'Filled with grief for the loss of my . close friend and teammate, Jerry Brown. I am also grief-stricken for his . family, friends and all who were blessed enough to have known him. 'I will live with this horrific and . tragic loss every day for the rest of my life. My prayers are with his . family, our teammates and his friends at this time.' It marked the second straight week the NFL found itself dealing with a tragedy right before gameday. Last Saturday, Kansas City Chiefs . linebacker Jovan Belcher fatally shot his girlfriend before killing . himself in front of his coach and general manager. The 25-year-old . Belcher shot himself in the parking lot at the team's practice complex . at Arrowhead Stadium. Crash: Tire skid marks are seen leaving the road where the car driven by Dallas Cowboys player Josh Brent crashed on Saturday morning. His teammate Jerry Brown was killed in the accident . Officers conducted a field sobriety . test on Brent and arrested him on suspicion of driving while . intoxicated, Argumaniz said. The charge, a second-degree felony . punishable by two to 20 years in prison, was upgraded after Brown was . pronounced dead.

Starkey was jailed in October 2008 after he admitted wounding with intent and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. It emerged following the shooting Gee, who had sent a text message to Starkey offering not to speak to police in exchange for £20,000, was plotting revenge within hours of being injured. When a policeman went to speak to him about his injuries Gee said: 'I fell over mate' then winked and added: 'But don't worry I'll get the little c***.' 'There is no doubt that this was a targeted shooting and that whoever did this meant to kill Jamie Starkey.' Ch Supt Jon Ward . Then in a call to Starkey's mobile just hours after he returned home from hospital after being shot, Gee is alleged to have said: 'All be ready cos one of yers is getting killed. We are not going there, you stupid little tools, you haven't got a clue... we are going to one your girl's ma's or anything first. You little w******. They are going first.' Adding: 'We are going to deal with every one of them until we get yous.' Police who bugged his plush flat to trap him over his drug deals, also recorded phone calls which showed Gee conspiring to buy guns and threatening to kill Starkey. Officers overheard him plotting revenge against Starkey and referring to a '45' and a Mac 10 machine gun. In a conversation with his partner Gee was heard saying: 'Don't worry the little f***** is going ... the only place he is safe is in jail and he won't be safe there .... it'll be even worse in there ...than he is out. I'll slit his f****** throat.' The next day he is alleged to have said: 'Put me in for 12 guns ... I'll buy the lot of them.' And in further conversations he went on: 'We're going lad, we're going big time ... right through the front door, right through the back door and bring this family down, kids whatever... all right lad, see you soon lad.' In 2010 Gee was found guilty of two counts of threats to kill and another two of blackmail and was told to serve a minimum of four and a half years concurrently to the term he is serving for drug dealing.

A council leader believed to have shot his wife dead before turning the gun on himself is set to be buried alongside her in a funeral at the church where they held their wedding. Keith Johnson and his wife Andrea are pictured here signing the marriage register in 2004 at St Peter and St Paul Church in Cromer, Norfolk - the place where they will be laid to rest next week. The victim's parents say they feel 'no animosity' towards their son-in-law even though he is thought to be responsible for their daughter's death. Wedding day: Keith and Andrea Johnson getting married at the Cromer parish church in 2004 . Police believe the 68-year-old North Norfolk District Council leader killed his 44-year-old wife on December 2 outside their home in Roughton, near Cromer. Mr Johnson was found with a shotgun by his side and is thought to have made a telephone call to friends before taking his own life. But despite the circumstances, Mrs Johnson's parents John and Janice Chadwick insisted that the couple should have a joint funeral. 'We have no animosity against Keith or anyone,' Mrs Chadwick said. 'It was a spur of the moment thing.' Couple: Mr Johnson shot his wife dead before turning the gun on himself on December 2 . A notice was published today in the Eastern Daily Press confirming that the Johnsons would be buried together, with members of both families uniting under one roof. The notice states that Mr Johnson was the 'dearly-loved son of Joyce and the late Ted', adding that his mother is 'broken-hearted' after his death. 'To honour Andrea's vibrant personality, her family requests that those who attend her funeral wear an article of brightly coloured clothing,' it continues. 'She was a beloved daughter, sister, auntie and nana and will be deeply missed by those she left behind.' The couple are said to have very popular, and a large crowd of mourners is expected to attend the ceremony.

Nicknamed 'Johnny Football,' Manziel kissed the trophy during a ceremony at the Best Buy Theater in New York's Times Square. 'I have been dreaming about this since I was a kid, running around the backyard pretending I was Doug Flutie, throwing Hail Marys to my dad,' he said after hugging his parents and kid sister.

A mover and a shaker: Manziel, seen in this file photo from September 15, uis known for turning plays that looked doomed to fail into touchdowns . Flutie was one of many Heisman winners standing behind Manziel as he gave his speech. 'It's such an honor to represent . Texas A&M, and my teammates here tonight. I wish they could be on . the stage with me,' he said with a wide smile, concluding his speech . like any good Aggie: 'Gig' em.' Just a few days after turning 20, . Manziel proved times have truly changed in college football, and that . experience can be really overrated. His Twitter followers have jumped from just under 100,000 a few days ago to more than 140,000 today - and counting. Honor: Manziel poses for photographers with the Heisman after he was announced as the winner . Manziel tweeted last night: ‘Such a special night I cannot even put it into words. Such a blessing and an absolute dream come true! Aggieland I love you all!!' Manziel's the second player from . Texas A&M to win the Heisman, joining John David Crow from 1957, and . did so without the slightest hint of preseason hype. What's more impressive is that he didn't even win the starting quarterback job until two weeks before the season. 'I always wanted to be in a fraternity,' Manziel said. 'Now I get to be in the most prestigious one in the entire world.' Sealed with a kiss: Manziel smooches the Heisman Trophy after becoming the first freshman to win the college football award . At 6-foot-1 and 200 pounds, Manziel is . master of the unexpected, darting here and there, turning plays . seemingly doomed to failure into touchdowns. With daring runs and elusive . improvisation, Manziel broke 2010 Heisman winner Cam Newton's . Southeastern Conference record with 4,600 total yards, led the Aggies to . a 10-2 in their first season in the SEC and orchestrated an upset at . then-No. 1 Alabama in November that stamped him as legit. He has thrown for 3,419 yards and 24 . touchdowns and run for 1,181 yards and 19 more scores to become the . first freshman, first SEC player and fifth player overall to throw for . 3,000 yards and run for 1,000 in a season. 'You can put his numbers up against anybody who has ever played the game,' Texas A&M coach Kevin Sumlin said. Manziel has one more game this season, when the No. 10 Aggies play Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl on January 4. Prestige: The Heisman Trophy is displayed before it was awarded to Johnny Manziel . As for the Heisman, Manziel said he'd like to keep it right next to his bed. 'But I'm in college. A lot of people . come through the house. We live in a college neighborhood. It might not . be a good idea. If I can get a case that's indestructible, locked and . looks pretty good, we'll see where I keep it,' he said. Manziel competed with two other . quarterbacks to replace Ryan Tannehill - who went on to join the Miami . Dolphins - as the starter this season, the Aggies' first in the SEC and . first under Sumlin. Manziel came out of spring practice as the backup, but became the starter in August. Still, nobody was hailing him is the next big thing. Did Sumlin think he had a Heisman winner on his hands? 'No,' he said emphatically, adding, 'Not this year.' Then Manziel started playing and the numbers started piling up. He also had some struggles against . Florida in the season opener and in a home loss to LSU. The question . was: Could he do his thing against a top-notch opponent? Unstoppable force: At 6-foot-1 and 200 pounds, Manziel is master of the unexpected . The answer came in Tuscaloosa, . Alabama, on November 10. Going into the matchup against the Crimson . Tide, Manziel said he and his teammates heard a lot of doubters. 'You can't do this and you can't do that,' he recalled Saturday at the podium. Manziel passed for 253 yards, ran for . 92 and the Aggies beat the Tide 29-24. Kansas State quarterback Collin Klein, who was also in the Heisman running, had been the front-runner . for most of the season, but Manziel surged after beating 'Bama. Still, Manziel was still something of . a mystery man. Sumlin's rules prohibit freshmen from being available to . the media. Manziel was off-limits, but not exactly silent. Manziel gave glimpses of himself on . social media - including some memorable pictures of him dressed up as . Scooby-Doo for Halloween with some scantily clad young women. Romantically, he's linked to fellow A&M student Sarah Savage, who posted photos of herself by Manziel's side with the Heisman on the photo-sharing site Instagram. Miss Savage has a background in modeling, and is represented by the Julie Freeman Agency, according to SlimCelebrity.com. Before he became a celebrity, Manziel got himself into some serious trouble. In June, he was arrested in College Station after police said he was involved in a fight and produced a fake ID. He was charged with disorderly conduct and two other misdemeanors. Love interest: Romantically, Manziel's linked to fellow A&M student Sarah Savage, who posted photos of herself with Manziel and the Heisman on the photo sharing site Instagram .

Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o finished a distant second in the voting and Klein was third. In a Heisman race with two nontraditional candidates, Manziel broke through the class ceiling and kept Te'o from becoming the first purely defensive player to win the award. 'That barrier's broken now,' Manziel said. 'It's starting to become more of a trend that freshmen are coming in early and that they are ready to play. And they are really just taking the world by storm.' Manziel drew 474 first-place votes and 2,029 points from the panel of media members and former winners.

Guilty: Patrick Moran, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault in Washington on Wednesday morning . The girlfriend of a Congressman's son has told police he did not attack her and instead she broke her nose after falling when her high heel snapped. Her claim is despite the fact her boyfriend, Patrick Moran, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault in Washington on Wednesday morning. The 23-year-old son of Democratic Virginia Rep. Jim Moran, had reportedly been dating Kelly Hofmann for six months when the incident took place at outside a bar earlier this month. According to a court document, seen by the Washington Examiner on December 1, a police officer outside the Getaway at 1400 Meridian Place NW observed Moran 'grab a white female by the back of her head with his hand and slam her head into the metal trash can cage in front of the nightclub.' The female identified herself as Kelly . Hofmann and said the pair had been drinking heavily and arguing inside . the bar about Moran talking to another woman. After the incident at 1:23am, Ms Hofmann was bleeding from her nose, and her right eye was 'extremely swollen,' the report said. An ambulance technician told police her injuries looked like a broken nose and skull fracture under her right eye and Ms Hofmann was taken to Howard University Hospital. Patrick Moran - police report . But on Wednesday Ms Hofmann released a statement contradicting the police report: . 'This was an accident that has been blown out of proportion. The statements in the police report are inaccurate. Pat and I were arguing, one of my high heels gave out, and I fell into the side of a trashcan. On impact, I fractured my nose. False conclusions were made as a result. I hope our privacy will be respected.' A source close to Rep. Moran told ARLnow.com said . that Ms Hofmann did not press charges and testified in Morans' defense . adding that she suffered from no broken bones and is back at work. Accusations: Patrick Moran, the 23-year-old son of Democratic Virginia Rep. Jim Moran, pictued, had reportedly been dating Kelly Hofmann for six months when the incident took place at outside a bar earlier this month . Moran’s court-appointed attorney, Gretchen Franklin, told the Washington Post that the couple were still together and that prosecutors declined to dismiss the case even though Hofmann wanted them to. Patrick Moran is one of Jim Moran's four children and in a statement to Washington City Paper, Rep. Moran described his son and his girlfriend as 'good kids.' 'I hope their privacy will be respected,' the congressman said. 'They look forward to putting this embarrassing situation behind them.' His office released the following statement about the incident: 'The Congressman strongly condemns domestic violence. As was stated in court by both his son Patrick and his girlfriend Kelly, the situation was an accident. Scene: On December 1, a police officer outside the Getaway at 1400 Meridian Place NW, pictured, observed Moran 'grab a white female by the back of her head with his hand and slam her head into the metal trash can cage in front of the nightclub' 'They were the only two people involved in the scene. In that sense, their statements are the only ones that matter. 'They are both very embarrassed by the situation, which involved drinking, and they are looking to move past it, and ask for their privacy to be respected.' Although he was originally charged . for felony domestic violence assault, Moran got off on simple assault . and was sentenced to probation. A D.C. Superior Court judge suspended a 90-day jail term and sentenced Moran to one year’s probation. He will also have to complete domestic-violence counseling and 50 hours of community service. Caught in the act: The video shows Patrick Moran discussing how to cast fraudulent ballots . It is not the first time this year that Moran has hit the headlines - in October he was forced to resign from his father's re-election campaign after he was caught on video discussing a plan to cast fraudulent ballots. Patrick Moran had been a field director for his father's campaign. The resignation came hours after Project Veritas, an organization led by activist James O'Keefe, released a video showing an undercover operative pitching a voter-fraud plan to Patrick Moran. In the past Jim Moran, who has represented Northern Virginia in Congress since 1991. has also been accused of domestic violence. His second wife, Mary Howard Moran, called the police on her then-husband in 1999, claiming that he'd hit her, although no charges were filed over the alleged assault.","Patrick Moran, is son of Democratic Virginia Rep.

Japans foreign ministry said the incident happened in the morning but the non-military Y-12 aircraft had left by the time they arrived. The islands have been at the centre of a territorial dispute since the islands were bought by the Japanese government in September. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said: 'I want to stress that these activities are completely normal. 'The Diaoyu and its affiliated islands are China's inherent territory since ancient times. 'China requires the Japanese side stop illegal activities in the waters and airspace of the Diaoyu islands.' It was the first time a Chinese plane had entered Japanese airspace over the disputed islands, as the two previous reported violations were by other nations, in 1979 by a Soviet plane and in 1994 by a plane from Taiwan, defence agency official Takashi Inoue said.

But the festive competition of putting up Christmas lights outside the two homes led to a ‘keeping up with the Joneses’ response from the rest of the Dorset cul-de-sac. Now Runton Road in Poole has been dubbed Britain’s most festive street due to its spectacular Christmas light display - and the electricity board says the local grid 'takes a bit of a hit' when it is turned on every day at dusk. Every year this quiet cul-de-sac in Dorset is lit up in a blaze of festive light, earning it the unofficial title of Britain's most festive street . Santa's little helpers: The festive residents in Runton Road have been putting up the display for more than 15 years . Nearly all of the 50 houses in the street are lit up at this time of year with flashing bulbs, singing Santas, giant inflatable snowmen, model reindeer, sleighs and trains. The dazzling display can be seen from half-a-mile away and attracts thousands of visitors from miles around. The cost of running the display adds . roughly £50 onto every household’s electricity bill and there are . thousands of individual Christmas lights in the street. One house has even brought in a snow machine to turn their lawn into a carpet of white while another household blasts out carols from loudspeakers. A spokesman from Southern Electric says there is a noticeable drain when the switch is flicked at Runton Road. He said: 'We do notice a spike as there's a considerable draw on power but the local distribution network will handle that.' The dazzling display can be seen from half-a-mile away and the electricity board say the local grid 'takes a bit of a hit' when it is turned on every day at dusk. The suburban street is crammed with hundreds of visitors a night who flock from as far away as Wales, Oxford and London to see the lights. Up to 100 cars have been known to queue around the block to reach the road and police have had to put out traffic cones in the past. To the local taxi drivers who drop the sightseers off, Runton Road is called Christmas Street as that is what it has become widely known as to their passengers. Nearly all of the 50 houses in Runton Road are lit up every Christmas, making it an annual tourist attraction . The electricity board say the local network 'takes a bit of a hit' when they are turned on at dusk . The stunning show began almost 20 years ago when neighbours Chris Smith, 61, and Bob Cowe, 71, got the ball rolling. Ever since more and more residents have joined in the friendly competition. Mr Smith said: 'It started when Bob put a table decoration in his window. 'A few days later I was in a shop and found a string of lights and bought them to put over the arch of our door. 'Another one of our neighbours did the same and over the years it has just grown and has escalated to virtually the whole street. 'Now we have to do it otherwise we will get told off by people who come to expect it. 'As you get older it becomes a bit of a chore getting up and down the ladder but it’s well worth it. 'It’s just fantastic to see how many people come to have a look in the days before Christmas.' Homeowners on the street are enthusiastic about their dazzling homes, but not everyone embraces it quite as much as others, as this picture shows . One of the residents of Runton Road is an electrician who has to take time of work in December as he is in great demand by his neighbours. The project is so vast that residents have their own switch on ceremony in the second week of December, including carols, mulled wine and a guided tour of the road. This year the ceremony was watched by five million television viewers on the BBC programme The One Show. Tom Brown, 63, who is retired, has been putting up Christmas lights outside his house for the last 20 years. Dazzling: The display adds roughly £50 to each household's electricity bill . He moved to Runton Road six years ago and was pleasantly surprised when he saw his new neighbours shared his enthusiasm for the festive season. Mr Brown said: 'It’s great and we all get a lot of fun out of it. 'It’s worth it when you see people outside with the smiles on their faces, it really is a lovely thing. 'This has just grown bigger and bigger over the years and we all take it pretty seriously. 'I think my display is probably the best, but then I would say that wouldn’t I? 'But when the whole road is all lit up like this it looks fantastic.' Mick Phillips, 58, introduced a snow machine this year which has proved a massive hit with his neighbours. He said: 'I’ve been doing it for about 20 years. You feel you have to do something bigger and better every year.'","Dorset cul-de-sac has been branded 'Britain's most festive street'

Television cook and author Sandra Lee  marched out of Bergdorf Goodman restaurant  thinking she had overheard offensive comments about her 'semi-homemade' empire, according to a diner. The 46-year-old was at BG restaurant when she reportedly picked up on remarks made by the new boyfriend of Calvin Klein’s ex Nick Gruber. Gruber who was dining with new partner John Luciano on Tuesday evening, did not recognise the celebrity chef when she waked into the restaurant. Ms Lee's vast Semi-Homemade empire is all based around her concept of culinary shortcuts - a typical recipe uses 70 per cent store-bought food and 30 per cent fresh produce. Luciano told the New York Post that he proceeded to explain to Gruber what Ms Lee was famous for:  'She takes an angel food cake, slices it in half, opens a can of . frosting, frosts the cake, calls it semi-homemade, and makes a lot of . money.' But he said his comments were overheard by Ms Lee who took immediate offence and complained to the manager of the New York restaurant. 'She said she was going to walk around the restaurant to find out who . it was,' Luciano told the paper. Luciano said that Ms Lee, whose boyfriend is New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, mistakenly confronted a group of confused Italian tourists, saying, 'I’m Sandra Lee, I have feelings, too.'

After 20 cookbooks, two cooking shows, a magazine and a memoir, Ms Lee's Semi-Homemade brand was built upon the concept that anyone can feed their family using pre-packaged goods with a little bit of imagination. Raised by an abusive, drug-addicted mother, by the age of 12, Ms Lee was responsible for raising her four siblings on welfare and food stamps. When asked by The New York Times earlier this year what she thought of the people who criticise her for using processed food in her recipes, Ms Lee responded: 'I think they’re snobs. I’m not sure that some of the food purists are in touch with what really goes on in American households.' She continued: 'It’s shtick. That’s how some people get their press. There are 17 million children in this country going hungry every day, and we’re worried about my Kwanzaa cake from 10 years ago? That’s what I think is ridiculous.'

X Factor bosses are 'tearing up the format' of ITV's flagship show after a string of disastrous viewing figures, with Sunday's final drawing its worst audience for seven years. According to reports, ITV bosses are set to hold emergency talks with Simon Cowell in anticipation of a complete overhaul of the show's format and judging panel. Despite putting more money into the show's budget, ratings have halved in two years, and now show chiefs are said to be planning a 'back to basics' approach. Revamp: It's been reported that the ITV1 is set to go back to basic for the 10th series . The X Factor's ratings slide continued with Sunday's final pulling in 2 million fewer viewers than last year. Crisis: Simon Cowell is set to sit down and talk through what's next for The X Factor with ITV in the new year following poor ratings . Figures from ITV show that Sunday . night's two-hour programme, which was won by James Arthur, had an . average audience of 11.1 million compared with the 13.1 million who . watched Little Mix win in 2011. And on Saturday the first part of the . X Factor final - eventually won by James Arthur, 24, had its worst . audience for seven years as it failed to beat rival Strictly Come . Dancing again. X . Factor attracted an average audience of 9.5 million for the first stage . of the final - the lowest audience since 2005 when 9.2 million watched . Shayne Ward win the show. The . ITV1 show trailed its BBC1 rival by 1.3 million viewers and it is . especially embarrassing for The X Factor chiefs because Strictly is . still two weeks away from hosting its own final. Now bosses are said to be planning to axe the arena auditions in favour of a more low-key approach. The new format will include shifting . the start of next year's show to the weekend after children return to . school in order to make it more popular with a younger audience. According to The Sun newspaper, . Saturday's shows are set to start earlier to avoid the dip in ratings . after 10pm. On the chopping board: According to a source Gary Barlow and Tulisa Contostavlos could be removed from the judging panel as Cowell plans to rejig things . A production source said: 'It doesn’t take a genius to work out that the show is not in the best health. 'We have had some very strong singers this year but the show is feeling in need of a reboot.' While another insider claims that Cowell could return to the show as a judge solely during the live shows.. Judges Gary Barlow and Tulisa Contostavlos are said to be favourites to face the chop in a cull of the judging panel. Not winning: This year the final had its worst audience for seven years on Saturday night - and it failed to beat rival Strictly Come Dancing . And one report claimed Cheryl Cole was . set to return to the X Factor to give the show a boost. No chance: Cheryl Cole will not be returning to the show that unceremoniously dumped her . But this was categorically denied by the Girls Aloud's singer's spokesperson. This sounded even more unlikely against the backdrop of Cheryl's $1.4million lawsuit against the U.S. X Factor blindsided show bosses. A source close to Cowell said: ‘This is a . bolt from the blue. Simon thought he’d patched things up with Cheryl. But now she’s attacking when the show is weak.' In Sunday's live final James, was speechless as he learned that he had gained more votes than runner up Jahmene Douglas. He said: 'Thank you, thank you so much. Have I really won? Wow. I don't know what to say.' Jahmene praised the winner and told Dermot: 'It's such a blessing to even share a stage with such a talent, he's my idol.' The Middlesbrough-born star, who won with 54 percent of the public vote, was presented with his winner's single, a cover of Shontelle's Impossible. A spokeswoman for the show said: 'The . series has only just ended but of course we'll review the production, as . we do with all our long-running shows.

Fight: Alex Miller, 25, is the blonde at the centre of a love triangle that saw a City firm's Christmas party descend into a violent brawl . This is the blonde at the centre of a love triangle that saw a City firm’s Christmas party descend into a violent brawl. Alex Miller, 25, inadvertently triggered the mayhem when her stockbroker fiancé Robert Nicolson, 27, was told she had cheated on him with one of his colleagues. Dozens of bankers looked on in horror as Nicolson angrily confronted unsuspecting IT worker Anthony Field, igniting an ugly scuffle that tore through the packed Queen Of Hoxton cocktail bar in Shoreditch, east London. Mr Field was left with two black eyes and facial injuries while Nicolson and at least two friends were arrested by police. Yesterday, Nicolson admitted affray but was cleared of assault after a three-day trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court. Friends said an explosion of publicity around the case had sent party-loving London worker Miss Miller ‘into hiding’. One said she moved out of the £200,000 home the couple shared in Grays, Essex, a few months after the punch-up. He added: ‘We have not seen her for months. She still goes out but it is with a different crowd. No one wants to mention what happened.’ The brawl took place when staff from City financial house Brewin Dolphin gathered for a Christmas party last December. Nicolson noticed his then fiancée was crying and was told by a friend that she had slept with a colleague. Mr Field was pointed out and Nicolson stormed over and grabbed him, starting a sprawling fight involving up to six other men, including Nicolson’s colleague Gary Jones, 33, who admitted smashing a glass bottle over the IT worker’s head. Another co-worker, Graham Sutherland, a 27-year-old data analyst of Holloway, north London, was cleared of throwing one or two punches. Nicolson said that he initially confronted Mr Field, who he claimed responded by headbutting and punching him. Giving evidence, Mr Field insisted that he had not known Miss Miller was Nicolson’s fiancée before the fight. Judge Joanna Korner QC told Nicolson he will probably receive a community penalty when he returns to be sentenced next Thursday. Directing the jury to clear him of the more serious charge of assault, she said: ‘The harm itself seems to have been caused by the other people who laid in. 'He certainly never got anywhere near Mr Field. 'On that evidence, it seems to me as a matter of law his behaviour is not very good but that’s not the same as there being evidence he committed either of the two counts charged.’ Anger: Alex Miller, 25, inadvertently triggered the mayhem when her stockbroker fiancé Robert Nicolson, 27, left,  was told she had cheated on him.  Another co-worker, Graham Sutherland, right,  was cleared of throwing one or two punches .

A job description for a lowly internship at the London office of book publisher Dalkey Archive Press has revealed a ridiculous lists of demands that makes Meryl Streep's demanding boss in The Devil Wears Prada appear tame by comparison. The company, which publishes . avant-garde and experimental books, is currently seeking . 'unpaid interns' to work in it’s London office, although 'one or two people may be appointed with short-term paid contracts.’ The . long and rambling job description posted on the publisher's website features a long list of demands and requires perspective employees to sacrifice all personal and professional commitments including holidays or weddings to attend in Rio, to focus on the unpaid work. The job description for an internship at Dalkey Archive Press makes it sound like an even more extreme version of The Devil Wears Prada . An internship at a book publishing . company sounds like a dream job for many young graduates, but the job description posted by Dalkey Archive Press . on Wednesday might be enough to make even the most desperate of . aspiring literary-nerds think twice about what they might be getting . into. Demanding internships and entry-level jobs in . competitive industries have been dramatized for storylines in TV shows . such as HBO series Girls and the movie The Devil Wears Prada. However . those stories about demanding bosses and poorly paid roles don't hold a . candle to the demands being made by Dalkey Archive Press. The job description starts by asking for interests you might typically expect from a . perspective candidate including ‘strong interest in publishing’ and . ‘highly motivated and ambitious.’ Then the list of demands starts to become more extreme, candidates must be ‘determined to have a career in publishing and will sacrifice to make that career happen.’ The list of what the successful candidate will be expected to sacrifice is long and quite specific: . ‘do not have any other commitments (personal or professional) that will . interfere with their work at the Press (family obligations, writing, . involvement with other organizations, degrees to be finished, holidays . to be taken, weddings to attend in Rio, etc). If . that isn't enough, the lucky interns must 'know how to act and behave . in a professional office environment with high standards of performance' and 'have a commitment to excellence that can be demonstrated on a . day-to-day basis.' To . reinforce how demanding this role will be, the next sentence in . description is printed in capital letters and warns 'DO NOT APPLY IF ALL . OF THE ABOVE DOES NOT DESCRIBE YOU.'

Dalkey Archive Press publishes avant-garde and experimental books . If perspective candidates aren't scared off already, the description then goes on to state the long list of offenses that unlucky interns could be fired for: 'Coming in late or leaving early without prior permission; being unavailable at night or on the weekends; failing to meet any goals; giving unsolicited advice about how to run things; taking personal phone calls during work hours; gossiping; misusing company property, including surfing the internet while at work; submission of poorly written materials; creating an atmosphere of complaint or argument; failing to respond to emails in a timely way; not showing an interest in other aspects of publishing beyond editorial; making repeated mistakes; violating company policies.' Potential applicants are once again warned: 'DO NOT APPLY if you have a work history containing any of the above.' For applicants confident that they fit the criteria and still willing to work for Dalkey Archieve Press, the job description warns candidates not too expect too much in the way of feedback from the publisher: 'We will not be able to acknowledge receipt of applications or provide feedback about your application. We will contact only those people whom we wish to ask further questions of or that we intend to interview. Do not contact us about your application.' Job from hell? The job description to intern at Dalkey Archive Press is likely to make aspiring literary-nerds think twice about a career in publishing . An internship at a book publishing company may sound like a dream job for many young graduates, but judging from the job description to work at Dalkey Archive Press it could turn out to be a nightmare . The ridiculous job description recalls demanding internships and entry-level jobs dramatized in the TV Girls and the movie The Devil Wears Prada. At the start of HBO series Girls, Hannah (actress and show creator Lena Dunham) gets fired from her internship at an independent publisher after she dares to ask to be paid. Dunham interned in real life at independent publisher Soft Skull in 2006 and based the storyline on the experience. In The Devil Wears Prada, Anne Hathaway stars as a college graduate who goes to New York City and lands the job 'a million girls would kill for' as co-assistant to powerful fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly (widely believed to have been Vogue editor Anna Wintour), played by Meryl Streep.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 08:19 EST, 22 November 2011 . More than 100 Iraqi civilians have won a landmark Court of Appeal battle in their bid for a fresh public inquiry into allegations of torture and inhuman treatment made against British soldiers and interrogators in Iraq. The group appealed against a High Court decision upholding the Government's refusal to order an immediate, wide-ranging investigation into whether there was systemic abuse, as opposed to ill treatment by 'a few bad apples'. Some 128 Iraqis complain that ill treatment occurred between March 2003 and December 2008 in British-controlled detention facilities in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq. Interrogation: A still from a video of an Iraqi civilian being interviewed by British soldiers.  More than 100 Iraqi civilians claim they were tortured by British troops . The High Court ruled last December that the inquiry being sought was unnecessary because the Government had set up a team, the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), to investigate the allegations of abuse with a view to the identification and punishment of anyone responsible for wrongdoing. Today three appeal judges ruled that IHAT 'lacks independence' and ordered the Defence Secretary to reconsider. They also found that other inquiries failed to fully meet the needs of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects against inhuman and degrading treatment. Today's ruling was made by Lord Justice Maurice Kay, vice president of the Court of Appeal's civil division, sitting with Lord Justice Sullivan and Lord Justice Pitchford. Up-close: A British military interrogator allegedly shouts at an Iraqi prisoner . It was a dramatic victory for Ali Zaki Mousa, from Basra, the lead claimant, who alleges he endured months of beatings and other abuse in the custody of British soldiers in 2006-07. High Court judges Lord Justice Richards and Mr Justice Silber had rejected his claims for an immediate fresh public inquiry, saying the IHAT investigations were sufficient to meet the needs of justice. The judges also took into account that there were two other 'significant public inquiries' into specific allegations of ill-treatment of detainees in Iraq - the Baha Mousa inquiry, which reported in September, and the Al Sweady inquiry, where a hearing date has yet to be set. The High Court said it was possible that a new inquiry might be 'required in due course' - but it was a matter which could 'lawfully be left for decision at a future date'. Ruling: The Royal Courts of Justice which is home to the Court of Appeal where today's hearing took place . But today the appeal judges disagreed and ruled the Government was failing to meet its duties under Article 3. Lord Justice Kay said that under the IHAT arrangements, members of the Provost Branch of the Army, which includes the Royal Military Police, were investigating allegations 'which necessarily include the possibility of culpable acts or omissions on the part of Provost Branch members'. The appeal judge said it was not a marginal case. 'On the contrary, we are of the view that the practical independence of IHAT is, at least as a matter or reasonable perception, substantially compromised'. Strong claims: The Iraqi claimants' solicitor Phil Shiner, of Public Interest Lawyers has accused the Ministry of Defence of 'deploying every dirty trick in the book' to avoid accountability . The judge said it was also 'entirely foreseeable' that the Baha Mousa inquiry could not satisfy the Government's legal obligations under Article 3 to investigate the allegations being made by the Iraqi civilians in today's case. The appeal judges also ruled the High Court was wrong to give 'real weight' to the fact that a new inquiry would have 'heavy resource implications' and to adopt a 'wait and see' policy. They ruled the 'resources argument' was reduced because IHAT lacked independence, and the wait and see policy could not be justified. Allowing the Iraqi appeal, Lord Justice Kay said: 'It will be for the (Defence Secretary) to reconsider how the Article 3 obligation should now be satisfied.' Later a Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'We note that the Court of Appeal has not ordered a public inquiry but has asked the Defence Secretary to reconsider how to meet the investigative obligations. 'We will examine the judgment very carefully and consider next steps.' Today the appeal judges gave new Defence Secretary Philip Hammond  until November 30 to decide whether to seek to challenge the appeal court ruling in the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land. The decision to refuse an inquiry was taken by his predecessor Liam Fox. Shocking: Baha Mousa, pictured with his son, was beaten to death while in British Army custody in Basra. There was a public hearing into his death which judges at today's hearing took into account . The Iraqi claimants' solicitor Phil Shiner, of Public Interest Lawyers (PIL), accused the Ministry of Defence (MoD) of 'deploying every dirty trick in the book' to avoid accountability. Mr Shiner said: 'The court has found that IHAT's practical independence is ""substantially compromised"". 'There must now be a judicial inquiry into the UK's detention policy in south-east Iraq. 'It is something we have been calling for since 2004. 'The MoD has deployed every dirty trick in the book to prevent accountability for the hundreds of torture and unlawful killings cases of Iraqi civilians.

Fugitive millionaire John McAfee has been rushed to the hospital in Guatemala after suffering two minor heart attacks. The 67-year-old software company founder had been denied political asylum in Guatemala and his lawyers said they were making a last-ditch effort to keep him from being flown back to Belize for questioning about the killing of a fellow American expatriate. McAfee was moved from an immigration center to a police-run hospital Thursday afternoon after Guatemalan authorities said McAfee's request for asylum had been denied. Authorities did not offer an explanation as to why they denied him that right. Shortly after the decision was announced, McAfee issued a plea on his blog for the public to petition Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina to let him stay in the Central American country. Scroll down for video . Heart attack: John McAfee was rushed to the hospital after suffering two minor heart attacks and experiencing chest pain all day . Condition unknown: McAfee's lawyer said the former tech mogul had been experiencing chest pain all day . Seeking asylum: McAfee is seen lying in a stretcher after being transferred by paramedics at the Policia Nacional Civil hospital in Guatemala City . 'Please email the President of . Guatemala and beg him to allow the court system to proceed, to determine . my status in Guatemala, and please support the political asylum that I . am asking for,' the post read. McAfee's lawyer vowed to block Guatemalan efforts to remove the entrepreneur. McAfee was not taken to a hospital and posted on his blog during the morning hours. 'I don't think a heart attack prevents one from using one's blog,' said the lawyer, Telesforo Guerra. McAfee was detained by Guatemalan police on Wednesday for illegally sneaking across the border with his 20-year-old girlfriend to escape authorities in Belize. He has said he fears authorities in Belize will kill him if he returns. Hideout: McAfee pictured Thursday in a migrant shelter, where he is detained in Guatemala City . Bombarded: McAfee's lawyer, Telesforo Guerra, enters a migrant shelter, where Guatemalan authorities say McAfee is being detained today . Still, Guatemala's foreign minister, Harold Caballeros, said McAfee's request for asylum had been rejected. Police in Belize want to quiz McAfee as 'a person of interest' in the killing of fellow American Gregory Faull, with whom he had quarreled. But they say he is not a prime suspect in the probe. McAfee says he has been persecuted by Belize's ruling party because he refused to pay it around $2 million. Belize's prime minister denies this and has described McAfee, who made millions from the Internet anti-virus software that bears his name, as 'bonkers.' McAfee later lost much of his fortune and turned to a life of semi-reclusion by the beach. VIDEO: McAfee rushed to hospital after suffering heart attacks . Transfer: McAfee is transferred in an ambulance to the national Police Hospital in Guatemalan City . Prisoner: McAfee had been held at a Guatemalan immigration detainment shelter following his arrest after sneaking into the country . During an exclusive interview with the AP Thursday morning from inside his private room at the center, McAfee said he was refusing to travel to a hospital because he had been using Chinese herbal medicine since suffering a heart attack in 1993. 'Last night I had a little bit of pain, but I am fine this morning,' he said. 'I don't like Western medicine ... if the people around me are kind and compassionate, that's all that matters in life. The people of Guatemala are very kind people, so I have no complaints.' A couple of hours later, an AP reporter returned to McAfee's room and found him changed into a suit but lying on the floor as he was examined by a doctor. Shortly after, he was taken to the police hospital. Belizean police spokesman Raphael Martinez said officials expected McAfee to be flown back to his country's capital. Police want to question him about the fatal shooting of killing of Gregory Viant Faull, who was shot to death in early November on the Belize island where both men lived. Fugitive: McAfee left Belize with his 20-year-old girlfriend Sam Venegas after weeks of hiding out from authorities . Denied: McAfee was arrested this week by Guatemalan authorities and was later denied asylum there . Guerra wants to lodge an injunction against McAfee's arrest and said he should not be moved from the immigration shelter where he is staying until doctors had cleared his health. They had drawn blood and results are expected later on Thursday. After his arrest, McAfee spent the night in a cottage belonging to the immigration department. He passed much of the night reading his blog www.whoismcafee.com and posting his thoughts on a laptop he said was lent to him by the warden. One person asked him if he felt like committing suicide. 'I enjoy living, and suicide is absurdly redundant,' he wrote. 'The world, from the very beginning, hurls viruses, accidents, hungry animals, defective DNA - and uncountable more - in an attempt to kill us. It always succeeds. Suicide is simply aiding and abetting.' His story: McAfee is pictured on December 5 when he spoke with Reuters in Guatemala City . Captured: McAfee was interrogated by police on December 6 in Guatemala City . McAfee's earlier posts spoke of his relief at arriving in Guatemala, thinking he had found a way out of his troubles. Government spokesman Francisco Cuevas said on Wednesday the eccentric tech entrepreneur, who loves guns and young women and has tribal tattoos covering his shoulders, would be expelled to Belize within hours. However, an immigration department official later said immediate deportation had been ruled out. On the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye, where McAfee has lived in Belize for about four years, residents and neighbors say he is eccentric and at times unstable. He was seen to travel with armed bodyguards, sporting a pistol tucked into his belt. The predicament of the former Lockheed systems consultant is a far cry from his heyday in the late 1980s, when he started McAfee Associates. Murdered: American Gregory Faul, 52, was found dead in his home in Belize last month; he and McAfee were neighbors . Grim task: Police officers carry the body of US citizen Gregory Viant Faull following his murder . McAfee has no relationship now with the company, which was sold to Intel Corp. McAfee was previously charged in Belize with possession of illegal firearms, and police had raided his property on suspicions that he was running a lab to produce illegal synthetic narcotics. He says he has not taken drugs since 1983. '(Before then) I took drugs constantly, 24 hours of the day. I took them for years and years. I was the worst drug abuser on the planet,' he told Reuters before his arrest. 'Then I finally went to Alcoholics Anonymous, and that was the end of it.'

A jeweller fought off a gang of masked raiders who attacked him with a sledgehammer, by hurling gold watches at them. Dramatic CCTV stills show the moment four balaclava-wearing robbers smashed their way into David Nicholl's jewellery shop in Smethwick, West Midlands, at 4.40pm on Saturday. The thieves then smashed glass counters before loading 17 trays of gold jewellery, worth tens of thousands of pounds, into a bag. Scroll down for video . Four balaclava-clad raiders burst into David Nicholls' Smethwick jewellers shop in West Midlands on Saturday armed with sledgehammers . Glass smashes everywhere as robbers help themselves to the trays of jewellery. In the top right of the screen one robber can be seen striking Mr Nicholls with a sledgehammer . Mr Nicholls begins to fight back and despite the grainy footage, you can just make out one robber putting his arms up to defend himself as Mr Nicholls throws heavy gold watches and broken jewellery trays . The armed gang of four decide enough is enough and flee Mr Nicholls' shop, carrying with them a total of 17 trays of jewellery worth tens of thousands of pounds . Shop owner David Nicholls was twice hit over the head with a sledgehammer but incredibly the 52-yeat-old fought back by hitting the raiders with the broken display cases. He then grabbed a handful of gold watches and threw them at the yobs who fled. Mr Nicholls, who suffered a head injury and needed hospital treatment, said today: 'I just thank God that I didn't get shot or killed or maimed in any way. 'We will recover, it will take a while. 'The bad thing for us is that we didn't have insurance, we were between insurance companies and the loss we will have to take ourselves. 'I was trying to protect my wife when they came in and then I just reacted and thought I'd try and stop them. 'The only thing I could grab was the display cabinets which they had smashed and I just tried to hit them with it. Loss: Mr Nicholls was between insurers at the time of Saturday's robbery and is not covered for the theft. He is considering closing down . 'I grabbed whatever I could and the next thing I knew I was lobbing gold watches at them. 'They were pretty heavy and were hitting the robbers who obviously just had enough and they ran off. 'A few trays of jewellery dropped to the floor, I think they were shocked at being attacked back. 'I didn't think about myself even though my head was bleeding badly.' The four offenders got away with tens of thousands of pounds worth of stock, and Mr Nicholls admitted he was unsure whether to continue running the business. Detective Constable Steve Goddard, from West Midlands Police, said: 'The victim was lucky to have got away with relatively minor injuries following what was an extremely nasty attack, there was no need for the level of violence used. 'I'm keen to hear from anyone who witnessed any of what happened or anyone who has any information about who may be responsible.'

Floyd Mayweather Jnr has not ruled out facing Manny Pacquiao in boxing's first $100million superfight - but only after the battered Filipino has at least one warm-up bout. Pacquiao was knocked out cold by the brutal right hand of Juan Manuel Marquez in Las Vegas last Saturday, a result which looked to end hopes of the 33-year-old facing Mayweather. But the five-weight world champion insists he remains interested in fighting his pound-for-pound rival, if terms can be agreed.

Wrong side of the law: Mayweather served two months in prison before his release in August . 'Pacquiao's focus should on be on . trying to take a vacation, get his mind right, and get a few tune-up . fights so he can bounce back,' Mayweather told Fight Hype. 'I feel bad for him. There's a . difference in the ways you can get knocked out. See, when a guy gets . knocked out and he can get up, they sit him on his stool, rub his back . and he goes home to ice himself. 'But when you gotta wake a guy up . with smelling salts and got a concussion and he gotta go to hospital . overnight, that's crucial. I mean, that's close to death.

Body pressed flat against the pavement, a 17-year-old boy is caught on film putting his own life in danger to rescue a total stranger shot by a sniper in Syria. The woman had been walking through the streets of war torn Aleppo with her son when a gunman opened fire and shot her. Rebel fighter Abdullah, 17, spotted the woman and decided he had to get her to safety. Scroll down to watch the video . Rescue attempt: Brave 17-year-old Abdullah starts crawling towards a woman lying on the ground in Aleppo . Risking his life: Abdullah, a former baker, eventually manages to reach the woman despite bullets raining down around him . He told CNN: 'We had a feeling she was still alive. We wanted to save her, to get her to a hospital.' But as Abdullah slowly crawls across to the woman on his stomach, loud gunshots start to fire around him as his fellow rebel fighters shout: 'Cover, him, cover him.' The footage appears to show the woman briefly moving her hand as Abdullah reaches her but more and more gun shots are fired. Abduallah added: 'If I die it's god will I die next to this woman.' Abdullah, a baker before civil war broke out in the country after uprisings in March 2011, then ties a rope around the woman. Risky: It is too dangerous for Abdullah to carry the woman back with him, so he ties some rope around her waist . Abdullah is then forced to run for safety, pictured to the left of the screen, and leave the woman lying on the ground . The teenager then quickly runs to safety before pulling the woman to him with the rope. But by the time the woman is reunited with her son she has tragically died from her wounds. The heartbreaking footage filmed by CNN comes as Syria's biggest ally, Russia, has stated President Bashar Assad is losing control of his country and the rebels might win the civil war. It is the first time Moscow has acknowledged the regime is cracking under the force of a powerful rebellion. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said: 'An opposition victory can't be excluded, unfortunately, but it's necessary to look at the facts: There is a trend for the government to progressively lose control over an increasing part of the territor.' Pulled to safety: The rebels refuse to leave the woman behind and pull her to their hiding place . Tragic: The distraught son of the woman stands to her right after she died from her wounds . Russia's ties to Syria date back to Assad's father, Hafez, who ruled Syria with an iron fist from 1971 until his death in June 2000. In the last four decades, Russia has sold Syria billions of dollars' worth of weapons. A change in power in Damascus could not only cost Russia lucrative trade deals, but also reduce Russian political influence in Arab world. Bogdanov also said Moscow is preparing to evacuate thousands of its citizens from Syria, where nearly two years of violent conflict have killed more than 40,000 people and turned Assad into a global pariah. Brave: Rebel fighter Abdullah, 17, is pictured talking about his heroic efforts . 'We are dealing with issues related to the preparation for evacuation,' Bogdanov said. 'We have mobilization plans. We are finding out where our citizens are.' His statement marks a clear attempt by the Kremlin to begin positioning itself for Assad's eventual defeat at a time when rebels are making significant gains. Opposition fighters have seized large swaths of territory in northern Syria along the border with Turkey and appear to be expanding their control outside of Damascus, pushing the fight closer to Assad's seat of power in the capital. 'On the losing side': Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, pictured right with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, said that President Bashar Assad is losing control over Syria . Winning the war: The statement by Russia's foreign minister is the first time the country has said there may be a chance the rebels will beat Assad . In a Damascus suburb, a bomb blast near a school today killed 16 people, at least half of them women and children, the state news agency SANA reported. The government says the bombing on Thursday is the latest in a string of similar bombings in and around Damascus that have killed at least 25 people in the last two days. The government blames the bombings on terrorists, the term it uses to refer to rebel fighters. While no one has claimed responsibility for the bombings, some have targeted government buildings and killed officials, suggesting that rebels who don't have the firepower to engage Assad's elite forces in the capital could be resorting to guerrilla measures. Similar attacks hit four places in and around Damascus on Wednesday. Three bombs collapsed walls of the Interior Ministry building, killing at least five people. One of the dead was Syrian parliament member Abdullah Qairouz, SANA reported. It comes after the U.S. and NATO said Assad's forces had fired Scud missiles at rebel areas, which the President denies, calling them nothing more than a conspiracy. In ruins: Damaged buildings and rubble covered streets are seen in the Karam Shamsham area in Homs . 'Being starved out': A Syrian woman and girl carry their belongings after their home was destroyed in Aleppo where the price up bread has rocketed by 1300 per cent . But the NATO secretary-general said the military alliance detected the launch of a number of the unguided short-range missiles inside Syria earlier this week. He added: 'We can't confirm details of the missiles, but some of the information indicates they were Scud-type missiles. 'In general, I think the regime in Damascus is approaching collapse. I think now it's only a question of time.' Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Syrians have become trapped in the city of Deir al-Zor by fighting as calls are made for medical teams to be allowed to evacuate the wounded. The group Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said the Syrian government had yet to authorize the deployment of international aid agencies despite the growing humanitarian crisis in the country. Deir al-Zor has become one of many urban battlegrounds in the 20-month-old revolt against President Bashar al-Assad. With daily army shelling and routes cut off by fighting, many residents are trapped. The group said in a statement: 'MSF appeals for international and impartial medical assistance to be officially authorized by the government and for such assistance to be respected by all parties of the conflict.' No power: Toys are seen among the rubble of damaged shops in Aleppo's al-Amereya district after the city's electricity was cut off 25 days ago . Humanitarian crisis: Groups are calling for aid to be delivered to Syrian cities where injured civilians have become trapped because of the fighting . Medical supplies are running short and only a small team of exhausted Syrian medics are left inside the embattled eastern city, MSF coordinator Patrick Wieland said. Wieland, who visited the area, said there was now only one makeshift hospital with four doctors in city, which sits near the Iraqi border and was once home to around 600,000 people. An MSF team unofficially visited Deir al-Zor province but said conditions were too dangerous for them to enter the main city with the same name. The team visited public and private hospitals around the city and said the premises were inundated with wounded, some of them with hundreds of patients. 'Despite support from a Syrian doctors' organization, medical supplies are almost impossible to get hold of, and aerial bombardments and sniper fire make evacuating patients by stretcher extremely difficult,' the MSF report said. 'The health system is being targeted, and medical supplies, including drugs and blood products, are running out, while the number of wounded continues to increase.' The startling reports of the state of medical care comes as The Times newspaper reports Syrian survivors in Aleppo are being starved as part of Assad's desperate bid to weaken the rebels and cling to power. The city has no electricity since the lines were cut 25 days ago, leaving civilians with hardly any fuel, running water and no working phone lines. The lack of power means flower mills can no longer provide the city with enough flour and the daily production of bread has fallen by 70 per cent in the majority of the large bakeries. This has caused food prices in Aleppo to rocket by 75 per cent in just over a month with a loaf of bread increasing in price by an astonishing 1300 per cent. Wages have also plummeted and many are out of work. Teenager's selfless attempt to rescue the woman filmed in Aleppo .","Teenager's selfless attempt to rescue the woman filmed in Aleppo .

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may not testify on December 20, as the State Department cast a certain amount of doubt on events. Though Clinton is scheduled to testify before the House of Representatives and Senate foreign affairs committees on a report on the deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, the said documents may not be ready in time. The state department spokeswoman added that Clinton has not yet agreed to testify next week, but would not say whether the hearings are on Clinton's schedule. Doubt: U.S. State Secretary Hillary Clinton may not testify at the Benghazi hearings scheduled for December 20, if a crucial report on the attacks is not finished . Speaking at the department’s daily press briefing, a reporter asked State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that the Accountability Review Board is continuing to do its work and has not yet finished its report. Nuland said: ‘The Hill has talked about a planning date on the calendar. That presumes that the ARB is finished. I don’t have any dates – any schedule of the Secretary’s to announce here.’ She concluded that Clinton testifying on the 20th is contingent on the completion of the ARB’s report.The attack on September 11 killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, and raised questions about the adequacy of security in far-flung posts. Republicans have criticized Democratic President Obama's administration for its flawed early public explanations of the attack. They have also criticized shifting explanations of why talking points given to U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice were changed to delete a reference to al Qaeda. Some Republicans have used that criticism to question Rice's suitability as a candidate to replace Clinton, if Obama were to nominate her. Answers: Clinton walks with President Barack Obama to the Rose Garden of the White House the day after the September 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya . Clinton has said she planned to retire from her post at State after Obama's first term. An accountability review board convened by the State Department is expected to release a report on the Benghazi attack before Clinton testifies. The board, led by veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering, is expected to consider whether enough attention was given to potential threats and how Washington responded to security requests from U.S. diplomats in Libya. Democratic Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement: 'We ask our diplomats and development personnel to operate in some of the most dangerous places on the planet. ‘We owe it to them, and we owe it to the memory of Ambassador Chris Stevens and his three fellow Americans who lost their lives in Benghazi to get past the politics and focus on the substance of what happened and what it tells us about diplomatic security going forward.'","It was announced Wednesday that the secretary of state would testify at December 20 hearings .

A couple furious with the work a builder has done on their home have posted a huge banner outside the house warning locals that he is a 'cowboy'. Fran Ikin and Peter Mortin paid Dean Watts more than £7,000 to transform their new semi into a dream home, but claim he wrecked the house with shoddy workmanship. The couple now say they want to stop others from being 'conned' by the builder, whom they accuse of 'ruining lives'. Fury: Fran Ikin outside her home in Gaywood, Norfolk which she claims was ruined by a 'cowboy builder' Ms Ikin and Mr Mortin, who recently became engaged, employed Watts to build a conservatory, extend their kitchen, fit a wood burner, knock through two rooms, fit a new bathroom, then plaster and paint the house in Gaywood, Norfolk. But they say he committed 25 different blunders which will cost them £12,000 to repair, and in protest they have written 'Dean Watts cowboy builder?' on a banner he left hanging on the scaffolding outside their home. The couple were furious with the builder's work - but they say that instead of offering to repair the damage, Watts demanded a £500 bonus before he would leave. They have remortgaged their home to pay for the repairs - less than a week after moving in. Chaos: Ms Ikin posing inside the home, which was supposed to have been renovated by Dean Watts . 'Shoddy': The couple claim Watts left much of the job undone despite being paid over £7,000 for his work . Mr Morton, 44, said: 'He has conned us out of a lot of hard-earned money. We have no money left and every day after work we spend trying to fix the house. 'It is bitterly cold, we have to flush the toilet with a bucket and we have no hot water to have a shower. It has been a complete nightmare. 'If the government are not going to protect us against cowboy builders then I will make sure everyone in the area knows what this man has done and ensure they never employ him. 'I want to stop him from ruining other people's lives.' Warning: The homeowners say they want to send a message to their neighbours in the wake of their ordeal . The homeowner met Watts in the builder's antique furniture shop, which is near Ms Ikin's pottery workshop in Hunstanton, Norfolk. He hired him for £7,800 after Watts claimed to have 20 years' experience, and the builder began working alongside a colleague in late October. However, the couple became suspicious when he asked for an extra £4,000 to treat the roof for woodworm, and they started keeping a diary detailing his work. They say they found him using bathroom sealant around the fireplace and knocking down a supporting wall leaving a hole in the roof. They later discovered he was apparently entirely untrained after he told the homeowners he had swept the chimney ready to install a log-burning stove. A dangerous coating of soot nine inches deep was later found in the flue which could have started a house fire. Uneven: The couple claim that Watts left the house in a nearly uninhabitable state last month . Mr Morton and Ms Ikin also discovered holes in the ceiling of the bedroom and bathroom, and accuse Watts of installing a cheap Chinese wood burner rather than the reliable model he had promised. Despite having no heating, hot water or drainage, and the roof leaking when it rains, the couple have had no choice but to move into the house, as the lease on the rental property where they had been living expired. They say they must now pay for digging up the concrete for the conservatory, replacing the wood burner and fixing the roof. Ms Ikin, 47, claims she was tricked into paying Watts an extra £3,500 when her fiancé, who had already paid the builder, was away on holiday. Watts failed to reply to messages asking him to comment on the couple's allegations.","Fran Ikin and Peter Mortin paid builder £7,000 to craft their dream home .

Weight issues: Samantha Burke, 22, took illegal drugs in an attempt to control her weight. A young woman who took illegal drugs to control her weight hanged herself after her mother confronted her about the habit the day before. Samantha Burke was so obsessed with her size that she would sometimes take amphetamines rather than eat, an inquest into her death heard. The 22-year-old also took cocaine in her battle to lose two stone to get to her 'ideal' weight. A post-mortem examination revealed amphetamines and alcohol in her system, as well as evidence that Miss Burke had previously taken cocaine. When the hospital carer's mother Janice question her daughter about the drug consumption, Miss Burke flew into a rage, telling her to 'f*** off' and saying: 'I might as well be dead. I might as well hang myself.' She packed a bag and left home, despite her mother's pleading, before phoning home later to apologise for her behaviour. Her body was found in a field by a dog walker the next day. Miss Burke had taken drug overdoses before as she battled with low mood, according to medical reports, but she said she never intended to kill herself. A support worker had previously assessed her risk of suicide as zero out of ten, the inquest heard. Charlotte Winfield, from psychological therapy group iTalk said: 'Sam reported being obsessed with her weight. She said: ""I know I have a disorder"" and reported taking laxatives.' She told the inquest that Miss Burke lost two stone in three weeks, and had experienced issues with her weight since she was 18. Miss Winfield added: 'In a day she would have porridge, two shakes then maybe chicken or fish - a healthy meal. 'She is 5ft 5ins tall and weighs 11 stone and had recently lost two stone in three weeks, however at Christmas she put on a stone. 'She has had this problem since the age of 18 and said: ""I feel I'm overweight, two stone overweight, and ideal weight would be nine stone"".' Mother Janice Burke said about two weeks before she died, Miss Burke had started a new job as a hospital carer, around the same time Janice discovered her drug use . Janice said: 'Instead of eating she would take speed. It was a way of losing weight. I just wanted to try to talk to her so we could help.' She said her daughter had also experienced financial difficulties. Janice confronted her daughter on July 30 this year when Miss Burke returned to the family home in Andover, Hants, after going for a walk with a friend. After stumbling, her mother asked her what she had taken. Depressed: The inquest heard how Miss Burke took laxatives and amphetamines in an attempt to control her weight (stock image) Miss Burke told her mother to 'f*** off', adding 'How f*****g dare you to say I take drugs?' Miss Burke went upstairs and when her mother followed her a few minutes later she found her packing a bag, adding: 'I'm f*****g leaving. I hate it here.' She left, only to return an hour later, telling her mother: 'I f*****g hate you. How dare you accuse me of something like that?' She left the house again but at 10.30pm she called her mother to say she was sorry. Despite the apology she refused to come home. Her mother suggested getting professional help to which her daughter only said 'no'. At the end of the phone call she told her mother 'I love you'. Warehouse worker Neil Smith found her body at 6.10am the following day while walking his dog in Rooksbury Mill Park. Police found a black Mini parked nearby and traced it back to Miss Burke. Simon Burge, the deputy coroner for central Hampshire, said: 'The evidence in this distressing case is clear; that she died as a result of hanging. 'There is some evidence she suffered from depression and was receiving some support from medical professionals. 'She had financial issues which may have contributed to her anxiety but there is nothing which in any sense adequately explains why she did what she did.' 'There had been a row with mum and mum will torment herself with what 'would have happened if I hadn't had the row with her',' he added. He told family members at the hearing in Winchester: 'At the end of the day you all have to accept it was her decision and nobody else's to end her life and I can't see how any of you could have done more than you did to support her. 'I suspect she felt ashamed and confused about the way she had behaved and in an impetuous and angered state decided that her life wasn't worth living.'","Samantha Burke, 22, took amphetamines and laxatives to control her weight .

It takes us more than half an hour to feel awake in the morning, according to a survey. Fewer than one in five Britons (17 per cent) consider themselves to be morning people. Daydream nation: A study found that it takes 36 minutes for Brits to feel awake . The study found that after being disturbed by the alarm clock, we typically snooze for 14 minutes and don’t feel awake for 36 minutes. Two out of three said they are less likely to snooze when woken by an alarm with ‘natural’ sounds. Some 73 per cent of those questioned by Radox thought the sound of a bird tweeting or a cock crowing made them wake up in a more positive mood. And, on average, we lose at least an hour’s sleep per night in December due to worries over Christmas. Two thirds (66 per cent) of Brits feel . unmotivated in the morning and 60 per cent admitted to sleeping in more . during the dark winter months. Just under a quarter (23 per cent) admitted to suffering from ‘seasonal sleeping slips’ as they recorded . more late attendance during December. A further 15 per cent said they were . prone to sick days during the final month of the year . Dev Banerjee of The Sleep Clinic said: ‘The first sound we hear in the morning has such an effect on our mood for the rest of the day.

They have found two of his ships which were scuttled off the coast of Panama over 400 years ago following the adventurer's death. The team believes Drake's lead-lined coffin could be near to the location of the two ships 'Elizabeth' and Delight' and have begun a search for the historical artefact. Major breakthrough: The treasure-hunting team led by American explorer Pat Croce, pictured in action, believe they have found two of Sir Francis Drake's ships which were scuttled off the coast of Panama . over 400 years ago - taking them closer to the site of the British naval hero's final resting place . The ships were scuttled by Drake's crews in 1596 after the English captain was buried at sea following his death at the age of 55 from dysentery. Drake is considered one of Britain's greatest naval heroes having led the English fleet in victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588 as they prepared for an invasion of Britain. He was the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe and the scourge of the Spanish in their ambitions to conquer the world. 1540 - Born in Tavistock, Devon, as one of 12 children . 1563 - Sails for the first time to the New World (the Americas) with second cousin Sir John Hawkins . 1568 . - Again sailing with Hawkins, Drake becomes trapped by Spaniards in the . Mexican port of San Juan de Ulua. Both escape but Drake vows revenge . 1572 . - Drake leads a fleet who capture huge amounts of Spanish silver off . the coast of Panama. 1579/80 - Drake, sailing in the Golden Hind, becomes the first Englishman to sail around the world . 1581 - Queen Elizabeth I knights Francis Drake, and he also becomes Mayor of Plymouth . 1587 - On the orders of Queen Elizabeth, Drake attacks and destroys the Spanish fleet at Cadiz . 1588 . - As Vice Admiral of an English fleet alongside Sir John Hawkins and . Lord Howard of Effingham, Drake helps destroy the Spanish Armada . 1595 . - Drake is sent to capture treasure from a wrecked Spanish fleet at La . Forteleza, near San Juan, Puerto Rico. Drake fails and returns to Panama . 1596 . - While anchored off Portobelo, Panama, Drake develops dysentery and . dies aged 55. He is buried at sea near Portobelo, though divers have . never found the exact location . The wrecks of the ships were found in an underwater expedition led by Pat Croce, a self-confessed pirate enthusiast and former president of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team. The 56-year-old financed the expedition to the coast off Panama to try and locate Drake's last known resting place. His 12-strong crew included explorers from Britain, France, Scotland, Australia, Panama and Colombia. They were armed with the most . sophisticated equipment in the world, including a magnetometer, GeoSwath . and sub-bottom profiler that can scan the ocean floor. Mr . Croce said: 'Explorers have been trying to do this stuff forever, and . here I am, a homeboy from Philadelphia in the Caribbean and we score! It's pretty wild.' Mr Croce, who runs a pirate museum in . St Augustine, Florida, said the ships would remain in the water as they . are the property of Panama. He said there was no treasure on board as the ships had been stripped before being scuttled. But he added that his team would now focus their efforts on trying to find Drake's coffin. He . said: 'It's truly a needle in a haystack, but so were the ships. We . found them within a week. We just haven't found him - yet.' Drake was buried in full armour and in a lead lined coffin by his crew following his death. Other marine experts spoke of the importance of the undersea find. 'We've really, I feel, hit a home run here with what we found with Pat,' said marine archaeologist James Sinclair. Sir Francis Drake (right) died of dysentery in . January 1596 and was buried at sea. He was the first Englishman to . circumnavigate the globe, which he did in his ship the Golden Hind, a . replica of which can be seen on the left .

But what do the words to Away In a Manger mean exactly? That is the question pondered by television historian Mary Beard after she attended this year's annual carol service at King's College, Cambridge. Confusion: Mary Beard, a professor in classics at Cambridge, wrote about the 'weird' Away In a Manger lyrics in a newspaper column . The historian, a professor in classics at Cambridge University, wrote about how she was struck by the phrase 'no crib for a bed' as she perused the lyrics printed in her order of service. Writing in her column in the Times Literary Supplement, Professor Beard said of the printed lyrics: 'It did make you reflect on what made a good carol, what was the right blend of sentimentality and jolliness. 'It also made you reflect on how weird some of the words were (what actually does ""no crib for a bed"" mean?),' she added. Carols: The historian attended this year's King's College carol service in Cambridge (file picture) The confusion is thought to arise from the fact that - at least in Britain - a crib and a manger are essentially the same thing; a trough from which an animal can eat fodder. Meaning interpreting the phrase 'away in a manger, no crib for a bed' could present something of a conundrum. But in the U.S., where the carol was first published in Philadelphia in 1885, a crib is defined as a small bed for infants and young children. One reader posted a reply to Professor Beard's column which said: 'I think we must apply a principle of charity and interpret the words in a way that makes them sensible. 'As a manger has just been mentioned, we must take ""crib"" to have only the meaning of a proper little bed designed for children.'","In Britain, the words 'manger' and 'crib' can mean the same thing; a trough from which an animal can eat ."

'Horrendous record': David Archer, 57, has committed over 300 offences and is thought to have spent 28 years in prison . One of the country's most prolific petty crooks - who claims to have spent almost half his life in prison - is back behind bars and facing his 16th Christmas in jail. David Archer, 57, already has more than 300 offences on his 'horrendous record', a court heard, mostly for theft. Yesterday a judge sentenced Archer to a further three months in prison for breaching an Anti-Social Behaviour Order after he threatened a female Police Community Support Officer. Archer, of Rhyl, North Wales, who has stolen charity collection boxes in the past, hurled abuse at the PCSO when she tried to speak to him about selling alcohol in the street at Llandudno Junction, Caernarfon Crown Court heard. When she approached him the thief retorted: 'Why don't you get a proper job? I've spent 28 years inside, do you know what I'd like to do to you - slit your throat.' Last summer the same court was told Archer had committed 333 offences during his life of crime, and had breached his ASBO nine times. He was handed an indefinite ASBO in 2006. Judge Peter Heywood said Archer had a 'horrendous record', but expressed hope at yesterday's hearing that the career crook could yet turn his life around. 'It seems there is some window of hope for you,' the judge said. 'I've seen a letter from your brother who seems to be bending over backwards to give you teh chance of a job in the Leeds area.' When defence barrister Andrew . McInnes had mentioned the support on offer for Archer in Leeds, Judge . Heywood remarked: 'That may give some respite to North Wales . police.' Archer had already spent the equivalent of two months in prison on remand, which will count towards his three month sentence. He is expected to be released later this month, but it was not clear whether he will be a free man before Christmas Day.

Tragic: Bethany Adcock, 14, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, was one of six girls at Meadowhead School experimenting with the sniffing craze . A 14-year-old schoolgirl died after inhaling fumes from a deodorant can in front of a friend in her room as she tried to get high, an inquest heard. Bethany Adcock, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire - one of six girls at Meadowhead School who were experimenting with the craze - inhaled for about 25 minutes before collapsing on her bed and rolling onto the floor, Sheffield Coroner’s Court was told on Wednesday. Her friend warned her that it could be deadly, but Bethany - who played football for the Sheffield United Community Ladies FC under-14s side - claimed she knew other girls who did it regularly and had done it at least twice before. She had been shown by another girl how to inhale to get high one month before she died in November 2011, with sniffing aerosol gas becoming a craze among pupils at her school. PC Mark Wilcock, who investigated Bethany’s death, said: ‘The common denominator is it had spread around a group at school. It is apparent this was not the first time Bethany had done it. ‘It seems to have been something done in the fairly recent past, but it was not her first time. She had done it at least twice before. She told her friend another girl had shown her how to do it roughly a month before the night in question.’ The girl who introduced Bethany to solvent abuse had herself been ‘caught red-handed’ by her own mother and had stopped, the inquest was told. The mother told the parents of another girl, who was also inhaling fumes, and she stopped too. But Bethany’s family was not aware she was involved. PC Wilcock said on the night she died, Bethany began rolling to the floor. Her horrified friend screamed for help, and Bethany’s distraught father Craig gave emergency first aid. Education: Meadowhead School is a 'satisfactory' specialist language college in Sheffield with 1,670 pupils . She was taken by ambulance to Sheffield Children’s Hospital, but was pronounced dead just over an hour after the alarm was raised. In the wake of the tragedy, the names of all children involved had been passed to their headteacher and social services. 'Her friend said: ""Come upstairs quick, something really bad has happened to Beth"". In pure fear I mounted the stairs three at a time and I found Bethany’s face ashen. Her eyes were as far as they could go in the back of her head. I knew we were in trouble, she was so limp' Craig Adcock . ‘We put measures in place to ensure appropriate education was provided,’ PC Wilcock said. ’We spoke to the headteacher and to a lady from social services and all the names we were aware of were provided to them. I know the school sent out a letter in the immediate aftermath.’ A post-mortem examination failed to find any reason for Bethany’s death other than traces in her blood of a chemical used in aerosol sprays. Pathologist Mudher Al-Adnani said solvent abuse can affect heart rhythms. He said the effect was ‘completely unpredictable’ - the same person could inhale one day without any effect, but do the same thing the next day and die. Craig Adcock, breaking down in tears at his daughter’s inquest, said: ‘It has destroyed me. No parent should have to go through this.’ Inquest: Sheffield Coroner's Court (pictured) was told that her friend warned her that it could be deadly, but Bethany claimed she knew other girls who did it regularly and had done it at least twice before . Reliving his battle to revive his daughter as she lay slumped on her bedroom floor, he said: ‘Bethany’s friend called down to us, a harrowing call , and her words still haunt me to this day. ’She said: “Come upstairs quick, something really bad has happened to Beth”. Meadowhead School is a mixed specialist language . college in Sheffield with 1,670 pupils. It was labelled 'satisfactory' in its last . Ofsted report earlier this year in March, which took place after Bethany's death in November 2011. The report also said it had ‘good systems in place to ensure . the safety of students’. The headteacher is Catherine James, who writes on the school's website: 'The school building opened in January 2007 and offers modern facilities with impressive technology.' ‘In pure fear I mounted the stairs three . at a time and I found Bethany’s face ashen. Her eyes were as far as . they could go in the back of her head. I knew we were in trouble, she . was so limp.’ Mr Adcock gave his daughter the kiss-of-life and did chest compressions while he and wife Michelle waited desperately for paramedics to arrive at their home and rush her to hospital by ambulance. ’I did everything possible to get some breath into her and to get a heartbeat,’ he said. Mr Adcock urged parents to lock up everyday household aerosol sprays away from their children. ‘Since that fatal day I have been disappointed with society in its perception of solvent abuse - most people my age believe solvents are glues and things like that,’ he said. 'This is a very tragic case indeed. Bethany had a great life ahead of her' Julian Fox, assistant deputy coroner . ‘I have spoken to dozens of parents and . kids, and some of Bethany’s friends, and they did not have a clue a . household spray can kill you like that. You should keep them under lock . and key with your bleach.’ Assistant deputy coroner Julian Fox recorded a verdict of death by misadventure. He said: ‘Bethany had acquired a practice of sniffing aerosols. She had acquired that practice from friends. She did it deliberately that night, she sniffed to inhale. 'But she certainly did not intend the sadly fatal consequences. This is a very tragic case indeed. Bethany had a great life ahead of her. I stress the unpredictability of this practice.’","Bethany Adcock, 14, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, died in her bedroom .

David Cameron said a commitment to strengthening the single market was 'written like a stick of rock through all of the conclusions that we now sign up to' David Cameron today insisted Britain had nothing to fear from a two-speed EU, as countries using the single currency moved ever closer. The Prime Minister hopes to use greater integration among eurozone countries to secure a 'better deal' for Britain, bringing some powers back from Brussels. A new banking watchdog will oversee the 17 countries using the euro, but those outside will not be affected, under a deal agreed in Brussels today. The agreement will prevent eurozone . countries from ganging up on those that have not adopted the single . currency – and protect the City of London from financial regulations . drawn up by the debt-stricken bloc. After . 14 hours of talks, eurozone countries agreed that the European Central . Bank should directly supervise 200 banks – none of which are British – . in the most far-reaching step towards a single-currency superstate since . the euro crisis began. Speaking in Brussels today, Mr Cameron said: 'What you’ll see is a growth of this . multi-faceted Europe and I don’t think it’s something we should be . frightened of at all, I think we should be very confident.' He also backed talks on strengthening the single . market, which he said was now 'written like a stick of rock through all . of the conclusions that we now sign up to'. David Cameron, pictured speaking to German Chancellor Angela Merkel during today's EU, promised to secure 'a better deal for Britain' In future, eurozone banking regulations will have to be approved by a majority of the bloc’s members, as well as a majority of those EU members outside it. This voting system means that a two-tier Europe – long talked of by diplomats – is now the reality. Mr Cameron hailed the agreement as proof that Britain can safeguard its national interests while letting other European countries pursue an economic and monetary union. He said Britain now has ‘opportunities’ to fight for ‘a better deal’, with the summit marking the ‘start of some important conversations where Britain can do better’. The Prime Minister is due to make a speech in the new year spelling out the kind of relationship he wants with the EU, as well as promising a referendum on any new deal. Last night he was locked in talks with fellow EU leaders as they discussed a blueprint for further integration, which is expected to lead to some countries pooling their debts and agreeing their budgets centrally after 2014. European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso suggested that the banking union, agreed in the early hours yesterday, was the start of a United States of Eurozone. Talks: Mr Cameron speaks to the press at the EU Headquarters on Thursday in Brussels, on the first day of a two-day European Union leaders summit . On a mission: Mr Cameron pictured arriving in Brussels on Thursday . ‘We are going to have powers at central level in Europe, through the ECB, very comparable to the United States,’ he said. Chancellor George Osborne described the agreement as ‘a good deal for Britain and a good deal for Europe’. ‘I think it’s a bit of a model of the way Britain’s relationship with Europe is going to work in the future,’ he added. ‘The eurozone is going to do more integration but Britain is going to protect its interests, and it is not going to give any more rights and powers to Brussels.’ George Osborne, left, described the agreement as 'a good deal for Britain and a good deal for Europe', while European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso suggested that the banking union was the start of a United Stated of Eurozone . However, Lord Harrison, of the Lords EU Sub-Committee on Economic and Financial Affairs, said he would summon ministers to ensure the deal is watertight. ‘The Government appear satisfied with the safeguards they have won in ensuring that the interests of the single market are defended – but the devil is in the detail,’ he insisted. ‘The implications of these important first steps towards a banking union could be momentous for the UK, even though we will not be participating. ‘We will be inviting the minister to meet with us early in the new year to explore the ramifications of last night’s deal.’ ■  The European Court of Justice has rejected MEPs’ calls to scrap the European Parliament’s monthly Strasbourg meetings, despite warnings that the 540-mile commute from Brussels costs taxpayers £160million a year. Tory MEP Ashley Fox called the situation ‘ridiculous’.","After 14 hours of talks, eurozone countries agreed that the European Central Bank should directly supervise 200 banks - none of which are British .

A tormented 14-year-old schoolgirl, who 'hated being a teenager' killed herself because she was scared of failing at school, an inquest heard today. Tragic Courtney Gwynn, who wanted to become an actress, was an 'anxious' but 'very bright' girl who was terrified she would get poor grades. The teen, of Carharrack, near Redruth, Cornwall, had become so concerned that, in the days before her death, she had Googled the phrase 'failing at school'. Police also found evidence that she had later also searched the internet for way of ending her life. She left a note telling friends not to be sad if they saw her on television or in the newspapers, adding: 'I just want to end my life.' Cornwall coroner Dr Emma Carlyon ruled out that it was a cry for help, telling Courtney's tearful family that she had made ‘dark writings about how hard growing up was at this time’ and the ‘social pressures on her’. The coroner said poems and writings in books were found in her bedroom as well as internet research into suicide in the hours before she died. Dr Carlyon told the family: 'No one could have seen this coming'. Courtney, who was found dead by her mother on January 6 this year, did not suffer any mental illness but there was evidence she worried about failing at school, the coroner ruled.

Tormented: She had become so concerned that, in the days before her death, she had Googled the phrase 'failing at school' Playful: Her mum Agnes said her youngest child was 'very bright, intellectual and creative' but always compared herself to other people . She added: 'Courtney asked me what I did at her age because there was nothing to do. She said she hated being a teenager in this decade.' The inquest heard how Courtney also complained that live bands were stopped from playing because of the noise they made and 'regulations were getting in the way of fun and stopping expressing themselves’. And while she did not have a boyfriend, some of her girlfriends did which made her feel a 'gooseberry'. Her mother, Agnes, said her youngest child was ‘very bright, intellectual and creative’ but always compared herself to other people, adding: 'She got bogged down with . worry about what to do with her life. I really did not see this coming. It is so terribly tragic and out of the blue.' Popular: Courtney's family described her as a 'regular teenager, with a good circle of friends, that was doing well at school' Lonely: She was spending more and more time alone and told friends at Penair school near Truro that she 'did not care about dying' 'She switched off, this was someone else completely, not the actions of my daughter.' Her father, a company director, told the hearing: 'A lot of factors all built up. The New Year party had been cancelled, her mother had a car accident the day before, different things all built up and it was too much for her.' Speaking after the inquest, Courtney’s mother Agnes said: 'Today, our family is coming to terms with the loss of its youngest member - our daughter, sister and granddaughter. 'She was a regular teenager, with a good circle of friends, and was doing well at school. 'She gave absolutely no reason for anyone to believe that such a devastating tragedy was about to unfold.

Nintendo launched its eagerly anticipated Wii U in the UK last night - the first major home console launch since 2006. Hundreds of fans queued in central London ahead of the official launch at midnight. The release of the console is seen by industry experts as something as a last chance for Nintendo to stay at the forefront of gaming. It posted its first-ever loss last year and is slipping behind as handheld gaming improves. Scroll down for video . worth the wait: Izzy Rahman, 25, from London is the first person in the UK to buy the Nintendo Wii U, from the HMV store on London's Oxford Street, after queuing for six days . Dedication: Around 300 fans braved the freezing temperatures to get their hands on the Wii U . The original Wii changed the way many viewed home gaming when it was released six years. But after the rapid developments made in smartphone and tablet technology the Japanese company hopes its latest offering will do the same again. On Thursday night, close to 300 fans queued outside HMV's Oxford Street store, which hosted the official midnight launch following the US release earlier this month, a spokesman for Nintendo said. HMV ensured it was well-stocked for the launch following high demand for pre-orders. In the US, all 400,000 units sold out in a week. The Wii U features the GamePad controller, a tablet-type device that allows users to continue playing after the connected television has been turned off or switched to another channel. The controller boasts a 6.2in touchscreen display and a three to five-hour battery life. Among the games expected to be best-sellers are ZombiU, which carries an 18 age restriction, Nintendo Land - the Wii Sports for the new console - and New Super Mario Bros U. The Wii U is being seen by the industry as Nintendo's last chance to turn around its fortunes . Joy: Izzy Rahman shows his delight at finally being let into the store . The console has received mixed reviews in the US, with most concerns surrounding the amount of games that will be available to justify the minimum £250 cost. Others have mentioned the controller’s weak battery performance, a lack of stand-out launch games and frustrating menus and online services. Four men had camped outside the store since Saturday to ensure they would be the first to lay their hands on the console. But the majority of the crowd joined the queue on Thursday evening, entertained by a DJ set and gaming experts. The original console revolutionised gaming with its infra-red motion-capture controllers that allowed users to play games such as golf and tennis by actually mimicking the actions. But industry experts have already questioned the new console. 'The machine is actually quite hard to understand - or perhaps to see the point of,' Oli Walsh, the deputy editor of eurogamer, told the Guardian. Nintendo UK marketing director Shelly Pearce said: 'We can’t wait to get the Wii U into the hands of our fans in the UK.' But she did admit it was a 'complicated device to explain in words'.","Company launched Wii console in 2006, revolutionising home gaming .

The harrowing moment a high-flying financial adviser murdered the mother of his newborn daughter was recorded on the voicemail of a mobile phone, a court heard today. In the eight-minute recording - during which time it is believed the 28-year-old mother died - Paul Keene can be heard threatening to kill her amidst sounds of choking, banging and screaming. Keene can then be heard strangling his partner with a dressing gown cord - and when that failed - an electrical cable, at which point she can be heard uttering her last words 'please don't'. Tragic: Carmen Miron-Buchacra, 28, pictured, was strangled by her partner in a drink-fuelled rage which was recorded on her friend's mobile phone, a court heard today . Financial adviser Paul Keene, pictured with his partner known as Gaby, allegedly strangled her with a dressing gown cord and then an electrical cable . The 32-year-old snapped and strangled . his girlfriend, 'outstanding and gifted' PhD student Carmen Gabriela Miron-Buchacra, in a . drink-fuelled rage, Bristol Crown Court was told. Mexican-born Miss Miron-Buchacra, . a student at Bath University’s Department of Biology and Biochemistry, . begged for her life as Keene throttled her with an electrical flex as . the couple’s 11-week-old baby lay in a cot nearby. Her desperate fight . for life as she tried to fend off the attack was . caught in a telephone call to one of their friends on the night of June . 23 this year, the court heard. Keene can be heard swearing at his partner and threatening to kill her during the eight-minute call. The court heard it was recorded on . the answerphone of Ben Jones and showed how she was repeatedly punched . in the face and strangled with a dressing gown cord and electrical . cable. Terrified Miss Miron-Buchacra - known as Gaby - called her friend when Keene arrived at their home following an all day drinking binge at a game of boules. But Ben was out of signal and did not answer the call - meaning that Miss Miron-Buchacra’s last moments and the horrific killing was recorded on his answerphone. Mother-of-one Miss Miron-Buchacra can be heard pleading as Keene repeatedly punched her in the face, telling her to shut up or 'you will be dead'. The chilling recording ends after eight minutes and 29 seconds - moments after Miss Miron-Buchacra gasped 'please don’t' and falls silent. Miss Miron-Buchacra’s body was later discovered lying in a semi-foetal position at the couple’s upmarket flat in Bath, Somerset. Keene, an administrator for a . financial services firm, was arrested and charged with murder. He appeared at Bristol Crown Court where he denied the charge but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of loss of control. The court heard the couple, pictured, were engaged to be married and their 11-week-old baby slept nearby as the alleged killing unfolded . The jury were told how in the recording Keene can be heard snarling: 'Why are you crying? 'What the f*** is your problem? What have I done to you today? 'Carry on like this and I’m going to end up in prison because you will be dead. 'I may kill you because you are a f****** twat.' Michael Fitton, QC, prosecuting, described how Keene first tried to strangle Miss Miron-Buchacra using a dressing gown cord before switching to an electrical cable to ensure her death. He said: 'She told him to stop and she can be heard screaming and the sounds of choking and struggling can be heard. 'She was begging him to stop and she was pleading with him to get off her. The defendant said, ""you f****** b****, I will kill you"". Then there are more sounds of choking, banging and screaming. 'Her last words were, ""please don’t"", then silence.' He added: 'When he took hold of the dressing gown cord and wrapped it around his her neck he was clearly trying to kill her. 'When he failed in that attempt and reached for the electrical cable he was showing a persistence to kill her that is at odds with his defence.' Mr Fitton told how Miss Miron-Buchacra and Keene, who were planning to marry in the autumn of 2013, had been together for two years but their relationship had recently soured. On the day of the Miss Miron-Buchacra’s death, June 23, 2012, the couple had exchanged a number of angry text messages as he spent the day at a boules tournament with colleagues from Advanced Investments. He had then met friends in the evening for food and drinks. The home in Bath, circled in red, where Keene is alleged to have murdered his 'outstanding and gifted' university student girlfriend . Meanwhile, Miss Miron-Buchacra was at . home looking after their daughter Eleanor and was becoming increasingly . annoyed at Keene’s decision to go out for the day. She accused him of not wanting to spend time with her and Eleanor. Mr Fitton said that by late afternoon . Miss Miron-Buchacra had walked with Eleanor the short distance from . their flat to where Keene was playing boules. 'Gaby had some time talking with Paul . Keene and from her expression it seems she was angered by the fact he . had said to her something to the effect of ""get used to it"",' Mr Fitton . said. 'She didn’t stay for long and she left with the baby and went to the flat, five to 10 minutes away.' Mr Fitton said that as the evening . progressed text messages between Miss Miron-Buchacra and Keene showed an 'increase in her irritation and the intensity of her mood'. 'Clearly she was still very angry with him and she told him not to come home,' he said. 'By 8.45pm she had made it clear she was not going to let him in at home that night.' After angry text messages had continued for more than 12 hours in total, drunken Keene turned up at the flat, having drunk eight bottles of beer and a bottle of lager and cider. He went upstairs to the front door of the flat and texted Miss Miron-Buchacra to let him in. She immediately replied: 'You’re at . the door? I told you if you went out of this house and our life for a . whole day, you do it for life.' Keene replied: 'Open it or I’ll kick it in.' Frightened Miss Miron-Buchacra called friend Ben for help but was forced to open the door after her friend lost signal during the call, as he was travelling on a train. She then called him for a second time . but was diverted to his voice mail, leaving the phone recording, as . Keene launched his fatal attack. When he got off the train, Mr Jones . realised there was a message on his mobile phone that was an argument . between Keene and his partner. The call lasted for eight minutes from 10.45pm until . 10.53pm. It is believed Miss Miron-Buchacra died during the duration of the call. Mr Fitton said: 'He could hear that Gaby was crying . and was accusing Paul Keene of being drunk and to get out and leave the . flat. 'Without listening to all of the call, he tried ringing Paul Keene to try and speak to him but got no reply. 'He also tried ringing Gaby but got no reply.' Then Mr Jones sent text messages to Miss Miron-Buchacra asking if she was okay. At 11.30pm he received a reply, . in which she said 'It’s okay Ben, I’m okay.' He asked her to call him but two minutes later Mr Jones received a reply, which said 'Just gone out for a walk to calm down. Mr Jones also sent a message to Keene saying he had 10 minutes to get Gaby to ring him or he was calling the police. At 11.18pm Keene replied and said: 'What? I got home and she’d gone crazy.' He sent a further message saying Miss . Miron-Buchacra had gone out for a walk and added: 'She went mental on . me mate because I played boule. Gaby told me off, accusing me of putting . work before family. It’s bullshit. I love my family xx.' Mr Jones called the emergency services and police and paramedics arrived at the scene and discovered Miss Miron-Buchacra’s body on the bedroom floor of their first-floor Georgian flat in Bath shortly after midnight. Keene was arrested and admitted killing his fiancee during interview but said he could remember only vague details. He denies murder and his trial continues.

Fraud: Abigail Martin, pictured in Antigua on her wedding day, swindled £10,000 from taxpayers . A benefit cheat who used taxpayers' money to pay for a luxury wedding in the Caribbean has escaped jail. Abigail Martin spent three years pretending to be a single parent in order to claim more than £10,000 in housing and council tax benefits to which she was not entitled. During this time she lived a lavish lifestyle, paying frequent visits to luxury hotels and spas, holidaying in Florida and even getting married on the island of Antigua. The 40-year-old mother of two claimed that she lived alone with her children in Bexhill, Sussex - when in fact she was living with the man she would later marry in a £3,500-a-head ceremony. Martin was rumbled when benefits workers found out that she had got married without telling them - and were apparently 'stunned' to discover her wedding photographs, which showed her beaming on the sun-drenched island. Magistrates in Hastings heard that she had used money she swindled from taxpayers to fund her 'very expensive' wedding last year. She also took her family to Walt Disney World in Florida, where they enjoyed pricey funfair rides and hotels. And Martin would spend pampered weekends at spa getaways in luxury hotels in Britain. She falsified documents by failing to declare that she had been living with her partner since 2009 and that the couple were married in 2011. But when she re-applied for benefits in January this year, workers reported their suspicions and she was subjected to an investigation by Rother District Council and the Department for Work and Pensions. Officials built a case against the fraudster using evidence which included her tell-tale wedding photos. Martin pleaded guilty to benefit fraud and received a suspended sentence - despite being told that she would normally have faced jail time. She was given a 24-week sentence suspended for 18 months, ordered to complete 240 hours of unpaid work and told to pay £2,000 in costs. Luxury: Martin was married to her partner on the sun-drenched Caribbean island last year (file photo) A spokesman for Rother District Council said following the court case this week: 'The lifestyle being led by Abigail Martin at the expense of the taxpayer was as remarkable as it was appalling. 'The benefit system should be helping people in genuine need, not people who cheat the system and pay for extravagances of the sort magistrates were told about. 'This should act as a clear message to people who are claiming false benefits. You will be caught and the punishment can be severe. 'Abigail Martin was very fortunate indeed not to go to prison.'

A California care home worker was arrested today after a DNA test revealed his alleged ties to the heinous rape of a disabled woman in his care. Authorities in Placer County were alerted to the crime at the Casa Del Mar Care Facility in Penryn last year when the woman, who is blind and seriously handicapped, was found to be pregnant. Investigators believed at the time that the woman, who was not identified, may have been sexually assaulted. Fox 40 reported that Marquise Montgomery, 22, who had worked at Casa Del Mar, was arrested on Thursday after a key piece of DNA evidence linked him to the crime. Montgomery had since left his job at the care facilty. Montgomery's arrest was a year in the making, as authorities could not positively link . Montgomery to the crime until they could obtain a DNA sample from the woman's child, who was born in April. Once investigators had the sample, they tested it with DNA of workers at the care facility - and Montgomery was a match, according to Fox 40. Police found Montgomery in Sacramento and charged him with rape. He is currently being held at the Placer County Jail in lieu of $150,000 bail. Montgomery is due back in court tomorrow.

A mother whose two young children were fatally stabbed dozens of times in their beds by their cardiologist father has revealed her outrage that he has been freed after just three years. Dr. Isabelle Gaston has lambasted the court system for letting her ex-husband, Guy Turcotte, walk the streets of Montreal - and potentially practice medicine again - after killing their children in 2009. Turcotte confessed to stabbing five-year-old Olivier 20 times and three-year-old Anne-Sophie 19 times but, a year later, a Canadian jury failed to convict him of the murders, citing mental illness. He testified that he did not remember killing the children and had not wanted to, but that pressure of his crumbling marriage had sparked blackouts. Dr. Gaston had left him for her personal trainer. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Dr. Isabelle Gaston has spoken out against her ex-husband's release from a psychiatric institution just three years after he admitted repeatedly stabbing their two young children in their beds . On Wednesday, a mental health review board deemed that, while he still posed a risk, he could be released from a psychiatric institution, the Pinel Institute, under strict rules. He is now a free man and said he intends to re-apply for his medical license. He also said he hopes to fall in love again and have more children, the National Post reported. In his trial, two psychiatrists for the defense testified Turcotte could not have known what he was doing, but Dr. Gaston told CNN she does not believe his claims of mental illness. 'We have a person that is . a cardiologist that never had a psychiatric incident, not at all,' she said. 'I . have trouble to understand how someone in five hours or six hours will . do an interview of someone and have a conclusion that he is not a danger . to society or is mentally insane. Killer: Guy Turcotte, a Quebec cardiologist, said he blacked out at the time of the killings due to stress over his crumbling marriage. He was not convicted of the murders due to mental illness . Murdered: Three-year-old Anna-Sophie, left, and five-year-old Olivier, right, died from their stab wounds . 'I have to respect [the jury's] decision but it confronts me and my values because I think they didn't do their job.' Gaston told CTV News she has spent a . year researching similar cases and has seen large disparities in the . results depending on the judge, the experience of the lawyers and even . how rich the defendant is, as it influences the quality of the defense. She added that she now lives in fear of what her ex-husband could do next. 'What brought him to do that is still there,' she said. 'Is it going to be me? Is it going to be another woman?' In court: The jury did not convict Turcotte in 2009 and he has been undergoing therapy ever since . Last sighting: The children had gone to Turcotte's home for a movie night. They are pictured with him on surveillance footage picking up films from a store on the night they were killed . Guy . Turcotte, who was never convicted of murder, has re-applied for his . medical license. When he worked as a cardiologist, he never had any . complaints brought against him. Yet former health minister Yves Bolduc told CJAD that he doubts Turcotte will ever be able to practice medicine again. Bolduc said that in light of his actions, it is unlikely Turcotte will be able to regain his licence. 'He did something very important,' Bolduc said. But the decision will be down to the Quebec College of Medicine. 'The . college won't accept that,' Boldus said. 'I don't want to decide for . the college, but if you look at it, it's going to be very difficult for . him to practice again.' She said that she is still haunted . by the deaths of her children, who were also covered in defensive . wounds. Her son did not have one single fatal wound, so she knows he died a long, painful death. 'To know that my children faced the . person that they should have trusted the most and they were left by . themselves to die, no one holding their hand,' Gaston said as she struggled to contain her tears. 'I struggle all the days, every day of my life, and I think until I . die I will struggle.' The release has outraged Quebec . residents and even the Canadian government has called Turcotte's release . on Thursday 'unacceptable'. 'We . believe that Isabelle Gaston does not deserve to live in fear of her . children's killer and neither do victims of similar crimes across . Canada,' said federal cabinet minister James Moore. Prime Minster Stephen Harper's government is drafting legislation to make it more difficult for mentally ill offenders to be released from psychiatric facilities, yet it will not influence Turcotte's case. Happier times: Turcotte, who is re-applying for his medical license, hopes to have more children . Rage: His ex-wife believes Turcotte killed their children out of revenge for her leaving him for another man . Torn apart: Dr Gaston said she lives in fear of her former husband hurting others when he is released . For . now, he has been released on conditions that he does not contact his . ex-wife or her family, that he continues his therapy and that he lives . at an address approved by the Pinel . Institute. He is not taking any medication for mental illness, CNN . reported. The release comes after Turcotte underwent six months of regular therapy, which he said has left him less anxious, CTV reported. He said he is able to deal with stress better now. Pierre Rochette has been overseeing his mental health for the past six months and said he is 'really satisfied' with the change in the man, and believes he does not present a short-term danger. The Crown has filed an appeal in the case, which will be heard in the new year.

Thomas Ammann, 39, pictured yesterday as he was jailed, handed over price sensitive details to his two girlfriends about a takeover bid . The serial love-rat who tricked two of his girlfriends into carrying out illegal trades worth almost £1.8million was jailed for two years and eight months yesterday. Thomas Ammann, who wears a toupee, persuaded Christina Weckwerth and Jessica Mang to buy and sell shares in a firm he knew to be the subject of a future City takeover bid. Ammann, who worked at the London offices of Japanese bank Mizuho, was one of only seven at the bank who knew that global electronics company Canon was planning a takeover of Dutch printing firm Oce. His two girlfriends, who had no knowledge of each other, bought and sold shares in Oce when Ammann told them to do so. The women almost doubled their investments and paid Ammann about 50 per cent of their profits. They said they had no idea his share tips were coming from sensitive insider information and were cleared of any wrongdoing last month. When police arrested Ammann, 39, in his central London home, he was in bed with a Japanese woman. At some point, he started a relationship with a fourth woman who gave birth to their baby son six weeks ago. She fled home to China when the extent of his murky dealings emerged. Jailing Ammann at Southwark Crown Court yesterday, Judge Anthony Leonard QC said he ‘manipulated’ his two girlfriends to make substantial profits. He said: ‘The City has been held in increasingly low esteem over recent years, not least because of the activities of a few unscrupulous and dishonest persons.’ Ammann, a German national, pleaded guilty to two counts of encouraging insider dealing and two counts of insider trading earlier this year.

The Milwaukee woman who brutally killed a pregnant mother and tried to steal her full-term fetus has been sentenced Thursday to life in prison without the possibility of extended supervision. Annette Morales-Rodriguez, 34, was convicted earlier this year of two counts of first degree intentional homicide; one each for Maritza Ramirez-Cruz and her unborn son. Morales-Rodriguez told investigators after her arrest that she was desperate to give her boyfriend a son, and that she drove around for days before the murder looking for a pregnant woman to kill. Annette Morales-Rodriguez, right, has been sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of killing a pregnant woman and trying to steal her fetus . Morales-Rodriguez's trial: Prosecutor Mark Williams gestures toward a photo of Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, the pregnant woman who was killed and disemboweled last year . Morales-Rodriguez, 34, has been sentenced to life in prison for found guilty of the murder of Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, pictured, and her unborn son . In September a jury of six men and six . women convicted Morales-Rodriguez of two counts of first-degree . intentional homicide in the October 2011 deaths of the mother and fetus. Wisconsin doesn't have the death penalty. Prosecutors said Morales-Rodriguez faked a pregnancy, panicked as her supposed due date approached and then lured 23-year-old Maritza Ramirez-Cruz to her house. There, she attacked her and used an X-Acto knife to cut the fetus out, according to the criminal complaint. Ramirez-Cruz died of blood loss and asphyxiation, and her fetus, a boy, died as a result of her death, authorities say. Morales-Rodriguez's defense attorneys didn't deny that she attacked Ramirez-Cruz. But they argued that the deaths of the mother and fetus weren't intentional because Morales-Rodriguez didn't intend for anyone to die. Morales-Rodriguez did not testify during the trial, and her attorneys did not call any witnesses. The strongest evidence against Morales-Rodriguez was a videotaped interview she gave to police in which she recounted the attack. Victim: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, 23, was expecting her fourth child when she was murdered last October. Her baby boy, who she planned to call Omar, also died . Guilty: Morales-Rodriguez admitted she had scoured the suburban Milwaukee neighborhood for two weeks looking for a pregnant woman whose child she could steal . Difficult: Christian Mercado, husband of Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, cries during the trial over the attacking and disemboweling of his wife . She explained to investigators that she was desperate to give her boyfriend a son but that she couldn't 'stay pregnant.' She said she twice pretended to be pregnant, only to claim each time that she miscarried. When she lied about a third pregnancy, she considered another scenario: killing a pregnant woman and stealing her baby. She described how she went to a Hispanic community center and found Ramirez-Cruz, a mother of three who was in her 40th week of pregnancy. Morales-Rodriguez told police she bashed Ramirez-Cruz in the head with a baseball bat, then choked her until she passed out. She said she then put duct tape over the younger woman's eyes and nose and wrapped a plastic bag around her head. Family torn apart: The mother, pictured centre, already had three children before she was brutally murdered . She then used a small blade to slice the victim open from hip to hip and pulled out a stillborn boy, Morales-Rodriguez said in the videotape. She then called 911, telling a dispatcher she had just given birth to a baby who wasn't breathing. In the ensuing investigation and autopsy, a medical examiner found evidence that the baby wasn't the product of a natural birth. A subsequent examination verified Morales-Rodriguez hadn't given birth.

It looks more suited to the battlefield of Agincourt to protect against the volleys of French arrows. But this medieval-style chain mail mask is actually a rare survivor of the Western Front of the First World War. It was worn by the pioneering British tank drivers at the Battle of Cambrai in 1917. Masked men: Tanks were first deployed in 1917 to break the stalemate of trench warfare and suitable protection had to be created . The vehicles, which were still in their infancy as machines of war, were piloted from fume-filled cabins. And the drivers were often at risk of taking red hot shards of metal in the face as enemy machine gun fire and shells smashed into the exterior. And so these masks were designed to protect the drivers faces and eyes in the heat of battle.However, very few survived the war. The face mask is expected to fetch £600 when it comes up for auction at Bosleys, in Marlow, Bucks, on Wednesday. Tanks were developed during the First World War in bid to break the stalemate of trench warfare. A prototype vehicle, nicknamed Little Willie, was constructed by the British company William Foster & Co, during August and September, 1915. Chain drivers: The mask was designed to protect the tank drivers from flying shrapnel when their vehicles came under fire . German soldiers dig out a British tank that became stuck behind enemy lines after the counter-offensive at Cambrai . The headgear resembles that worn by soldiers down the centuries. Pictured is a suit of armour from 17th century Poland . This provided the basis for the Mark I tank that was demonstrated to the Army on February 2, 1916. Although initially called 'land ships', the vehicles were nicknamed 'tanks' to preserve secrecy after it became known that the factory workers referred to the first prototype as 'the tank' because of its resemblance to a steel water tank. The heavily shelled terrain around the trenches and in no-man's land was impassable to conventional vehicles. The Mark I's rhomboid shape, caterpillar tracks, and 26 feet length meant that it could navigate obstacles, especially wide trenches, that wheeled vehicles could not. However, the first tanks were highly unreliable, with a number of mechanical problems that caused considerable attrition rates during combat deployment and transit. By the time of the battle of Cambrai . in November/December 1917, the British had already used more than 200 . tanks in Flanders in June and July. The French, meanwhile, had deployed . large numbers in April, May and October of that year. Battlelines: Tanks were developed in a bid to end the stalemate of trench warfare of the Western Front . But Cambrai was the first time they were used in significant force, with a battleplan especially designed to utilise the new capability . Those deployed by the British at Cambrai were Mark IV tanks and despite initial success, German artillery and infantry defences exposed the frailties of their armour and the vehicles became mostly ineffective after the first day. Tank design gradually improved in the inter-war period and during the Second World War, where they had once been used to support infantry, the concept of Blitzkrieg made tanks a formidable branch of the army in their own right. efore the end of the war, tanks had surpassed infantry as the most important force on the battlefield. The battle of Cambrai started well for the British forces, before they were defeated by a German counter-attack . The Battle of Cambrai proved to be a significant event in the First World War. The town itself was important because it contained a strategic railhead and was near the Hindenburg Line - the Germans' vast network of defences in northeastern France. And so, as the battle of Passchendaele was being fought, General Haig approved a plan to take on the Germans by sweeping round the back of Cambrai and encircling the town. It was the first battle in which tanks were used en masse, with the British deploying a mixture of tanks, heavy artillery and air power - though some in the military did not yet believe that tanks were effective in battle. Suddenly there was place for mobility on the battlefield - and despite the problems encountered by the British and the Germans speed at countering the threat from the tanks, the nature of the war was changed. The British plan included an attack on the Hindenburg Line and the use of three cavalry divisions that would encircle Cambrai, thus cutting it off. While Haig's plan won the approval of some, others were less than inspired that it included tanks as these new weapons had yet to prove their worth in battle in the eyes of some. The attack started at 6.20am on November 20, 1917 with an intense artillery attack directly on the Hindenburg Line, which surprised the Germans. Then 350 British tanks began their advance across the ground supported by infantry - both were assisted by an artillery rolling barrage that gave them cover from a German counter-attack. The bulk of the initial attack went well. The 62nd Division (West Riding) covered more than five miles in this attack from their starting point. Compared to the gains made at battles such as the Somme and Verdun, such a distance was astonishing. Defeated: A British tank that had been destroyed during the battle of Cambrai . However, not everything had gone to plan when a tank crossing the St Quentin Canal broke the bridge that the the 2nd Cavalry Division were supposed to use to advance to Cambrai. Elsewhere, British units got bogged down in their attack, becoming isolated and seeing the command structure break down. By November 30, the Germans were ready to counter-attack and defend Cambrai. This was so effective that on December 3, Haig gave the order for the British units still near to Cambrai to withdraw 'with the least possible delay from the Bourlon Hill-Macoing salient to a more retired and shorter line'. While losses did not equate to the Somme or Verdun, the British lost over 44,000 men during the battle while the Germans lost about 45,000 men. The initial phase of the battle did show that mobility was possible in the war but that to sustain it, a decent command structure was needed to coordinate best to take advantage of the situations. And the failure to build on the initial success of the attack was blamed on the British middle-ranking commanders - some of whom were sacked.

Fiddled: Moran, 57, who represented Luton South for 13 years, claimed nearly her entire annual allowance in one bogus expense entry and forged invoices for more than £20,000 . Disgraced former Labour MP Margaret Moran has been spared jail for fiddling expenses to receive more than £53,000 from the taxpayer. Moran, 57, who represented Luton South for 13 years, claimed nearly her entire annual allowance in one bogus expense entry and forged invoices for more than £20,000 for non-existent goods and services. The MP's claims were the largest amount uncovered in the wake of the MPs' expenses scandal, but she does not receive a criminal conviction after a judge ruled she was unfit to stand trial for mental health reasons. She was sentenced today at Southwark . Crown Court to a two year supervision and treatment order after her lawyers told the court she is so mentally ill she cannot leave home without being restrained. However, only last month, she was photographed . popping out to the pub without any apparent need for restraints. And it emerged today that she could still be forced to repay the money after the prosecution revealed that they were considering taking civil action against the MP to recover it. Mrs Moran was not present at Southwark to hear Mr Justice Saunders make the ruling. He said: 'There will inevitably be feelings among some that Mrs Moran has ""got away with it"". 'What . the court has done and has to do is to act in accordance with the law . of the land and on the basis of the evidence that it hears.' The judge said two distinguished . psychiatrists instructed by the defence had concluded she was unfit to . plead, and a psychiatrist instructed by the prosecution broadly agreed. 'All the evidence in the case was . that she was unfit to plead. If I had reached any other conclusion my . decision would have been perverse and would inevitably have been . successfully appealed.' A jury decided that she did the acts alleged against her, and the defence played little if any part in the hearing. 'The findings of the court were not . convictions. Those findings enable me to make orders requiring her to . undergo treatment for her mental health,' the judge added. Out and about: Former MP Margaret Moran is pictured leaving a pub in Southampton only five days after she was deemed unfit to stand trial . Able to drink: Despite a judge ruling she was too fragile to defend herself in court, MP Margaret Moran appeared to enjoy a glass of red wine at the pub near her Hampshire home . Up for a walk: Ms Moran was later seen at Lepe Country Park, walking her dog with her husband last month . Dr Simon Kelly, from the Priory Hospital in Southampton, said that he last saw Moran on Tuesday and that she was teetering on the brink of a breakdown as a result of the press coverage surrounding her case. 'She is experiencing panic attacks which make her believe she is going to be door-stepped at any point,' he told the court. Moran submitted parliamentary expense forms (censored example pictured) for . claims including £979.84 for a kitchen that was never installed, £2,283 for a telephone line . that did not exist and £2,678.76 for a carpet she went on to claim for again. In one case she claimed £22,500 . - just under the annual maximum expense allowance for an MP - to treat dry rot . at her Southampton home, using the money instead to pay for a lavish . refurbishment. She arranged for the taxpayer to . foot the bill for personal expenses totalling nearly £60,000 between 2004 and . 2008. During that time the former . Luton South MP also ‘flipped’ her designated second home in order to make . claims for properties in London, Luton and Southampton. 'There is almost a tendency for her to feel threatened whenever she does leave home.’ Kelly said Moran would have had to be forced to come to court, such is the severity of her physical and mental conditions. 'She has severe and concentrated panic attacks, nausea, and vomiting', he said. 'I don’t believe it would be possible to physically remove her from home without restraints.' Mr Justice Saunders said one report . had indicated Moran could suffer a massive heart attack if she was . forced to sit in the dock. Dr Kelly replied: 'She has suffered raised . blood pressure for some months and had to attend casualty because of an . allergic reaction to hypertension medicine. 'She extremely distressed.' He added: 'She's living a restricted . lifestyle, she's not answered the telephone at home for approximately . three years, she goes out very occasionally, to a local supermarket for . 30 minutes.' Meanwhile, her barrister Jim Sturman QC attacked press intrusion into her life in the wake of the scandal. ‘The more vengeful form of press who hounded her at her front door seem to think only someone is demonstrably mentally ill is in a straight jacket in a padded cell drooling and incapable of speech’, he said. ‘The hounding of a mentally ill woman is a dangerous and vile thing to do at any time, particularly post-Leveson,' he added. Changed: Ms Moran's appearance had changed dramatically since the 2010 election when she appeared at a court hearing in September 2011 . Paparazzi photographers snapped Moran two weeks ago walking her dog with her husband, and stopping at a pub near to her home. ‘Mrs Moran’s husband was distressed by the attempt to door step her two weeks ago’, said Mr Sturman. ‘All reports agreed it could have led to an increased risk of suicide. ‘The headlines in The Sun show there are always people who believe it is a huge con. ‘But none of them read all the evidence, and the person best placed to make the decisions is My Lord.’","Ex-Labour MP forged invoices to claim biggest sum in expenses scandal .

You would think that flying around the world in a sleigh with reindeer, going down chimneys and eating all those mince pies would be among the most serious health hazards for Father Christmas. But poor old Santa has been banned from sitting on his float in Sutton, south London, after a health and safety assessment found it to be too dangerous - so he will have to walk alongside instead. The ruling brings to an end a 46-year tradition in the town, and a plastic Santa will be placed on the float instead - while the human Santa walks alongside the float, collecting money from residents. It's a fake! The ruling brings to an end a 46-year tradition in the town, and a plastic Santa will be placed on the float instead - while the human Santa walks alongside the float, collecting money from residents . The Cheam Round Table's fundraising float has been a highlight of the festive calendar, raising more than £130,000 for local charities since it started in 1966. In recent years it has been taken over the Rotary Club of Cheam, and after a health and safety assessment this year they ruled it was too dangerous for Santa to sit on top of the 10ft float. The float used to travel at walking pace around residential streets of Cheam and Worcester Park with a volunteer dressed as Father Christmas on top of it in the three-week run up to Christmas. In previous years he stood inside the vehicle, with his upper body above the sun roof - but there are concerns this year over a new vehicle that meant he would have to sit in a bolted-down chair. Grounding Santa has caused a row with former members of Cheam Round Table, which set up the tradition in 1966, and passed over running the float to the rotary club in 2009. An insurance firm willing to insure the float with Santa on top was found, but the rotary club still decided to scrap the tradition. Days gone by: The Cheam Round Table's fundraising float with a human Santa on top (in 2006) has been a highlight of the festive calendar, raising more than £130,000 for local charities since it started in 1966 . Jeff Jones who is the chairman of Cheam 41, a group made up of former Round Table members, said: ‘The float has been going for 40-odd years and Father Christmas has never fallen off. There were various predecessors to the modern-day Father Christmas who we know. One was the Norse God Odin, who had a blue cloak and white beard. He rode through the winter world and gave gifts or punishments to people, so was both loved and feared. Then there was the fourth-century Bishop of Myra, also known as Saint Nicholas, who was known for being kind to children and the poor. Father Christmas has represented kindness and happiness since medieval times. The Dutch took the story of a legendary gift-bearer called 'Sinterklaas' to the U.S. in the 19th century, where he became known as Santa Claus. ‘I had a big row with [the president of Cheam Rotary], but I couldn't get him to change his mind. I said it was ridiculous. Common sense has gone out of the window.’ Mother-of-three Sara Palmer, 43, from Sutton, has gone to see the float every year since she was a child and said it was a family tradition to visit the sleigh. She said: ‘Not having him on top for three weeks of the year is ridiculous. The kids were like “Where's Santa?” 'It's just taking the magic out of it and they raise so much money for charity. It was always the highlight of Christmas.’ The sleigh was saved by the Rotary Club of Cheam in 2009 after the closure of its former organisers, the Cheam Round Table. Peter Bright, 71, from Banstead, is an honorary member of the rotary club and former member of the round table, who still helps to organise its tour each year. Plastic Santa: Grounding Father Christmas has caused a row with former members of Cheam Round Table, which set up the tradition in 1966, and passed over running the float to the rotary club in 2009 . He said he found a company that would insure the sleigh with Father Christmas on top -  but the majority decision taken by the rotary club meant that Santa would not be sitting on the float. Cheam Rotary Club president Stephen . Cunningham, 52, from Wallington, who has qualifications in health and . safety, said: ‘From our point of view it's a serious matter. 'Not having him on top for three weeks of the year is ridiculous. The kids were like ""Where's Santa?"" It's just taking the magic out of it and they raise so much money for charity. It was always the highlight of Christmas' Sara Palmer, 43, from Sutton . ‘We didn't take this decision light-heartedly. I work in the construction industry and I have an obligation to make sure everyone goes home safely every night.’ ‘We have got a new vehicle this year and someone proposed we had someone sitting on a chair bolted to the roof. But it is very dangerous - not only for us. So we said we couldn't do that. ‘Another rotary club somewhere else in the country had an accident. From my own point of view we have found it better with Santa walking as he is able to interact with the youngsters better.’ Responding to negativity from some ex-Round Table members, he said: ‘They were doing it 30 or 40 years ago when health and safety wasn't such a big issue. You have to adapt to changing times.’","The ruling brings to an end a 46-year tradition in Sutton, south London .

Merlin – one of the most popular shows on TV – is coming to PC, bringing with him the wondrous fantasy world fans know and love. Thankfully, BAFTA-winning Bossa studios are behind the project, and have developed a game that places a strong emphasis on cooperative, pick-up-and-play gameplay. Pretty: The visuals stay true to the series but have a cartoon-like feel about them . Merlin: The Game is free to play on Facebook, and combines authentic style with striking visuals. Players can embark on a magical adventure with friends to battle against the evil forces that threaten Camelot. We talked to Creator in Chief, Imre Jele, on what fans can expect from the game: . Take us through Merlin. Imre: 'We wanted to create a fantasy game for quite some time and it made sense to work with a very good like brand like Merlin. 'We asked ourselves how we can make a game that is an authentic extension of the show and not an exploitation of the brand. 'The show is about three things: heroism, fighting off evil creatures and comradery, this being the relationship between Arthur and Merlin, or Arthur and Gwen. Have you brought characters over from the universe itself, or have you created your own characters? Imre: 'Both, we call it Season A. It takes place in the same universe at Season 5 and therefore you’re going to meet all those characters. 'You get quests from Merlin, Arthur and Giaus and interact with them throughout the game.' Adventure for all: The game is free and can be played at any time on Facebook . What made you want to make this game free to play? Imre: 'We decided a game based on this IP has to meaningfully expand upon it and it cannot be just exploitation. 'The reason we decide to go for a model where you don’t pay upfront is firstly because we believe the game is good enough to be able to work as a freemium model and secondly because everyone and anyone who wants to try it can play the game. 'That’s why the game is on Facebook - we wanted to make sure we opened up this game to as many people as we can. 'The visuals speak for themselves, this quite a unique looking game, not something you’re going to find on the market. You’re not going to find any other game on the platform like this.' Character customisation is a huge part of this. How have you managed to tailor that kind of freedom without it jarring the game universe? Imre: 'Because we wanted to make an accessible game we decided we won’t have classes, so it’s not like traditional games where you choose your class and you’re stuck with it. 'I didn’t want anyone to feel they can’t change their mind and be penalised for their starting choice.' Work together: You can work through the adventures with any of your friends . Tell us about cooperative play. Imre: 'We wanted to combine the good elements of a role-playing game but at the same time is simple enough so somebody who’s new can instantly pick-up the game. We’ve made a very intuitive control system.' What about the game’s soundtrack? Imre: 'All of our sound effects and music from the game are made by the same people who the music and the soundtrack of the TV show. 'So, the music is based on what you’ve heard on the TV show and the sound effects, too. When you hear two swords clashing together in the game it’s actually the same one as the show.' Any plans for mobile gaming? Imre: 'Not at this point, the first release of the game will be on Facebook only but we are considering a touch version.'

However, patience is by far Dishonored’s strongest virtue, a game that whisks you away to an enchanting world, before trapping you there and not letting go. You play Corvo, a trusted guard who has been framed for killing the city of Dunwall’s beloved empress and abducting her girl. Blown away: Corvo has loads of powers, many of which have deadly results . Thus the familiar story of redemption, revenge and retribution ensues. But what makes this so unforgettable, is the way Dishonored tells the tale. Playing in a first-person perspective, you can approach missions with remarkable freedom. Either go in all guns-blazing, amassing a huge body count, or use the silent approach and take your targets down non-lethally. How you choose to go about your missions directly impacts the state of the city. Many residents of Dunwall have been infected with the plague, and bloodbaths serve to worsen matters – turning the city into a darker, more dangerous place. Approach tasks more mercifully, and fewer residents become infected, and Dunwall takes on a very different appearance. The levels are brilliantly designed – each one offering true sandbox-style gameplay to allow execution of objectives to suit your gameplay style. This is complimented by Corvo’s impressive armoury and magical abilities. If you see a sewer, for example, Corvo can possess a rat and crawl through – perhaps finding a new way to reach his target. There may also be roof access, which can be exploited with his ‘blink’ teleport ability, and numerous underground tunnels. All guns blazing: If stealth is not your thing, then you can cause complete chaos . There are often so many ways to complete an assassination that you’ll spend hours trying to figure out the best way to do it. On finding your target, the game frequently gives you the chance to kill or spare them – the latter resulting in a grisly punishment. Although presented with a main objective, there are often many side quests to get involved in. These serve only to give you a greater sense of purpose and never interrupt the narrative. You’ll be awarded with Runes and other items that you can use to upgrade and unlock new powers – reinforcing the incentive to complete them. There’s more than a slight nod to Deus Ex, Hitman and the Elder Scrolls games in the way Dishonored plays. However, although some may have felt daunted by the sheer amount of optional missions offered in the aforementioned, Dishonored gets the balance just right. It’s easy to lose yourself in the world, which is not surprising, given that the visual design director is Viktor Antonov – the genius behind Half-Life 2's unique look. There’s an elegant, Tudor-like feel to the open surroundings, beautifully brought to life with the Unreal engine with very little slowdown. Have mercy? Whether this target lives or dies is left entirely up to you . Populated by the City Watch, who bear a striking resemblance to the Combine in Valve's classic, and it’s easy to see Dunwall as a Dickinsion City 17, overrun with rats. Sadly, the game’s strongest hand is in the early levels, and – following a rather obvious plot twist – you’ll see less of these beautiful archetypical surroundings, and more dingy grey fortresses. It’s in these indoor areas where your powers may feel slightly constrained. You’ll often use one just because you haven’t for a while, or be prompted through the level’s design to use a certain one. Blinking, in particular, can be quite a fiddly affair. Enemy AI is a mixed bag, too. Although they are unforgiving and are programmed to mob you on sight, many will not see you when stood just a few metres away. Also, characters can get jammed in doorways, which can break the otherwise immersive experience. However, these are relatively small gripes in a game that just misses out on classic status, offering some of the best stealth-action gaming in decades.

'As the regime becomes more and more desperate, we see it resorting to increased lethality and more vicious weapons moving forward and we have in recent days seen missiles deployed,' she said. White House press secretary Jay Carney said he could not confirm reports but said if true it would be a sign of desperation. 'The idea that the Syrian regime would launch missiles, within its borders, at its own people, is stunning, desperate and a completely disproportionate military escalation,' Carney said.

A search is underway for a 14-year-old girl who went missing 23 years ago, authorities said. Melanie Melanson vanished in October 1989 after going to a party in the woods with friends near a Kraft Foods plant in Woburn, Massachusetts. Although police initially thought she had run away, it was later believed that she had been killed. The girl's body has never been found and no suspects ever named. The missing girl's family were at the . scene on Wednesday while a dig took place and a police helicopter flew . over head taking pictures of the area. Looking for answers: There was a renewed search today for Melanie Melanson who went missing 23 years ago in Massachusetts . Lost: Melanie, pictured with her parents and baby brother. Her mother and father died without ever knowing what became of her. Right, how she might look today by using age-advancing technology . Private investigator Michael Garrigan, who has been working with the family for two decades, told MailOnline today that every new lead left the family on an 'emotional rollercoaster'. He said: 'There is the initial high that comes with thinking we are getting closer and then that hope is dashed. But with every piece of the puzzle that comes, I think we are closer to her than we have ever been before.' Mr Garrigan speculated that the police may have been looking for vegetation that is a different color or growing in a different way during their search. The area where the police conducted their search this week is 3,000ft from where the family received a tip-off for their investigation. They are currently awaiting soil samples which are being tested for human decomposition. The results should be available in the next few weeks, Mr Garrigan said. Never giving up: A wooded area close to the Kraft food plant in Woburn, Massachusetts is being searched by police today in the hunt for a girl who disappeared 23 years ago . New information: An anonymous tip led a private investigator working on the case to organize a search of Middlesex Fells Reservation . Miss Melanson, who was about to turn 15, was the youngest person at the party at a popular teenage hangout near the Woburn-Stoneham town line in 1989. On the night she went missing, there . were unconfirmed reports that the 14-year-old had walked off into the . woods with another party-goer. There is a $5,000 reward for any information on what may have happened to the teenage girl. In July, cadaver dogs zeroed in on a small patch of parkland near the spot mentioned in a recent anonymous tip. Michael Gariggan said that three dogs were alerted to a small area of land in a search of Middlesex Fells Reservation. Garrigan, who has worked on the case since 1991 on a pro-bono basis, said he recently received new information from a man in New Hampshire who suggested that police check the Middlesex Fells Reservation in Stoneham. Seeking closure: While Melanie's parents and grandparents died, her other relatives are still hoping to give her a proper burial . He said one of the teenage boys last seen with Melanson was spotted there later that night. During the search in July involving 11 teams with cadaver dogs, Garrigan said at least three of the animals picked up on an ‘area of interest’ in the 2,500-acre park. He described the area as a 15-by-15 foot square patch of land that would have been ‘very accessible’ in 1989. Melanson, who would now be 37, was described by her relatives as kind and thoughtful. Before her disappearance, she was looking forward to having her braces removed and was excited about getting a pair of leather boots for her birthday.

Impostor: A Facebook picture of the Adelaide teenager shows him wearing a medical uniform including a stethoscope . A teenager has been audaciously impersonating a doctor at two hospitals in Australia in echoes of the Leonardo Di Caprio movie 'Catch Me If You Can.' The 17-year-old was spotted on hospital wards at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in South Australia wearing a name badge and a stethoscope, and even reading patient notes. There have also been numerous sightings of him on the grounds of Flinders Medical Centre in the city wearing scrubs, an identity lanyard and stethoscope. He has also been seen in the city posing as a doctor and offering first aid to the general public but police are currently refusing to identify him because of his age.

The . state health department has now circulated a situation report to some . hospital staff warning them about the 'bogus clinician,' who was . expelled as a St Johns Ambulance volunteer earlier this year for . inappropriate behaviour. The memo said he had been spotted on wards at the Royal Adelaide on at least three occasions since October.

The memo notes that he . has 'not to date committed substantive offences, but should he make . physical contact with a patient, posing as a clinician, this would . constitute criminal assault'. The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Authority first warned Flinders Medical Centre about his activity in late November and the information was subsequently circulated to nursing directors and security.

A father collapsed and died of a heart attack in front of his wife and co-workers minutes after dancing energetically to Gangnam Style at his office Christmas party. Eamonn Kilbride, 46, had been imitating the vigorous dance moves of the Korean YouTube hit when he began to suffer from chest pains on Saturday evening. Shocked colleagues from the Thwaites brewery in Blackburn looked on as paramedics tried in vain to revive the Irish father of three at the office party. His wife Julie was with him celebrating her birthday at the event at the Whitehall Hotel in Darwen, Lancashire. Shocked: Julie Kilbride, right, was devastated to watch her husband Eamonn, left, collapse and die . Mr Kilbride began to complain of chest pains shortly before he collapsed, whereupon his wife tried to save his life using CPR. Although paramedics were on the scene just five minutes later, the IT manager was pronounced dead on arrival at Royal Blackburn Hospital shortly after 11.30pm. The coroner who examined him concluded that he had suffered from acute heart failure. Mrs Kilbride, from Burnley, paid tribute to the 'loving husband' she married 23 years ago, and said he was a man who always put his family first. 'I want people to know how he would help anybody whether it was a life-long friend, or someone he had just met,' she said. 'He was a great family man and he worked so hard. Eamonn was always the life of the party and loved dancing. Death: The Thwaites brewery party was being held at the Whitehall Hotel in Darwen, Lancashire . 'We were having a fantastic time at the Christmas party and Eamonn had just finished dancing to Gangnam Style. He was up on stage and entertaining everybody. 'He said he had a bit of a pain and just collapsed. I tried to revive him until the ambulance got there, but by the time he got to the hospital he was gone.' Mr Kilbride moved to Burnley from Ireland in 1985, and became a staunch Liverpool fan in his adopted country. His wife said: 'Eamonn was such an intelligent man, he inspired our children and made sure they had a good education.' Mr Kilbride, a keen golfer, had three children - Laurajade, 22, Jack, 21, and Conor, 18, who are all at university. Phenomenon: Gangnam Style, by South Korean rapper Psy, is the most popular video on YouTube . Party: The father of three had been dancing to Gangnam Style, pictured, at his office Christmas bash .

My heart aches for his wife Julie and his family, including his sisters and his mother. You are in my thoughts and prayers here in Dublin. What shocking news to hear.' Police launched an initial investigation into Mr Kilbride's death, but quickly ruled out suspicious circumstances. Neil Bullows, proprietor of the Whitehall Hotel, said: 'It is a terrible tragedy and our thoughts are with his family. 'It is horrendous and an awful time of year for it to happen.'

Tragic death: Nicholas Wieme, a 23-year-old comedian from Chicago, fell to his death into a scorching smokestack after climbing the top of a landmark hotel to take pictures . What started out as a romantic night on the town in downtown . Chicago ended in a tragedy when a man fell to his death after climbing a . smokestack of a landmark hotel on the Magnificent Mile to take pictures. The victim, 23-year-old Nicholas Wieme, was . killed Thursday morning after falling 22 feet down a scorching chimney at the . top of the InterContinental Hotel. According to firefighters, Wieme, who worked as an improv comedian, . climbed onto the dome-shaped roof of the building in the 500 block of Michigan . Avenue to take pictures at around 1am, CBS Chicago reported. He apparently climbed a ladder along a smokestack to the top . when he fell into the extremely hot shaft, resulting in severe burns throughout . his body. Wieme then became wedged in an angle of the chimney and was . able to send a text message or a voice mail to his girlfriend, asking for help. However, it was too late. It took a total of about 125 firefighters . four hours to reach the 23-year-old, which required cutting a hole in the duct . work and sliding him down, according to Fire Chief Michael Fox. ‘It turned very precarious because two feet after we made . the hole was a drop that would have went 42 floors to the basement,’ Fox told NBC Chicago. Scroll down to watch video . Bad decision: Wieme and his girlfriend took an elevator to the top of the InterContinental Hotel and then accessed the roof, which is restricted to the public, via an unlocked door . Second City landmark: The iconic hotel featuring a signature domed roof is located in the 500 block of Michigan Avenue and has 42 floors . Immediately after the rescue, fire officials said Wieme was able . to communicate with them before losing consciousness, at which point he stopped . talking. The 23-year-old was rushed in critical condition to Northwestern Hospital, . where he was pronounced dead from his injuries shortly after 5am. It all started hours earlier when Wieme, a Minnesota native, . and his girlfriend, Kate Henrikson, went out for dinner and drinks at Michael . Jordan Steak House. According to officials, following the meal, the young . comedian and his date decided to photograph the view from the top of . the InterContinental Hotel next door to the restaurant. Larry Langford, a spokesman for the Chicago Fire Department, . told the Chicago Sun-Times that the couple were able to access the roof, which is restricted to the . public, via a door that was not bolted. Once on the roof Wieme was able to scale the smokestack . located next to a large observation deck. He thought he had stepped on a ledge, . but plummeted 22 feet before getting stuck in the spot where the chute angled . before dropping 42 floors. Rescue mission: It took 125 firefighters about four hours to reach Wieme inside the chute and extract him . Risky operation: First responders had to cut a hole into the chimney's duct work and insert wood beams to prevent Wieme from falling further down . Sources said the hotel management shut off the boiler as . soon as they were notified about Wieme’s predicament. Rescue crews responded to the hotel at 1.10am after receiving . a report about a person threatening to jump off the roof of the hotel. Firefighters later learned that a man had fallen into a chimney. ‘We had to send members from the top down on ropes to assess . his condition. The whole time we’re monitoring the situation for toxic gases,’ Chief . Fox said. Officials said while Wieme was stuck in the six-foot-wide shaft, . he was communicating with his girlfriend, either with phone calls or by . texting, and that firefighters had maintained contact with him until about 3.15am. Firefighters taking part in the rescue operation cut a hole . in the steel duct work and inserted wood beams to prevent Wieme from falling . 400 feet. They then slid him down into the opening and removed him from the . chute. Raymond Vermolen, general manager at the InterContinental, . released a statement Thursday morning: . ‘The InterContinental Magnificent Mile holds the safety, . comfort and well-being of our guests and employees as our top priority and . concern. ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of . the guest at this difficult time. The hotel staff will continue to cooperate . fully with authorities in their investigation.’ Funnyman: Wieme (bottom second from the left) recently moved to Chicago from Minnesota and worked as a comedian . Promising career: Wieme had his comedy routines posted on a website and was scheduled to perform Monday at the Cabaret Theater . The Cook County medical examiner's office said Wieme . recently moved from Pipestone, Minnesota, and was living on the North Side of . Chicago. Wieme was registered with a comedy website, Rooftop . Comedy, which features videos showing the 23-year-old Minnesota State University graduate performing on stage, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. He was scheduled to appear Monday at the iO Improv's Cabaret Theater. Alumni from iO Improv include such household names as Tina Fey, Mike Meyers and Andy Dick. Kyja Nelson, a professor at Minnesota State at Moorhead, described Wieme as 'very creative' and 'larger than life.' 'Everything he did, he had fun doing it. That's part of his vibrancy,' Nelson said, adding that the young man had a sharp sense of humor. The victim's brother, Jamie, said that it was during college that the English major first became involved in standup comedy, which eventually led him to move to Chicago and pursue a career in improv.

Ding dong row: Edward Elgar is being dragged to court by his French neighbour over noisy cowbells . A British publisher is being taken to court by his French neighbour in a row over cow bells. Edward Elgar, 63, allows a local farmer to graze his cows on his estate in the south of France, something which a new ‘townie’ neighbour alleges breaches his human rights because the cattle’s bells keep him up at night. Mr Elgar now faces a potential £4,000 fine if a French court rules in favour of neighbour Yves Meignan. Mr Elgar, who owns Edward Elgar Publishing in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, bought the 10-bedroom mansion in the Languedoc-Roussillon region in 2006. He generously allows beef farmer Claude Mesjeans to keep his 150-strong herd on his 20-hectares of land where the cows all wear the traditional bells. When Mr Meignan moved into a house bordering the land in 2010, he began complaining that the noise from the bells was keeping him up at night and has now taken his case to the local authorities. ‘I'm not going to have myself being pushed around by anyone, let alone an arrogant Frenchman,’ Mr Elgar said. ‘He's complained about the noise of the bells, which keep him awake at night, and which he claims are in breach of his human rights for a good night's sleep. ‘He's filed claims that it's causing him psychological damage.’ News of the row has caused uproar in rural France, and more than 4,000 people have backed a national petition supporting Mr Elgar and farmer Claude. Father-of-three Edward said: ‘I think this guy must be getting very scared. The countryside is in uproar about this city man's complaint - cow bells are a vital way of life. ‘I certainly would not want rural Frenchmen angry at me. ‘People feel passionate about the countryside and those trying to make a living in difficult circumstances, and when someone is trying to overturn traditions that have been running for hundreds of years. ‘And it's a part of France where it's important the cows have bells because they can escape from the fields, and it is rough terrain.’ Rural anger: French farmer Claude Mesjeans, right, with cows wearing the bells which are the cause of the complaint . Cattle quarrel: French farmer Claude Mesjeans feeds his cows on Edward Elgar's land, which allegedly keeps the neighbour up at night . Peaceful sound: Edward Elgar, in a cap walking on his estate with farmer Claude Mesjeans, said the first time he heard of any complaint was when he received a letter from a lawyer . He added that Mr Meignan has not been in touch about his problem but went straight to the courts: ‘I think he was ill-advised by his lawyers to take out the lawsuit. ‘The first I heard of his grievance was a letter from his laywer. His very aggressive stance was very silly.’ Many of the comments on the petition website are critical of Meignan's attitude. One visitor wrote: ‘We must defend our rural traditions and in the face of what I call disrespectful urbanites migrating to the countryside. ‘When you move to a village, you know what to expect and that's why you settle there. ‘It's too easy to take everyone to court to ensure their little individualistic conception of rural life and serenity is maintained! Long live the countryside!’ Long live the bell! A petition in support for Claude Mesjeans, right, and Mr Elgar has been backed by 4,000 people calling for Mr Meignan to drop the complain . Traditional: Cow bells are worn by freely-roaming livestock so they can be heard whenever they wander off or run away . Another angry petitioner wrote: ‘Why doesn't he just wear earplugs and shut up?’ Edward, who splits his time between homes in France and Cheltenham, first heard from disgruntled Meignan's lawyer in April this year. Last month Edward received a formal summons to appear before the district court - the Tribunal de Grande Instance d'Alhs. Edward spends the summer months at his property in France, which he describes as being peaceful and quiet. He said: ‘It's such a relaxing place to be. I can't understand why anyone would take umbrage with the noise of the countryside. ‘It's much better than car alarms and sirens.’","Edward Elgar allows a local farmer to keep his herd on his 20 acre estate in the south of France .

Punishment: Billi Jo Smallwood, 39, was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison for setting fire to her home which killed two of her children in 2007 . A sobbing mother was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison for setting fire to her home in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and killing two of her children in what prosecutors described was a scheme to kill her husband and collect on his life insurance policy. In a tearful plea for leniency, 39-year-old Billi Jo Smallwood showed photo albums and her son's toy chest while professing her innocence to a crime that could have put her in prison for the rest of her life. ‘Those are my children, my babies that grew inside of me,’ she told U.S. District Judge Thomas B. Russell. ‘I love them so much.’ Family, friends and even her jail guards portrayed her as caring, selfless and deeply religious during nearly an hour of testimonials in support of Smallwood, who wept during many of the presentations. Assistant U.S. Attorney James R. Lesousky Jr. described Smallwood's actions as ‘premeditated and devious’ that justified a life sentence. ‘She turned her back on those children, and when she did so, she lost two of them,’ he said. Smallwood was convicted by a federal jury in June of maliciously setting fire to the two-story housing unit in 2007 while her children slept inside. Prosecutors argued her intent was to kill her husband and cash in his $400,000 insurance policy. Deadly inferno: The fire set at the Fort Campbell home of Billi Jo Smallwood killed her two oldest children, a nine-year-old boy, left, and two-year-old girl, right . Plea: During the hearing, Smallwood sobbed as she showed photos of her slain children, son Sam Fagan, left, and daughter Rebekah, right, telling the judge that she loves them and asking for leniency . She was convicted of one count of malicious damage and destruction by fire to property owned by the United States. The blaze killed nine-year-old Sam Fagan and two-year-old Rebekah Smallwood. Smallwood's husband, Wayne, a soldier serving at Fort Campbell at the time, and their young daughter escaped unharmed. Russell mentioned the ‘powerful and sincere’ remarks by Smallwood's defenders while handing down the sentence. Russell also ordered Smallwood to pay $209,000 in restitution for damage caused by the blaze. Evidence presented at trial indicated she purchased a gasoline can about 12 hours before the fire was set. Remnants of the container were found by investigators in the first-floor dining room, where gasoline had been poured and ignited. Arsonist: Smallwood was found guilty by a grand jury in June of igniting a fire in a plot to kill her solider husband and cash in on his $400,000 life insurance policy . Testimonials: Family, friends and even her jail guards spoke in support of Smallwood, describing her as caring, selfless and deeply religious . During her trial Matthew Cummings, a special agent with U.S. Army Criminal Investigations Division testified that Smallwood suffered second- and third-degree burns, but they were consistent with someone who set a fire. He said doors in the home had been locked from the inside and smoke detectors had been removed. Mr Cummings said the husband had a $400,000 life insurance policy and the investigation showed the couple's relationship was 'rocky' and she was 'concerned with his abuse of alcohol and drugs.' Wife and mother: Smallwood talked of being thrilled when she found out she was pregnant with her oldest child and of her devotion to her husband . Just before the fire was set, the couple had returned from a trip to Georgia and had only $17, the agent said. She was aggravated that her husband had gone out earlier in the evening to a VFW club bar. Previous records of Mr Smallwood abusing his wife were brought up during her trial, with him released from a county jail on a domestic abuse complaint by his wife just before her bail hearing in 2008. Prosecutors also pointed to evidence showing Smallwood fabricated her claim that she received a threatening phone call meant for her husband on the eve of the fire. Her intent, they said, was to divert attention from herself as a suspect. ‘The telephone call never happened,’ Lesousky said Thursday. ‘It was part of her cover up.’ Smallwood said she wasn't the person portrayed by prosecutors. She talked of her devotion to her husband and of being thrilled when she found out she was pregnant with her oldest child. She talked about the children in personal terms while describing scrapbook photos. Her mother and her aunt offered tearful statements asking for leniency. Rocky marriage: Army Spc. Wayne Smallwood had a record of domestic abuse complaints made by his wife which prosecutors and her defense both used in court . Home Team: Mr Smallwood came to his wife's defense early in the trial, dismissing allegations that she had plotted to kill him as 'absurd' Brenda Napper, a sergeant at the Marion County Detention Center, where Smallwood has been held, said she believes Smallwood's claim of innocence. Napper said it's the first time she's ever felt an inmate was innocent. Mitchell Embry, a volunteer chaplain who has gotten to know Smallwood during her incarceration, called her ‘the most faithful, deep-thinking, spiritual person I've been around.’ Defense attorney Laura Wyrosdick declined to say whether Smallwood will appeal. Smallwood's trial had been delayed several times over evidentiary issues and appeals.","Billi Jo Smallwood, 39, was convicted in June of setting fire to her Fort Campbell home in 2007 as her children slept inside .

A leading hospital consultant was killed as he test-drove a top-of-the-range super-bike after boasting he had pulled a wheelie at 115mph, an inquest has heard. Heart expert Dr Andrew Richardson had taken the BMW S1000 RR out of a spin but died when he lost control on a double bend and was hurled into a ditch. Before his death the consultant cardiac anaesthetist sent a message from his phone claiming 'this bloody thing has just pulled a wheelie at 115mph in sixth gear on a country road.' Super-bike: Shortly before he died, Dr Andrew Richardson sent a text message to his brother claiming to have 'pulled a wheelie at 155mph' while test riding a BMW S1000 RR motorbike, pictured . Salesmen at the BMW garage raised the alarm after Dr Richardson failed to return the superbike, which retails at more than £12,000, to them after he took it for a test drive. Police then searched through the night for the missing father-of-three before they discovered his body lying in a ditch at the side of the 50mph road. The red, white and blue motorcycle had barely been damaged despite being thrown over a nearby hedge in the impact of the crash. An inquest into the 39-year-old’s death heard how he had only passed his motorcycle test in November 2011, when he bought his first bike - a Triumph Speed Triple. Earlier this year Dr Richardson test drove the BMW, which was originally built to compete in the 2009 superbike championships and has a top speed of 185mph. 'He kitted himself out with the best available motorcycle clothing and crash helmet, this was in his meticulous nature - to be the best and have the best,' said Dr Richardson’s brother Matthew, in a statement read at the inquest. 'Four months after buying the bike he had a test drive of the BMW S1000. He considered it to be the best bike around. His opinion was that if he could ride this bike he could ride anything.' On June 23, Dr Richardson booked another test ride at a BMW garage in north Oxford. He left his Triumph at the garage and set off on the BMW at 1pm for a two-hour ride but worried salesmen called police when he had not returned by 5pm. His body was found more than 12 hours later, at 5.20am by police officers combing the B4437 Woodstock Road, Stonesfield, Oxfordshire, around nine miles from the garage. Successful: Dr Richardson worked as a consultant cardiac anaesthetist at Southampton General Hospital University NHS Trust . The bike was found leaned against a hedge around 40 yards away with its back light and registration plate missing. Police analysis of his phone revealed that Dr Richardson had sent the Whatsapp message from his mobile at 2.30pm, placing his time of death between that moment and 3pm when the bike had been due back. A post mortem examination revealed that Dr Richardson, who worked at Southampton General Hospital, Hants., had died from multiple injuries. Collision investigator Terry Anderson told the hearing in Oxford that he believed Dr Richardson had been going too quickly to negotiate the double road bend. He said that there was no evidence to suggest that another vehicle had been involved. Mr Anderson said that he did not know how fast Dr Richardson had been travelling and that the 115mph claim could not be confirmed. 'Whilst this can’t be verified, it gives an indication as the speed is very specific, and nowhere near the 185mph the bike was capable of,' he said. 'It’s highly likely the rider entered the bend too fast for his ability and was carrying too much speed to negotiate the second bend.' He told the hearing that he believed the bike had bounced off Dr Richardson, causing his chest injuries, before coming to rest. He said it appeared that Dr Richardson had been trying to slow down as he came to the second bend. Matthew Richardson told the hearing that there was an anti-wheelie mechanism on the bike, which meant that it could not perform the trick in sixth gear, and that his brother could have exaggerated in his message. 'It might be there was an element of exaggeration in that type of message,' said Oxfordshire Coroner Darren Salter. 'It’s something that anyone would say for effect, as to the actual speed at the time there isn’t any physical evidence but we do know he lost control.' Mr Salter recorded that the death of Dr Richardson, of Winchester Road, Romsey, Hants., had been an accident. 'We know the message sent at 14.30pm indicated excessive speed but I think perhaps it would be dangerous to read too much into that,” he said. 'I think however the fact he did lose control of the motorcycle at the location does suggest too much speed.'","Heart expert Dr Andrew Richardson took a BMW S1000 RR super-bike out for a test run from a garage in north Oxford .

Mr Griffiths said: 'I love to involve drawing in my work, and using ink and tea allows me to create repeating layers of drawing which I then wash away partly with tea, and make new drawings from what appears beneath. 'I don’t like to be idle, I suppose drawing is a form of meditation for me so I get my relaxation at those times in the studio. 'I think if you are passionate about something, it will find its way into everything you do.' Mr Griffiths previously worked producing gold wire embroidery for the military, which sparked his desire to move into using textiles with his work. He said: 'Experimenting with new materials and liquids means that the work is constantly facing new challenges. Detail from 'Comfort' by Carne Griffiths .

And now an American artist has used feathers to created stunning images of birds. Chris Maynard uses eye surgery tools, miniscule scissors, forceps and sharp scalpels to slice intricate patterns into the shape of birds. Chris uses complex surgical tools to cut intricate bird-shapes from a variety of feathers . The American artist started his feather work in 2011 after the death of his artist mother . A piece of art can take several days to complete, with some feathers measuring just 1mm . He begins by choosing a perfect feather and sketching out a draft version of his designs, before gluing it to a board and cutting it out. He uses feathers from private aviaries and zoos that range in size from just 1mm to 4ft long, and has worked with feathers from birds including parrots, pigeons and turkeys. The talented artist has create more than 80 pieces which can take up to several days at a time, before mounting them onto frames known as shadowboxes. The stunning works sell for prices between £500 and £1,240. Chris, 58, from Olympia in Washington, USA, said: 'My art in the shadowbox form began two years ago in 2011. 'I think it had to do with the death of my mother, a professional artist. It got me thinking that life is short and to get on with pursuing what inspires me most. Chris mounts the work on special shadow boxes that show off their three-dimensional nature . He said: 'Choosing the right feathers takes a lot of time, they have to be perfect.' Feathers from the art come from birds including crows, turkeys, pigeons and pheasants . 'To start, I either first think of a particular bird, get to know it and its qualities or I think of a concept I want to express and think of the right bird or feather. 'Choosing the right feathers takes a lot of time, they have to be perfect in shape, pattern, form, and colour. 'Feathers have shafts, then barbs, then barbules which have little hooks on them which act as Velcro, keeping the feathers barbs together. 'They can be cut and worked with without falling apart, but they do tend to curl so the feathers are usually backed before I cut them. 'I use eye surgery tools, tiny scissors and forceps and small sharp scalpels to cut. 'The feathers come from private aviaries and zoos, I use tiny feathers as small as a pencil point to the biggest in my work. 'Other than feathers from pigeons, crows, and turkeys, I mostly use pheasant and parrot feathers.' Chris chooses the feather which he feels will best represent the bird he wants to portray .

The elderly are being denied life-saving treatment for heart attacks and surgery following breast cancer, a report warns. It reveals the extent of age discrimination across the NHS, with doctors making ‘inaccurate assumptions’ about patients based on their dates of birth. This year the Government promised to end ageism in the Health Service and introduced laws that enable the elderly to sue if they are unfairly refused treatment. Discrimination: The elderly are being denied life-saving treatment for heart attacks and surgery following breast cancer . But a report today warns that patients in their 50s are three times more likely to be offered an emergency treatment for heart attacks than those in their 80s. And some hospitals are refusing to offer the treatment to anyone over 75 at all. The procedure – a percutaneous coronary intervention – widens blood vessels and has been credited with saving the lives of up to 80 patients a year and hundreds since it was first introduced in the late 1980s. It involves patients being sedated, but not given a general anaesthetic, while a thin tube is inserted into their upper leg and threaded up to the coronary artery in the heart. This year the Government promised to end ageism in the Health Service . Once in place the tube is inflated, widening the blocked artery and increasing the blood flow to the heart. The report by the Dr Foster Intelligence Unit, a healthcare information provider based at Imperial College London, found that on average about 18 per cent of patients in their 80s have PCI. By comparison, PCI is offered to 52 per cent of those in their 50s. Michelle Mitchell, of Age UK said: ‘It is unacceptable to use someone’s age as a shortcut to deciding whether they are suitable for treatment. ‘Everyone must be given the most effective, suitable treatment for their individual circumstances and chronological age must not be used as a cut-off date.’ The report also found fewer than 5 per cent of women in their 80s have surgery to reconstruct their breast after cancer treatment but almost 100 per cent of women in their 50s have reconstructive surgery. Dr Rachel Greig, senior policy officer at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘We need to ensure that inaccurate assumptions are not being made about patients solely due to their age.’ The report also warned that hospital wards are becoming ‘dangerously’ overcrowded, raising the risk of infections and blunders by staff . Ideally, only 85 per cent of hospital beds should be occupied at any one time to ensure patients are treated safely. But most hospitals are 90 per cent full almost all the year round, rising to 95 per cent in winter. Treatment: Patients in their 50s are three times more liekly to be offered emergency treatment for heart attacks than those in their 80s . Roger Taylor, director of research at Dr Foster Intelligence, said: ‘When hospitals get full up they have to put patients in the first bed they can find and that increases the risk. ‘There’s also evidence that infections become much harder to control as hospitals become fuller.’ Meanwhile a separate report by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges warned that some patients can wait up to four days to see a consultant because they don’t work weekends.","Government promised to end ageism in Health Service and introduced laws .
