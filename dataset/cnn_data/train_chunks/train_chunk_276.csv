"(CNN) -- An Egyptian court has given nine men sentences ranging from 20 years to life in prison for sexually assaulting women near Cairo's Tahrir Square, according to state run newspaper al-Ahram. The sentences handed down Wednesday were the harshest seen since the government criminalized sexual harassment last month, amid criticism over the widespread abuse of women in the country. The men were found guilty of being involved in four different attacks, three of them taking place during the inauguration celebrations for newly elected President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in June. The fourth assault took place in 2013 on the second anniversary of the revolution that toppled longtime strongman leader Hosni Mubarak. The attacks during the inauguration celebrations came only days after Egypt's outgoing interim President Adly Mansour issued a decree criminalizing sexual harassment. The ""I Saw Harassment"" campaign, which documents sexual violence against women in Egypt, said there had been at least five mob sexual assaults in Cairo's Tahrir Square that week. The new law, the first explicitly to use the term ""sexual harassment,"" made the offense punishable by up to five years in prison and a maximum fine of 50,000 Egyptian pounds. A 2013 United Nations report from the Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women found that 99.3% of Egyptian women have experienced some form of sexual harassment and more than 82% of female respondents felt unsafe in the street. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","An Egyptian court jails nine men for sexually assaulting women in central Cairo -- state media .

"(CNN) -- Over the past decade the Arab world has witnessed a shifting of not only hard power -- which saw the traditional armies of the Arab world in Syria, Egypt and Iraq consumed in internal turmoil -- but also of what Harvard professor Joseph Nye termed ""soft power,"" which has moved from these countries to the resource rich Gulf states. Long before their formation into modern states, the cities of the Gulf were recipients of talent, skill and economic aid from the traditional Arab nation states that have today fallen into obscurity. For centuries the Kiswa, or black drapes of the holy Kaaba in Mecca were supplied by Baghdad, Cairo or Sanaa as well as Istanbul who were locked in protocol battles of soft power over the holy city. This is of course no longer the case. Saudi Arabia -- the Arab world economic superpower and fourth largest spender on military -- is the party that sends aid not only to Yemen and Egypt but also to most Arab states. According to the World Bank, the Arab Gulf states, perhaps none more so than Kuwait, are today amongst the most generous nations with regards to financial aid, contributing more than twice the United Nations target of 0.7% of their combined gross national income during the period between 1973-2008. Since the beginning of the Arab uprisings, Gulf Aid to the Arab world has significantly spiked. Egypt, for example, has received billions of dollars from the Gulf States since its January 25, 2011, uprising. The Egyptians' loss of influence over Mecca -- which was then under Hashemite rule -- to Saudi founder Ibn Saud in 1925 was an irreparable blow to Cairo's mechanism of religious soft power and a significant advantage to the Al Sauds. Perhaps no other city in the world, save for Hollywood, commands as much global soft power as Mecca. For decades, media output in the Arab world was produced, recorded, filmed and performed in the traditional leading Arab states of Iraq, Syria and Egypt as well as Lebanon. Today a significant portion of television production, recording and filming -- not to mention financing -- takes place in the Gulf cities of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha. Much of this entertainment is produced in the local dialects of Egypt and Syria, but the Gulf cities can exercise a large degree of influence on material that is locally filmed and financed. The Gulf states are also home to the most watched TV news channels in the Arab world, a significant mechanism of soft power in one of the most politically unstable regions. Between the Doha based Al Jazeera and the Saudi owned and Dubai based Al Arabiya is a media war for the hearts and minds of the Arab public. The two leading news channels of the Arab world are accused of reflecting the versions of events closest to the politics of their funders. Even so, the soft power reach of these channels with their tens of millions of Arab viewers cannot be quantified and has become one of the main levers of soft power of the Gulf states. Flourishing tourism . While tourism has come to a standstill in Lebanon, Egypt, Syria and Iraq it has flourished in the Gulf states. Dubai with its infrastructure and attractions that were built over the past half-century today attracts more tourists than any other Arab state and is the seventh most visited city in the world. This year, Airports Council International ranked Dubai's airport, home of Emirates Airlines, as the world's busiest -- in terms of passenger numbers -- for the 12 months ending March. Abu Dhabi, Doha, Muscat and a number of Saudi cities are undertaking massive airport and other infrastructure projects that will keep tourists pouring in. The Gulf cities have turned themselves into globally recognized brands, while traditional Arab cities such as Baghdad, Cairo and Damascus have become synonymous with turmoil and unrest. The massive multi billion-dollar nation branding exercise that cities like Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Doha have undertaken has turned into a self-fulfilling prophecy. World diplomatic, business and media leaders continuously make visits to these cities attracted by their commercial, political and media clout, this in turn attracts others to be based here. For instance, today Abu Dhabi is arguably the de facto political hub of the region having witnessed visits by most foreign ministers of regional and global powers. While the traditionally culturally rich powers of the Arab world continue to face internal turmoil and fail to invest in cultural projects, the Gulf states continue to thrive. Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Doha and Sharjah are investing heavily in museums and education, attracting talent from across the Arab world and beyond. For the second year running, a survey of young Arabs found that the UAE topped their list of preferred countries to live in, followed by the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The UAE at 39% scored almost twice as high as the U.S. at 21% -- a significant show of force for a country that isn't even half a century old. Barely a week goes by in the Gulf states without them witnessing major international events and meetings. The Gulf states have been on a publicity and nation-branding streak. From Dubai's hosting of the World Bank and IMF meetings in 2003 to the Dubai World Expo in 2020, the city is abuzz with global conferences such as the World Economic Forum's Global Agenda Councils, sporting championships and media, IT and business forums. Qatar's hosting of the World Trade Organization Doha Round of talks in 2001 to the World Cup 2022 as well as Abu Dhabi's massive Guggenheim and Louvre museums -- which are scheduled to open in the next few years -- will cement these states' soft power advantages. When the British decided to withdraw from the Gulf states in the 1960s they left behind fledgling nations, weak and exposed to regional states and the political ambitions of neighbors. Today -- due to their incredible soft power -- it is these Gulf states that carry influence over the rest of the Arab world.","Arab soft power has shifted to Gulf nation states, writes Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi .

"(CNN) -- The president of Ukraine's top football club has warned six of its players who have gone AWOL they will ""suffer"" if they don't return to the conflict-torn country. Shakhtar Donetsk had played a friendly against Lyon on Saturday, but after the game five Brazilians and one Argentine remained in France rather than travel back to Ukraine. On Monday there was fighting in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk. ""I don't rule out that these players will return to the team quickly, and some of them -- tomorrow,"" Shakhtar president Rinat Akhmetov told the club's official website. ""Players have contracts that they have to abide by. If they do not come, I think, they will be the first to suffer. Each of them has a minimum release clause, which is tens of millions of euros. ""If someone wants to reduce this amount by a million, then such a decision is our right."" Akhmetov also assured Brazilians Douglas Costa, Fred, Dentinho, Alex Teixiera, Ismaily and Facundo Ferreyra of Argentina they have ""nothing to fear"" if and when they return to Ukraine. ""Hopefully, the mind and heart will prevail over misunderstanding, and the players will not follow temptation and fear,"" said the Shakhtar president. ""We are ready to provide security. We will not take risks and in any case we won't bring players to dangerous places."" Shakhtar, which regularly features in Europe's top competition the Champions League, play rivals Dynamo Kiev in the Ukrainian Super Cup Tuesday, a curtain raiser to the Ukraine domestic league season. ""Despite the fact that we will be weakened in the Super Cup match against Dynamo Kyiv, our players will do their best to make the game hard for our opponents,"" added Akhmetov. The ongoing unrest in the region means Shakhtar, the reigning Ukrainian champion, is unable to play matches at its Donbass Arena stadium. The Ukrainian football season is due to start this weekend, with Shakhtar scheduled to host Metalurh Zaporizhya. It is unclear where the match will be played, although Akhmetov would like it to take place in Kharkiv, a city over 150 miles north of Donetsk. ""We want to play in Donetsk very much, but, unfortunately, at the moment we cannot do it. ""The decision regarding the championship is taken by the Ukrainian Football Federation. Through our game, we will call for peace and try to bring joy to our fans."" Of the six AWOL players, playmaker Douglas Costa is arguably the most valuable. The 23-year-old has previously been linked with Manchester United, but Akhmetov ruled out a ""clearance sale."" Prior to the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash last weeks, European governing body UEFA's Emergency Panel decided its European club competition matches involving Ukrainian clubs would be allowed to take place in Dnipropetrovsk and Odessa, in addition to Kiev and Lviv. Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk will play in the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League while Chornomorets Odessa are in the Europa League. UEFA's Emergency Panel also ruled Ukrainian and Russian teams cannot be drawn against each other in its competitions. That ensured Dnipro were not drawn against Russian club Zenit St Petersburg when the UEFA Champions League third qualifying round draw was made last week.","Six Shakhtar Donetsk players refuse to return to Ukraine after playing against Lyon .

"(CNN) -- A decade ago, tiny ""travel-size"" shampoos were fun stocking stuffers and a more expensive, more convenient means of packing toiletries for a trip. Now they're a reminder of the layered security landscape that has evolved at airports since the September 11, 2001, attacks. As the 10-year anniversary of that day approaches, CNN asked security experts to weigh in on changes in aviation security in the United States since 9/11 and to offer a glimpse of what's likely to happen next. The good news for the widely criticized Transportation Security Administration? Some security analysts like where the agency is headed. ""The TSA is exhibiting much more open-mindedness and has already accepted the concept that there is a need to look at people as well as what they carry,"" said Rafi Ron, president of Virginia-based New Age Security Solutions and former head of security of Ben-Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel. But despite all the hassles travelers now endure to get on an airplane, two experts' picks for the decade's most significant safety improvements had nothing to do with checkpoint screening. They were reinforced cockpit doors and the screening of checked luggage for explosives. So how do all the other measures -- the ones that aggravate the shoeless, jacket-less masses -- hold up in security analysts' eyes? ""The past 10 years were mostly wasted by consistently holding to the idea that we can solve the problem by technological screening only,"" Ron said. Body scanners, metal detectors and pat-downs have limitations and responding to recent threats by having passengers remove shoes or carry only small amounts of liquid doesn't make sense, analysts say. ""Try to anticipate the future, rather than reacting to the past,"" said Richard Bloom, director of terrorism, espionage and security studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. ""Just to do things based on something that already happened in and of itself is frankly illogical and is not supportive of good security,"" he said. TSA Administrator John Pistole, who took the helm in 2010, gets credit from security experts for a shift in strategy. Pistole, a former deputy director for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has said intelligence is the best tool for preventing terrorism, and the agency is testing measures at airports that it hopes will make things easier for most travelers. ""We are working on a risk-based security initiative that recognizes that the vast majority of travelers are not terrorists,"" Pistole said. Pistole recently announced a pilot trusted traveler program to reduce screening hassles for travelers who provide additional personal information to the government and free more resources to focus on high-risk passengers. The program is expected to launch in October. ""The P word"" The path to a more effective and efficient, intelligence-driven system is not easy. Profiling, or ""the P word"" as Ron referred to it, should be part of that path, according to many security analysts. But that concept, and some of the physical means of screening, have opponents who invoke that other ""P word"" -- privacy. Everyone profiles, consciously or unconsciously, Bloom said. And there's nothing ""unusual or unnatural"" about it. ""The question is does it work, the scientific part, and is it consistent with our values or not? And there's always a tradeoff between the two."" They're not calling for illegal racial or ethnic profiling, Bloom, Ron and security analyst Douglas Laird said. ""(That's) the lazy and the easy way to go about it and the nonprofessional way,"" Ron said. The profiling he supports uses legitimate information to identify what doesn't make sense -- flying one-way with no luggage, for example. Laird, president of Laird & Associates and a former security director at Northwest Airlines, helped develop a profiling system called CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System) used by the airlines before 9/11. ""It didn't look for the bad guy, it looked for the knowns. So, taken to the extreme, if you were a Platinum Elite at Northwest, you were given a good score. If you had never flown on us before you were given a not very good score,"" he said. The system referenced commercial data available through airline computer systems and credit card companies, Laird said, comparing information like street addresses with phone numbers with where the passenger purchased the ticket. The system took names out of the equation, Laird said, because a ""professional"" terrorist would probably travel under a different identity with genuine documents. Each passenger's score determined how much screening and which methods should be used. A proposal after 9/11 for an expanded CAPPS system was abandoned in 2004 amid criticism from privacy and civil liberties groups. Instead a system called Secure Flight was introduced. The system compares information provided  to airlines by passengers against watch lists, but does not use commercial data and protects travelers' privacy, according to the TSA. The watch-list matching program was fully implemented in November 2010. ""Secure Flight is not really a profiling program,"" Ron said. ""It is basically a program that is mostly focused on identifying wanted people or people that we already have their names in various databases."" Laird said he believes a more sophisticated automated system will be used within the next 10 years. Bad things and bad people . TSA behavioral detection officers are testing a ""casual conversation"" screening technique at Boston's Logan airport. While officers talk with passengers they are looking for suspicious behavior and facial expressions. Some passengers may be engaged in longer conversations, receive additional screening or be referred to law enforcement if suspicious behaviors persist, according to TSA spokesman Greg Soule. The incorporation of the ""human factor"" in U.S. airport security is overdue, Ron said. ""In other terms, instead of just looking for bad items, we need to look for bad people."" Laird is skeptical of behavioral analysis and would like to see more evidence of its effectiveness. Ron acknowledges that the efficacy of the TSA's program will depend on the quality of the program, the training and the personnel. Ron said his professional experience with Israeli airport security, widely considered to be the best in the world and heavily reliant on behavioral analysis and profiling, doesn't mean he would suggest the United States go to the same lengths. But the American system should understand the roots of Israel's success, he said, and incorporate them in a way that fits within our legal framework. How the TSA will tailor and add to layered passenger screening remains to be seen. But, while there are no guarantees, these experts expect some of today's little annoyances to be phased out for most passengers. ""And I'm glad,"" Bloom said. ""Because I like to wear wingtip shoes to go with my suit and having to unlace and take them off and put them back on is getting to be a real hassle."" CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Agnes Pawlowski contributed to this report .","Experts name reinforced cockpit doors among best aviation security moves since 9/11 .

"Hoylake, England (CNN) -- The British Open is Rory McIlroy's to lose. On a day when the weather finally bared its teeth at Royal Liverpool, so did the Northern Irishman. At one stage of this historic championship round -- with two tees in operation for the first time ever -- another dynamic 25-year-old threatened the fairytale Merseyside had been dreaming of. Rickie Fowler tied McIlroy for the lead as the two-time major champion toiled amid the thick and unforgiving rough of Hoylake's 12th hole. But that seemed the catalyst for the home favorite to turn on the afterburners, as two eagles on his final three holes wrested the famed Claret Jug ever closer to his clubhouse locker. The roar that followed his three on the final green was of the pitch one expects to greet the winning putt. It may well prove to be the telling blow. A six-shot lead going into a final round that should see a return to the benign weather of the first two days means a third major of McIlroy's fledgling career is within touching distance. Fowler's only hope is to recapture the furious pace he set early on Saturday. Seven birdies drew him level with McIlroy before three bogeys halted a gallant charge. He will make up a final group with a combined age 14 years junior to that of five-time Open champion Tom Watson, who sits on five-over for the tournament. Spain's Sergio Garcia and Dustin Johnson, from America, both lie on nine-under with Frenchman Victor Dubuisson a further shot behind. But McIlroy is in such form it'd take a return to the dark days of his Augusta meltdown in 2011 to derail his procession towards Hoylake's honors board, and entry to an exclusive club. Only Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods managed to win three majors in the modern era by the age of 25. By Sunday night, McIlroy could have 75% of a career grand slam sewn up and make that twosome a supremely talented hat-trick. ""I never thought I'd be able to be in this position,"" McIlroy told reporters as torrential rain crashed down on the media centre roof, justifying the decision to send the players out early. ""I'm going to try and put all that out of my head because it would be way too much to think about, way too much to ponder. ""Not a lot of people have achieved a career grand slam and if everything goes the right way tomorrow, to get to three-quarters of the way there is some achievement by the age of 25. ""I'd be in pretty illustrious company, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves but it would mean an awful lot. First things first, play a good solid round tomorrow and if that means I'm going to Augusta with a bit of hype then so be it."" It was fitting that a biblical downpour erupted just as McIlroy filed in to face the gathered press, for Hoylake has proved something of a perfect storm for him. Intent on improving his record in golf's oldest major, McIlroy spent the weeks leading up to the tournament shaping his game on the links courses of his native Northern Ireland. It has made quite a difference. The 25-year-old has arrested a decline that saw finishes of 25th, 60th and 116th in the last three years and now sits one solid round away from landing his first Open title. With savage thunderstorms sweeping northwards, the R&A decided to operate two starting tees for the first time in the tournament's history, sending groups of three out from 9am. This meant after a twilight finish on Friday, McIlroy barely had time to hit the gym and watch a movie, as he has done after both rounds so far, before he was due back at the course. And like yesterday, his start was sluggish. A bogey on the first, coupled with playing partner Dustin Johnson's birdie, saw his four-shot lead chopped in half immediately. He canceled out that error with a birdie on the fifth but seemed more content to protect his lead than exert himself to extend it. Fowler was the opposite. In weather that would make most Californians recoil in horror, the 25-year-old reveled in the hanging cloud and spitting rain that swept across the Wirral Peninsula. He recorded four birdies in six holes to close the gap on McIlroy, with Garcia fighting to keep pace in the same group. When Fowler rolled in a 30ft putt on the 11th, a shot for shot Sunday battle between the Florida neighbors who first met at the amateur Walker Cup battle between the U.S. and Great Britain and Ireland in 2007 looked likely. Another birdie on 12 took Fowler to 12-under and when McIlroy missed a short par putt on the same green not 15 minutes later, the Open had joint-leaders. If McIlroy was in any way perturbed, he didn't show it. In fact, he seemed to welcome the challenge. The contours of this strip of land on the west coast mean its predators are forever catching glimpses of each other. A huge gallery gathered around the 15th hole speculated as to whether the clamor back on the 14th meant McIlroy had made a birdie. Seconds later, the huge scoreboard to the right of the green confirmed he had. That fleeting Fowler share had now become a two-shot deficit. McIlroy refused to relinquish his grasp on his rival's throat. A booming drive down the 16th and perfectly flighted approach offered an eagle chance which was duly swallowed whole. By this stage, Fowler had bogeyed three holes out of four -- his round of 68 would include eight birdies and four bogeys in total. Despite dropping a shot on the 17th, a ferocious McIlroy drive on the 18th was complemented by a five iron that landed barely 10 feet from the hole. The putt held its line and disappeared. McIlroy fist-pumped as thousands flanking the final hole rose to their feet. ""The support this week has been fantastic,"" he added. ""It's a pleasure to play in front of crowd like this. ""Walking onto the 18th green today I got goose bumps -- how loud it was, how much I support I felt from them. ""I said yesterday I want to try and give them something to cheer for and I'll try and do the same thing tomorrow. ""I was conscious that Rickie was getting closer but I never panicked and stayed patient. It was nice to come up with the goods when I needed them. ""I felt like those two shots on 18 deserved an eagle."" Barring a meltdown of similar proportions to the one McIlroy suffered at The Masters in 2011, when he blew a four-shot lead in the final round, the title is his. The 2012 U.S. PGA Champion's lead is the largest at this stage since Tiger Woods won in 2000 at St Andrew's. But having stormed from seven shots back to win the PGA Championship at Wentworth in May, McIlroy knows how quickly a lead can evaporate. ""I wanted to try and be as far ahead as I could, that's why I was grinding over that putt at the last,"" he explained. ""Whenever you have such a big lead you really can't think anyone else but yourself."" Few people around Hoylake tomorrow will be thinking of anyone else either.

"(CNN) -- It wasn't the pollster's fault. Sure, it would be an understatement to say that Eric Cantor's surprising loss Tuesday night to relatively unknown tea party candidate David Brat did not reflect the internal polls that had the House majority leader ahead by more than 30 points. But it wasn't necessarily Republican pollster John McLaughlin's fault. Really. He doesn't deserve the withering attacks he's come under by those who sit safely on the sidelines of actual real campaign work. He shouldn't bear the slings and arrows of those, thanks to 24-hour cable news, who have become paid pundits on the subject of politics and campaigns without ever being part of one. Now don't worry, I'm not letting McLaughlin or Republican pollsters off the hook. Not so fast. You see, polling is hard. I know. I've done it for the DNC under Chairman Howard Dean crafting The 50-State Strategy, two successful presidential campaigns, and scores of state and local ones, too. It's hard because we are always chasing a moving target. In this case, the trouble was those ""likely voters."" What's a ""likely voter,"" you might ask? Well the textbook says it is someone who has a history or pattern of voting in a particular election -- presidential, state assembly, Congressional party primary, etc. If you have voted in, say, two of the last three presidential elections, the conventional wisdom says you are a likely voter and you get plugged into our universe if we are looking for voters in the presidential year. However that doesn't make you necessarily a likely voter in, say, the mayor's race next month, and certainly not in the congressional primary election next week. Typically, more than half the eligible voters skip the midterm elections every two years. The percentage who vote in primaries is often less than one-third. And don't even get me started on caucuses (love ya', Iowa). As pollsters, we look for patterns. We figure that, considering how low U.S. voter turnout is compared to most other Western democracies, it is safe to bet that if you've had multiple opportunities to vote and you haven't done it so far, you probably won't. Now that holds fairly true unless there is something different going on out there. Like the tea party movement. Or a big-eared, charismatic, black guy with a Muslim-sounding name from Hawaii. When the conventional rhythm of politics has been altered, all hell can break loose. When that dynamic shifts, the textbook is useless -- and so are our likely voter assumptions. So getting locked into seeing the world only one way -- particularly if it is how you want to see it -- instead of how it actually is can be dangerous for a pollster. Which brings me to Republican pollsters. In 2012, so many of them had Mitt Romney winning convincingly -- he didn't, by the way -- because they failed to sense or hear the dynamic changing rhythm of a younger, more diverse America. They built their polling models on the pillars of sand (OK, it was really, really white, sand) of a 1980s electorate. They bet on the white-male-likely-voting universe of the Reagan era. And they were wrong. They simply failed to see the throngs of younger and minority adults as likely voters in 2012. They failed to see that African-Americans would, for the first time in history, actually become the largest most-likely voter bloc in the general election. It was unfathomable for so many Republicans. The Obama candidacy and what it symbolized dramatically altered the archaic rhythm of politics on both sides. It energized those that the textbook said were not politically engaged. Hope and change rewrote the textbook. Which brings me back to the shocking primary election results in Virginia's 7th Congressional District Tuesday night. Cantor, the second-most powerful member of the House of Representatives, vastly outspent his opponent. He had not just the backing of the GOP establishment, but was on its board of trustees. But he lost to a second-tier tea party challenger. And, because of Barack Obama, no one saw it coming. The change that united and drove the politics of hope on the left also awakened the politics of anger on the right. What Obama represents in the White House has led to an uprising on both sides of the political spectrum. The textbook had been rewritten, and few bothered to get the new edition. So, with all due respect, Cantor didn't drop a 34-point lead because of a single issue like immigration or incumbents or Democrats meddling in his primary. It just doesn't work that way. In fact, polling in the district on June 10 -- the day of the primary -- showed almost nine out of 10 respondents said fixing our immigration system is important (84% important, 57% very), including a majority of Republicans (58%) who say it's very important. So for those who simply prefer to place the blame for the majority leader's loss on immigration, pointing to his failure to pass immigration reform would be safer ground. Suggesting it was David Brat's ranting about Cantor's inability or failure to kill bipartisan immigration reform just isn't credible in a district with 72% of its voters, including a majority of Republicans, favoring reform. In reality, it's far more likely that this 34-point lead never really existed in the first place. The changing dynamics of American politics brought on by the election of President Obama has changed the calculus for pollsters on both sides. Obama's song that tells a story of changing America makes some hopeful that those who were never part of that Reagan-era likely-voter equation are now creating new math. At the same time, it hits a very sour note among others, bringing them out to voice their anger at the entire body politic. In the Obama era, pollsters have to deal with a tumultuous electorate that is increasingly difficult to predict using conventional models. Or end up looking very, very wrong. Cantor's campaign really should have detected the rumblings of revolt long before election night. His loss was likely due ultimately to angry voters on the right who had not before been engaged in the primary process saying in one clear voice, ""Anyone but Cantor!"" Remember, no one thought shutting down the government was a good idea except the tea party. They don't do moderation. Compromise is a dirty word. So anyone who would consort with the enemy -- like they saw Cantor as doing in even considering a deal with Obama -- just had to go. Cantor didn't lose a 34-point advantage. He never had one in the first place. He never had a 34-point advantage because figuring out who is a likely voter in these tumultuous times is growing increasingly difficult. Obama has stoked strong emotions on both sides of the political spectrum in an unprecedented way, challenging our conventions about who will and won't vote. Now, come the November midterm, I'm betting younger people and minorities will leave convention scratching its head again.

"London (CNN) -- While Ukraine's fight for freedom gets bloodier by the day and Russia faces the West's cold shoulder, in the elegant surroundings of London's Somerset House, one oligarch is using art to get his message across. ""This work is called 'Widows,' for one simple reason,"" says Andrei Filatov as he points towards a picture of five elderly ladies looking forlorn. ""Because instead of an icon [on the wall] there is Karl Marx."" And in cottages where the father of socialism has taken the Holy Mother's place, he explains, ""this tells us the women depicted have probably lost their husbands in the war."" For almost half a century the widows' empty eyes have stared out over Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery, caught behind the iron curtain as a new, ""cold"" war came and went. But now, thanks to the 42-year-old's passion for paintings, they have been given a new perspective, on display for the first time in London alongside 39 other canvasses by Viktor Popkov, in a special exhibition dedicated to the Soviet-era artist. The exhibition includes pieces from Filatov's own collection, and brings together works from museums across Russia's biggest cities, recording a post-Stalin age when heroic peasants and propaganda had begun to give way to themes of industrial optimism and the bloom of youth. ""I was born in the Soviet Union and I loved that country,"" says Filatov. ""So it seems right to showcase the good things that it created because there wasn't the opportunity to do so before. As a period, it was somewhat misunderstood."" With an estimated $1 billion fortune this Forbes rich list stalwart has clearly done well out of his country's break with communism. Yet he is nostalgic about the past and, having amassed a sizeable collection of Soviet masterpieces, Filatov hopes to one day found his own museum in London and promote a ""better understanding"" of his home nation. ""I want to show the creative work of the Russian people, so that there is more love for Russia,"" he says. ""That is why I want to build a museum here."" Filatov isn't new to the world of soft diplomacy. As President of the Russian Chess Federation, he has overseen international tournaments at the Louvre in Paris and personally funded the restoration of the tomb of the Russian chess legend Alexander Alekhine in the same city. Cultural exchanges, he says, can be key ways of keeping the dialogue going. ""For people to understand each other better they must communicate ... through the exchange of culture, through exhibitions, through theaters, through music and ballet. ""I hope this exhibition will improve the understanding and relations between different peoples and countries. That is its meaning."" For Filatov, just like many Ukrainian-born Russians, the concept of ""home"" is more complicated than it first seems. Born in Kryvyi Rih in Ukraine, the co-owner of the ports and roads firm N-Trans describes himself as Russian but still has relatives in Ukraine. And like many practical business people with a sizeable stake in this complex region, Filatov leaves the artwork to make the bold political statements, saying only he considers sanctions imposed by the EU and the U.S., ""a big mistake."" According to Filatov, ""the sooner there is an understanding by the European countries and the U.S., the faster there will be logical, sensible and constructive relations."" Putting on a large Russian art show in London at a time of heightened animosity towards his country is an ambitious project. Even talking about art, at a time of deadly skirmishes in Ukraine, may seem flippant but Filatov does have another motive for wanting to host the show: to cater for the British capital's sizeable Russian expat population. ""Walking around here I discovered there is not one large collection of Russian art,"" he says. ""Russian culture is not presented here yet hundreds of thousands of people from Russia live here. Russian children go to school here and they are losing their connection to their own culture."" ""Viktor Popkov: The Genius of The Russian Soul"" was organized last year as part of 2014's somewhat overshadowed UK-Russia Year well before Ukraine's crisis pitted the countries against each other.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order that blocks Alabama from enforcing a key portion of a new abortion law that requires doctors at an abortion clinic to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. U.S. District Judge Myron H. Thompson's ruling on Tuesday puts on hold what is considered the lynchpin of Alabama's new abortion law, which is considered one of the toughest in the nation. Thompson barred the state from enforcing that portion of the law until March 2014, a month after oral arguments are scheduled in a lawsuit brought against the state's attorney general by Planned Parenthood. In conservative states, abortion pushback with an eye toward Roe v. Wade . The state has argued the measure is designed to protect the health of a patient. The plaintiffs call it medically unnecessary due to the safety of abortion procedures and said enforcement of the section will force them to shut down. Thompson's order comes just days after federal judges in Wisconsin and North Dakota blocked those states from enforcing new abortion laws. In Wisconsin, U.S. District Judge William Conley issued a temporary restraining order against the enforcement of the law that bans doctors from performing abortions if they don't have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 minutes of their practice. After divisive debate, Texas Senate approves restrictive abortion measure . Conley issued the order after Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed suit. The group alleges the admitting privilege requirement is unconstitutional and treats doctors who perform abortions differently from doctors who perform other types of medical procedures. In North Dakota, a federal judge temporarily blocked the enforcement of the state's new abortion law that is considered one of the most restrictive in the country, saying it was ""unconstitutional."" The North Dakota law bans an abortion when a fetal heartbeat can be detected -- sometimes as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland granted a temporary injunction after a Fargo women's clinic filed a lawsuit last month. In his decision, the judge said ""there is no question"" that the law known as HB 1456 directly contradicts a ""litany"" of Supreme Court cases that address restraints on abortion, including Roe v. Wade. N.C. House passes restrictive abortion bill . CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","U.S. District Judge Myron H. Thompson bars authorities from enforcing the law until 2014 .

"(CNN) -- Maybe it didn't have quite the grandeur of President Barack Obama's historic inauguration four years ago. But Monday's Inauguration Day events showcased the pomp and circumstance of the U.S. government at its finest. We may not have royal weddings in the States, but this is about as close as it gets. And, where there is public spectacle, there is Twitter, the rapid-fire platform where the world's online social critics record their musings. Twitter said its users sent 1.1 million inauguration-related tweets during Monday's swearing-in ceremony, way up from 82,000 in 2009, when Twitter hadn't yet been widely adopted. From politicos to comedians to ordinary citizens, some offered heartfelt thoughts on the historical importance of the day, while others jockeyed for a cheap laugh and a few retweets.

"(CNN) -- The Iranian president on Tuesday likened the anti-government protests during Sunday's observances of Ashura to ""a theater play by the Zionists and the Americans,"" the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency said. ""The Iranian nation has witnessed many plays of this kind: a play ordered by the Zionists and the Americans, who had purchased the tickets to this play and were the only audience of this play,"" IRNA quoted President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as saying. Ashura is the major Shiite Muslim holy day. It marks the death of Imam Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, as a martyr. Shiites commemorate the death of Hussein each year, climaxing on Ashura -- the 10th day of the month of Muharram -- after a 40-day mourning period. Read more about the protests in Iran . Ahmadinejad strongly criticized the positions taken by U.S. President Obama and the British government, IRNA said. The news agency quoted the president as saying he had ""advised"" the two countries several times, but ""they insist on experiencing humiliation."" The British ambassador to Iran, Simon Gass, was summoned to the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday ""to receive Iran's complaint regarding that country's interference in Iran's internal affairs,"" the semi-official news agency Fars reported. Ari Larijani, the speaker of Iran's parliament, also slammed Britain and the United States on Tuesday for condemning the government crackdown Sunday on the protesters. Larijani said authorities should mete out ""the harshest punishment"" to protesters who disrupted Ashura observances. Addressing lawmakers, Larijani said the protesters had insulted Imam Hussein. He urged officials to ""arrest offenders of the religion and mete out harshest punishments to such anti-revolutionary figures with no mercy."" An Iranian media blackout had made it difficult to verify accounts of the weekend's violence, but videos that found their way west depicted bloodied and, in some cases, apparently dead protesters. Are you there? Share your stories, photos and videos . In one video, posted on the Web site YouTube on Tuesday, green and white police trucks rush into crowds of protesters in Tehran. The demonstrators scatter in all directions, but one truck drives into a crowd trapped in a narrow street with a wall on one side and parked cars on the other. The camera follows the truck as it backs away, but a person briefly can be seen crumpled in the street where the truck had been. When the camera returns to the spot, another police truck drives over the person. Other protesters rush to the downed person's aid, but it was not clear whether that person was killed. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the video, or another one obtained by CNN that shows a woman who was reportedly killed when hit by a car driven by members of the Basij, the Iranian paramilitary group. The video shows protesters transfering her body from a clinic near where she was killed to another hospital to keep her remains out of reach of security forces. Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, Tehran's chief prosecutor, said Tuesday that seven people were killed in the Ashura riots Sunday. The toll makes them the bloodiest since June, when protests over the disputed presidential election that gave Ahmadinejad a second term left at least eight dead. The Iranian government has denied that its security forces killed anyone. One of those reported killed was Saeed Ali Moussavi, the nephew of Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi. Moussavi's movement says the nephew was shot to death. Dolatabadi said that one of those killed was fatally shot and that the case is under investigation, but he did not identify the victim. He said most of the seven deaths occurred after the people were struck with ""hard objects or due to similar causes."" Mir Hossein Moussavi's Web site said the nephew was killed in the demonstrations by a shot to the heart. But IRNA said that the bullet came from a ""terror team"" and that other such teams were operating in Tehran. It did not offer further details. The Mehr semi-official news agency quoted security forces Tuesday as explaining that the nephew was standing on a street at midday Sunday when he was ""assassinated by firearm by the occupants of a passing vehicle, and died because of the delay in taking him to the hospital. ""He died of severe bleeding on the way to the hospital. Efforts to identify the culprit or culprits continue."" IRNA disputed an account on the reformist Web site Parlemannews, which said the nephew's body had disappeared. It said the government is holding the body and four others for autopsies. The delay meant the dead could not be buried within 24 hours, as Islamic custom dictates. Iran Deputy Police Chief Ahmad Reza Radan and Tehran Police Chief Azizollah Rajabzadeh denied that their forces had killed anyone. In fact, they told the semi-official Islamic Students News Agency, their forces fired no weapons and weren't even carrying firearms. In many cases, opposition media reported, government security forces prevented observances of Ashura. Police arrested hundreds of people, including prominent figures. Nobel Laureate Shirin Ebadi said Monday that Iranian intelligence officials had detained her sister, dentistry professor Nushin Ebadi. IRNA, Fars and other state news agencies said there would be a pro-government march on Wednesday afternoon.","Ahmadinejad: Ashura protests are ""theater play""

"(CNN) -- The news that one of America's TV icons is suffering from cancer brought sadness. Learning the type of cancer she had made some squeamish. Farrah Fawcett, shown here in 2004, learned she had cancer in 2006. Former ""Charlie's Angels"" actress Farrah Fawcett, 62, was hospitalized this week. She received a diagnosis of anal cancer in 2006. This type of cancer is less common than rectal and colon cancer, and the location of the tumor and risk factors make people squeamish about discussing it openly, doctors said. Colon cancer at one time also was not openly talked about, because of the body part  and functions affected, but with the public awareness campaigns and celebrities advocating for screenings, it has been largely destigmatized. Anal cancer is less familiar. Fawcett has not publicly confirmed the specifics of her illness, but is working on a documentary, titled ""A Wing and a Prayer,"" about her health battle. Anal cancer affects more women and the illness is usually found in people who are in their early 60's. The American Cancer Society estimates that 5,000 new cases of anal cancer are diagnosed each year and about 680 people die from it annually. Meanwhile, colorectal cancer has 148,000 new cases and about 50,000 deaths each year. The numbers of anal cancer cases are rising, although experts haven't been able to pinpoint why. Cultural squeamishness about certain body areas could prevent early diagnosis and treatment of anal cancer, said Dr. Petr F. Hausner, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. ""Patients in the United States hate to be examined in these areas,"" said Hausner, who trained in Czechoslovakia. ""They like to keep their private parts more private than in Europe. In the U.S., the patients hate those exams and physicians hate to do them. The examination is incomplete."" The cultural discomfort might be a minor factor, though. ""The bigger role is the virus,"" he said referring to the human papilloma virus, a key risk factor for anal cancer that also can cause cervical cancer. Getting vaccinated against HPV is a step in prevention, Hausner said. More than half of anal cancer patients experience bleeding as a symptom. Others have no symptoms or report common conditions, such as hemorrhoids, fissures, or warts. Symptoms also include itching or pain in that area, changes in the diameter of stool, abnormal discharge, swollen lymph nodes in the anal or groin areas, according to the American Cancer Society. ""The most common thing is people think it's a hemorrhoid,"" said Dr. Cathy Eng, associate professor in the department of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Patients should consult with their physicians, she said. Anal pap smears are routine only for HIV-positive patients, who are at higher risk for this cancer. There are no anal cancer screening recommendations for non-HIV individuals, because it remains a rare disease, Hausner said. People whose immune system are suppressed, from HIV or drugs taken after organ transplants are at risk for anal cancer. Other risk factors include a sexual history with many partners, a medical history of human papilloma virus (HPV), sexually transmitted diseases or gynecological cancers. People tend to view anal cancer negatively, because they associate the cancer with a few of its risk factors -- such as sexually transmitted diseases or anal sex, Eng said. ""It's one of the risk factors, not the only risk factor,"" Eng said. ""It's fair to say people are stigmatized, she said, primarily because of the disease's association with that type of sex. When anal cancer is caught early, chemotherapy and radiation are highly effective. But if the cancer doesn't respond to treatment and spreads to other areas of the body, the five-year survival rate plummets to 20 percent, Eng said. ""Anal cancer is unique,"" she said. ""The majority of time you can cure the patient, but if you have recurrent or residual disease, you could end up losing your sphincter."" The sphincter are muscles that holds in urine and feces. If the sphincter is removed, the patient must have a special bag, called an ostomy pouch, that collects the waste. Anal cancer is ""much rarer than colon cancer,"" Hausner said. ""For 50 colon cancer patients, we see one anal cancer... It's a rare disease. It is becoming a little bit more frequent. I would say that people are not aware.""","Risk factors for anal cancer include suppressed immune system, HPV, STDs .
New cases of anal cancer number about 5,000 a year, with 680 deaths per year .
Anal cancer it treatable, but becomes more difficult to treat if tumor spreads ."
"(CNN) -- Everyone has tough days at the office, but when Drake has one it goes viral. The rapper has been picked apart online after he tweeted his feelings about his profile in Rolling Stone magazine. The magazine's cover features the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who was found dead at age 46 on February 2 from an apparent drug overdose. According to Drake's tweeted comments -- some of which he later deleted -- not only was he supposed to have the Rolling Stone cover, but the publication printed a quote that he called incorrect. ""I never commented on (Kanye West's) 'Yeezus' for my interview portion of Rolling Stone,"" Drake initially posted on Thursday. ""They also took my cover from me last minute and ran the issue. I'm disgusted with that. RIP to Phillip Seymour Hoffman. All respect due. But the press is evil. I'm done doing interviews for magazines. I just want to give my music to the people. That's the only way my message gets across accurately."" Actually, it's not the only way. By the early morning hours of Friday, Drake turned to his website to give more clarity on his rage against Rolling Stone, and to apologize to the Hoffman family and those who were offended by his comments. ""These days are the worst ones,"" Drake said in a lengthy statement. ""After dwelling on it for a few hours or days you will come to the conclusion that you brought it on yourself almost every time. So here I am having that moment."" Thursday, which also happened to be the fifth anniversary of his landmark ""So Far Gone"" mixtape, was ""an extremely emotional day,"" Drake explained. ""I completely support and agree with Rolling Stone replacing me on the cover with the legendary Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He is one of the most incredible actors of our time and a man that deserves to be immortalized by this publication. My frustration stemmed from the way it was executed. The circumstances at hand are completely justifiable (on the magazine's behalf), but I was not able to salvage my story or my photos and that was devastating."" Drake goes on to say that the issue was printed without him having the option to be in it or not, and that, had he been able to, he would've ""waited until it was my time because I understand the magnitude of the cover they chose. But I just wasn't given that option and that made me feel violated."" In the end, the 27-year-old said he wanted to apologize ""to anybody who took my initial comments out of context, because in no way would I ever want to offend the Hoffman family or see myself as bigger than that moment. I am still the same person. ... I respect Rolling Stone for being willing to give a kid from Toronto a shot at the cover. I guess this is a day to learn and grow.""","Drake lashed out at Rolling Stone on Twitter .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States has seen the first preliminary signs that Russian forces may be preparing to move away from Ukraine's eastern border, a U.S. defense official told CNN on Wednesday. ""There is some evidence of preparations for potential movement,"" the official said. ""At a few locations, there is evidence of troops packing up, but nothing has moved yet."" The official declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information. The official also declined to specify the locations and emphasized that actual movement has not yet occurred. This latest assessment was made days after Russia formally announced it had ordered its troops off the border. And it comes ahead of Ukraine's presidential election scheduled for Sunday. The United States has estimated that 40,000 troops were on the border. Ever since the latest announcement, the United States has been watching for signs of movement to show up in satellite imagery from the area. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered tens of thousands of troops near the Ukraine border to return to their bases, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday. The withdrawal has started, he said, and could take some time to finish. But despite Moscow's assertion, there were no signs of the troops' withdrawal, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said hours later. The United States, which along with other Western countries has sanctioned Russia for its disputed takeover of Crimea, has threatened additional punishment for Russia if it fails to pull its troops back from the border. Putin: 'Our troops are no longer on the border' On Wednesday, Putin said that ""our troops are no longer on the border,"" the Kremlin website said. The President made the remarks during a trip to Shanghai, China, it said. ""They really were quite close to the border and you certainly heard about that. A while back I gave the command to the Ministry of Defence to withdraw them to their training grounds. They are also located in the adjacent regions, in Rostov region, nearby. But now the Ministry of Defence received another instruction. To withdraw them even from these training grounds,"" he said. Putin said the upcoming elections factored into his decision. ""I would like to stress again it is done not because we are embarrassed to keep our troops there -- we are a sovereign state and we keep our troops where we want to -- but to be able to set up extra favorable conditions around the coming presidential elections in Ukraine. To avoid any speculation about that, such a decision was made,"" he said, according to the website. Detained journalist freed . A journalist detained Tuesday in Ukraine was freed Wednesday, according to his Twitter account. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry confirmed to CNN that Russia Today journalist Graham Phillips had been detained and turned in to the Security Service of Ukraine. He sent a series of tweets Wednesday saying he had been freed and describing his detention. ""All my work in order, no charges, no deportation, no one laid a hand on me in anger, Ukrainian authorities treated me fairly. All ok,"" he tweeted. He thanked the British Embassy for its help in his case. The exact circumstances of his detention were not immediately clear, but RT.com said he had been arrested at a checkpoint in Mariupol.

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Garry Kasparov has defeated the world's greatest chess players and battled a supercomputer for supremacy. Now, he's facing his toughest opponent, but trying to check the power of Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn't been easy. Garry Kasparov, right, says Vladimir Putin's regime is at a ""dangerous phase"" of turning into a dictatorship. Intensely sharp, the energetic 44-year-old Kasparov, whose political opposition party has been the most vocal against Putin's Kremlin, can hardly suppress his fury with the country's leadership. Jailed for five days before Sunday's parliamentary elections, the brooding grandmaster has spent long hours plotting his moves and countermoves. ""This regime is entering a very dangerous phase that is turning it into a dictatorship,"" he told journalists as he arrived at his Moscow apartment shortly after his release on Thursday. He said he had been denied access to a lawyer since his arrest at a banned anti-government protest that he organized in Moscow last weekend, but that his commitment to opposing Putin remained strong. ""I'm undeterred in my resolution to fight this regime,"" he said.  Watch Kasparov won't be a pawn » . Maxim Mishchenko, a Putin youth leader, is equally undeterred. The 30-year-old leader of a group called ""Young Russia"" -- one of many  organizations that have sprouted up in support of Putin -- is ardent in his defense of the Kremlin's path. Terms like dictatorship, autocracy and undemocratic make no sense when applied to Russia, he says. ""It is complete nonsense. These accusations are part of the hysteria, which is fueled against our country,"" he said. Sunday's parliamentary elections are expected to reinforce the hold on power of Putin's United Russia Party, although it's not clear what role Putin may have in the regime when his presidential term expires next year. Mishchenko accuses what he calls enemies of Russia of plotting to keep his country weak. ""It doesn't suit certain forces inside and outside Russia to have stability inside of Russia. Therefore, these forces are attempting to shake the situation from inside,"" he said. ""We have seen how it was done in Ukraine and in Georgia, when a minority with the use of political technologies has captured power,"" Mishchenko says, referring to the pro-Western revolutions that took place in the two former Soviet republics in recent years. Kasparov dismisses claims of a U.S.-backed conspiracy funding the opposition movement he has galvanized. Intellectually, he says, the Russian leader is no match. ""I think Putin is a KGB officer, and he is an expert on judo, and he relies only on brute force,"" Kasparov says. ""He is used to playing with an overwhelming advantage and now he's still ahead, but his position is getting worse while we are gaining the momentum."" Putin has been fortunate, he says, to have such high oil prices supporting his regime. Fortunate, not clever. ""He is a lucky president, or a lucky dictator, but that tells us nothing about his ability to play on a level playing field. He was never a part of a public debate, his regime does not know how to deal with a public protest. They don't understand the nature of compromise,"" he said. ""And the only way to make sure the Russian government reflects the views of the Russian people is to learn how to get compromise and create a broad coalition."" But it is precisely Putin's uncompromising stance on a range of issues -- like energy supply to European nations -- that Mishchenko says makes the Russian leader so popular in his country. ""People link their hopes for revival of Russia as a superpower with Putin,"" Mishchenko said. ""Putin has stood up against those wishing that Russia dies as a nation. He gave to Russia the right for revival and he works for saving Russia as a culture and as a nation."" But while Russia's economy -- fueled by high prices for gas and oil -- is booming, and the country is resurgent on the international stage, it is still a nation ravaged by problems. On this, even Kasparov and Mishchenko agree. ""I will work on improving Russian roads, for example, to complete a road from Central Russia to Chita, in the Russian Far East,"" says Mishchenko of his political ambition. ""I think I will also work on improving social conditions for young families, tackling the problem of access to kindergartens."" Kasparov sees the wide wealth gap as the major political problem facing his nation. ""People ask me this question time and again: 'Why, Mr. Kasparov, tell us, there's so much money in the country, but nothing in our pockets?'"" Kasparov said. ""I think people are slowly beginning to understand there is a connection -- a mystical connection for Russians -- between high living standards and political freedom.""

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors released a summary of evidence Tuesday in the case against neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who is accused of second-degree murder in the death of Trayvon Martin. The eight-page document released to the public contains a list of possible witnesses and law enforcement reports that could be used in the prosecution's case against Zimmerman. But it doesn't include details from those statements or reports, and contains no new revelations about the case, which sparked nationwide protests and reflection on race relations and gun laws in the United States. The document is part of the routine exchange of information between prosecutors and defense attorneys that occurs before trials. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said Monday on the website set up to release information from Zimmerman's side that his office had received ""67 compact discs and numerous hardcopy documents"" from prosecutors, including many of the records and statements mentioned in the summary. ""Please remember and understand that it is inappropriate for us to comment on particular pieces of evidence,"" O'Mara said in the website statement. Zimmerman, 28, is accused of killing Martin on February 26 as the African-American teenager walked back to the Sanford, Florida, house where he was staying, after visiting a convenience store. Prosecutors have said Zimmerman, who is a white Hispanic, killed Martin unjustly after profiling him. Zimmerman, who acknowledges shooting Martin but claims self-defense, has entered a not guilty plea in the case, which has not yet been scheduled for trial. A timeline of the case against George Zimmerman . The document lists 50 possible law enforcement witnesses, including 28 officers from the 140-member Sanford Police Department. It also lists 28 civilian witnesses, including Martin's brother, mother and father, two of Zimmerman's friends -- Joe Oliver and Frank Taffe -- and his father, Robert Zimmerman. Prosecutors did not give names for 22 other potential civilian witnesses. Attorneys have previously expressed concern about publicly identifying some witnesses who may fear retribution for their roles in the case, which has inflamed passions among supporters of both Martin and Zimmerman. At least one of the witness interviews was conducted by Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump, according to the document. Evidence taken from Zimmerman after the shooting, including his weapon, bullets, clothes, a DNA sample, medical records and his cell phone data were also included in the disclosure to defense attorneys, according to the document. The document indicates that police technicians in biological and DNA evidence, trace evidence, gunshot residue, fingerprints and firearms may testify, along with two FBI agents, as well as two audio technicians who analyzed emergency calls made during the confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin in an effort to determine who was heard screaming in the background. Experts Tom Owen and Edward Primeau concluded that the screams did not come from Zimmerman, who told police that Martin rushed him after they exchanged words, knocked him to the ground and repeatedly hit his head against the concrete sidewalk. Martin, who lived in Miami, died after a chance encounter with Zimmerman in the gated community where he was staying with his father during a suspension from school. Zimmerman called police to report a suspicious person walking on the streets of the neighborhood, which had been struck by several burglaries in recent months. Prosecutors say he disregarded a dispatcher's advice not to follow the person, who turned out to be Martin, and shot him after a confrontation minutes later. While Zimmerman supporters have characterized him as a well-meaning neighborhood watch volunteer who was only trying to protect his community, Martin's family and supporters have said he unfairly profiled Martin as a troublemaker just because he was an African-American teenager walking down the street wearing a hoodie. Sanford police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman, saying there was no evidence to contradict Zimmerman's claim of self-defense under Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, which allows people to use deadly force anywhere they feel a reasonable threat of serious injury or death. After weeks of protests demanding Zimmerman's arrest, a special prosecutor appointed by Florida Gov. Rick Scott filed the second-degree murder charge against Zimmerman. He was arrested April 11 and briefly jailed. He has returned to hiding after his release on $150,000 bond.","Prosecutors release an eight-page list of witness statements, reports .

"(CNN) -- On Friday, January 18, 2008, chess master Bobby Fischer died at age 64, the same number, CNN.com reader Susan Polgar points out, as the number of squares on a chessboard. Susan Polgar played chess and developed a friendship with Bobby Fisher from 1992 to 1994 in Hungary. No cause of death was given for Fischer, the eccentric genius who was renowned for his Cold War defeat of Russian chess champ Boris Spassky in 1972; his two-decade retreat from chess; and his trip to Yugoslavia in 1992, in defiance of U.S. sanctions, for a rematch with Spassky. After Fischer beat Spassky again, winning $3.5 million, he vanished from the scene once more. He spent his later life denouncing the U.S. and moved to Iceland, where he died. CNN.com asked readers to share their memories of Fischer and his sometimes triumphant, often turbulent life. Below are a collection of their responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Frank Taylor of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Bobby Fischer was simply the best! His aura was the main reason I took up chess, and the more I understood about chess, the more I came to appreciate his sheer genius. Like many others, I did have a problem with his anti-America, anti-Semitic outbursts and views, but his chess playing was pure magic. I'd always hoped and dreamed he would make a final appearance and play Garry Kasparov. What a match that would have been. What a loss of talent. Gregory Campbell of Lewisville, Texas  When I returned home from Vietnam, the game between Bobby Fischer and Spassky had just started. I did not play the game that well, but watching Bobby play was a welcome home for me. He inspired me to learn more about the game, and in so doing, I was able to recover from the war. I will always remember that game and what Bobby has done for me through the game of chess. Susan Polgar of Lubbock, Texas  In spite of his obvious flaws, he will be remembered as ""The King of Chess,"" a genius on the board and the man who broke through the Iron Curtain. I mostly admired him as a chess player and what he did for chess. He put chess on the map in the U.S. and changed the economic opportunities for chess players. If it weren't for him, demanding reparation and prizes in the '60s and '70s, players wouldn't be making the money they are today. He was fanatic about chess; he was working on chess most of his life, even years and years after he retired. His dedication, passion and love for the game, it was his life. It was his profession. It was how he expressed himself. It's symbolic that he died at age 64, for the 64 squares of the chessboard. Tom Brabant Jr. of Lexington, Kentucky  Bobby Fischer was a childhood hero of mine. His match with Spassky resounds in my memory like the Apollo moon missions, and he inspired me to learn chess. His book on the subject [Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess] was a focused treatment of winning chess games (using back-rank mates). It was also a wonderful example of ""programmed instruction."" While I mourn his death, I teach college and would like to believe that a little bit of Bobby lives on in my classroom. Daryl Bertrand of Ottawa, Ontario  As a chess player, I've always been astounded by the mysterious power of Bobby Fischer's play. As a chess teacher, I've always tried to instill his courage and determination in my students. Surely this is the darkest day in the history of chess. Philip Skipper of Lake Charles, Louisiana  When I was a young boy, Bobby Fischer was no less than a hero for me. I am now 51 years old, and I still have the yellowed newspaper clippings of his famous match with Boris Spassky in my desk. Unfortunately, Bobby obviously suffered from mental illness that progressed as the years passed by and eventually destroyed him. His remarks (ravings) of support for the 9/11 attackers upon the United States will certainly be as much of a legacy as being the American Cold War hero, and first American world chess champion three decades earlier. Bobby Fischer was a genius, a hero, a villain and a very sick man. It's a shame that no one could reach him many years ago and save him from himself. Judy Winters of Port Charlotte, Florida  Bobby Fischer was my first boyfriend. Starting about 1955, I would go to the Manhattan chess club with my father. My father would play, and I would drink soda. I saw Bobby a few times there, and we would talk a little. (We were both the same age and very shy.) I fell in love with him at a tournament at Asbury Park, in New Jersey. We went to the boardwalk together, went on rides and played games of chance. His mother was real mad at him when we got back because he was almost late for his game. I think it was Memorial Day or Labor Day, Maybe 1955 or 1958. The Asbury Park newspaper had a picture of me watching one of his games. I wish I could get a copy of that picture. We wrote back and forth for a while, and then I got too cool for chess and he got famous. One time, a Jewish friend of mine said I couldn't marry him because he was Jewish and I wasn't. I wish I could have seen her when he converted. I love remembering him in such an innocent time. He was just a person, like you and me, with a wonderful gift (and he was very cute). If anyone can get that picture from the Asbury Park newspaper, please let me know. I think it was on the front page, because we were only about 13 or 15, and he won. Gerry Christmas of Carrboro, North Carolina  What happened to Robert J. ""Bobby"" Fischer was tragic, Shakespearean in scope. Raised in a New York apartment by a single mother, he rose to take on and vanquish single-handedly the Russian chess behemoth. At age 13, Fischer defeated Donald Byrne in a game now dubbed ""The Game of the Century."" Fischer deserved honor, respect and glory for his great chess achievements, not ridicule, exile and shame. Carlos Calderon of New York, New York  That has to be the greatest loss for all chess players. ... I learned to play the game when he played B. Spassky, and I've been playing the game since then. I've been playing chess all this time, and it's all about fun, and Fischer has been my inspiration. Just a week ago, as I was trying to inspire some kids from a school to learn to play chess, I mentioned to them that Fischer was the greatest American chess player. They were fascinated with the story, and it will be really hard to tell them that Fischer has died. It's a sad day.

"(CNN) -- He's known as ""the millionaire with no face."" And South Korean officials apparently have questions for him. Yoo Byung-un -- businessman, artist, ex-con and religious figure -- does not appear to have a direct financial stake in the Cheonghaejin Marine Co, which runs the ill-fated South Korean ferry Sewol. But South Korean media have reported that some believe he controls the company through two of his sons, who own stakes in the firm through subsidiaries. Yoo's allies strongly deny his involvement. A release issued Friday by a public relations agency representing Yoo insists that he doesn't have anything to do with any company tied to the ferry disaster. Michael Ham, managing director of Ahae Press, said he knows Yoo ""has been spending every single day of the past four to five years focusing on his photography work,"" not directing any firm tied to the sunken ferry. ""I am dismayed at the media reports linking him to the Sewol incident and suggesting that he is directly responsible for this tragedy,"" Ham said. ""These claims cannot be further from the truth."" Authorities searched Yoo's home this week, plus offices of the company that owns the ferry, prosecutors told CNN. The Ahae Press release notes Yoo's sons are among dozens subject to travel bans in light of the ferry incident, calling this ""blanket approach ... standard for investigations by Korean regulators."" Investigators have also searched 20 of the ferry owner's affiliates and a religious organization linked to Yoo, according to the semiofficial Yonhap News Agency. The religious group and a private organization that conducts ship safety investigations are also facing probes in the disaster, Yonhap reported. Prosecutors are looking for evidence of wrongdoing that might have contributed to the Sewol disaster. How Yoo fits into that picture remains murky. Little is officially known about Yoo, who earned his nickname as ""the millionaire with no face"" by making few public appearances. He was convicted on fraud charges in the 1990s and spent four years in prison for tax evasion. He also headed a now-defunct ferry company that operated on the Han River. Yoo is now believed to be involved with the Evangelical Baptist Church, a Korean religious group founded by his father-in-law. It now has 20,000 members, according to Yonhap. More recently, he assumed a new identity of sorts as a photographer and artist who goes by the name ""AHAE."" The news release out Friday indicates his work has gone on display in the Louvre and the Palace of Versailles. A biography on Ahae.com says he has an interest in organic farming and also describes him as an entrepreneur who once designed ships that traveled the Han River. True to Yoo's nickname, Ahae doesn't show his face on the website. He only appears from behind, photographing nature scenes in his trademark style -- out an open window of his South Korean studio. According the website bio, Ahae was born in 1941 in Japan, where his family was during Japanese colonial rule of Korea. That would make him 72 or 73. The biography describes Ahae as ""an inventor, entrepreneur, philanthropist, environmental activist, martial artist, painter, sculptor, poet, and photographer."" ""Ahae has been a conservationist all his life and has done everything within his power to ensure that his business activities do not conflict with his endeavors to maintain the purity of the natural world,"" the biography reads. ""His focus on organic products is a natural extension of his concern for the environment, and the individual in particular.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- In a letter to a Pakistani schoolgirl shot in the head on her way home from school, a senior Taliban commander purportedly tells her that she was targeted not because she advocated education for all girls, but rather for her criticism of the militant group. The letter attributed to Adnan Rashid was released just days after 16-year-old Malala Yousafzai took the stage at the United Nations, where she delivered an emotional plea for the right to go to school on behalf of all children. Malala was 15 when gunmen jumped on her school bus and shouted her name, scaring other girls into identifying her, in the Swat Valley on October 9, 2012. The attack sparked massive protests in Pakistan and condemnation worldwide. ""The Taliban believe you were intentionally writing against them and running a smear campaign to malign their effort to establish an Islamic system in (the) Swat Valley, and your writings were provocative,"" according to the letter, which was dated Monday and released to CNN by a Pakistan intelligence source. ""You have said in your speech ... that the pen is mightier than the sword. So they attacked you for your sword not your books or school."" Malala at U.N.: The Taliban failed to silence us . CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the letter, but its validity has been generally accepted by Pakistan intelligence officials. Rashid made headlines last year after the Taliban broke him out of a Bannu prison, where he was serving a life sentence following his 2003 conviction for his role in the attempted murder of former President Pervez Musharraf. Nearly 400 prisoners were freed in the jailbreak, which authorities believe was staged to get Rashid out, a former Pakistani Air Force officer. Read more: The world's other Malalas . In the letter, Rashid said he was writing -- not as a Taliban leader -- to say he was shocked by the shooting, and to express his regret that he did not warn Malala ahead of time of the attack. The letter went on to say that the Taliban supports the education of women, as long as it adheres to Islamic law. He urged her, according to the letter, to return to Pakistan and ""use your pen for Islam and the plight of the Muslim community."" Gordon Brown, the U.N. special envoy on global education, blasted Rashid's letter. ""Nobody will believe a word the Taliban say about the right of girls like Malala to go to school until they stop burning down schools and stop massacring pupils,"" he said in a statement released Wednesday. Gordon Brown: Malala's U.N. speech is just the beginning . This summer in Pakistan, a teacher was gunned down in front of her son as she drove into her all-girl school. A school principal was killed and his students severely injured when a bomb was tossed onto a school playground at an all-girl school in Karachi in March. In January, five teachers were killed near the town of Swabi in the volatile northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the United Nations says. And, in June, a suicide bomber blew up a bus carrying 40 schoolgirls as it made its way to an all-girl campus in Quetta. Fourteen female students were killed.","A letter purportedly from Adnan Rashid was made public this week .

"(CNN) -- Dear Girls of the World, . The technology industry needs you. Around the world, people are watching movies on laptops, buying goods online and connecting with friends and family through mobile devices. All of these experiences are powered by technology, created by people just like you. Girls of the world, the tech industry is waiting for you. The skills you learn in your math and sciences classes today are the foundation for building technology that will touch nearly every aspect of our lives in the future -- your future. If you invest in learning technical skills, soon you won't just be consuming technology, you'll be defining it, creating it and sharing it with people all over the world. The tech industry is growing faster than nearly all other industries today. In fact, computer programming jobs are growing at two times the U.S. national average. And it's still very early days. Google, for example, is only in its teenage years. The opportunities for a career in technology will only continue to grow as an additional 5 billion people around the world come online. Yet despite being a ripe career field, the tech industry is losing women. In the United States, according to one report: ""young women earned 37% of computer science degrees in 1985; today, the number has plummeted to 18%. Some 22% of software engineers at tech companies are women."" It's a deficiency we see mirrored around the world. If this trend continues, fewer women will have the skills necessary to participate in the tech sector. As a result, fewer women will hold leadership positions in tech, and we'll miss out on the opportunity for women to shape the world around us. This isn't a problem just for women, but for everyone. Innovation thrives on diversity, and we simply can't afford for the future of technology not to represent women or people with different backgrounds and experiences. That's why it's so important for tech leaders to reach out to girls with encouragement. We need to share our enthusiasm and show them all the amazing opportunities available today. Getting girls excited about technology isn't just a job for educators, it's a responsibility for all of us. We also need to create more opportunities for girls to learn technical skills. We have a great start with programs such as the Khan Academy and Code.org that give people access to computer programming education. There are also fantastic local programs that connect girls with communities of other like-minded girls to learn together. For example, Google supports a program called Girlstart that provides science, technology, engineering and mathematics education to girls through afterschool programs and camps. But there are also many girls out there struggling to find access to even the most basic education. The Google RISE Awards helps to bridge this gap by funding science and technology education for primary and secondary school students around the world. And initiatives such as Girl Rising put a spotlight on just how powerful access to education can be for young women. For girls who don't benefit from support early on, it's also important to remember that it's never too late to get started. I was finishing up my senior year of college, studying history and literature, when I decided to get into tech. I wondered if it was too late to change paths, but I decided to do it anyway. Years later, I joined a new startup -- Google -- and I've never looked back. For all the girls out there who think it's too late to get into tech, know that it's never too late to pursue a good opportunity, even if it means taking a different path. So, people of the world, let's help girls rise up in the field of technology and support them with the programs they need. If you're in technology, talk to your daughters, nieces and friends about just how cool it is to work in tech. And we can all help them find internships, encourage them in their studies and foster their creative spirits. The future of technology affects us all. Let's all work together to build it. -- Susan Wojcicki . More: CNN's ""Girl Rising"" Read more open letters . Open letter from Christiane Amanpour: It's time to power the world .

"(CNN) -- An all-female jury will start hearing the murder case against Florida neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman next week, with opening arguments in the closely watched trial set for Monday. The jury was selected Thursday afternoon after defense attorney Mark O'Mara completed his question-and-answer session with the potential jurors. Opening statements are scheduled to begin Monday morning, Judge Debra Nelson said Thursday. The prosecuting and defense attorneys referred to the jury members as five white women and one black or Hispanic woman. CNN does not have access to the juror questionnaires and cannot confirm the ethnicities of the jurors. Four alternate jurors -- two women and two men -- will hear the case as well. Nelson asked Zimmerman if he agreed with the jurors selected to serve on the panel, and he said he did. Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch captain, is charged with second-degree murder for killing 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, on the night of February 26, 2012. He says he shot the teenager in self-defense, but prosecutors accuse him of unjustly profiling and killing Martin. An initial decision by police not to pursue charges in the case led to the dismissal of the town's police chief and sparked fresh debates about race relations and gun laws in the United States. Zimmerman is Hispanic; Martin was African-American. Opinion: The facts must decide Trayvon Martin case . O'Mara began the day by explaining the definition of reasonable doubt to the jury pool. He said it's a complicated concept that even ""third-year law students"" can have difficulty understanding. O'Mara questioned the 40 potential jurors about a variety of topics, including their beliefs about gun ownership and their thoughts on self-defense. O'Mara pointed out that Florida law states that there is no duty to retreat when being threatened, but Nelson admonished O'Mara, saying she did not want the attorneys interpreting the law for the jurors. Nelson then read to the jury the strict definition of justifiable homicide that they must consider during deliberations. Justifiable homicide is a killing where no criminal liability can result, such as when someone acts in self-defense to protect himself or another person. O'Mara finished his questioning of the jury before Nelson broke for lunch. When court resumed Thursday afternoon, the attorneys began the process of whittling down jury pool to the six jurors and the four alternates needed for the trial. Under Florida law, six-person juries hear all criminal cases except capital offenses. The charges against Zimmerman do not make it a capital case. Fast facts: Trayvon Martin shooting . After the jury was selected, attorneys representing the Martin family released a statement saying with the makeup of the panel, ""the question of whether every American can get equal justice regardless of who serves on their jury panel will be answered."" The statement, from the law firm of Parks and Crump, added, ""We firmly believe that when these jurors see the overwhelming evidence that will be put before them in the coming weeks, they will find George Zimmerman guilty of murder on the night in question."" Both sides had the chance to keep or strike jurors. Each side had 10 peremptory strikes -- 10 opportunities to eliminate potential jurors without having to disclose their reasons -- and an unlimited number of strikes ""for cause,"" for such reasons as bias or hardships. Court will be in session Friday to handle any outstanding issues before opening statements begin, and Nelson said she try to make a ruling Friday on the admissibility of technology used to analyze the screams on a 911 call from the night of the shooting. The technology may be key to the prosecution's case, because their experts' testimony may be able to shed light on what was said between Zimmerman and Martin moments before the teenager was shot. If the analysis indicates Martin screamed for help, it could hurt the credibility of Zimmerman's claim that he acted in self-defense. The law states that for technology to be admissible, it must be ""generally accepted"" in that particular field. Zimmerman's attorneys are arguing the technology does not satisfy that threshold. On June 6, defense expert Hirotaka Nakasone, an audio engineer for the FBI, expressed his doubts about using the recordings. ""A screaming voice is too far for us to address,"" Nakasone said. ""It might mislead in the worst case."" CNN's Grace Wong, Rich Phillips and MaryLynn Ryan contributed to this report.","An all-female jury will hear the Zimmerman murder case .

"(CNN) -- As Iraqis count the votes following the first parliamentary elections since U.S. troops withdrew from the country at the end of 2011, they agree on one thing: the fierce urgency of change. Although the vote is an important milestone in Iraq's fragile state, it is unlikely to resolve the country's severe political crisis and generate a new social contract and a constitution that enshrine equal citizenship before the rule of law. At the heart of Iraq's structural crisis lies a dysfunctional political system based on muhasasa or distribution of power along communal, ethnic and tribal lines, a system put in place after the U.S. invaded and occupied the country in 2003. Ever since, the dominant social groups have fought over the division of political spoils, unwilling to put the interests of the nation over their own sects and tribes. Although the rules of the game influence the conduct of the political class, politicians of all colors (Shiites, Sunni Arabs and Sunni Kurds) have not transcended their narrow parochial concerns and have not risen up to the historic challenge. Iraq faces a two-pronged systemic and leadership challenge. The ruling political class is as much responsible for Iraq's predicament as structural conditions. The structure is not destiny. Having taken ownership of the country after U.S. occupation and ouster of Saddam Hussein, the Shiite leadership has treated Sunni Arabs like second-class citizens and has equated its numerical majority with a license to monopolize power at the expense of others. In a similar vein, the Sunni leadership has not come to terms with the new realities of post-Saddam Iraq and still entertains illusions about ruling Iraq. Kurdish leaders would not mind if Iraq burns as long as they preserve a separate Kurdistan -- a quasi-independent entity. Of all actors, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki bears greater responsibility for the steep deterioration of the security situation and the quality of life of Iraqis, including corruption that infects all aspects of Iraqi society. After eight years in office and monopolizing power, al-Maliki has failed his countrymen and has delivered neither security nor prosperity. He was blind and deaf to the gathering storm among Sunnis Arabs who feel excluded by what they view as his sectarian-based policies. Under his watch, al Qaeda factions -- or the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (Greater Syria) known by its Arabic acronym, ""Daish"" -- has revived and found shelter among dissatisfied Sunnis. Indeed, Iraq is deeply polarized along social, ideological and communal lines, witnessing a resilient Sunni insurgency in late 2012 that has exacted a heavy human toll and has almost plunged the country to the brink of civil war. Since last May, almost 1,000 civilians get killed each month and the insurgents, a mix of tribesmen and al Qaeda extremists, control neighborhoods of the provincial capital, Ramadi, and nearly all of the nearby city of Fallujah. The conflict in Syria has aggravated communal tensions in Iraq and polarized the country further. It is now almost forgotten that the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham established al-Nusra Front in Syria, al Qaeda's official arm, and built a potent jihadist infrastructure in the war-torn country. The two insurgencies in Syria and Iraq feed on one another and supply the fuel that powers their deadly engines. Yet al-Maliki, who leads the mainly Shiite State of Law Coalition, is shamelessly running on a triumphant slogan presenting himself as a strong Shiite leader who can defeat al Qaeda. ""Together, we defeat terrorism"", one of his campaign posters declares. Instead of pledging to form a genuine national unity government that tackles Iraq's structural problems, al-Maliki is also asking voters to give him an absolute majority to form a stronger central rule, as if he has not already accumulated too much power, blaming weak governance on political rivals who blocked his efforts. ""Partnership with other political factions has hampered the government performance,"" al-Maliki told his supporters during a campaign rally in Babil province south of Baghdad. It is doubtful if either al-Maliki's coalition or any other would gain an outright electoral majority because of the extent of inter- and intra-communal fragmentation. More than 9,000 candidates from nearly 280 political entities are vying for 328 seats in parliament. Not unlike the last parliamentary vote in 2010, intra-sectarian Shiite rivalries mark this round. The prime minister's bloc is challenged by The Citizen Coalition, led by Ammar al-Hakim of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, Ammar al-Hakim, and the Ahrar Coalition, formed by followers of the Islamist populist Sadrist Movement. Although in 2010 Iran played a key role in convincing al-Hakim and al-Sadr to back al-Maliki and provide him with a majority to form a government, it might not be able to do so now given that the gulf among the three reluctant Shiite allies has widened. Sunni Arabs are as divided as the Shiites. In a consolidated democracy, electoral division would produce a broadly-based coalition government. Not so in Iraq's case, a fragile country with deep sociological rifts, dysfunctional political system, and absence of a viable progressive non-sectarian alternative. Far from beginning the complex process of nation-building and social reconstruction, an urgent task, the vote would likely prolong the crisis of authority and legitimation. Many Iraqis whom I speak to say they have low expectations of the vote; they are cynical about the politicians who promise deliverance but fall far too short. I have not met a single Iraqi who believes that the elections would signal either a new beginning, a different direction, or inject fresh blood in the veins of the cloaked body politic. Rather more modestly, Iraqis hope that the new leadership will prevent the country from sliding to all-out war and putting its house in order.

"Editor's note: Meloney Dunning, this year's Real Simple ""Life Lessons Essay Contest"" winner, describes the heartbreaking day when she decided to say good-bye to her newborn son, who was born prematurely. (Real Simple) -- Sitting in the newborn intensive care unit five years ago, I could feel my heart pound in my chest and my throat tighten in panic at the sight of my son. Real Simple: How to make positive changes in your life . The doctor had come to my bedside that morning and told me that Phoenix had suffered through a difficult night. But that didn't remotely prepare me for what I now witnessed. Alarms were ringing, the numbers on his monitors plummeting. All the while, my beautiful boy lay there, apparently peaceful, as chaos surrounded him. What frightened me most was that nobody rushed to his side. This state of frenzy, it seemed, was the status quo for our boy, and it was only my husband, Adam, and I who were distraught. Real Simple: How to tell if someone is lying . Phoenix was just three days old. I had developed preeclampsia during my pregnancy and spent the last several weeks in the hospital, desperately trying to keep him inside and growing. Finally, at 27 weeks, my body decided that it could do no more. The doctors rushed me to the operating room, my frightened husband at my side, and delivered our tiny baby by Cesarean section. He was one pound, 12 ounces and just 12 inches long. Although he was very early and very small, I believed in him. I knew that he would thrive. Real Simple: How to stop procrastinating . Now Adam and I sat at his bedside. After what felt like forever but was only a few minutes, the nurse approached us. She discussed some of Phoenix's challenges and went to get his doctor. We waited, choking back fear and praying for a miracle. Real Simple: 24 nutritious and tasty snacks . When the doctor came in, she was calm and gentle. I cannot remember her name or her face. But what I remember is this: She began to describe to us the difficulties that Phoenix had faced in the last eight hours, the hours during which I had slept peacefully, aided by pain medicine and a false sense of security. He had suffered an intra-ventricular hemorrhage, or IVH, which is bleeding in the ventricles of the brain. There are four types, or grades, of severity, the doctor said, and she began to explain the complications related to each type. Real Simple: How to snack smarter . I remember, too, how time warped as she talked on and on about the types. It was like a trick they do in movies, clock hands racing while someone drones in slow motion. Each time she described a grade, I expected her to stop and tell us that this was the type of IVH that Phoenix had had. But she kept going. At last, she mentioned a grade 4 hemorrhage, and she swallowed hard around the words. Fleetingly, my heart ached for this doctor who had to deliver such news to us, who had to tell us about the permanent damage that this hemorrhage was causing our son. Real Simple: 8 steps to a happier family life . When she was finally, mercifully finished telling us what Phoenix was up against, we just sat there in shock. She gently explained that we could take time to make some decisions about how we would like to proceed with treatment and left us with our son. In the quiet of the newborn intensive care unit, I could feel the sobs building inside me. ""Hurry,"" I begged my husband as he wheeled me back to my room. Once there, we both collapsed, allowing ourselves to release the grief behind this closed door. It didn't seem possible that this baby could fail, not this little boy who had spent the last many weeks dancing joyfully on my bladder. Not the feisty guy who had such bursts of energy inside my belly each day. Not our son, whom we had named years in advance, after the power of being renewed by fire. And, yet, here we were. As I was lying in my hospital bed in the weeks before Phoenix was born, I had often talked to him. I told him my fears about his health. I told him about my love for him. I cried many, many tears. One of my biggest fears, I told him, was that he would be born and spend hours being poked with needles and feeling nothing but anguish. While he still kicked inside me, I told him that if he needed to let go, if he wasn't strong enough for this life, I could handle it. Especially if it meant that he could avoid being in pain. It wasn't going to be that way. Adam and I had never really discussed the worst possibilities for our son, but we had decided a while back that whatever happened, we would be the ones to decide how Phoenix's care proceeded. Now was the time to face that decision. While Phoenix still kicked inside me, I told him that if he needed to let go, if he wasn't strong enough for this life, I could handle it. Especially if it meant that he could avoid being in pain. What we both knew was that we loved this little boy more than anything we had ever known before. We discussed the diagnosis we had been given and what that would mean for his, and our, future. And I knew this: My greatest fear for Phoenix was right before me, coming true inside these walls where life-and-death choices were made every day. The truth is, it didn't take long for Adam and me to decide that what we wanted was to keep our son comfortable. I thought of his tiny body in the incubator, respirator in place, blood-pressure cuff pumping, needles and catheters and scans and transfusions. It was not how we wanted him to live. What we wanted more than anything was for him to live the time that he had left knowing our touch, knowing our love, feeling that we were with him, no matter what. We called the few people we could bear to speak with and shared the news. We cried and cried and tried to hold each other, though I was too sore from my own surgery and weeks of bed rest to move into any comfortable position in my husband's arms. When we were calm, we went back to Phoenix's bedside. The doctor returned, and we told her that we did not want to continue his life support. We asked her if we could find a place to sit and rock him, a private place to say our good-byes and hold him tight. She didn't question our decision for one moment. She just ushered us to an empty room and told us that she was going to unhook the baby from his machinery. When the nurse brought my baby back into the room, it was the hardest moment of my life. Harder than hearing his diagnosis. Harder than making the decision to stop treatment. Here he was, our sweet little peanut, without any of the lifesaving equipment that he needed to keep him alive. Still, he rested peacefully in his tiny blanket and hat. When the nurse handed him to me for the first time, I fully realized how little, how light he really was. My husband and I held him and rocked him, petted him and cooed over him as all new parents do. The only difference being that our hello would also serve as a goodbye. I will always treasure the minutes we spent together in that room. I willed my son to know that no matter how hard it was, I was right here. I would not leave his side. Most of those momentsâ€”his final momentsâ€”I keep inside my heart and have never shared with anyone. They belong to us, Phoenix and Adam and me. The nurse stayed close by, and, eventually, she let us know that Phoenix had passed. His tiny, little spirit had flown from a body that couldn't hold him. There was no sign from him, ever, in either life or death. Just peaceful release. In the days and years since his death, I have turned it all over and over in my head. I no longer ask why. Things, bad things, happen to people every day. I have doubted our decision at times, but I know that those thoughts come from fear. In my heart of hearts, I know that we did the best thing we could for our child. And only with this distance can I see that, perhaps, he did the best he could for me, too. By not listening to me and letting go before his birth, he gave me the gift of being his mother. And that is a gift I would never give up, no matter how much pain came along with the package.

"(CNN) -- Twitter is testing a major profile redesign that's very reminiscent of Facebook and Google+. Mashable assistant features editor Matt Petronzio spotted on Tuesday a huge update to his Twitter profile page, with the main picture and bio scaled to the left and significantly more real estate dedicated to the header photo. The revamped tweet stream is also a departure from its signature look. There is a greater focus on photos and content cards. It moves away from a strictly vertical timeline too. Click the image below to enlarge. It's common for Twitter to quietly test new features and design updates before tweaking or rolling it out to a larger user base. Experiments typically go out to a small, random pool of users. Under the header photo in the test is the count for tweets, photos/videos (a new category called out on the profile), who you are following, followers, favorites and lists. Although Petronzio isn't verified on the site, there's an option for the stream to show ""Tweets"" and ""Tweets and replies"" for every user â€” a feature typically reserved for those with the blue check mark. Other profile pages viewed from an account with the new design are automatically made to look like this too. This means that even if your Twitter page isn't a part of the test, Petronzio can see what yours will look like. SEE ALSO: Everything you need to know about Bitcoin in 2 minutes . The recommended header photo size in the test version is 1500 x 500 pixels, up from 1252 x 626 in the current design, so users with the new design will want to switch their picture so it doesn't look stretched. The news comes days after Twitter rolled out its latest design to all users, after weeks of behind the scenes testing. The company declined to comment on this story.

"(CNN) -- The U.S Navy minesweeper that grounded on a Philippine reef last week has taken on water and sustained too much damage to be towed off, the Navy says. ""It's got hull penetrations in several places, and there is a significant amount of water inside the ship,"" Rear Adm. Tom Carney said at a briefing Thursday. The Navy said it will use ship-borne cranes and heavy-lift vessels to lift the minesweeper, the USS Guardian, off the Tubbataha Reef. ""As the crane ships arrive, we will take items off the Guardian to lighten the weight of the ship so we are able to remove it from the reef,"" Carney said. ""The option that we had hoped to tow the ship off the reef is not available. The ship is too badly damaged."" The Guardian would be removed from the area on a barge or other ship, Carney said. ""The ship cannot move on its own, and it is not operational,"" he said. The 224-foot-long,1,312-ton ship was on its way from Subic Bay, Philippines, to its next port call in Indonesia when it struck the reef, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) east-southeast of Palawan Island in the Sulu Sea, on January 17. Initial efforts to free the Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship at high tide were unsuccessful. Its crew of 79 was evacuated to other vessels, and the ship was battered by waves that pushed it farther onto the reef. Carney said the Guardian now rests about 20 to 30 meters (22 to 33 yards) from the edge of the reef. Originally, only its bow was on the reef, but waves have now pushed the entire ship onto it. Lt. Cmdr. James Stockman, a Navy spokesman in Manila, said Friday that the heavy-lift vessels would arrive at the grounding site in about a week. The guided missile destroyer USS Mustin, the oceanographic survey ship USNS Bowditch and the rescue and salvage ship USNS Salvor, as well as tugboats and Philippine navy and coast guard vessels, are on station, he said in an e-mail to CNN. ""Extracting the ship safely, while minimizing further damage to the reef, is a very complex process that requires careful and detailed planning and specialized equipment,"" Stockman said. ""Although we are moving as expeditiously as possible, we want to ensure it is done safely while minimizing damage to the reef and surrounding environment."" It could take two weeks to remove the Guardian from the reef, Carney said. ""We are committed to moving the ship from the reef as soon as possible. ... That is the focus of all our efforts,"" he said. The Navy said Friday that the ships on station have removed about 15,000 gallons of diesel fuel from the Guardian. Carney said there have been no signs of oil or fuel leaking into the waters above the reef, which is a Philippine national park and UNESCO World Heritage Site. The reef is home to a vast array of sea, air and land creatures, as well as sizable lagoons and two coral islands. About 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral can be found there, as can whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles and one of the last surviving colonies of breeding seabirds in the region, according to UNESCO. Philippine officials said this week that the Philippines would seek compensation for damage to the reef. About 1,000 square meters (about 10,760 square feet) of the reef have been damaged. ""It's a damage to a world heritage site. It's a damage to our natural resources. It's a damage to an important site. We cannot but put emphasis on the importance of this reef as a heritage site,"" presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda said. He said the salvage operation must ensure that the reef sustains no further damage. As to how the ship got stuck on the reef in the first place, Stockman said the Navy is looking at a number of factors. He said the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which prepares the digital navigation charts used by the Navy, has reported the location of the reef was misplaced on a chart by nine miles. ""The U.S. Navy investigation will review what charts Guardian was using. While this erroneous navigation chart data is important information, no one should jump to conclusions,"" Stockman said. ""It is critical that the U.S. Navy conduct a comprehensive investigation that assesses all the facts and circumstances surrounding the Guardian grounding.""","The USS Guardian has several holes in its hull, admiral says .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Mir Hossein Moussavi, the Iranian opposition leader and symbol of anti-government fervor, lashed out against Iranian authorities on Tuesday, saying remnants of the ""tyranny"" and ""dictatorship"" that prevailed under the toppled Shah of Iran's regime persist today. ""In the early years of the Islamic Revolution, most people were convinced that the structure of the revolution would destroy the past political situation of tyranny and dictatorship, and I was one of them who believed that,"" said Moussavi, a former prime minister. But now, he said, he no longer believes that. ""The current political situation in Iran indicates the presence of the remaining roots of tyranny and dictatorship of the Shah,"" whose regime was overthrown in 1979 and replaced by an Islamic republic led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. ""I don't believe that the revolution achieved its goals,"" said Moussavi, speaking out forcefully as the tensions over Iranian politics continue. The regime is marking the anniversary of the shah's overthrow with a series of events that began this week and culminate on February 11. Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi, another Iranian opposition leader, have urged supporters to demonstrate. Those celebrations coincide with Iranian trials and executions of street protesters who demonstrate against the June 12 presidential election victory of incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In the final results Ahmadinejad was declared the winner over Moussavi, a result seen by many Iranians as questionable or rigged. The initial protests broke out last summer and have persisted. In late December, at least seven people were killed and hundreds arrested, witnesses said, as they took to the streets on Ashura, a Muslim holy day which occurred on December 27. Moussavi's nephew was among those killed during those protests. The Iranian government has denied that its security forces killed anyone and has blamed reformists for the violence. Police have arrested 4,000 people in the post-election crackdown. Moussavi, who made his Web site comments in a question and answer format, said an Iranian government that reflects ""dictatorship in the name of religion is the worst kind"" and he added he has lost hope ""that the revolution had removed all those structures which could lead to totalitarianism and dictatorship."" ""The most evident manifestation of a continued tyrannical attitude is the abuse of parliament and judiciary. We have completely lost hope in the judiciary,"" he said. ""Stifling the media, filling the prisons and brutally killing people who peacefully demand their rights in the streets indicate the roots of tyranny and dictatorship remain from the monarchist era."" The semi-official Fars news agency reported Tuesday that Iran will soon execute nine more people in connection with the country's post-election riots. The nine are among 11 who were sentenced to death by Tehran's Revolutionary Court last month. Iran vows to execute protesters . Two were hanged last week, and a senior judiciary official was quoted as saying ""the two people who were executed as well as the other nine who will soon be executed had certainly been arrested during the recent riots. ""Each had belonged to an anti-revolutionary group, had aspired to sow dissent and to uproot the regime,"" the official said. Moussavi also praised the grass-roots Green opposition movement. But he said while protesters should vent their opinions, they should follow law and not overstep legal bounds. Any law-breaking would hurt the reform movement, he said. ""The ultimate goal is to move toward an independent, free and united Iran. Women and men of all cultures, classes and ideas should have opportunities,"" he said. ""The Green movement stands for human dignity, open ideas, diversity and freedom of expression."" Moussavi hasn't been arrested since the protests began, but he is facing the wrath of an establishment targeting reformers like him. At the same time the regime is risking even further civil unrest if it takes him into custody. Recently, Iran's parliament asked authorities to arrest ""the main instigators and directors"" of violent anti-government protests, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday, the same day massive pro-government rallies were held in Tehran and other cities. Legislator Hassan Noroozi named three people he said ""must be arrested"" -- Moussavi, Karrubi, and Fa'ezeh Hashemi, daughter of the former reformist president, Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. ""They must not remain on the sidelines and be safe,"" Noroozi said. ""Those who issue statements and invite people to create chaos in the streets and attack one another must be dealt with according to Islamic laws."" Pro-government crowds demonstrating in Tehran have chanted ""Death to America,"" ""Death to Israel,"" and ""Death to Moussavi."" Noting the pressure and threats in the highly-charged political environment, Moussavi has said on his Facebook page that he is ready for ""martyrdom."" CNN's Mitra Mobasherat contributed to this report.","Iran marking the anniversary of the shah's overthrow with a series of events .

"(TIME.com) -- Two of Emily Cunningham's three children have food allergies. And protecting her kids is taking toll on the family budget. When she was nine months old, Cunningham's four-year-old daughter Elena ate a spoonful of yogurt and broke out in hives. Elena is allergic to eggs, tree nuts, dairy and peanuts, and even brief contact with one of the these hard-to-avoid items is all it takes to set off a potentially life-threatening immune reaction. Cunningham's eight-month-old son Wyatt has a bad dairy allergy too. In order to keep their kids safe and healthy, Emily Cunningham, a stay-at-home mother from Charlotte, North Carolina who writes the AllergenMenuMom blog, and her husband keep a completely allergy-free home, buying only food products that are free of any trace of their children's triggers. But that protection comes at a high price. Between breathing medications and epipens of epinephrine, a drug used to treat anaphylactic shock, the Cunninghams spend about $1,000 a month to safeguard their children from their allergies, and that's before the grocery bill. Emily estimates her family spends $80 a month just on rice milk. TIME.com: How nut allergies made me monogamous . About 4% to 6% of U.S. children under age 18 have food allergies, and the latest statistics show this percentage may be on the rise. Why so many kids are experiencing allergies to common food items still isn't clear, although experts suspect that some of the trend can be attributed to improved public health and sanitation efforts that may have made us too clean to build strong enough immunity to common allergens found in food and the environment. Kids not eating things like nuts and shellfish at an earlier age may also contribute to the rise in food allergies. Regardless of how the shift began, however, researchers reporting in the journal JAMA Pediatrics say that the economic cost of food allergies is also reaching a peak, with families like the Cunninghams spending an estimated $25 billion per year, or about $4,184 per child. About $4.3 billion of those costs involve direct medical fees such as medications and emergency treatments for allergic reactions, with $20.5 billion going to additional yearly costs to families. TIME.com: Why we're going nuts over nut allergies . While other studies have investigated the economic toll of food allergies, few have studied in detail how these costs affect a family's finances. A 2011 study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, for example, calculated that the national cost was much lower at about $500 million, but the authors acknowledged that they underestimated the prevalence of food allergies, and excluded some other costs families cover, such as higher fees for special foods and lost productivity of parents who had to sacrifice their jobs to care for their children. TIME.com: Being born in the U.S. puts kids at higher allergy risk . For the new estimate, the researchers looked at both direct medical costs like hospital visits, co-payments and medication purchases, as well as other costs that are unique to families of children with food allergies â€” including special child care arrangements, allergy-friendly summer camps and even changing schools. ""I am the room mom for [Elena's] class so I can be directly involved in planning activities,"" says Cunningham. ""I always make sure I know what is being brought in when another child has a birthday, and during special events I provide safe alternatives for my daughter, which are as similar as possible to the treats the other kids will have."" The study authors also accounted for less direct costs, such as in lost career opportunities for parents of food-allergic children, which they estimated at $14.2 billion. Overall, they found that caring for a child with major food allergies harms a caregiver's career, primarily because many parents, who live with the specter of imminent -- and often emergency -- care, choose to be around their children more frequently to ensure they are safe from exposure. Emily, for example, quit her job as a speech therapist to stay at home, and her husband Justin left his banking job to create apps that help families find restaurants that provide detailed information about their menu ingredients. How can these costs be lowered? The authors of the study say more policies that ensure safe environments for kids could provide some relief. A month ago, the Senate began considering a bill that would give states an incentive to make epinephrine more widely available. States that allow schools to stock epinephrine are given preferential status when they apply for federal grants for asthma funding. The bill also encourages schools to allow trained staff instead of only nurses to administer epinephrine to students who may be having a reaction, and requires states to ensure that administrators have legal protections when they try to help students who might be in allergic shock. TIME.com: Genetic glitch may explain most allergies, asthma . But will making more places ""safer"" cut back on costs? In some ways, yes. But Dr. Carla Davis , pediatric allergist and immunologist at Texas Children's Hospital says families will start to see the greatest decreases in costs once better treatments are developed. For instance, researchers are looking into oral treatments that could potentially ""cure"" children of their allergies by building their tolerance with repeated exposures to tiny amounts of the allergen. Doctors are encouraged by early results that suggest such de-sensitization can lessen the chances that allergic children will experience anaphylactic shock if they are exposed. More options for treating immediate reactions can also lower costs of devices like epinephrine devices; when the new epinephrine auto-injector, Auvi-Q,which is slimmer and more portable that previous models, was launched last year, more coupons and discounts were available for epi pens overall. TIME.com: Bullying over food allergies . ""A little competition has made a big difference for a lot of families,"" says Cunningham. ""The number of people dealing with foods allergies is promoting more products to become available, which should help with affordability and availability of options.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court sided on Tuesday with adoptive parents in a divisive custody fight over a Native American child after the biological father asserted his parental rights. The justices, by a 5-4 margin, said the adoption by a white couple was proper and did not intrude on the federal rights of the father, a registered member of the Cherokee tribe, over where his daughter, Veronica, 3, would live. The court said the father could not rely on the Indian Child Welfare Act for relief because he never had legal or physical custody at the time of adoption proceedings, which were initiated by the birth mother without his knowledge. Justice Samuel Alito said when ""the adoption of an Indian child is voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent with sole custodial rights, the (law's) primary goal of preventing unwarranted removal of Indian children and the dissolution of Indian families is not implicated."" The appeal was filed by Matt and Melanie Capobianco, who legally adopted Veronica in 2009 shortly after the birth mother agreed to give up the child. She is known in court papers as ""Baby Girl."" The South Carolina Supreme Court ruled last year for the biological father, Dusten Brown, who had sought custody after Veronica's birth. He is a registered member of the Cherokee Nation and is raising the child in Oklahoma. The ICWA remains in effect, but the high court majority concluded the biological father could not apply it to his circumstances. The Supreme Court ruling throws the issue back to the state courts, but it was not clear whether and when Brown would have to turn the girl over to the Capobiancos. The Charleston, South Carolina, couple said they hope the ruling will prevent disruptions of other adoptions. ""We are very happy with the ruling today. The Supreme Court gave us everything that we asked for,"" Melanie Capobianco told CNN affiliate WCSC. ""They made it very clear that Veronica would have never been taken from her home and from her family and that the adoption would have been approved."" She and Matt Capobianco said separation from Veronica has been difficult. ""We are looking forward to seeing her again soon when we have the opportunity to do so, because we miss her so very much,"" said Melanie Capobianco. Christinna Maldanado, Veronica's birth mother, also expressed satisfaction. ""Matt and Melanie are part of my family, and they have treated me like part of theirs. I'm hopeful that we will all be reunited with Veronica very soon,"" the statement said. There was no immediate reaction from Brown, or the tribe. But Native American groups remained hopeful he would still keep custody. ""While we are pleased the court has upheld ICWA, we're very disappointed for Dusten, Veronica, and the Brown family that the court has ruled to send the case back to the South Carolina courts on a technicality,"" said Jefferson Keel, president of the National Congress of American Indians. ""However, the courts in South Carolina have previously affirmed that Dusten Brown is Veronica's father and that he is a fit parent. We are confident that his parental rights will be upheld and that Veronica will stay with her family,"" Keel said. The case is Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, a Minor Child Under the Age of Fourteen Years (12-399)","Sharply divided Supreme Court says adoption by white couple of Native American girl was legal .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. military successfully conducted a test of the Ballistic Missile Defense System in a joint military exercise on Sunday, the Pentagon confirmed in a statement. ""This is a very important step in our continuing efforts to improve and increase the reliability of our homeland Ballistic Missile Defense System,"" Missile Defense Agency Director Vice Adm. James D. Syring said in the statement. A long-range, ground-based interceptor was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, and successfully intercepted a simulated incoming ballistic missile threat launched from a test site on the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, colliding over the Pacific Ocean. The Pentagon says initially it appears that all the systems and components performed as expected. The agency says it will spend the next several months conducting an extensive evaluation based upon telemetry and other data it got during the test. ""We'll continue efforts to ensure our deployed ground-based interceptors and our overall homeland defensive architecture continue to provide the warfighter an effective and dependable system to defend the country,"" Syring said. A number of U.S. government and military defense agencies participated in the joint exercise, including the Missile Defense Agency, the Air Force 30th Space Wing, U.S. Northern Command, the Army and the Navy. The Pentagon says Sunday's test of the Ballistic Missile Defense System was the 65th successful hit-to-kill intercept out of 81 attempts since 2001.","Branches of U.S. military conduct joint test of missile defense system .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations will investigate claims by the government and rebels that either side used chemical weapons against each other in the Syrian conflict. The United Kingdom and France have also put in requests with the U.N. to investigate the alleged use of such weapons in three cases. U.S. President Barack Obama and other American officials have said in recent days there was no intelligence to substantiate reports that rebels used chemical weapons against government troops. Now analysts are also ""leaning hard away"" from the notion that Syria used chemical weapons against its own people, a U.S. military official directly familiar with the preliminary analysis told CNN. That official told CNN ""there are strong indications now that chemical weapons were not used by the regime in recent days."" The official would not detail the indications. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, were not authorized to publicly release details of the intelligence analysis. Game-changer: Syria's 'probability' of using chemical warfare . Syria claimed rebels used chemical weapons in an attack Tuesday in Khan al-Asal in the northern province of Aleppo. State-run media blamed rebels for the attack, which it said killed 25 people and injured more than 110 others. Rebels, meanwhile, accused government forces of a chemical weapons attack on the rural Damascus suburb of Ateibeh. An analysis of video of hospitalized Syrians released by state-run TV suggests people are not suffering from a chemical weapons attack, nor are they being treated as though they were in such an attack, the U.S. military official said. ""The actions in the video don't match up to a chemical weapons response,"" the official said, adding that Syrian hospitals may have a shortage of the supplies that would be expected to be used in such an attack. Analysts believe it's possible people in the video were deliberately exposed to a ""caustic"" agent such as chlorine. But that would not be the same as using a chemical weapons as defined by international treaties, such as a nerve or blister agent. ""Something went down, but it was short of a chemical weapon,"" a senior State Department official told CNN. The official was speaking on condition of anonymity for the same reason as the other two officials. NATO and U.S. radar or satellite intelligence also do not indicate there was a launch of a missile at the time Syrians say the alleged attack occurred, according to the military official. ""The fact that it's not a weapon doesn't mean it's not some creative use of a caustic agent,"" the official said. Israeli minister: It's clear that chemical weapons were used in Syria . 'Unfettered access' The news came as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for full cooperation from all sides, saying the investigation would begin as soon as ""practically possible."" He also stressed the investigation must include ""unfettered access,"" something that has not been possible in some previous attempts to investigate claims of violence. Ban's promise of an investigation into the claims followed a formal, written request by al-Assad's government for an independent investigation. While Ban told reporters at the United Nations he was aware of the rebel claims of a chemical weapons attack by the government, he did not say whether those claims will also be investigated. A senior administration official, traveling with Obama in Israel, told reporters the United States supports a U.N. investigation but said that it should include allegations by the Syrian government and the rebels. ""We believe very strongly that that investigation needs to address all allegations of chemical weapons use. Not be limited to any one allegation,"" said the official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reason as the others. The United States, meanwhile, continues to monitor Syria's chemical weapons very closely, the official said. Analysts believe the Syrian government may have one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world. Specifically, the supply is believed to include sarin, mustard and VX gases, which are banned under international law. Syria has denied the allegation. The Chemical Weapons Convention prohibits the production, stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons. Syria is not one of the 188 signatories to the convention. In recent months, reports have repeatedly surfaced that Syrian forces moved some of the chemical weapons inventories possibly because of deteriorating security in the country, raising fears the stockpile could fall into the hands of al Qaeda-linked groups working with the opposition should al-Assad's government fall. As a result, the United States has been talking with neighboring countries about the steps needed to secure the weapons should al-Assad be forced from office. Cleric killed . In the latest violence to hit the country Friday, at least 100 people were killed in incidents across the country, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. On Thursday a suicide bomber struck one of the main mosques in Damascus, killing a top Sunni cleric and longtime al-Assad supporter, Syrian state-run media. Mohammad Said Ramadan al-Bouti was teaching religious class at the mosque when he was killed during the blast, state-run media reported. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but al-Bouti is hated among rebels for his support of al-Assad. In one of his final sermons at the Umayyad, or Great Mosque, of Damascus, al-Bouti called on Syrians to stand by the government and condemned rebels as ""terrorists."" As has become common in violent attacks that kill civilians, the government and the opposition accused one another of being behind the attack. The LCC said the area where the mosque sits is near al-Assad's party headquarters. ""The whole area was under the full control of the regime forces with much military reinforcement,"" the LCC said. The government, meanwhile, accused rebels of being behind the attack. Sunni Arabs make up the majority of Syria's population and are dominant in the opposition, but some support the government, controlled by Alawites -- an offshoot of Shiitism. More than 70,000 people have died in Syria since unrest began two years ago, the United Nations has said. Syria's chemical weapon potential: What is it, and what are the health risks?

"(CNN) -- When Babatunde Osotimehin last year became the head of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) -- the international development agency promoting female rights -- the news didn't go down too well with many women working in the field. After his appointment Osotimehin was told that some female ambassadors at the U.N. were upset that a man had been made head of the agency. But he was determined to put their minds at ease. ""We had lunch with them [female ambassadors] and they asked me, 'so, justify this position,'"" remembers Osotimehin. ""I spoke and after that they stood and said 'OK, we're satisfied with that, from today you are an honorary woman.' I carry that title well."" Read: Too many mothers still dying . A tireless advocate of female rights, Osotimehin has had a long career caring for women. He qualified as a doctor in 1972 and went on to teach at the University of Ibadan, in his native Nigeria, before heading Nigeria's National Agency for the Control of AIDS and becoming the country's health minister. Today, as executive director of the UNFPA, Osotimehin, who is also the U.N.'s under-secretary general, is focused on gender equality and reducing poverty, helping hundreds of millions in developing countries. Some 20 months into his new role, Osotimehin says he wants the agency to reach as many women and girls around the world as possible, improving their access to reproductive and educational services. ""There are an estimate of 222 million women in the developing world who are in union, who want family planning and they are not getting it,"" he says, citing a shortage of funding and cultural obstacles among the reasons for the lack of universal access to reproductive services. According to a UNFPA report released last week, meeting the family planning needs of those 222 million women would have resulted in 26 million fewer abortions in the developing world this year. Osotimehin speaks passionately to world leaders about the agency's concerns and works closely with women around the world to make sure they have choices and know their rights. ""I think it's a job that actually was made for me and I say that with all sense of responsibility,"" explains Osotimehin. ""The natural thing to do was now to do something that actually gives me a global sense, given all the experience I have and the natural work that I'd been able to establish. ""And I think linking back to what I did, practicing or as a minister of the HIV field, it was all about reproductive health to reproductive rights, gender, women's health and I think it just all fits."" But above all, Osotimehin, a father of five, says what needs to be changed is the status of women around the world. ""I think that for me is where the problem really is -- how we value women and girls in our societies,"" he says. ""I think that we need to do far more than just legislation or policies, we need to confront these issues to make a difference."" Watch video: Osotimehin: a global voice for women . Osotimehin credits his mother for imparting the value of equality to him and shaping his views from an an early age. He says: ""My mother was an entrepreneur, a mother, a wife, a community leader and she was very strong but she believed in equity of social justice, so I saw her as a role model."" Osotimehin adds that whether it's though his current work at the UNFPA or any other posts in the future, he will always fight for women's empowerment. ""I truly believe that women will change the world,"" he says. ""I say that with all seriousness -- as a teacher in a medical school, my best students were women. ""As physicians they are the best and, really, when you look at different aspects of life, even peace-building, women they build better peace. So, let's give them a chance.""","Babatunde Osotimehin is the executive director of U.N. Population Fund .

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri urged people in Saudi Arabia to follow the example set by popular revolutions in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia and rise up. ""Why don't you rise up, for you are the sons of the strong and proud tribes that look down upon death in order to lift up humiliation and oppression? Are you afraid of the forces of the Saudi regime and its security and army?"" al-Zawahiri said in a video posted Thursday on jihadist forums, according to the SITE Intelligence Group. It's the latest video message from al-Zawahiri, who took over as leader of the terror network after Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces. In recent days, al-Zawahiri has made a similar call on the people of Yemen, saying the government was a puppet of the United States. In the 6-minute, 19-second video, al-Zawahiri called on the people of Saudi Arabia to overthrow their rulers, saying they committed criminal and un-Islamic activities, said SITE, an organization that tracks the online activity of terror groups. Al-Zawahiri questioned how people could watch the Arab Spring revolutions and do nothing. In the video, he said Saudi Arabia's rulers should be ousted for, among other things, opening the country to American forces and jailing militants. ""The Family of Saud might be able to kill tens, hundreds, or thousands from amongst you, but if hundreds of thousands come out, then they will be shocked and will end up, Allah permitting, in the state that their brethren ended up in amongst the ousted tyrants,"" he said, according to SITE's translation. Al-Zawahiri was al Qaeda's No. 2 leader under bin Laden. He took over leadership in June 2011 following bin Laden's death, according to statements posted on jihadist websites. One of the FBI's most wanted terrorists, al-Zawahiri has played a defining role in al Qaeda. He was indicted for his alleged role in the August 7, 1998, bombings of the United States Embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, that killed 224 civilians and wounded more than 5,000 others, according to the National Counterterrorism Center, part of the U.S. federal government. The FBI is offering a $25 million reward for information leading to his capture, the same amount as the reward for bin Laden. Al-Zawahiri's wife and three children were killed in December 2001 in a U.S. attack on the family's residence in Afghanistan. Al-Zawahiri is believed to be hiding somewhere in Pakistan's tribal region that borders Afghanistan. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Ayman al-Zawahiri appears on a video posted on jihadist forums, an intelligence group says .

"(CNN) -- For the makers of electronic cigarettes, today we are living in the Wild West -- a lawless frontier where they can say or do whatever they want, no matter what the consequences. They are free to make unsubstantiated therapeutic claims and include myriad chemicals and additives in e-cigarettes. Big Tobacco desperately needs new nicotine addicts and is up to its old tricks to make sure it gets them. E-cigarettes are being aggressively marketed to children with flavors like Bazooka Bubble Gum, Cap'n Crunch and Cotton Candy. Joe Camel was killed in the 1990s, but cartoon characters are back promoting e-cigarettes. Many e-cigarettes look like Marlboro or Camel cigarettes. Like their old-Hollywood counterparts, glamorous and attractive celebrities are appearing on TV promoting specific e-cigarette brands. Free samples are even being handed out on street corners. A report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the promotion of e-cigarettes is reaching our children with alarming success. In just one year, e-cigarette use doubled among high school and middle school students, and 1 in 10 high school students have used an e-cigarette. Altogether, 1.78 million middle and high school students nationwide use e-cigarettes. The three largest cigarette companies are all selling e-cigarettes. Because tobacco use kills more than 400,000 people each year and thousands more successfully quit, the industry needs to attract and addict thousands of children each day, as well as keep adults dependent to maintain its huge profits. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, whether delivered in a conventional cigarette or their electronic counterparts. The potential harm from exposure to secondhand emissions from e-cigarettes is unknown. Two initial studies have found formaldehyde, benzene and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (a well-known carcinogen) coming from those secondhand emissions. We commend New York City recently for banning the use of e-cigarettes indoors. No e-cigarette has been approved by the FDA as a safe and effective product to help people quit smoking. Yet many companies are making claims that e-cigarettes help smokers quit. When smokers are ready to quit, they should call 1-800-QUIT NOW or talk with their doctors about using one of the seven FDA-approved medications proven to be safe and effective in helping smokers quit. According to one study, there are 250 different e-cigarette brands for sale in the U.S. today. With so many brands, there is likely to be wide variation in the chemicals -- intended and unintended -- that each contain. In 2009, lab tests conducted by the FDA found detectable levels of toxic cancer-causing chemicals -- including an ingredient used in anti-freeze -- in two leading brands of e-cigarettes and 18 various e-cigarette cartridges. There is no safe form of tobacco. Right now, the public health and medical community or consumers have no way of knowing what chemicals are contained in an e-cigarette or what the short and long term health implications might be. Commonsense regulation of e-cigarettes by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is urgently needed. In the absence of meaningful oversight, the tobacco industry has free rein to promote their products as ""safe"" without any proof. A proposal to regulate e-cigarettes and other tobacco products has been under review at the White House Office of Management and Budget since October 1, 2013. The Obama administration must move forward with these rules to protect the health of everyone, especially our children. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Harold P. Wimmer.","Harold Wimmer: New York City was right to ban the use of e-cigarettes indoors .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama and his vice-president, Joe Biden, won't be there. As a matter of fact, neither will the heads of state from France or Canada. But the good news for Russian President Vladimir Putin is that FIFA president Sepp Blatter will be at the Sochi Winter Olympics. So far only Lithuania's president, Dalia GrybauskaitÄ— -- an outspoken critic of the Russian government -- has openly said that she is boycotting the games for political reasons. The Winter Games have been bedeviled by allegations of corruption leading to cost overruns and Russia's attitude towards homosexuality . However Blatter, who heads world football's governing body and is a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), believes threats to skip the Games over Russia's anti-gay laws would be counterproductive. Gay rights activists have been protesting against the law which was passed in June 2013 which prohibits talking about homosexuality in front of children. The law has been widely criticized by Western leaders who have called it archaic and discriminatory, leading to politicians from around the world deciding to snub the Games. But Blatter, whose own organization is facing criticism for holding the 2014 World Cup in Brazil amid protests and domestic unrest says the opportunity for dialogue outweighs a boycott. ""These two events (Sochi and the World Cup in Brazil) have one thing in common: they have both been misused as a platform for political disputes,"" he said in his column in FIFA's weekly magazine. ""In the case of the Winter Olympics, this dispute is coming to a head with threats to boycott the Games. ""Such a boycott would change nothing. On the contrary, it may be interpreted as a refusal to establish a dialogue on the issue, as was the case with boycotts of the Olympic Games in Moscow in 1980 or in Los Angeles in 1984. ""I believe that such a major event presents a perfect opportunity to strike up conversations and cultivate contacts."" Russian President Vladimir Putin has already stated that no athlete would face discrimination at February's Games while protestors will have designated zones in Sochi to make their protests. Blatter, the man who infamously said that racism on the pitch could be settled by a handshake, believes that by traveling to Sochi, it will allow issues such as homosexuality to be discussed in front of a larger audience. ""It is also likely that unpleasant issues will be addressed, because FIFA's fight against discrimination does not end with the anti-racism campaign,"" he added. ""We must fight every form of social exclusion. Anyone who decides to boycott the Winter Olympics in Sochi will be surrendering on this important issue, just as anyone running away from a problem will never be able to resolve it. ""This reason alone is why it is important for me to travel to Russia.""","FIFA president Sepp Blatter warns against boycott .

"(CNN) -- The sweet aroma of blossoming orange trees wafts through the air as a white-haired figure moves slowly along the green-choked path. Aided by a yard stick, 85-year-old Sam Motsuenyane walks through his citrus orchard in South Africa's Winterveldt area, occasionally stopping to check the lush fruits hanging from the trees. The scene strikes a sharp contrast to what the veteran agriculturalist encountered when he returned to the area in early 2000 to retire following a successful career as a South African diplomat and leading banker. Weeds and bushes had reclaimed the deserted plots as much of the land laid fallow and under-utilized due to lack of resources and the local farmers' economic hardship. ""I decided that something had to be done and with my agricultural background, I thought I could perhaps initiate something that could help the people,"" says Motsuenyane. As a result, the farming pioneer, whose first business was a plant nursery in 1963, embarked on a mission to show small plot owners how to lift themselves out of poverty by growing orange trees on a commercial scale. See also: Agriculture 'next big thing' in Africa, says World Bank expert . He drummed up private sector financial support to buy orange trees and in 2002 he launched the Winterveldt Citrus Project, a community initiative which enables small holders to make a living and become self-sufficient by training them how to work the land. So far, the project has helped to set up some 100 small farms. ""He helped us a lot, we didn't know anything about oranges,"" says Pauline Lueba, a smallholder who today earns a steady income by selling the oranges from her 800 trees to major retail chains across South Africa. ""There's enough income, I can manage to pay my helpers, we even eat there and buy fertilizers with that money,"" she adds. Commercial farming is a major industry in South Africa -- it distributes produce all over the world while Johannesburg's fruit market sells about a million tons of goods every year. But the picture is quite different in other parts of the continent -- more than two-thirds of African countries are net importers of agricultural products, with the continent importing $50 billion worth of food every year, according to U.N. figures. See also: Africa can feed itself in a generation . Geoffrey Livingston, regional economist for the eastern and southern Africa division at the International Fund for Agricultural Development says these mass imports represent a ""huge missed opportunity for African producers."" ""This is related to very poor yields in a lot of African countries that make it a requirement for countries to go out of their borders and go outside of the continent to meet food requirements for their people,"" he says. They are views echoed by Microsoft chairman Bill Gates who wrote in his 2012 letter, ""Given the central role that food plays in human welfare and national stability, it is shocking - not to mention short-sighted and potentially dangerous - how little money is spent on agricultural research."" On the whole, only 3.5% of Africa's arable land is irrigated and about 9% of world fertilizer is used in the continent, according to the U.N. Livingston says the low levels of African productivity are linked to a lack of investment in agriculture by African governments and donor organizations over the last two decades. He notes, however, that a change is taking place now. ""In the last three or four years there's been a renaissance of interest by those African governments and donors regarding the critical role agriculture plays in economic development,"" he says. ""We are seeing that African governments are now spending more for basic research, for applied research, extension services and we feel there will be a pay-off in the medium-term for this increased investment."" Read more: 'Silent crisis' as food prices fuel hunger in Kenya . Livingston also calls governments across the continent to focus their efforts on improving transport infrastructure in order to boost productivity. ""Thirty-four per cent of sub-Saharan Africans live more than five hours away from a market town of 5,000 people,"" he says. ""Increasing market access to particularly improve field roads and improve access to electricity for processing is absolutely fundamental to improving agricultural productivity and increasing economic growth in these countries."" Back in the Winterveldt fields, Motsuenyane also calls on South African leaders to take a greater role in encouraging people to work on the land. ""The government has to do a great deal to rekindle the enthusiasm which once existed in agriculture,"" Motsuenyane, who ran the first black-owned bank in post-Apartheid South Africa, says. Passionate about farming, Motsuenyane believes it's smallholdings that have the potential to revitalize communities and help curb South Africa's soaring levels of unemployment. ""If we do not create sufficient employment opportunities in our country we will certainly end up in a very terrible situation,"" he says. ""We must skill the black people to use that land in a way that can enable them to become job creators as well as contributors to the development of the country.""","A community initiative in South Africa helps poor farmers make a living by growing trees .

"(CNN) -- Until death do us apart and beyond ... I sent him a text message from holiday saying: ""Having a great time in Spain. I am riding an authentic Arabic horse."" His reply came within seconds saying: ""Well, if that horse knew how to speak Spanish he would have gone to the police and complained."" He was referring to my weight. It is exactly this kind of response that I miss most. I miss his promptitude and presence of mind. They say war brings the worst out of people but what about prison? Especially if it was a prison run and supervised by the Syrian security apparatus? Over the course of the Syrian revolution I read and heard of many horrific stories about the grave situation in the prisons. I never imagined it could be this bad. When he was arrested in January this year I knew that getting him released would not be easy. I realized all too well the struggle ahead of us. I panicked; at one point I wished that he was killed but not arrested. No human being would want to be a guest in one of those prisons. Nonetheless I, along with my family and friends, tried my best to reach to him. We paid an endless number of bribes and gifts to those people misleadingly called security men. They are anything but security men. Heartless, cold, and vile are more fitting terms. We are not alone in this struggle; thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Syrian families are suffering the agonizing pain of having loved ones behind the bars of one of the security branches. The Assad legacy in brutality is most evident in those branches. The late dictator, Hafez Assad, the father of the current dictator, made a point of creating more security branches in Syria than olive tree branches. Our journey to find my loved one and help him, or at least lessen his suffering, has uncovered ugly realities that we never acknowledged before. Torture is not a new phenomenon to us but I didn't realize how widespread and vile it is. When one of his fellow inmates was released he came to visit us and told us that the prison he was in was a hell hole. Forty men are crammed in an extremely small room, stripped naked except for underwear and forbidden from showering. He said every day a ruthless commander would come in and call few names then declare: ""Come with me to be executed."" This was enough to keep every one of these men on edge every night. I think he spent his nights thinking if he will ever live the following day. According to his released fellow inmate, the dirty and unhygienic place led to a weird skin disease spreading between inmates. The food was very poor and the heat was overwhelming. Despite the rather disturbing details of his situation we experienced a sense of relief because he was definitely alive. We tried everything, everyone and every possible route but we had no luck. He wasn't involved in the events; he wasn't an activist so his arrest was a puzzle for us. We were naÃ¯ve to try establishing the reason for his arrest; after all, you don't have to do anything to be arrested in Syria. Some people reported some of their family members were arrested and never returned over an argument with neighbors who were well connected. Others said their relatives were taken by the security men for no apparent reason other than being from a liberated village or city, even if they weren't involved themselves in the events. The released inmate said he was arrested because he had an argument with a passenger who hired his taxi. When they got to one of the security barriers spread all over Syria, the passenger said to the security men that he was insulting the regime. That was enough to arrest him. The world is most concerned about the number of dead and refugees because their suffering is more evident. From my own experience I can say that those unjustly arrested men and women are suffering immensely, probably much more than refugees. In addition to torture, humiliation and degrading treatment, they are forbidden from seeing their families or having any form of communication with them. And for those families outside, the wait cannot be more excruciating. I spent most of the last few months fighting the sense of helplessness and incapability. Can you imagine knowing your loved one is going through so much pain and suffering and you cannot do anything about it? I prayed, cried, and sometimes tried to forget about him but I couldn't. After a series of lies and misleading stories we were told that he was about to be released because of a presidential pardon. I felt slightly better but continued to try to find ways to get in touch with him or secure his release because I never trusted Assad before all of this brutality and won't ever trust him. My brother wrote that day on his Facebook page: ""Pray for the prisoners, they have been given another lease of life."" This couldn't be more true. Those who come out of these places often say it feels like being born again. One prisoner sent a message to his mom through one of his released inmates to pray that he dies because he couldn't take it anymore. She did and he died. A report issued recently by a human rights violation watchdog outlined the torture methods used in the Syrian security branches. I couldn't finish it. Nobody can if they have one of their loved ones inside. The most shocking element of this report was that when a prisoner dies, his body sometimes is left with the inmates and nobody is allowed to touch him. One prisoner was hanged from his hands for a long time during which he witnessed the body of his friend decay on the floor and insects come in and out of his body for days. He died later, probably in front of other observers. I thought what we were going through was the ultimate pain. I was wrong. I was in the kitchen making coffee and felt that everybody around me was acting funny. There was an unexplained, awkward feeling among us. They knew the news and were finding the best way to break it to me. They knew how much I loved him. I made it even more difficult when I mentioned him exactly at that time and said that I missed him and looked forward to seeing him again. After many failed attempts, one of them plucked the courage and told said to me that he was dead. The regime had killed him. The pain was so sharp and immense, I felt as if somebody had physically stabbed me. I gasped for air and sat down. Then a crazy feeling overcame me. I felt a sense of relief. He is not in pain anymore. He is not being tortured, he is not beaten until he bleeds, he is not being made to say that Bashar is the only god. After the initial shock had elapsed I started asking questions. When? How? Funeral? Then it hit me. This regime is capable of hurting us even after death. First of all he died two weeks before we knew about it and we only found out about it by chance. We bribed somebody to check his name and he found his name on the dead list. The bribed informer called one of our family members and asked her to go and collect his ID and the death statement. Forty years under the emergency law which allows security men to arrest anybody anywhere has made Syrians obsessed with their IDs, hoping they don't get arrested due to errors in names. Then a bitter horrible feeling crept over my entire body. The corpse? Where is his body? They wrote in clear Arabic text on the death statement ""The body shall not be given to the family."" They didn't bother to write the cause of death. I knew all along that this regime is capable of everything and anything, nothing is too brutal or ruthless. But for a split second I hoped they'd give us the body to bury. I understand them now all too well. Not only does this regime cause you pain and suffering in knowing that your loved ones are probably wishing they die sooner than later, but it can also strip away from you the sense of closure you so much need in such case. I wanted to bury him. Is this too much to ask? I wanted to say goodbye and probably hug his body one last time. I wanted to lay him in peace. Another bribe and we learnt he was buried in a mass grave. While the world debates whether to strike the Syrian regime or not, this kind of suffering will continue.","Author tells of trying to free someone she loves from a Syrian jail .

"(CNN) -- All that stood between Tim McCarty and the thrill-promising roller coaster was a seat belt. If he could just buckle it, he and his children would zoom to 53 miles an hour in the first three seconds. There was just one problem: McCarty was too big. He had to step out and go tell his wife he weighed too much, while his kids blasted off on the ride without him. ""From there, we kind of made a saying: 'The walk of shame,' "" he said. ""I realized at that time I was just too big."" Incidents such as this prompted McCarty, 42, of Dallas, to finally take action against his weight. Since September 2012, he has dropped 125 pounds. ""It's not easy. You didn't get big overnight, so it's going to take a little time,"" McCarty tells others who want to follow his lead. ""It's going to take some work. You just got to decide for yourself that's what you want."" Sorority girl drops 107 pounds . Getting motivated . At 5-foot-3, McCarty, who works in maintenance at an office building, describes himself as a ""short, round person."" But it wasn't always that way. He was initially a skinny child, but he gained a lot of weight between the second and third grades. That summer, he stayed home and watched TV and ate. Other children made fun of him, calling him ""sheep dog"" and ""fat boy."" McCarty knew the health risks of being overweight. He has always been diligent about annual physicals because his father's siblings died of cardiovascular problems, and his father has had a heart attack. Yet McCarty remained healthy in adulthood by other measures. His blood pressure and cholesterol were fine, so he never consistently weighed himself. He thinks he reached 300 pounds in his 40s. ""I thought I didn't need to lose weight because I'm healthy,"" he said. At one annual physical, McCarty's doctor told him he still needed to lose weight and that he was ""very lucky "" to have normal vital signs, but they wouldn't necessarily stay that way. The doctor said, McCarty remembers, ""You're going to be in a world of hurt."" But the message didn't make a dent in McCarty's unhealthy habits until last August, when he decided to race his youngest daughter for one mile. He thought he would finish in about 10 minutes. He estimates he weighed between 310 and 320 pounds at that point. ""It was horrible,"" he said. ""It took me 22 minutes to do a mile."" And because of poor route planning, McCarty couldn't make it back; he had to call his wife to pick him up. The next day, he told his wife: No more sodas. He would start walking. It was time for a change. How diet bloggers stay thin . Tailored for larger bodies . A big help to McCarty's weight loss effort was the arrival of a new gym, Downsize Fitness, behind his workplace. The facility is specifically geared toward overweight and obese people, and their equipment and workouts are tailored for larger bodies. McCarty didn't realize before going to this gym that he could modify challenging exercises, such as push-ups and jumping jacks, to accommodate his fitness level. He also liked that everyone there had the same goal: weight loss. There were no perfectly toned bodybuilders in sight. The gym made exercise personal. He'd get calls from employees asking what time he'd be showing up. ""I wasn't just a number there,"" he said. ""They knew what level I was at. They pushed me to my limits."" Now, McCarty works out five times a week. He runs four times every week, a total of at least 20 miles, and does weights twice a week. He's also a personal trainer at Downsize Fitness, helping others reach their goals. To help his physical transformation, McCarty made drastic changes to his eating habits. ""Before, my range of food was: Hamburger, pizza, something fried,"" McCarty said. Now, processed foods are strictly forbidden. He eats a lot of fruits and vegetables, grilled chicken and grilled fish. When he drinks sweet tea, he dilutes his serving to 75% water. Of course, he still splurges on one guilty pleasure now and then: The Oreo Cookies Blizzard at Dairy Queen. The journey hasn't always been easy. During his running and training earlier this year, he tore a meniscus in his left knee. ""I was scared to death -- if I couldn't work out, the old me would pop back out,"" he said. His surgery was on a Thursday. By Monday, he was back at the gym, working on his upper body, chest and shoulders. Two weeks later, he was walking on the treadmills. At three weeks, he was able to jog, and by the fourth week, he could run again. Opinion: Is being fat a disease? Measuring success . Beyond the numbers on the scale, McCarty has seen many benefits to his weight loss. Remember how he agonized over a running a mile in 22 minutes in August 2012? In June, he ran a 5K race (3.1 miles) in under 28 minutes. After he crossed the finish line and saw his time, ""I just started crying,"" he remembers. ""I just kept walking and thinking about where I came from."" At his job, he's noticed a change as well. He's always had to be on his feet all day, but because of his weight, he used to avoid tasks involving standing on ladders and leaning or reaching -- he was scared he would fall. ""Now, I'm like a little ninja up there,"" he said. ""I can reach over, and I don't care about falling no more."" Weight loss contests at Downsize Fitness proved lucrative for McCarty. He originally had no intention of winning the first round, from September to December, but when he learned he was close, he stepped up his workout to four hours a day, five times a week. That earned him $7,000. The January to June phase, which came with a $20,000 prize, was an incentive to keep going with his weight-loss efforts. After winning, he paid off his truck and bought his wife a nice camera; the rest is in savings.

"(CNN) -- It has been branded ""hateful and deliberately demeaning,"" but the media is key to changing the way football works, says one leading economist. The game's global governing body FIFA has faced a slew of corruption allegations over the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, most recently claims that bribes were paid to Caribbean, Asian and African officials in order to secure Qatar the right to host the latter tournament. But former Goldman Sachs Asset Management chairman Jim O'Neill insists that the pressure applied by the media towards football organizations helps to promote transparency and good governance. ""It's very legitimate, the questions being asked, more focus on it would be healthy,"" said O'Neill. ""At the end of the day it is something that connects hundreds of millions, if not billions of people around the world, they deserve a better deal."" O'Neill argues that the media is the only body holding FIFA accountable for its actions. ""It forces them to take more responsibility,"" he added. ""I think the media here is a highly legitimate form of enforcing it."" The investigative work done by British newspaper the Sunday Times in recent weeks has prompted a FIFA backlash from key figures within the organization as well as president Sepp Blatter, criticizing the media coverage Monday. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) launched a stinging response to allegations of wrongdoing following its general assembly, which was held in Sao Paulo, Brazil ahead of the 2014 World Cup, which gets under way in the city on Thursday. CAF passed a resolution attacking ""the repeated, deliberately hateful, defamatory and degrading attacks by some media, notably British, on the image and the integrity of the Confederation of African Football, its president (Issa Hayatou), its members, its member associations and the entire African continent."" It went onto claim African football officials were being used as a ""scapegoats"" and thanked Blatter for his ""personal commitment to the fight against racism."" Blatter was in similarly defiant mood at an Asian Football Confederation (AFC) meeting -- also in Sao Paulo -- despite many of FIFA's corporate partners, such as electronics giant Sony, calling for an investigation into corruption allegations. ""We have seen what the British press has published,"" said Blatter, who has been FIFA president since 1998. ""I don't know what the reasoning is behind this but we must maintain unity."" Referring to the recent storm around FIFA as ""Qatar-gate,"" Blatter warned that his critics wanted ""to destroy, not the game, but they want to destroy the institution."" The eyes of the world are on Brazil ahead of it hosting the World Cup for the second time in its history and the first time since 1950. A string of protests and demonstrations over the reported $11 billion spent on the tournament have dominated the build up to this World Cup. A strike by subway workers in Sao Paulo on Monday caused chaos in the city which will host Brazil's first match against Croatia. Hosting football's biggest tournament is often billed as an opportunity to regenerate a country by reinvesting the money generated into domestic projects. But O'Neill, who is famous for coining the term ""BRIC"" to describe the rapidly-growing economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China in 2001, questions whether the tournament will benefit Brazil. ""There's not a huge amount of evidence that hosting a World Cup, particularly once it starts, benefits a country,"" explained O'Neill, who is honorary professor of economics at the University of Manchester. ""In principle, the build-up, with the infrastructure spending, has helped some countries, but the effects are very hard to see. If anything, there is a bit more evidence that the opposite happens, that countries get a bit carried away and they spend more than they can really afford. ""Once the party is over, it fizzles out. If I was Brazilian, particularly given the slowdown they've had in the past couple of years, I wouldn't wanted to be resting my hopes for the future on hosting the World Cup.""","Media branded ""hateful"" by African football's rulemakers following corruption allegations .

"New Brunswick, New Jersey (CNN) -- September 11 was a tragedy so immense that it has sent ripples, and sometimes tidal waves, through the past 10 years. In the big picture, since 9/11, we have become engaged in two armed conflicts, seen thousands of American soldiers die, aided countries that have been attacked by terrorists and are now living in an age where trust in government is an oxymoron. On Main Street, the broken families left behind after the dust cleared on 9/11 have been living in the shadow of that terrible memory, that terrible loss, for a decade. Some are prevailing while others are struggling, but all are struck by the loss each day. We journalism students have been interviewing children of the victims of September 11 to see how they are doing 10 years on. I interviewed a brother and sister in Colonia, New Jersey. They shared so much with me. It's hard to write about such a sensitive subject and not want to include every minute detail. So I'm focusing on what it is that has gotten these two through the past 10 years. When all of our stories are published in September, I think readers are really going to know these children through their experiences. In that way, I hope the children receive respect and recognition for their great achievement of moving forward over the past decade. I signed up for the 9/11 Project because it was a hands-on course in narrative journalism that would produce a documentary film and my byline in newspapers. September 11 affected me personally only slightly. At my church, some parishioners lost their son, a firefighter. Later, in November 2001, someone broke into the church and burned our book of special intentions and an American flag standing next to it. Events like this and my observing how our society and our media have changed over the past decade make up my 9/11 experience. Since I was 12 on 9/11, I remember the past 10 years very well. They have run parallel to my teenage years and college career, during which I became interested in journalism. The news of Osama bin Laden's death obviously affects the stories we are writing. How could it not? We are profiling people who lost a parent as a result of bin Laden's commitment to terror. He was an evil man, without a doubt, and the families of those who died on September 11 can consider his death a piece of closure. But it's not for us to say whether bin Laden's death will help a fatherless teenager sleep better at night. I saw a Facebook status from a child of a September 11 victim this week. He wrote about bin Laden's death. He was angry. He cursed bin Laden, and friends and family commented on it, agreeing with him. To them, he deserved a worse death. Osama bin Laden's death obviously strikes a chord with the families of the victims, but it isn't a cure-all. I don't know if it will help the difficult emotional process that all these families are going through. We'll see how everything unfolds in the coming days, especially if the pictures are released. That will be a whole other story.","David Seamon was 12 during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks .

"(CNN) -- Princesses transformed into ghouls. Psychedelic teacup rides. Simulated suicide. The world's most famous theme park turned into a vomitorium. And you thought this was the happiest place on earth. In ""Escape From Tomorrow,"" the most buzzed-about movie out of this year's Sundance Film Festival, director Randall Moore presents Disney World as a dystopian hellscape and uses it as the backdrop for a descent into madness. Jim White (Roy Abramsohn) is on holiday with his wife and two children when he learns he's been fired from his job. As he reels from that news, his mental state progressively worsens as he and his family navigate the park. Shot in black and white, Disney's ""attractions"" become nightmarish specters as perceived by White's unstable mind. Now The Walt Disney Co. is weighing whether to quash the film or to let it slide -- not so much because of the disturbing imagery, but rather the way Moore made his movie. In an audacious act of filmmaking, he shot it almost entirely at Disney World and Disneyland -- all without Disney's knowledge or permission. After a screening of the film at Sundance, Moore answered questions from an enthusiastic audience, hinting at how he pulled off his cinematic subterfuge. Avoiding detection by Disney security took ""a lot of planning,"" he said. ""We were careful and cautious and tried not to draw too much attention to ourselves. But planning was the main thing."" Abramsohn said shooting in such a stealthy fashion ""was scary. ... It was exciting and fun."" In a ""director's statement"" included in press materials for the film, Moore describes the origins of his film: . ""Heavily influenced by various strange outings I endured as a boy with my father -- who at the time lived in Orlando, Florida -- 'Escape From Tomorrow' is my personal attempt to make sense of what felt like a very artificial childhood, brought on by our cultural obsession with these fake, manufactured worlds of so-called fantasy."" He adds, ""I think the film is really about defining the word 'escape' and how so many American households seek it out in a yearly pilgrimage to a materialistic Mecca."" It's a small, small dysfunctional world after all, in Moore's depiction. The director said he succeeded in making his film without tipping off Disney largely because of advances in camera technology. It's now possible to shoot high-quality video with what looks like, to the uncritical eye, a digital SLR camera. ""(Digital) SLR's had just hit the market at that point,"" Moore said. ""So we had the Canon 5D Mark II we could bring into the park and look like a tourist."" Moore shot for 10 days at the Disney parks in Orlando, and for two weeks at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. (He filmed additional scenes off Disney property on a soundstage in Los Angeles and at a hotel in the LA area.) His crew and actors went unnoticed by Disney, until near the end of filming. ""We almost got caught once. ... We were shooting in the entrance of the park and we had to do a few takes and basically they thought our team was just paparazzi and we were shooting a famous family (entering the park)."" Moore said Disney security pulled his actors aside and demanded to know why they had entered and then re-entered the park within a seven-minute period. He said his crew took advantage of a passing parade to scatter while Abramsohn and his co-star, Elena Schuber, struggled to explain themselves. Abramsohn said he felt like he was ""acting for his life."" He said he told Disney security he and his ""family"" entered and then quickly left the park because they needed to reapply sunscreen. While his interrogator was temporarily distracted, he hid his microphone and mini tape-recorder -- used to record dialogue -- in his sock. If that had been discovered, the game would have been up. ""It was very scary that day,"" Abramsohn admitted. Although Moore and company escaped Disney's notice then, the company now knows about them all too well. At the Sundance Q&A, an audience member claimed, ""Disney is furious and they are going to sue."" That may or may not be true. Disney told CNN ""(We) are aware of the film"" but ""are not commenting at this time."" Moore seems resigned to a possible lawsuit from Disney that might keep the film from ever being seen by the wider public, but he described ""Escape From Tomorrow"" as a passion project that he could not step away from, despite the legal risks. ""It started off really small and it just kind of snowballed,"" he said. ""I became obsessed. And at one point there was no turning back.""","""Escape From Tomorrow"" is the most buzzed-about movie out of Sundance .

"(CNN) -- Authorities believe they have found the final victim of a deadly landslide in Washington state. A rain-saturated hillside along the Stillaguamish River gave way on the outskirts of the town of Oso on March 22. Authorities announced Tuesday that workers found a body believed to be that of Molly Kristine ""Kris"" Regelbrugge. Local health officials will confirm the identification of the body once it's recovered. ""It is a testament to the persistence of the sheriff's office that today, four months after the slide, we recovered the final victim,"" Snohomish County Executive John Lovick said in a statement. ""The sheriff's search and rescue teams are true professionals. I am honored and humbled by their dedication and commitment to this community,"" he said. Search crews had been digging through deep mud and debris, which was 70 feet thick in some places, to search for the missing. Including Regelbrugge, 43 people are thought to have been killed in the March slide.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A tree dedicated to the memory of Beatle George Harrison, whose solo career included the hit ""What is Life,"" has met a grisly end to its life from the jaws of voracious bark beetles. A pine stump now lies a few feet from a plaque dedicated to Harrison at the foot of a hiking trail in Los Angeles's Griffith Park. City officials say the 12-foot-tall pine had to be cut down June 18, to spare nearby trees from the spread of infestation by bark beetles. ""But we are going to replant a new George Harrison tree in November,"" said L.A. City Councilman Tom LaBonge, a local politician well known for his undying optimism and ceaseless attendance of civic events. ""We're going to wait until after the summer when the weather cools off again."" The original Japanese black pine tree was planted in 2003 near the Griffith Park Observatory and dedicated in 2004. ""He meant a lot to me, George was my favorite Beatle,"" LaBonge reflected. ""I saw him at (nearby) Dodger Stadium in 1966. George just did so much for so many people. I think he was the first rocker ever to stage a fund-raising event, the Concert for Bangladesh."" Near the tree stump, a plaque reads ""In memory of a great humanitarian who touched the world as an artist, a musician and gardener."" Below that it reads, ""For the forest to be green, each tree must be green,"" a quote attributed to Harrison. Harrison, often called the quiet Beatle, died of lung cancer in 2001 in Beverly Hills. In a photo that LaBonge says he took five or six years ago to mark an anniversary of Harrison's passing, the mature tree is ringed by family friends. The picture includes Harrison's widow Olivia, Eric Idle of Monty Python fame and Jeff Lynne, the Electric Light Orchestra frontman who played with Harrison in The Travelling Wilburys. Beatles songs written by Harrison include ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" and ""Something."" The virtuoso guitar player's signature riffs and solos helped propel the Beatles to greatness and his experimentation with Eastern Indian music could be heard with his sitar work on ""Norwegian Wood."" Now, in a city park where there was once a specific wood -- a George Harrison tree -- there's a stump. But LaBonge, borrowing from a Harrison album title, vows ""All Things Must Pass"" including the lack of a George Harrison tree. ""When you plant a tree to memorialize someone, it's a special thing."" LaBonge said. ""And I promise you in November this will be special again when we dedicate the new tree.""

"(CNN) -- The nation's suburban schools added 3.4 million students to their rolls over the past 15 years -- and nearly all of them were minorities, according to a study released Tuesday. Jean Bonner teaches fourth-graders last month at Middleburg Elementary in suburban Washington. Yet the new arrivals resulted in only a modest increase in the individual schools' racial and ethnic diversity, the study said. ""The school districts look like they are more diverse, but within your school districts, if the whites are in one school, the blacks in a different school and the Hispanics in yet a different school, it doesn't necessarily mean the suburban whites have more black and Hispanic classmates -- because they don't go to the same school,"" said Richard Fry, senior research associate at the Pew Hispanic Center in Washington, who wrote the report. Using federal government data, Fry found that minority students made up 99 percent of the increase in suburban school enrollment between the 1993-94 and 2006-07 school years. During that time, the student body at the nation's suburban schools went from 72 percent white to 59 percent white; from 12 percent black to 15 percent black; from 11 percent Hispanic to 20 percent Hispanic; and from 5 percent Asian to 6 percent Asian. The diversity, however, is not reflected at the individual school level. For example, in 2006-07, the typical white suburban student attended a school whose student body was 75 percent white, down from 83 percent white in 1993-94, Fry wrote. ""So at a time when the white share of student enrollment in suburban school districts was falling by 13 percentage points, the exposure of the typical white suburban student to minority students in his or her own school was growing by a little more than half that much -- or 8 percentage points,"" the report said. From another point of view, the typical black suburban student attended a school in 2006-07 that was 34 percent white, down from 43 percent white in 1993-94. But Latino suburban students tended to become more segregated over the same time period -- in 2006-07, the typical such student was in a school that was 49 percent Latino, versus 42 percent Latino in 1993-94. Suburban schools accounted for most of the change in demographics, according to the study, accounting for two-thirds of the 5.1 million increase in the number of students nationwide over that time period. City schools tended to be more segregated than their suburban counterparts, the study said, with the typical urban black student attending a school with 60 percent black enrollees; and the typical Latino student attending a school with 63 percent Latino enrollment. Minority students in rural areas and in towns tended to be more exposed to whites than were their suburban counterparts. The typical black student in a town or rural area attended a school where whites composed 47 percent of the student body and blacks 44 percent. The typical Latino student in a town or rural area attended a school where whites made up 43 percent of the student body, and Latinos made up 47 percent. Asians in suburban schools saw only a slight uptick in isolation -- from 23 percent Asian to 24 percent Asian over the time period. However, ""white students aren't going to school with as many black and Hispanic students as the aggregate school district enrollment numbers indicate,"" Fry said in a telephone interview. School diversity has long been considered an important marker of racial equality in education. ""When students of different racial/ethnic backgrounds do not attend the same schools, the potential exists that they also may not attend the same type of schools, i.e., schools of similar quality and level of resources,"" Fry wrote. ""Racial differences in school quality ... cannot exist if schools are racially balanced."" The study identified the nation's most-segregated suburban school district as Maywood-Melrose Park-Broadview 89 School District in suburban Chicago, Illinois, based on its ""dissimilarity index"" of 0.79. That index means that 79 percent of the district's minority students would have to be moved to different schools in order for the schools' student bodies to mirror the ethnic makeup of the surrounding population, he said. The 0.74 figure for suburban Atlanta, Georgia's, DeKalb County means ""you would have to move about three-quarters of DeKalb County's black students to a different school"" in order to get racial balance, he said. Calls to school superintendents in both districts were not immediately returned. ""The suburbs seem to have grown a lot more diverse,"" Fry concluded. ""The place you'd expect to see it is among kids. But when you actually look at where kids go to school, it's not clear that white kids are going to school with a whole bunch more different classmates than they used to -- a little bit more, but not as much as the aggregate measures would suggest.""","Minorities made up 99 percent of increase in suburban school rolls, study says .

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- South Sudanese wept openly as they celebrated their independence Saturday, cheering, whistling and dancing down the streets in a ceremony fitting for the birth of a new nation. ""We are free at last,"" some chanted, flags draped around their shoulders. A man on his knees kissed the ground. The red, white and green flag of the newborn nation, readied at half-staff the day before, was hoisted over the capital of Juba. Among the world leaders bearing witness on this historic day: United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and South African President Jacob Zuma. ""This is liberation, a new chapter,"" said Abuk Makuac, who escaped to the United States in 1984 and came back home to attend the independence day activities. ""No more war. We were born in the war, grew up in the war and married in war."" South Sudan's sovereignty officially breaks Africa's largest nation into two, the result of a January referendum overwhelmingly approved by voters. The referendum was part of a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of civil war pitting a government dominated by Arab Muslims in the north against black Christians and animists in the south. The war killed about 2 million people. Amid the independence celebrations, some residents paid tribute to relatives killed in the war. ""It is very emotional. I'm excited, but I'm also thinking of all the people who died for this to happen,"" said Victoria Bol, who lost dozens of family members. Salva Kiir Mayardit, a former rebel leader who is South Sudan's first president, said his people cannot forget years of bloodshed but must now forgive and move forward. He vowed his people would never again be marginalized. ""As we celebrate our freedom and independence today, I want to assure the people of Darfur, Abyei and South Kordofan, we have not forgotten you,"" he said referring to three conflict-mired regions. ""When you cry, we cry,"" he said. ""When you bleed, we also bleed. In Washington, President Barack Obama issued a statement recognizing South Sudan's sovereignty. ""Today is a reminder that after the darkness of war, the light of a new dawn is possible,"" Obama said. ""A proud flag flies over Juba and the map of the world has been redrawn."" There were shouts of joy, big hugs and hearty handshakes at South Sudan's new Washington embassy on Saturday. Others cried as a colorful new flag was raised. ""This day means a lot to me because we achieved our victory. We got our own country,"" says Anai Aluong. ""We are a new nation now. We are very happy because God answered our prayer."" Aluong said she lost her father, brother, sister and friends during the decades-long civil war. British Foreign Secretary William Hague told the dignitaries gathered in Juba that his nation has opened an embassy there and appointed an ambassador. Al-Bashir stood with his former enemies from South Sudan and congratulated them on their new homeland. He said he believed a united Sudan was still the best option but supported the dream of the South Sudanese. The gracious tones sparked a ray of hope that the two sides would get past a bitter relationship to forge ahead. That journey will hardly be easy as many challenges await. South Sudan is among the world's poorest, with scores who fled the long conflict coming home to a region that has not changed much over the years. The infrastructure is still lacking -- with few paved roads in the new nation the size of Texas. Most villages have no electricity or running water. South Sudan sits near the bottom of most human development indices, according to the United Nations, including the highest maternal mortality and female illiteracy rates. Although the north has flourished, the South has not changed much over the years, said South Sudan native Moses Chol. ""They have schools and clean water, and their children are not dying of simple diseases,"" Chol said, referring to the north. ""In the south, people still drink stagnant water. They have nothing."" There is also the threat of renewed fighting between the two neighbors. Clashes have erupted recently in the disputed border regions of Abyei and South Kordofan. And despite the 2005 peace deal brokered by the George W. Bush administration, forces aligned with both sides continue to clash. Abyei was a battleground in the brutal civil war between forces of both sides. A referendum on whether the area should be part of the north or the South has been delayed amid disagreements on who is eligible to vote. The two countries look set to divorce in name only -- they have not reached an agreement on the borders, the oil or the status of their respective citizens. The U.N. Security Council, which voted to send up to 7,000 peacekeepers and 900 uniformed police to South Sudan, is expected to meet Wednesday to discuss U.N. membership for the new nation. As dignitaries gathered in the new capital to celebrate the new nation, world leaders warned of a tough road ahead. ""Their economic prospects are dim unless the two sides can come to agreement on how to share precious resources, cooperate in other economic areas and together promote the viability and stability of each other,"" the U.S. special envoy to Sudan, Princeton N. Lyman, said in an editorial to CNN. Lyman, who attended the ceremony, said both sides want food, education and security for their families. ""They want the freedom to be able to express their opinions, choose their leaders and become active participants in political and social life,"" he said. South Sudan natives such as Makuac admit there are challenges ahead. However, she is pushing those thoughts to the back-burner for now. ""We have waited so long to get here ... I will worry about that later,"" she said. ""This weekend, we celebrate."" CNN's Nima Elbagir reported from Juba, South Sudan, and Faith Karimi reported from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- When Chuck and Elicia James ventured to their local animal shelter to adopt a dog, they expected to meet a new member of their family. Instead they found themselves reunited with their long lost canine. The James' had not seen Reckless, a brown and white terrier-pitbull mix, since he went missing over a year and a half ago during Superstorm Sandy. They had lost their beloved pup after the fence in their Keansburg, New Jersey, home was mangled during the storm, Chuck James told CNN on Friday. While the family never stopped looking for Reckless, for their 10-year-old daughter's birthday they decided it was time to move on and adopt a new dog at the Monmouth County SPCA. To their surprise, the first dog they were introduced to was one named Lucas, who had a striking resemblance to their former pup. ""He jumped 3 feet in the air,"" James said. ""He immediately recognized us. And then the tears came -- there wasn't a dry eye in the place."" The James' confirmed it was their dog based on an uncanny scar on the top of his head. ""After Sandy, we had so many animals being turned in,"" said Jerry Rosenthal, president and CEO of the animal shelter. Rosenthal told CNN that 3-year-old Reckless ended up at the shelter last November after an employee found him on the streets. Rosenthal believes Reckless was taken in by another family for a period of time before he once again got loose. Rosenthal said the James' story really emphasizes the importance of getting your pet microchipped. Microchipping is a process in which an animal is implanted with a rice-sized chip that is used to identify him or her. ""If Reckless had been microchipped, we could have reunited him with his family much sooner,"" he said. ""We love happy endings. I always tell people our goal is to prevent animals from coming into the shelter except when we can get them back to their original owners,"" Rosenthal said. The James family is still displaced from their home after it was destroyed by Sandy. They are currently residing at a local hotel with Reckless after the hotel happily allowed him to stay. The James' 10-year-old daughter was absolutely ecstatic with Reckless' return and the two have been inseparable since, Chuck James told CNN while on a family weekend camping trip. ""The only thing I can say now is I am finally on a vacation with all the members of our family again,"" said James.","Chuck and Elicia James lost their dog during Superstorm Sandy a year and a half ago .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Attackers killed at least 60 people in Iraq on Thursday in strikes that targeted Shiites and renewed fears of sectarian violence, authorities said. The deadliest attack was a suicide bombing targeting Shiite pilgrims just west of the southern city of Nasiriya. It killed at least 36 and wounded 72 others, police and Interior Ministry officials said. A series of blasts in Baghdad left 24 dead and dozens wounded, an Interior Ministry official said. The violence raged as Shiites made a pilgrimage to the city of Karbala, south of Baghdad, leading up to Arbaeen, one of the holiest days of the Shiite calendar. It arrives next week and marks the end of a 40-day mourning period for Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, who was killed in a seventh century battle in the Iraqi city. Gen. Qassim Atta, the Iraqi commander of Baghdad security operations, said that ""terrorist groups take every chance they get to incite sectarianism."" Martin Kobler, the U.N. special representative in Iraq, condemned the strikes and urged Iraqis to ""remain steadfast in the face of those who are using violence"" and trying to undermine the country's efforts to succeed as a democracy. ""These casualty figures are people, women and men, the youth of the country and its children. These are mainly civilians, and one life taken per day is one life too many. And this has to be stopped,"" Kobler said. Violence raged for years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq between members of Iraqi's Sunni minority, who held power during the era of Saddam Hussein, and its Shiite majority, which gained power after his ouster. Iraqis have been concerned about an increase in Sunni-Shiite violence after the U.S. military withdrawal from the country last month. Sunnis in Iraq have felt marginalized by the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a Shiite. That anger intensified after he ordered the arrest last month of Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who was charged with ordering bombings and assassinations, a charge he denies. The bomber in Nasiriya struck an Iraqi Army checkpoint where buses carrying pilgrims were parked. Most of the casualties were pilgrims, police and an Interior Ministry official said. The city is located in Thiqar province. A triple bombing in Baghdad's Sadr City area Thursday morning killed at least nine people and wounded 35, an official with Iraq's Interior Ministry said. The first bomb -- attached to a motorcycle -- detonated near a group of laborers who were searching for day jobs in the Shiite neighborhood, according to the official. Shortly after that, two other bombs detonated in quick succession nearby. The sprawling neighborhood of Sadr City is a Shiite enclave. Car bombs exploded successively in northern Baghdad's predominantly Shiite Kadhimiya district on Thursday morning, killing 15 and wounding 31, the Interior Ministry official said. The bombs exploded in two busy squares that were about 150 meters (nearly 500 feet) apart. Kadhimiya is busy with many Shiite pilgrims who started their pilgrimage walking to Karbala, and security has been jacked up accordingly. Atta said it was too soon to tell who was behind what appeared to be coordinated attacks in Baghdad. However, he said he believes it was ""what remains"" of terrorist groups trying to incite sectarian rifts. Iraq has a large Shiite population in the capital and across southern Iraq. Iraq has been engulfed in political turmoil that has threatened to unravel the government. Al-Hashimi said al-Maliki's charges against him were politically motivated and fled to the semi-autonomous Kurdish region. His arrest warrant was issued just days after the Iraqiya bloc suspended its participation in parliament amid complaints it was being cut out of the political process. Iraqiya, a cross-sectarian as well as Sunni-backed bloc, castigated the al-Maliki government, saying it had shunned cooperation despite the power-sharing arrangement. It said it is considering sending a request to parliamentary leaders to withdraw support for al-Maliki and come up with a new prime minister to form a post-occupation government. There have also been mounting calls for federalism from at least three predominantly Sunni provinces. Al-Maliki has called federalism a recipe for the partitioning of Iraq. The bloc loyal to the radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, a key ally to al-Maliki, has called for the dissolution of parliament and early elections. Al-Maliki managed to forge a fragile coalition and secure a second term in office because of backing from followers of al-Sadr, the powerful leader of the notorious Mehdi Army that fought some of the fiercest battles against U.S. forces.","NEW: Pilgrims are also targeted in the Shiite heartland .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- His was one of the first photos of a missing child to appear on a milk carton. Almost 30 years later, Etan Patz is still missing. Etan Patz, who disappeared in 1979, was the first missing child featured in the milk carton campaigns of the 1980s. Etan was 6 when he disappeared on May 25, 1979, the Friday before Memorial Day. He was on his way to school in what is now the upscale Soho neighborhood of New York. It was the first time he'd walked to the bus stop by himself. It was just a few blocks away. Etan, like any 6-year-old, argued that all of his friends walked to the bus stop alone, and his parents relented. His mother, Julie Patz, learned that Etan hadn't been in classes when he failed to return home. She called the school at 3:30 p.m., then called the homes of all his friends. When no one had seen Etan, she called police and filed a missing person's report. By evening more than 100 police officers and searchers had gathered with bloodhounds. The search continued for weeks, but no clues to Etan's whereabouts were found.  Watch an update on the case » . The boy's disappearance was one of the key events that inspired the missing children's movement, which raised awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children. Etan's case was the first of the milk carton campaigns of the mid-1980s. ""In our minds there were only two possibilities,"" said Stan Patz, the boy's father. ""Either Etan was taken by a stranger and killed or he was taken by a very sad woman desperate for a child of her own, and we hoped that such a woman would at least take care of him and keep him safe."" Patz lived with this hope until 1982, when he learned of Jose Antonio Ramos' arrest and the surprising connection between him and a former babysitter of Etan's. Ramos was a drifter who in 1979 lived in Alphabet City, a neighborhood not far from Soho. In 1982 he was arrested after boys in a neighborhood in the Bronx complained that he had stolen their book bags while trying to coax them into a drainpipe under a bridge, where he lived, said the Patzes and federal prosecutor Stuart GraBois, who spent years investigating the case. When police found Ramos in his drainpipe home, they found he had many photographs of small blond boys. They noticed that they looked a lot like Etan Patz, according to author Lisa R Cohen's book about the case, ""After Etan: The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive."" Bronx police questioned Ramos, and he denied having anything to do with Etan's disappearance. But he did tell police that his girlfriend used to baby-sit for the boy, GraBois said. Prosecutors in the Bronx and Manhattan pursued this lead, but concluded they did not have enough evidence to connect Ramos to Etan's disappearance, GraBois and a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said. Ramos was released when the parents of the Bronx boys chose not to press charges against him, according to published reports. He left town and disappeared for six years  -- until GraBois reviewed Etan's case.  GraBois said he focused on Ramos as the prime suspect. GraBois said he learned in 1988 that Ramos had  been arrested and convicted of child molestation and was serving time in a Pennsylvania prison. GraBois said he brought Ramos to New York for questioning and surprised him with the question: ""How many times did you have sex with Etan Patz?"" Ramos told GraBois that he'd taken a little boy to an apartment he had on the lower East Side on the same day that Etan went missing. ""He was 90 percent sure it was the same he'd seen in the news that was missing,"" GraBois said. According to GraBois, Ramos claimed he released the boy and brought him to a subway station so the boy could go visit his aunt in Washington Heights. ""Etan did not have an aunt in Washington Heights,""  GraBois said. When questioned further, Ramos refused to say anything more and asked for a lawyer, according to GraBois. Ramos is serving a 10- to 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania. He is scheduled to be released in November 2012, GraBois said. GraBois said he had Ramos transferred to a federal prison, and planted informants as his cell mates.  He wouldn't go into detail about what Ramos might have told them, but said he's convinced he's eyeing the right suspect. GraBois turned over his evidence to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, but prosecutors have not brought charges. They say that without a body, they don't have enough evidence. Etan's case is still considered by the NYPD to be a cold case. Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Etan Patz or that leads to the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible for his disappearance is asked to call the FBI/NYPD Etan Patz hotline: 212-384-2200.","Boy, 6, begged his parents to let him walk to school bus stop for first time .

"(CNN) -- A judge on Thursday filed preliminary charges against Football Club Barcelona for alleged tax fraud in its purchase of Brazilian superstar Neymar, according to a copy of his writ viewed by CNN. Judge Pablo Ruz at Spain's National Court expanded his investigation against the club, as requested a day earlier by a prosecutor, who alleged the club avoided paying 9 million euros (more than $12 million) in taxes on Neymar's signing and transfer, corresponding to contracts signed in 2011 and 2013. The judge is already investigating whether a former Barcelona president committed financial irregularities in the signing of Neymar. In a six-page order, the judge said the investigation would include a look at an alleged ""contract simulation presumably carried out by the parties which signed the contracts."" The expanded investigation would hold FC Barcelona, a fan-owned club, responsible as an entity or business enterprise if found guilty of tax fraud, said a National Court spokesman, who by custom is not identified. The judge ordered Spain's tax collection agency to examine FC Barcelona's tax filings for 2011, 2012 and 2013, the writ said. Neymar joined Barcelona in June 2013, with his father -- who doubles as his agent -- having entered into an initial contract with the Spanish giants in late 2011. In a statement on the club website, Barcelona on Wednesday said its ""dealings with respect to this operation, and in light of all information available, was at all times in line with the relevant legal legislation."" Barca said its lawyers will appear in court ""within the next few days in order to defend its interests and rights."" ""We express our total willingness to collaborate with the justice authorities in this matter, as we have done since the issue arose,"" it added. Barcelona's former president, Sandro Rosell, who resigned last month after a judge agreed to investigate a lawsuit against him for alleged irregularities in the Neymar deal, has denied any wrongdoing. Ruz began the investigation last month after a legal complaint from one of the members of this fan-owned club. Prosecutor Jose Perals on Wednesday formally asked the judge to expand the investigation. In an seven-page writ, Perals alleges that he's ""become aware of a series of economic transactions by the club, and in favor of various companies, related to the signing of Neymar da Silva Santos Jr., based at times on simulated contracts."" The investigation originally came after season-ticket holder Jordi Cases complained that the amount paid to bring Neymar from Brazilian club Santos was more than the reported fee of 57.1 million euros. A day after Rosell resigned, the club released figures that showed that Barca actually paid 86.2 million euros for Neymar. Cases' lawyer, Felipe Izquierdo, earlier told CNN that other Barcelona executives, still working at the club after Rosell's resignation, also allegedly signed some of the contracts that brought Neymar to the club. Barcelona has told CNN that one of those signatories was former club VP, and now President, Josep Maria Bartomeu. Piers Edwards and Chris Murphy contributed to this report.","Spanish judge looking into alleged improprieties .

"(CNN) -- A call to the Secret Witness tip line helped police break CNN's first featured cold case: the slaying of college student Brianna Denison, investigators say. James Michael Biela, 27, is accused of killing 19-year-old Brianna Denison. A construction worker was charged with Denison's murder last week, nearly 10 months after the 19-year-old California college student was found strangled and sexually assaulted in Reno, Nevada. At a news conference Wednesday, relief was visible on the faces of the cops who worked the case and came, as one said, to view Denison as ""everyone's daughter."" For her family, the relief competed with tears. The arrest of James Michael Biela, 27, closes one chapter and opens another as the case moves from the investigative phase and into the courts.  Watch what led to the arrest » . For Nancy Grace's Cold Case team, the arrest also marks a milestone. Brianna Denison's was the first cold case we featured. Her story appeared on CNN.com, and a segment aired on ""Nancy Grace"" on September 15. And now, it is also our first cracked cold case. Denison, who attended Santa Barbara Community College, vanished January 20 while visiting friends at the University of Nevada's Reno campus. Her body was found several days later, partially covered with snow in a desolate field outside of town. Biela, a former Marine, is charged with murdering Denison by strangulation. Prosecutors say they may file more charges as the case makes its way through the courts. Biela also was charged with first-degree kidnapping and sexual assault of a second young woman, a student at the University of Nevada, Reno. And, police say, Biela is a suspect in the November 2007 parking lot assault of another UNR student. In that case, the alleged victim washed off evidence of the crime and delayed reporting the attack, police said at the news conference. DNA is the crucial link in the two cases that led to criminal charges. Police say they were able to connect Biela's DNA with a sample left on panties found near Denison's body. Police said at the news conference that they found DNA matching Biela's on the rear door of  the off-campus house where Denison was staying with friends.  Watch how the investigation unfolded » . It also matched DNA found at the scene of a December 16 sexual assault, police maintain. The victim, a UNR student,  was able to escape her attacker and describe him in detail, police say. Both crimes bear a striking resemblance to several other sexual assaults in the area, leading police to believe that Biela is a serial rapist. They are asking other possible victims to come forward. One of the previous victims was able to describe Biela's pickup, another key link in the evidentiary chain, according to investigators. Police say Biela's associates told them he left Reno in a hurry in March, shortly after Denison's body was found. He also sold the pickup that matched the witness' description. The investigation has now turned up gray fibers on one victim's clothing, said Detective Adam Wygnanski of the Reno Police Department. They appear to match fibers from the gray velour interior the pickup Biela sold, he added. Biela returned to Reno in September. It was an anonymous tip from a friend of his former girlfriend November 1 that broke this cold case wide open, police say. Investigators had established that the killer was from the Reno area and had an unusual fetish of collecting one victim's underwear and leaving it as a ""calling card"" at the next victim's crime scene. The tipster caught investigators' attention, telling the Secret Witness tip line about Biela's pickup and suspicious ex-girlfriend. The tipster then told police that the former girlfriend had found two pairs of thong panties in Biela's new truck. Detectives immediately followed up on the tip and, with permission from the former girlfriend, took DNA samples from Biela's 4-year-old son. Lab tests showed that the boy's father -- Biela -- was almost certainly a match for the DNA found on the doorknob and at the crime scene, police said. The finding was confirmed when Biela was arrested and ordered to submit DNA samples. An overnight session at the crime lab confirmed the match, and charges were filed, police said. Investigators say they since have learned that Biela was familiar with the grounds of the university, having worked there on a construction job last year. Police say his work on campus put him in a position to easily target women. When first questioned about the Denison case in early November, Biela refused to submit DNA samples and provided an alibi to police, claiming that he'd been with his girlfriend. The girlfriend denies that he was with her the night Denison disappeared, investigators say. Police spokesman Lt. Robert McDonald said investigators have no doubt that Biela is responsible for Denison's death. ""We knew the profile we were looking for: someone unobtrusive, who stalked his victims quietly but escalated his violence with each new attack,"" he said. Now, it's up to the courts to decide. Meanwhile, investigators are certain there are other victims who just haven't come forward. Police are urging anyone with more information to call the Reno Police Hot Line at 775-745-3521.","James Michael Biela, 27, is charged with murder of Brianna Denison .

"(CNN)  -- As Tracy Ocasio's 28th birthday came and went last week, her mother remained hopeful that she would soon get answers about the young Florida woman's disappearance nearly three months ago. Tracy Ocasio disappeared after watching a ball game with friends at an Orlando, Florida, sports bar. Police have a person of interest in custody on unrelated charges, but they still don't have the full story, said Detective Mark Olson of the Ocoee Police Department near Orlando. In honor of Ocasio's birthday, her family increased the reward for information on her disappearance to $20,000. Elizabeth Ocasio said she last spoke with her daughter about 8:30 p.m. May 26. Tracy Ocasio said she planned to come home that night after watching a televised basketball game with friends at the Florida Tap Room, a popular sports bar in Orlando. When Ocasio didn't come home that night, her mother said she assumed she'd decided to stay at a friend's house. She often stayed with the friend when she was too tired to drive home. At 6:30 the next morning, Elizabeth Ocasio sent a text message to her daughter: ""Where are you?"" She did not receive a response, she said, so she called her daughter's cell phone again two hours later. The phone rang a few times and then went to voice mail. She tried calling Ocasio several more times that day, and each time, the call went to voice mail. ""I was worried, but I still did not imagine that anything terrible could have happened,"" Elizabeth Ocasio said. Panic set in when she received a call from police on the afternoon of May 27. They'd found Tracy Ocasio's car in a rundown neighborhood three miles from the Ocasio home. The car was parked on private property, and the residents had called to have it towed. ""When I got there, I knew something didn't make sense. Tracy would never go to such a neighborhood by herself,"" Elizabeth Ocasio told CNN. She found her daughter's purse in the car, but her ID, cell phone and car keys were missing. By 7 p.m., Tracy Ocasio was officially reported missing and a county-wide search was under way. It lasted for weeks. ""We searched bodies of water and heavily wooded areas,"" Olson said, ""and we continue to search based on tips we receive."" The investigation led detectives to James Hataway, 28, who is considered a person of interest because a Tap Room surveillance video shows him leaving the bar with Tracy Ocasio, Olson said. A spokesman said the Orange County Public Defender's Office would have no comment. Police questioned Hataway for 11 hours over two days. He told investigators that Ocasio had given him a ride home from the bar that night, Olson said. Hataway told police that he didn't see Ocasio after she dropped him off. His home was just 200 yards from where Ocasio's car was found, police said. During questioning, Hataway took a polygraph test, which police said showed some discrepancies, Olson said. Police brought bloodhounds to where Ocasio's car was found, but the dogs didn't hit on her scent, leading police to believe she wasn't the one who parked her car there. Police also say no forensic evidence was found to suggest Ocasio was injured or killed inside her car. Police are holding Hataway on unrelated charges at the Orange County Jail. He is charged with aggravated battery, robbery and false imprisonment stemming from an incident in neighboring Seminole County in August 2008. A young woman said she gave him a ride home one night. She said he attacked her and tried to break her neck, but she fought back. She'd reported the assault when it happened but only later were police able to identify Hataway as the alleged assailant. Hataway remains in custody on those charges with bail set at $250,000. He has not pled. Shortly after his interrogation in the Ocasio case, the public defender's office took Hataway's case, and he stopped talking. Hataway has not been named a suspect and has not been charged in the Ocasio case. Police and family urge anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the person responsible for Ocasio's disappearance to call the tip line at 1-800-423-TIPS. A $20,000 reward is offered.","Tracy Ocasio last spoke with her mother about 8:30 p.m. on May 26 .

"(CNN) -- This month, Britain's deputy prime minister squared up to the leader of the country's euroskeptic Independence Party to advocate the merits of his nation's membership of the EU. So did Nick Clegg convince the electorate in this televised debate that Britain was better off inside the union? In short, no. For all Clegg's passion for Europe, polls showed two thirds of those asked thought his opponent, Nigel Farage, had won the day by suggesting the UK's future was brighter outside the bloc -- not in. As an island nation with its own regional identity politics to consider, Britain knows what it's like having ambivalent bedfellows. The eurozone crisis has prompted Brussels to advocate closer cooperation within the bloc, but the UK hasn't just been swimming against the tide on that topic -- it's also been trying to prevent Scotland from leaving its own union. Farage, a member of the European Parliament and staunch europhobe, paints a controversial figure among eurocrat circles. He has suggested that the EU will end in tears, with people taking to the streets if countries see their democracy further eroded. Clegg, by contrast, points to the massive advantage the common market awards British manufacturers and the stability the EU has brought this once war-torn region. Both claims may be exaggerated and the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. One thing is certain -- the discussion highlights how Europe's union needs to be more receptive to its members' changing needs. Britain was never a member of the original ""Inner Six"" nations that laid the foundations for what the EU has become today. Yet UK's recent and very public soul-searching has become a source of exasperation for pro-Europe leaders like the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. UK Prime Minister David Cameron has promised his people a referendum on the subject if his Conservative Party is reelected next year and has lobbied Brussels hard on the need for reform and cumbersome treaty change. The incontrovertible fact is that as the EU has become bigger and its bureaucracy has ballooned, it hasn't kept pace with some of its members changing economies -- in particular Britain's. Some might argue that what started out as an economic bloc has also overplayed its hand, drifting into notoriously torpid areas like justice and foreign policy. While the single market undoubtedly has myriad benefits for the exports of British goods, it hasn't helped the nation's services sector anywhere near as much. A report by Open Europe written in 2012 found that although nearly three quarters of the UK's GDP comes from services, just 3.2% of that is generated by intra-EU trade. Reels of bureaucratic red tape and grandiose pronouncements about regulating the financial services industry -- the jewel in its capital's crown -- have left Britain feeling singled out in the single market. This comes just as the other goal of the EU -- the free movement of people -- has made immigration soar. Add to this edicts from the European Court of Human Rights and increasingly protectionist economic directives, jarring with a UK which sees a bright future in trade with other partners like the U.S. and China. The net result: Britain has been left feeling its sovereignty has been eroded, shackled by laws made elsewhere. There are a few options for the UK should it wish to surrender its membership card. It could emulate models followed by Switzerland, Norway and Turkey, becoming part of the European Economic Area or signing individual ad hoc cooperation agreements with individual countries over which it has more control. It could even make a clean break and just be part of a (now increasingly irrelevant) World Trade Organisation. None of these would be good for Britain or the world economy. They would require major upheaval and sour its investment climate considerably. Britain's potential exit may also throw a spanner in the works as the EU and the U.S. negotiate the world's largest free trade agreement -- one which would open up each other's goods to a 700 million-strong consumer market. Yet the UK economy is growing much faster than its EU neighbors and as the nation rebounds the confidence of its convictions has also strengthened. Monty Python, one of Britain's most successful comedy exports, once asked: ""What have the Romans ever done for us?"" Now a whole nation is asking the same of Europe. And whether they are right to do so or not, Brussels better take note. Read more from Nina dos Santos: EU should leave trade alone . U.S. - EU trade pact key to rebuilding trans-Atlantic ties .

"(CNN) -- By July 20, a historic deal may be reached to resolve the Iranian nuclear standoff. The choice America will face at that point is whether to lift sanctions on Iran in order to extract valuable and irreversible nuclear concessions from Tehran. Any debate over whether to exchange sanctions for limitations to Iran's nuclear program, however, would be incomplete at best and misleading at worst if it does not address the cost of this policy. Surprisingly, the U.S. government has not conducted any study to assess the cost of its two decades-long policy of sanctioning Iran. According to our study, based on an econometric gravity model that commonly is used to measure trade patterns, the United States is by far the biggest loser of all nations enforcing sanctions on Iran. From 1995 to 2012, the U.S. sacrificed between $134.7 and $175.3 billion in potential export revenue to Iran. These are astonishing numbers. But the human cost is even more surprising. Based on the Department of Commerce's annual report on jobs supported per billion dollars of exports, this lost export revenue translates into between 51,043 and 66,436 job opportunities lost per year on average. In 2008 alone, as many as 214,657 to 279,389 job opportunities were relinquished. Texas and California are likely the biggest losers in terms of lost job opportunities, due to their size as well as the strength of their industries in areas attractive to the Iranian economy -- oil and gas, automobiles, green energy, and telecommunications to name a few. Yet, these are conservative numbers. The model only captures lost export revenues and does not take into account secondary effects of sanctions such as higher oil prices to the broader U.S. economy. Nor does it account for how lower Iranian GDP and imports -- as a result of sanctions -- further suppresses Iran's ability to absorb exports from the sanctioning countries. Consequently, the full cost to the U.S. economy is likely even higher than the numbers listed here. America is not alone in losing export revenue and job opportunities as a result of the Iran sanctions. Sanctions cost the EU states more than twice as much as the United States in terms of lost trade revenue between 2010 and 2012. Germany was hit the hardest, followed by Italy and France. It is not uncommon that cost becomes a secondary factor when devising national security policy. But as American and Iranian diplomats try to negotiate nuclear deal in Vienna together with their EU, Russian and Chinese partners, the question is not whether sanctions have been justified. Rather, the question is whether sanctions should be exchanged for blocking Iran's uranium and plutonium pathways towards a nuclear weapon. These are pathways, incidentally, that cannot be bombed. As former IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei famously said, ""You can bomb their facilities, but you cannot bomb their knowledge."" Opponents of a nuclear deal argue that intensified sanctions provide a more effective route to halting Tehran's nuclear activities. They also fear that sanctions relief will give Iran a get-out-of-jail-free card and enable it to restart its nuclear program at a later stage. The arguments in favor of sanctions, or against a deal that entails sanctions relief, are debatable. In the words of U.S. President Barack Obama, the idea that Iran would simply surrender to American demands due to the economic pressure of sanctions ""does not reflect an honest understanding of the Iranian people or the Iranian regime."" In addition, continuing sanctions may break the international coalition against Iran. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have heard directly from Europeans that if a reasonable deal is reached, the EU will not accept the cost of sanctions even if Congress rejects the nuclear deal. It will be Congress, not Europe, that will break the transatlantic coalition by clinging on to sanctions at the expense of a nuclear resolution, the Europeans have said. If the Obama administration in the next few days manages to secure a deal over Iran's nuclear program, some in Washington will ask whether the deal is good enough to ""give up sanctions."" But the American public must also ask themselves if the cost of sanctions to the U.S. economy is worth shouldering if other options exist.","A July 20 deadline to reach a permanent deal on Iran's nuclear program is looming .
If a deal is reached, the U.S. will have to decide whether to lift sanctions, authors say .
They say the U.S. is the most negatively impacted of the nations imposing sanctions .
The EU will likely end sanctions if a reasonable deal is reached, regardless of the U.S., they say ."
"(CNN) -- Virginia is adding a drug used in a controversial Ohio execution to its roster of chemicals for lethal injections over the objections of the drug's manufacturer. The state Department of Corrections announced Thursday that it would have the sedative midazolam available as an alternate drug for lethal injections. Midazolam was one of two drugs used in the January execution of Ohio convict Dennis McGuire, who was put to death for the rape and murder of a 22-year-old woman in 1994. Like many U.S. states, Virginia has been forced to find new drugs to use on condemned prisoners after European-based manufacturers banned American prisons from using their drugs in capital punishment. McGuire's lawyers argued that the drug would bring on an agonizing, suffocating death, and witnesses said the condemned convict appeared to be gasping for air for more than 10 minutes after receiving his injection. The Illinois-based pharmaceutical company Hospira, which manufactures midazolam, says it opposes the use of its products in lethal injections and no longer sells it to prison hospitals. ""However, due to the complex supply chain and the gray market in the United States, despite our efforts, Hospira cannot guarantee that a U.S. prison could not secure restricted products through other channels not under Hospira's control,"" the company says in a statement on its website. According to the website for the Death Penalty Information Center, Virginia uses a three-drug protocol, which involves drugs that have different effects on the body.","Virginia says it will use the sedative midazolam as a drug for lethal injections .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The fears that Hurricane Gustav would turn into another human catastrophe on the scale of Katrina in 2005 have mercifully not been realized. The ""Three Little Pigs"" project aim is to try and make scenes like this a thing of the past. But it has been another untimely reminder of nature's destructive power, and a further taste of what climate scientists are predicting will be far more common spectacle as the century progresses. As Gustav blew itself out, more hurricanes -- Hanna, Ike and Josephine -- were threatening even more lives and properties. But in the face of such relentless disruption can anything be done to lessen the impact of such extreme weather events? Well, researchers at The University of Western Ontario certainly think so. Their ""Three Little Pigs"" project at The Insurance Research Lab for Better Homes got underway at the end of August with the aim of making houses more resilient in the face of such violent storms. CNN caught up with Professor Greg Kopp -- a civil and environmental engineer who is working on the project -- in Houma, Louisiana, where he's been surveying the damage from Hurricane Gustav. ""When there are natural disasters the biggest problem seems to be with residential houses,"" he said. ""In North America and in most parts of the world houses aren't engineered. So we are taking an engineer's eye to look at this. Wind has some peculiar effects which can be mitigated relatively easily. The motivation for this project is to make houses safer, but not cost more."" Unfortunately, building a wind tunnel at a size required to test full-scale buildings just wasn't feasible. But the equipment and methods chosen by the researchers are a unique and far more efficient way of testing which replicates the pressures that occur on the surface of a building. The $7 million facility is a large movable steel hanger. The full-scale 1,900 square foot house sits inside a steel cage rigged up with 60 pressure boxes which can simulate the effects of a Category 5 hurricane (see photos). Professor Kopp has taken a leading roll in developing the pressure boxes explained how the test has been set up. ""We have a bunch of air boxes on the roof -- which is made of plywood -- and then we have what are called pressure load activators,"" ""These are kind of like vacuum cleaners -- they have a hose and are connected to the air boxes. The pressure load activators suck air out of the air box and causes a suction which wants to lift the roof"". Before the experiment in the hanger could begin, researchers calculated the pressures the house would experience in a small-scale study conducted at the University's Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory -- which has over 40 years of expertise testing high-rise buildings and bridges. Once accurately recorded these results were then scaled up in preparation for the test proper. Monitored by 20 cameras, the first experiments were conducted over three days and saw the house endure ever increasing winds speeds up to a Category 3 hurricane. Initial tests have produced some unexpected results. ""The thing that surprised us most is where it [the roof] failed first. It failed on the leeward side of the house. We had all expected it to fail on the windward side first,"" Kopp said (see video). ""If you looked at the house now, the roof isn't actually connected to the walls. But you'd look at the house and say it looks ok. ""Another thing was that the failures were progressive. There wasn't one real gust of wind that broke it. The damage accumulated,"" Kopp said. Having now understood the house's behavior under stress, Kopp and his team will now set about recreate the experiment but this time measuring the load on the nails which lifted. ""These are more scientific than engineering experiments currently,"" Kopp said. ""But we can now develop numerical models and look at other roof structures with a lot more confidence as to how these models work. Ultimately we want to try some mitigation strategies."" It's still early days though and the tests are set to carry on for the next few years. ""Science always takes time,"" Kopp said. ""We want to make houses which are safer for people and to do it in a way that doesn't break the bank. It should be done in an efficient way so that it is affordable to everyone. Not just high-end houses, but for poor people too.""","Canadian researchers test roof on full-scale house under hurricane conditions .

"(CNN) -- A year ago, Sarah Murnaghan, an 11-year-old Pennsylvania girl, was fighting for her life while her family waged a campaign to change a national policy on lung transplants for child recipients. Their battle has now led to permanent policy change. On Monday, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) and United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) announced their decision to allow some children ages 11 or younger to receive additional priority for lung transplants, including lungs from older donors, according to a statement from UNOS. The previous policy required lung transplant candidates to be at least 12 to receive lungs from an adult donor. Following an appeal by the Murnaghans, in June 2013 a federal judge issued a restraining order to prevent the age-restriction policy from being imposed in Sarah's case. Sarah received lungs donated by an adult. The first transplants didn't take, requiring a second transplant, again from an adult donor. ""Sarah receiving adult lungs means she is now breathing on her own,"" her family said last year, ""after three years of being tethered to machines."" On Monday, the family called her new lungs ""beautiful"" and said Sarah will be returning to school in the fall. ""Sarah is still getting physical rehabilitation and we have work in front of us,"" said the family, ""but we are blessed there has been no rejection."" The new policy change to allow some child recipients to receive lungs from adult donors ""is meant to provide an appropriate balance for a specific group of candidates,"" a UNOS statement said Monday. The Murnaghan family expressed excitement regarding the decision, saying in a statement also released Monday that the policy change ""is important for two reasons: More children will be fortunate enough to receive life-saving lung transplants, and the medical community has determined this is the right step to take."" The fight was not just about Sarah, the Murnaghans said, ""because there was a very good chance it would have been too late for her -- but for every family in our situation."" Several factors determine a potential child recipient's place in line on the adult list, such as distance from donor to potential recipient, a lung allocation score determined by a patient's diagnosis and test results, and a patient's blood type. Sarah's parents said her score was a 78 last year and went up to a 91 in June of 2013 according to a family spokeswoman. Anything above 60 is considered a high score, according to the OPTN's ranking system, and means a transplant need is particularly urgent. Sarah's parents fought to change the policy regarding lung transplants because their daughter suffered from a lifelong battle with cystic fibrosis. This illness led to a deterioration of her lungs. In light of Sarah's case the OPTN executive committee a year ago approved a one-year change to the age-restriction policy. Today, Sarah can be seen riding her bike outside, swimming, even kicking around the soccer ball. Sarah's case received national attention and was widely covered by CNN. According to policy documents, a high-profile media case was the catalyst for the first change in policy. CNN's Jason Carroll, Ross Levitt, Laura Ly, Rande Iaboni and Chris Welch contributed to this report.","New policy gives some child lung transplant candidates access to adult organs .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Between 15 and 20 people died when two trains collided outside of Cairo, Egypt, Saturday night, and officials expect the death toll to rise, the country's Health Ministry said. Another 40 to 50 people were injured when one train traveling from Cairo to Asyut crashed into a train en route from Giza to Fayyoum, Deputy to the Health Ministry Mohammed Sarhan told state-run Nile News TV. The Fayyoum-bound train was stationary when it was struck in Al-Ayyat district, he said. The collision occurred in Kafr Girza, a village in Al-Ayyat district of October 6th province, Nile News TV reported. Al-Ayyat is about 70 km (40 miles) south of Cairo. The wreck's location posed a problem for emergency personnel, Sarhan said, because the site is next to a water canal. Security forces used tree trunks and branches to create an ad-hoc bridge to reach the dead and injured. People were still trapped beneath the wreckage late Saturday, reported Nile News TV. Some of the dead were found buried under the trains, Sarhan said. Eighty ambulances were sent to the scene to transport the injured to local hospitals, said government spokesman Ahmed Rady in a statement. The Transportation Ministry has ordered an investigation into the cause of the crash, Rady said. Government investigators are searching for the train's recorders, reported the country's official news agency, MENA. Egyptian National Railways also launched an investigation into the collision of their trains, MENA said. The governor of October 6th province ordered that families of the victims receive compensation, MENA reported. The Egyptian government has issued compensation to families of train crash fatalities and to those injured in crashes in the past. Train disasters in Egypt over the last 12 years have killed hundreds. In August 2006, at least 57 people died and 128 injured when two passenger trains collided and burst into flames in Qalyoubiya Province, just north of Cairo. A month later, three people died and 24 injured when a cargo train collided with a passenger train in the same area. More than 370 people died in February 2002 when a fire broke out near the rear of a passenger train en route to Luzzur from Cairo. At least 44 of those passengers died when they leapt from the burning cars while the train was still moving.","40 to 50 people injured when trains collide outside of Cairo .

"(CNN) -- Hope is a wonderful thing when it spurs struggling people to aspire to better circumstances and a more promising future, lifting communities out of poverty. But combined with misinformation, opportunistic politics and outright fraud, hope can be one of the cruelest harbingers of misery. And this is the role of hope on the border these days. What is drawing thousands of children to America's doorstep unaccompanied by their parents, aunts, uncles or anyone else they know is hope. What is prompting their loving families to send them on perilous, expensive journeys over hundreds of miles in the hands of strange men is hope. But what is awaiting them is confusion, conflict and despair. So how did this strange confluence of expectations and suffering begin? And what is going to happen now? Here, in a series of short questions, is how this witch's brew was mixed. Fast facts: Immigration . 1. What is happening on the border? In simple terms, a flood of children has been pouring across the 1,900 mile United States border with Mexico, children who are accompanied by neither their parents nor proper documentation for immigration. The primary problem is the sheer volume. In a normal year, immigration authorities would expect to apprehend and process about 8,000 undocumented children, according to federal officials. This year that number has soared to almost 60,000, with children ranging from very young to teenagers. By the time the year is over, officials expect 90,000 unaccompanied minors will have trekked into the United States. That's more than enough to fill the Dallas Cowboys stadium. No one knows what next year will bring, but some estimates suggest it will be even worse if nothing can be done to stem the flow. That explosive growth in the caseload has overwhelmed holding facilities, case investigators, and most importantly the immigration courts that must decide what happens with these children. 5 things to know about immigration . 2. Why kids? Because parents in some Central American countries believe if their children can get to America, they will be given citizenship. Communities protest surge of kids . 3. Where did they get that idea? From President Obama, to hear Republicans (and some Democrats) tell it. They say he has sent mixed messages about how undocumented immigrants will be treated. Although his administration has thrown out so many people for illegal entry that he is known in some Latino communities as the Deporter-in-Chief, he has also told Homeland Security to exercise ""discretion"" in terms of deporting young people. This was the White House response after Congress failed to pass the so called Dream Act, which would have allowed many children to stay who were brought here illegally by their parents and who frankly had little or no knowledge of their ""home"" countries. In any event, critics believe the President's actions launched a subtle message south of the border: Send your kids and we'll let them stay. 4. What else could explain the problem? President Bush. In 2008, just before he left office, he signed a law to protect children from human trafficking, from being sold into the sex trade or domestic servitude. The law stipulates that children who are caught in the United States illegally and who come from countries other than Mexico and Canada should get full hearings on their status. To wit: They can argue for asylum instead of being immediately deported. That's why the current border rush is being principally driven by children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Those children qualify for this treatment. The catch? The courts that hold the hearings are so backed up that this process can last years, during which time these children can attend school, live in the United States with relatives or family friends, eat at McDonald's and generally enjoy a full, American lifestyle. What's the difference between immigrant and refugee? 5. So between Bush and Obama, does that pretty much cover the cause for all this? No. Severe problems of poverty, gangs and crime have made more families in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras desperate to get their children to a better place. All three nations have beautiful scenery, lovely people and stratospheric crime rates. The Honduran city of San Pedro Sula is arguably the single most likely place on the planet for a person to be murdered, higher than many U.S. cities including Chicago, Detroit, New York or Philadelphia. All indications are that smugglers, who can charge thousands of dollars to transport a young person to the United States, are more than happy to fan the flames of hope by suggesting such schemes to escape these dangerous places really will work. 6. Will they? Strangely enough, maybe. Some unknown percentage of these children will probably successfully argue for asylum. But beyond that, the politics make it all murky. The President's team does not want to appear heartless, especially with children involved. Simultaneously, they don't want it to look like they were illegally ""played"" for citizenship. They are in a tough spot, and Republican critics are making it tougher because that's what opponents do in Washington. Who will win and what that will mean to the fate of the children is anyone's guess. 7. So what's happening now? The President has asked Congress for $3.7 billion to set up new places to hold all these children, to speed up the processing of their cases, and to strengthen the border against new arrivals. Republicans want a cheaper program that includes even more dramatic streamlining of the deportation process and even more robust border protection measures. People on both sides of the political debate say emphatically that the well-being of these children must be taken very seriously. But beyond that, the situation is still a mess and there is not yet any agreement about what to do next. And still the kids keep coming, across the rivers, over the mountains, through the deserts, with little more than their family's hopes in hand. Immigration crisis is a political conundrum .

"(CNN) -- Engulfed by the darkness of doping's ""white noise"", he emerged the other side to become a beacon in cycling's anti-drugs fight. And in a sport where the tainted legacies of former Tour de France champions Lance Armstrong and Jan Ulrich continue to cast a dark shadow, reformed rider David Millar can see a light at the end of the tunnel. He has come a long way since nine years ago when he was was sitting in a Biarritz restaurant in south west France. Millar was having dinner with Dave Brailsford, now performance director at British Cycling and Team Sky, when French police arrived to arrest the cyclist, throwing him in a cell and outing him as a drugs cheat. A two-year ban from competition followed and, after a Damascene conversion, he returned to the sport a reformed character determined to remove the stain of doping from cycling. ""I was a fervent anti-doper,"" the Malta-born Scot, who spent his formative years in England and Hong Kong, told CNN's Changing Gear series before the start of the 2013 Tour de France. ""I was a naive kid who came from Hong Kong, who dreamed of winning the Tour de France and who was disgusted to learn that my colleagues were doping, but within four or five years I was one of them."" Blog: Cycling faces watershed of credibility . Millar had served notice of his potential by winning the prologue of his first ever Tour de France in 2000 and the journey from idealistic youngster to fully-fledged doper was not a simple one. What began with ""recup"" injections of vitamins and iron -- not illegal in the sport but a practice Millar had long been opposed to -- ended with him intravenously pumping outlawed substances into his bloodstream. ""I was part of a culture where it was -- it was never obligatory, but it was -- I would describe it as white noise,"" explains the 36-year-old, who rode for the Cofidis team between 1997 and 2004. ""It was always there. It was in the background. It was something with a certain inevitability about it -- if I ever wanted to be the best and be professional. ""That unfortunately was the era I began my career in, and something that I regret deeply, and that's something that I have tried to rectify ever since. ""There are many of us that make mistakes that we regret ... that should never have happened."" Millar now rides for Garmin-Sharp -- the team formerly known as Garmin-Slipstream -- having also represented Great Britain at the 2012 Olympic Games in London. He sits 98th in the 2013 Tour de France after nine stages of the marathon race. He is also a member of the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) athlete panel and he has used his experiences to become an unlikely figurehead in the crusade against doping -- with the help of Garmin-Sharp general manager Jonathan Vaughters, who has also admitted that he doped as a pro cyclist. ""We started off at Slipstream, now with Garmin-Sharp, but we started off with a team with a pragmatic method,"" Millar continued. ""That method was originally to sign me as an anti-doper, as an anti-doping crusader who had been a doper ... it's not very logical but it was inspired by Jonathan Vaughters. ""We really have led by example. We're not going to rely on their anti-doping methods. We've said: 'We're going to do this ourselves' and we've been flag bearers ourselves for the sport."" What Millar hopes Vaughters has fostered at Garmin-Sharp is an environment in which a young, clean rider can harbor legitimate dreams of winning cycling's biggest prize. While his early career led him down the wrong path, Millar's experiences have afforded him a unique insight which could prove invaluable to those who might be tempted to dope. ""I made the wrong decisions because I was surrounded by the wrong people in the wrong culture,"" declares Millar. ""But because of that, it's allowed me to understand that mentality and put everything into what we do with our team now. Our team is the total opposite. ""We create an environment for a young version of me to remain naive, be idealistic, and reach the Tour de France without ever encountering drugs. ""I'm very proud of that ... I'd like to think I'm a kind of example of the whole story."" The sport is now in a position where, according to Millar, it is creating icons such as 2012 Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins, who won't be defending his title this year, and fellow Garmin-Sharp rider Ryder Hesjeda,l who can be admired and trusted. ""I have trust in Bradley Wiggins. I have absolute trust in my teammate, Hesjedal who won the 2012 Giro d'Italia. ""The Giro and the Tour de France are arguably two of the toughest sporting events in the world, and probably the two flagship events of cycling. ""If two riders that I trust implicitly have won those in 2012 ... that should give us all hope. It means it's possible now.""","British cyclist David Millar was handed a two-year ban for doping in 2004 .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Nicole Ganguzza was a newlywed in grad school at the University of Central Florida when she was dragged off a trail and strangled to death while jogging in a park in June. Nicole Ganguzza, 26, was studying to be a family therapist at the time of her death. Ganguzza, 26, was close to earning her master's degree in marriage and family therapy. She was looking forward to having children of her own. She left class on June 10 at about 5:35 p.m. Ten minutes later, she called husband Brendan Ganguzza and told him she was going jogging at Jay Blanchard Park, not far from the university's campus in Orlando, Florida. Brendan Ganguzza became worried at about 7 p.m. when he couldn't reach his wife on her phone. He searched the park for two hours, calling police at about 9 p.m. Police combed the brush through the evening, and the search the next day grew to 60 people. Her body was found behind the post office, about two miles from where her Mitsubishi Eclipse was parked and just off the Econlockhatchee Trail where she'd been jogging.  Watch for the clues » . Brendan Ganguzza became a widower at 30. He is working hard to keep her memory alive. ""It's hard sometimes because you can feel very much in the dark about what is going on, wondering if you'll ever get answers,"" he told CNN. ""We've started a foundation in Nicole's name to continue her dream of providing free counseling and therapy to those who can't afford it. She was studying to be a counselor,"" he added. Nicole Ganguzza was killed five days before toddler Caylee Anthony was reported missing. That case grabbed the headlines in Orlando -- and beyond. Investigators wove a web of circumstantial evidence and charged the child's mother, Casey Anthony, the notorious ""tot mom"" whose wild party pictures became a cable news show staple. Writing recently about the charitable foundation established in Nicole Ganguzza's name, an Orlando Sentinel columnist described her as ""the anti-Casey."" Police say her killer deliberately hid her body in the brush along the trail. Investigators believe the killer either is from the area or is very familiar with the park and nearby campus. The Orange County Medical Examiner characterized Ganguzza's death as a homicide by strangulation without elaborating. It is not publicly known whether she had been sexually assaulted. ""We are keeping very quiet about this because this is information that only the killer would know,"" said Orange County sheriff's spokesman Carlos Padilla. Last week, Ganguzza's family and friends asked anyone with information to come forward and help solve this cold case. They expressed relief that the police may have a break in the case and that an arrest could come soon. ""I just hope they make an arrest soon in my wife's case, so they can get this dangerous guy off the streets,"" Brendan Ganguzza said. Police executed a search warrant two weeks ago on the mobile home of a man who is considered a person of interest in the case. His home lies along the Econlockhatchee Trail. He is a former student and employee of the University of Central Florida. Police say that after reviewing tips and leads, they believe they have probable cause to investigate this individual further. ""The search warrant is sealed, and I can't say at this time what evidence was collected or what led us to this individual,"" said Cpl. Susan Soto, a spokeswoman for the Orange County sheriff. Police are being tight-lipped about whether Ganguzza's attacker left behind any DNA or other forensic evidence. Police are still asking for the public's help in solving this case. If anyone has any information please call Crime Line at 1-800-423-TIPS.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Authorities in Aruba say they're looking into new evidence that could lead to an arrest 3½ years after Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway disappeared on a senior class trip to the island. Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway disappeared while on vacation in Aruba with classmates in 2005. Aruban police are investigating two new tips they hope will provide the corroborating evidence they need to make an arrest, lead prosecutor Hans Mos told CNN. He would not discuss details but said police again consider Dutch student Joran van der Sloot to be the prime suspect in Holloway's disappearance. A new witness has emerged, authorities say, who can place van der Sloot and his father, Paulus van der Sloot, near a pond on the island at 4 a.m. on the day Holloway vanished. The witness told authorities he saw a young man, wet from the chest down and wearing only one shoe, running along a road from the pond to a fast-food restaurant. The witness said he saw the young man and an older man driving slowly down the road in a red Jeep about 10 minutes later. The pond was not among those searched in the early stages of the investigation, Mos said. A second witness, a former girlfriend of Joran van der Sloot, also told police he made suspicious-sounding comments while they were on the beach. The witness, publicly known only as Celes, told police van der Sloot said: ""Who knows? You may now be on the beach with someone who is able to get rid of a corpse.""  Watch the latest developments in the case » . In addition, Mos said, two other witnesses have come forward. He declined to discuss those witnesses, other than to say he is hopeful the case can be solved. ""We are hoping to make a decision by the end of this year or early next year as to whether we will re-arrest [the younger] van der Sloot or not,"" Mos told CNN. Also key to the investigation, Mos added, is a Dutch journalist Peter De Vries' videotaped interview with van der Sloot. In the interview, van der Sloot acknowledges a friend helped him get rid of her body. Read how van der Sloot ""lost no sleep"" over Holloway . Mos said he is confident that the tape, which he characterizes as a confession, is admissible in court.  With the new tips and new witnesses whose testimony impeaches earlier statements by van der Sloot and his father, Mos said he might have enough evidence to solve the mystery of what happened to Holloway. The elder van der Sloot has told police he was at home, asleep in bed until 7 a.m. on the night in question. And, Joran van der Sloot has never been able to explain what happened to his tennis shoes, Mos said. Holloway's father, Dave, said the new developments caught him by surprise. ""Well, I really hope it's true, because they even have Joran on tape confessing, and I don't know what could be better than that,"" he said. Van der Sloot's family and attorney did not return phone calls. Natalee Holloway, 19, a senior at Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama, was a vibrant member of the school band's dance team, ""The Dorians,"" which is similar to the ""Rockettes."" She was a straight-A student who planned to study pre-medicine at the University of Alabama. She vanished in May 2005 while on her senior class trip to the island.  She was last seen at the popular night club Carlos 'n Charlie's early on the morning her class was due to fly home. Her disappearance became the subject of a high-profile search and a massive media frenzy. Holloway family members and friends organized volunteer search efforts in Aruba that went on for months. Early missteps cost investigators valuable time and evidence. Police at first mistakenly arrested two men who had nothing to do with Holloway's disappearance. And, investigators initially ignored information from witnesses pointing to the three young men last seen with Holloway that night. When Joran van der Sloot and brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe were arrested, they told conflicting stories. By that time, verifiable facts were hard to come by. Van der Sloot is a member of a prominent Dutch family in Aruba. At the time of Holloway's disappearance, his father was a judge in training. Joran van der Sloot and the brothers Kalpoe were arrested and let go twice in connection with Holloway's disappearance. While they were in jail, police and prosecutors sought corroborating evidence to piece together a motive and theory. They were not successful. Late last year, authorities closed the case without bringing any charges. ""We simply did not yet have the corroborating evidence to take this to trial and win a conviction,"" prosecutor Mos told CNN. ""If we had a body even to determine cause of death, then we could piece some thing together."" In February, the videotape of van der Sloot's taped admission surfaced on Dutch television. De Vries, a famed Dutch journalist, set up a hidden camera capturing van der Sloot talking about Holloway's last moments and how her body was disposed of ""like an old rag."" Since then, De Vries has set up another on-camera sting. It aired last week, showing van der Sloot meeting with undercover reporters who posed as Dutch sex industry bosses looking for Thai prostitutes to recruit to the Netherlands as sex slaves. In the tape, van der Sloot allegedly promises to supply Thai girls for prostitution in Holland and accepts 1,000 Euros as advance payment for his services. Apparently van der Sloot left the Netherlands late last year and has been living in Thailand for the last few months as a student. His whereabouts right now are unknown, but Aruban authorities are grateful for the tips that the Dutch documentaries have generated. They hope the tips will bring them closer to a resolution in the disappearance of Natalee Holloway.","Aruban prosecutor says new evidence has surfaced in Holloway case .

"(CNN) -- Think back six months. You probably never had heard of a little website called Pinterest. Now it's the third most-visited social-networking site in the United States, according to a report released Thursday by Experian Marketing Services, a digital marketing firm. Pinterest, which lets its users ""pin"" photos and info from the Internet onto virtual boards, ranks behind only Facebook and Twitter in terms of total visitors, according to the analysis, titled ""The 2012 Digital Marketer: Benchmark and Trend Report."" The ranking is based on the total number of U.S. visitors during March and does not include mobile traffic, according to Experian spokeswoman Jennifer Marshall. Last month, Facebook had more than 7 billion total visitors; Twitter had 182 million; and Pinterest had 104 million total visits from people in the United States, according to data sent to CNN by Experian. That ranking puts the newbie site ahead of heavyweights such as LinkedIn, Google+, MySpace and Tumblr. ""The site has really just rocketed,"" said Matt Tatham, another spokesman from Experian. ""It's just been tremendous since (Pinterest) took off around October and then in the last few months. With Pinterest, it's kind of a new take on an old thing. Social networking is great. Pinterest is great. The way people are sharing on Pinterest is new."" One caveat: Since the data doesn't include mobile traffic, sites such as Twitter, which sees much of its traffic from smartphones and tablets, may take a hit in this ranking, Tatham said. Pinterest's traffic jumped 50% between January and February. The report calls the site ""the hottest social media start-up since Facebook and YouTube."" Those stats add momentum to a site that already had become one of the hottest topics of conversation on tech blogs and was known to be one of the fastest-growing networks. In February, Pinterest was the third-fastest-growing site on the Internet in the United States, with 17.8 million unique visitors that month, compared with 11.7 million in January, according to a report from another Internet tracking company, comScore. Plus, it can't hurt when the U.S. president joins your website. Pinterest launched in March 2010, but it has grown rapidly only in the past six months. Unlike many social-media darlings, tech bloggers in Silicon Valley largely ignored the site until they noticed that it was growing like mad. The site's co-founder, Ben Silbermann, sounds somewhat surprised by the growth. ""It's a really humbling feeling that all these people are using something that you helped make,"" Silbermann said in an on-stage Q&A at last month's South by Southwest Interactive conference. At that conference, he announced that an iPad app and new pinboards were coming soon.

"(CNN) -- Doctors will amputate the feet of a Colorado woman who was missing for five days before being found in her wrecked car just off a scenic highway, a family spokesman said Monday. Kristin Hopkins is in critical but stable condition at St. Anthony Hospital in Lakewood, Brian Willie said, reading a statement from the Hopkins family. ""Doctors were not able to save her feet due to the severity of her injuries,"" he told reporters, adding the amputations would be done Monday afternoon. Hopkins, a 43-year-old single mother of four, was reported missing on April 29. She was found May 4, still in her car, about 140 feet from U.S. 285 just north of Fairplay, the Park County Sheriff's Office said. The Hopkins' family statement thanked a man who found Hopkins in her car and drove to the sheriff's office to report finding a car with a possible body inside. The man was not identified by authorities, who said he slipped out of the sheriff's office after reporting the accident. A firefighter who treated Hopkins at the scene said it appeared she had written notes on the white portions of a red and white umbrella and was trying to use it to signal passersby on the highway. Lt. Jim Cravener, a firefighter with the North-West Fire Protection District in Park County, said, ""(The notes) were hard to make it out. One of them appeared to say 'Please help doors won't open.' Another one (said) 'Please help, bleeding, need a doctor' and another one said, 'Six days, no food, no water, please help.'"" Cravener said Hopkins was ""really severely dehydrated."" The man who spotted the car had stopped to take photos at the top of a pass near a sharp curve, Cravener said. ""He ventured off the highway a little bit, found the vehicle, and walked down to it,"" the firefighter said. ""The person thought they found a body."" Cravener and another firefighter were surprised to discover Hopkins alive. The car was upside down in a heavily wooded and steep area. As the other firefighter went to break a window, Hopkins put her hand on the glass. Hopkins went in and out of consciousness, Cravener said. ""She said she crashed at night,"" he said. ""We assumed she crashed the night before, but it turned out it had been several days."" The family asked for privacy during Hopkins' recovery. ""While we are hopeful for her prognosis, Kristin was seriously injured with multiple internal and external injuries,"" Willie said. Hopkins lives in Highlands Ranch, about 90 minutes away from the accident scene.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer tuned up in perfect style ahead of Wimbledon with a straight sets victory over Alejandro Falla to claim his seventh title at Halle. The 17-time major champion from Switzerland edged a tight encounter with his Colombian opponent 7-6 (2) 7-6 (3) to win on the grass in Germany. Federer's seventh title means only at Wimbledon has he had as much success, though he'll be hoping to bag an eighth crown in London later this month. The pair swapped a break each in the opening set before Federer pulled clear in the tiebreak, the second set following a similar pattern. ""It is great to have won seven times here,"" Federer the ATP Tour's official website. ""It is very special and I hope to come back here next year, where it is a [ATP World Tour] 500-series event. ""I really enjoy winning titles. It is what I play for, to play and receive a standing ovation at the end. I am very pleased with my performance. ""I work hard and travel the tour to win these titles and not lose in the quarters or semifinals. With all the success I have had in the past, I need to aim for titles. I think I deserved the title this week."" Federer's record at Halle now reads 45 wins and just five defeats. The 32-year-old has also taken his tally of Tour wins to 79. ""In the past, when I have played well at Halle I have usually played well at Wimbledon,"" added Federer. ""They have been two of my most successful tournaments, so I hope that this title will bring me luck again. ""Last year it didn't work out, but it did many times before. So I hope it will be back to the good old days."" It meant Falla missed the chance to become the first Colombian to win an ATP Tour title since Mauricio Hadad in 1995 . ""It's always tough losing a match, especially a final,"" said Falla. ""I wanted to win the title so badly. But when you play Roger in a final, it is always tough. It was a close match. ""I tried my best and fought for every point. I am happy with the way I played today and the tournament overall. I enjoy playing on the grass. ""This tournament gave me a lot of confidence, having won some tough matches."" At Queen's, Grigor Dimitrov -- known as 'Baby Federer' -- claimed his first grass court crown after defeating Spain's Feliciano Lopez in the final at Queen's club. Theirs was also a tight affair, the Bulgarian being forced to save a match point before eventually prevailing 6-7(8) 7-6(1) 7-6(6). Dimitrov, the boyfriend of French Open champion Maria Sharapova, held his nerve as the deciding set also went to a tiebreak, prevailing in a little over two-and-a-half hours. ""(Grigor) never gives up, as he showed today,"" Lopez told the ATP Tour's official website . ""I think when you face players like Grigor, you know that even playing the way I played today there is a chance to lose because he's a great player. ""It's tough to lose when you play such a great match. Overall it was a great week for me. It has been a great preparation for Wimbledon, and hopefully in Eastbourne, next week, I can do well again. ""It's true that I'm feeling great. I'm playing good and hopefully I can continue playing like this for the next two or three weeks.""","Roger Federer claims his seventh title on grass at Halle in Germany .

"(CNN) -- First came the devastating news that Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 had crashed. Then, the horrifying accusation that someone shot it out of the sky. And now this -- the fear that their loved ones' remains might never make it home. ""We want to know where my brother...is right now, and we still don't,"" Paul de Kuijer told CNN on Monday. Authorities have said a train carrying the bodies of hundreds of victims is on its way to Kharkiv, Ukraine. But de Kuijer said he hasn't gotten any word about whether his brother Pim is on it. ""We don't know whether they recovered his body, whether it's on the train, whether it will be coming to the Netherlands soon,"" he said. ""These are the big questions that we have right now."" The 298 people aboard Malaysia Airlines 17 when it crashed on Thursday left behind hundreds of family members across the globe. Some say their voices are getting lost in an international political scuffle as world leaders face off over what happened to the downed jet. ""The passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 had nothing to do with the conflict in eastern Ukraine. They were families heading on vacation, students returning home from abroad, researchers trying to eradicate a deadly disease,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said Monday. ""Those who were killed deserve to be treated with dignity and their families are crying out, as we have heard, for closure."" As presidents, prime ministers and ambassadors pointed fingers over who was responsible for the crash, father Hans de Borst spoke out in a Facebook post. He accused Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Ukrainian government and separatists of murdering his 17-year-old daughter, who was nearing the end of high school and planning to study engineering. ""She was looking forward to it!"" de Borst wrote. ""But suddenly she is not here anymore! She has been shot out of the sky, in an unknown country, where there is a war going on! Aforementioned misters, I hope you're proud to have shot her. ... And that you will be able to look at yourself in the mirror tomorrow morning."" Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans said bringing the remains of the 193 Dutch citizens who died in the crash home was his country's top priority. He decried what he called disturbing reports of how bodies had been treated at the scene of the crash. ""Just imagine that you first get the news that your husband was killed. and then within two or three days, you see images of some thug removing a wedding band from their hands. Just imagine that this could be your spouse,"" he said. ""To my dying day, I will not understand that it took so much time for the rescue workers to be allowed to do their difficult jobs, and that human remains should be used in a political game."" Even as reports that thieves have been picking over bodies at the scene draw sharp condemnation from international officials, Silene Fredriksz said she wasn't worried about material things. Until the remains of her son and his girlfriend are returned, Fredriksz said she's paralyzed. ""I can do nothing but wait for the bodies,"" she told CNN. ""They can have everything, but the bodies have to come back. Take their iPhones, take their money, take everything."" In Malaysia, a group of families of victims meeting with government officials had just one request, state media reported. ""That the bodies be brought back in whatever condition,"" Malaysian government minister Datuk Seri Rohani said. In Britain, Hugo Hoare told The Mirror that he was worried about whether rebels were taking care of the bodies of his 59-year-old brother Andrew and the other crash victims. ""I just hope whatever they are doing is humane and their intention is just to release them at the appropriate time. The first thing I thought was, what if they are going to use them as a bargaining chip?"" Hoare said. ""We just have to follow normal pressure through diplomatic channels and just hope there is a decent resolution at the end of it."" Standing at Amsterdam's Schipohl Airport, just meters away from the place where her son and his girlfriend checked in for their flight last week, Fredriksz asked Russian President Vladimir Putin for help. ""Mr. Putin,"" she said, ""please take care of my son and my daughter, to bring them home."" Her son, Bryce, 23, and his girlfriend Daisy Oehlers were on their way to Bali when the plane was downed in war-torn eastern Ukraine. Fredriksz had bought the ""beautiful young couple"" their tickets for a holiday after the death of Oehlers' mother 2Â½ months ago. ""I paid their tickets to give them four weeks holiday to find their happiness again,"" she said. Supported by family members, Fredriksz, sometimes in tears, described searching through grisly photos on social media in an effort to find her son. ""I saw pictures on Facebook of bodies. Complete bodies. I had to look at it because maybe my son was on the picture,"" she said. Fredriksz couldn't find him. But that hasn't dampened her resolve. She knows she wants to bring Bryce and Daisy together again. ""Here. They have to be buried together,"" she said from Amsterdam. ""They died together. They loved each other. They have to be together forever."" CNN's Susannah Cullinane and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.","NEW: A father accuses Putin, rebel and Ukrainian leaders of murdering his daughter .

"(CNN) -- Last April, images of Kurdish men dressed in drag started making the rounds on Facebook. The campaign, called Kurd Men for Equality, featured men proudly swathed in the colorful garb traditional among Kurdish women. The subjects -- young, old, moustachioed, bespectacled -- were making a statement that was at once political and feminist, proving that in the Kurdish community, the two often go hand in hand. ""You can't separate the two,"" explains Dilar Dirik, a Kurdish activist, journalist and a Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge. ""It's a political move against the Iranian regime, and the regime happens to be oppressive, to Kurds and to women -- not just Kurdish women but all women."" The campaign, which received over 17,000 Facebook ""likes"", and, according to the site, the endorsement of American actress Rosario Dawson, was the brainchild of two male feminists, Masoud Fathi and Dler Kamangar. They launched the campaign after an Iranian court in the Kurdish region of Marivan sentenced a man convicted of domestic abuse to walk the streets dressed in women's clothing. Fathi donned a dress, had Kamangar snap the picture, and posted the image on Facebook with the slogan, ""Being a woman is not a tool to humiliate or punish anyone."" ""Women are part of our personality, our character. If we oppress one part of our character, we oppress ourselves,"" Fathi said in an interview with the Kurdistan Tribune. ""If one part of us is unfree, our whole cannot be free, either."" That a male-led feminist movement could emerge is somewhat surprising given the region's track record for women's rights. Diana Nammi, the executive director for the Iranian & Kurdish Women's Rights Organization (IKWRO), notes that honor killings, genital mutilation, and child marriages still make up a large part of the cultural landscape. ""Officials put the number of honor killings at a few hundred each year, but I think that shows just the tip of the iceberg. The realities are far darker,"" she says. For the men involved in the campaign, however, women's rights is an issue of obvious importance. ""In my own experience, it seems the Kurdish people are trying really hard to fight for the rights that have been taken from them. I guess women's rights is part of that whole thing,"" says Pedram Penhan, who says he didn't hesitate to put on a dress as part of the campaign. ""I wouldn't label myself as a feminist, but I would say I'm an activist who does anything possible to make the world a better place for every human,"" he adds. ""It might have something to do with my nationality, I suppose."" Video: Yemeni girl, 11, runs from marriage . Dirik argues there are many areas where Kurdish women enjoy more rights than their female brethren in neighboring countries. By law, 30% of the Iraqi Kurdistan parliament's members must be women. The main Kurdish party in the Turkish parliament has instituted a similar quota, requiring 40% of the seats go to women. At the same time, women have also made up the backbone of many Kurdish separatist movements, including the PKK in Turkey and the YPG in Syria. ""It's like affirmative action,"" says Dirik. ""In many of the PKK camps, men do the domestic work so women can read books."" To a certain extent, notes Dirik, it's because women have been denied rights, both within the Kurdish community and by the government of the country in which they reside. Read more: Saudi Arabia's first anti-domestic violence campaign . ""One fighter (in the PKK) I interviewed said to me, 'I have nothing to gain from the nationalist structures of the Turkish state.' For her, she's taking up arms against patriarchy and national oppression. It's a secular revolution run by women who are the most oppressed in the world,"" she says. Though Nammi agrees that women play a pivotal role in these groups, she argues that their presence is not necessarily feminist in nature. ""I know lots of women in these movements, and though they've been armed and are fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with men, they are just fighting as a nationalist group. Women's rights are not seriously part of their political agenda,"" she says. Dirik is not in agreement. ""I genuinely believe that Kurd women have reached the point of no return. Even if the Kurd people were given all their cultural rights, if men didn't share them equally with women, I think women would take up arms against them,"" she jokes. Correction: An earlier version of this article stated Dilar Dirik visited the training camps of PKK members, which is not correct.","Masoud Fathi launched the Kurd Men for Equality Facebook campaign in Kurdish area of Iran .

"(CNN) -- If the Tour de France founder Henri Desgrange could have magically transported himself forward to the100th edition and discovered that the hot favorite was Kenyan-born Briton Chris Froome, with not a French contender in sight, then he might have abandoned the idea altogether. Desgrange and his editorial colleagues on the newspaper L'Auto came up with the idea of a cycle race around France to boost its flagging circulation and a non-French winner was the last thing they would have wanted. Maurice Garin duly obliged in the 1903 edition, but more importantly the ""Grand Boucle"" had successfully captured the French public's imagination and with the exception of two world wars has been raced every year since. Despite a raft of doping scandals -- this year's Tour is the first since Lance Armstrong confessed to cheating and was stripped of his seven titles -- and the tragic deaths of leading riders such as Tommy Simpson and Fabio Casartelli -- its popularity as the greatest free sporting spectacle in the world has endured. For a race conceived by a journalist, it has undoubtedly provided rich material to fill countless column inches, not to mention ample opportunities for their photographic colleagues to capture the drama of the moment and France's stunning scenery. Mapping Le Tour, published in conjunction with the centenary race, chronicles the history of the race in images and route maps of each year, plus a stage-by-stage preview of the 2013 edition. It reveals that the Tour has visited every region of France apart from Corsica -- so fittingly, and to mark the special anniversary, this year's race will start Saturday with three road stages on the hilly Mediterranean island. World's greatest tourist destination . The peloton returns to the mainland for a short team time trial in Nice before setting off on a clockwise route around France. For the first time since the 2003 race, which marked the actual centenary of the Tour, all 3,360 kilometers will be on French soil, a move designed organizers say to ""showcase the splendors of the world's greatest tourist destination."" Froome, who began his cycling career racing BMX and mountain bikes near his birthplace of Nairobi, and the other leading contenders will be too busy to appreciate the delights of the terrain in the Alps and Pyrenees, but for the millions of spectators who line the route it's an added attraction. Last year Froome finished second to Team Sky teammate Bradley Wiggins as he became the first British rider to win overall honors in the famous three-week race. Last month Wiggins withdrew from the 2013 edition after sustaining injuries in the Giro d'Italia, leaving the way apparently clear for Froome to lay his claim to the storied yellow jersey. ""It's got to be our focus to try and get yellow, make that the number one goal,"" Froome told the UK's Press Association on the eve of the race Friday. His Australian teammate Richie Porte is also tipped to fulfill the major supporting role that Froome himself played for Wiggins last year. ""I don't see why Porte couldn't be on the podium come Paris,"" Froome added. ""There's a lot of road ahead but that would be the dream scenario for us."" Doping controversies . But as the riders gathered in Corsica, the shadow of doping controversies continued to hog the headlines. Armstrong was quoted in the French daily Le Monde claiming that the route to success still lay in taking performance enhancing drugs. ""It's impossible to win the Tour de France without doping because the Tour is an endurance event where oxygen is decisive,"" he said. The disgraced Texan -- who dominated the Tour from 1999 to 2005, added: ""I simply took part in this system. I'm a human being."" Coming a week after Armstrong's arch rival Jan Ullrich finally confessed he too had taken blood boosting drugs such as EPO, it was the last thing the organisers needed as the sport seeks yet another fresh start. Australian BMC rider and 2011 champion Cadel Evans, one of the major challengers to Froome, took exception to Armstrong's remarks. ""I think the opposite. I am proof that that is not true,"" Evans told gathered reporters in Porto-Vecchio. ""I sometimes read in the press what Armstrong says and I respect him as a human being, but really I just focus on doing my own job as best I can and fortunately we are supported by a great group of people."" Angry Hinault . Five-time Tour champion Bernard Hinault strongly defended his sport when asked about Armstong's reported comments by CNN affiliate BFMTV. The French legend said that if other sports were as tightly controlled as cycling ""we would be laughing for five minutes."" He angrily added ""one has to stop thinking that cyclists are drug addicts, thugs."" Froome's other likely rival, Spaniard Alberto Contador, has himself served a ban after giving a positive test for the banned steroid clenbuterol on the way to winning the 2010 edition, the title later awarded to Andy Schleck of Luxembourg. Saxo-Tinkoff's Contador has always protested his innocence and his route to redemption may well lie in the 2013 race, which takes in 28 mountain ascents, four of which finish at the top, suiting his climbing abilities. Away from the battle for yellow, sprinting stars such as Britain's Mark Cavendish and Slovakian Peter Sagan will battle it out for the green points jersey on the flatter stages. Cavendish, led out by Wiggins, crossed the line first on Champs Elysees last year, his 23rd Tour stage win, closing fast on the all-time record of 34 by the five-time overall winner Eddy Merckx of Belgium. International appeal . It is unlikely a home rider will add to France's record 38 overall victories, the last of which came from Hinault back in 1985, but Desgrange would surely have been proud of how his creation has gained such international appeal. Since it's first incursion into the Netherlands in 1954, the Tour has visited major capitals such as London and Berlin, while the 2014 race will start in the English northern county of Yorkshire. American Greg Lemond, an outspoken critic of Armstrong, was the first non-European winner of the Tour in 1986 and Wiggins' historic victory last year is likely to continue this trend as the well financed Team Sky squad has the resources and rider lineup to dominate for the foreseeable future.

Thanks to a slew of new galleries, hotels and museums paired with festivals, fairs and more, there's plenty to keep you busy across the Continent in the coming year. CNN's 2013 travel wish list . Corsica, France . It's France, but not as we know it. A petite island a couple of hundred kilometers from the French mainland, Corsica flies under the radar for the most part -- and that's part of its appeal.

Kissing latitude 67 degrees north, the isolated island of volcanoes and glaciers is home to equal urban drama: the Harpa Reykjavík Concert Hall and Conference Centre opened here not long ago and is now the official home of the Icelandic Opera and Iceland Symphony Orchestra. Local favorite Björk has also been known to belt out a tune or two in the shimmering glass-clad building, embedded with colored LED strips. While the glowing hall is pretty, it's hard to beat the lights in the night sky.

The Austrian capital may steal the spotlight from the rest of the country -- let's face it, Vienna is one beautiful city -- but Innsbruck deserves a place in the sun. Encircled by the Alps, the city offers the ultimate access to some of Europe's best ski fields: hop on a funicular in town, zip past jaw-dropping railway stations designed by Zaha Hadid and you'll find yourself flying down untrammeled snow in no time. Visit early in the year and you'll share the slopes with the world's snowboarding elite for the 20th edition of the Billabong Air & Style (February 1-2). White stuff aside, Innsbruck offers equal allure during its warmer months, when visitors jump on bikes and cycle between historic hillside towns. Crete, Greece . It may be one of the largest islands in the Mediterranean, but Crete offers plenty of intimate experiences, plus plenty of reasons to party -- the island is celebrating a century of union with Greece in December 2013. Away from the blissful beach resorts, still extremely good value thanks to the country's recent economic woes, chilling of another kind is in full swing. Crete is developing a reputation as one of the region's finest wine producers, with a growing catalog of extremely drinkable native grape varieties: Vilana and Vidiano, Dafni and Kotsifali, Mandilari and Thrapsathiri. The best bit? Many of the vineyards are wedged between languid towns where predictably good tavernas dish up uncomplicated, but classic, Cretan fare for a handful of euros. Helsinki, Finland . The World Design Capital in 2012, Helsinki continues to push creative boundaries. In Narinkka Square, the freshly minted Kamppi Chapel of Silence resembles a wooden egg, dressed in fir and with a halo-shaped skylight beneath which you can sneak a moment of quiet contemplation. Another eye-opening building will soon feature pine, larch and spruce rooms: the upcoming Kulttuurisauna will be the first public sauna to open in the city in some 50 years. And on the outskirts of Helsinki in Espoo, the WeeGee Exhibition Centre is now home to The Futuro, an elliptical plastic house showcasing the space-age architecture and design of the late 1960s. An equal spectacle will unfold at sea in 2013 when Helsinki hosts the Tall Ship Races for four days (July 17-20), welcoming more than 100 imposing vessels on their voyage from Denmark to Poland.

Near, far, wherever you are, you've no doubt heard a lot about Belfast -- and the legendary cruise liner it launched. The ill-fated Titanic, which went down just over a century ago on April 15, 1912, was built and floated in Belfast and you can still visit the old Harland and Wolff Shipyard where the luxurious vessel was brought to life. Today, the area has been reinvented as the Titanic Quarter -- Europe's largest urban regeneration scheme -- and is now home to the spectacular Titanic Belfast complex. Newly opened, the space showcases an impressive collection of memorabilia, taking you from the conception to the destruction of the ship, and also hosts activities for the Titanic Belfast Festival (April 2013). If that doesn't float your boat, book in for one of Titanic Walking Tours' excursions, where you'll learn yet more about the Titanic and how it changed the city forever.

It's a bit obvious as a Euro hot spot, but there is a reason -- well, there are many -- why Amsterdam is a must-visit in 2013. For a start, the Rijksmuseum will open once again on April 13, welcoming visitors after 10 years of renovations. Highlights of the made-over space will include a dazzling new pavilion dedicated to Asian art, as well as lighter, brighter and impeccably restored halls, cupolas and galleries. Other milestones over the course of the year include the reopening of the Van Gogh Museum (April 25), just in time to mark Vincent's 160th birthday and the gallery's 40th, and the 400th anniversary of the city's canal ring, which was added to the World Heritage List in 2010.

Come October 2013, Berlin will be much easier to fly into, thanks to the highly anticipated (and well overdue) opening of the Brandenburg Airport, replacing three other airports at a cost of more than €4.2 billion (US$5.4 billion). Needless to say, it will be one of the most modern terminal buildings in the world. And when you do finally touch down you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that Berlin is home to some of the most affordable five-star hotels in the world at the moment. Newcomers to look out for include the 232-room Waldorf Astoria Berlin (opening February), as well as boutique properties Bikini Berlin and Leonardo Hotel Berlin Mitte. The Waldorf will be part of a large retail complex with upscale boutiques, a cinema and office space and will feature a spacious rooftop terrace and bar. The Leonardo will resemble a glass-and-metal pyramid and has been designed by notable German architect Eike Becker. Got a favorite or must-hit European destination?

"(CNN) -- On February 14, when Netflix aired Season 2 of ""House of Cards,"" my book, ""The Last Great Senate,"" appeared clearly on the desk of Vice President Francis Underwood in Episode 2. It was as incongruous as it was unexpected. I can't think of anyone less likely to read, let alone be inspired by, my narrative history about the statesmen of the great Senate than the scheming, diabolical, Underwood. With the possible exception, that is, of Sen. Mitch McConnell. McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, seeking his sixth term in the Senate, handily defeated Matt Bevin, his tea party opponent, in the Republican primary on May 20. He has certainly helped the Republican chances of capturing the Senate by spearheading the effort to defeat other potential tea party nominees. But as McConnell turns to his general election campaign against Alison Grimes, it is a good moment to inventory the extraordinary damage that McConnell has done to the Senate over the past 5Â½ years. Mitch McConnell did not create the hyper-partisan Senate, which has been in a long downward spiral dating back at least to the mid-1990s. But through a deliberate and calculated political strategy, McConnell drove the Senate to a new low. When Barack Obama took office in January 2009, America was close to plunging into a second Great Depression. In one month, we lost three quarters of a million jobs. Our national narrative is that Americans come together in times of crisis, but it didn't happen this time. Obama faced total partisan opposition despite the potential economic catastrophe. On the economic stimulus, health care, financial regulation, and then virtually everything else, Sen. McConnell did everything in his power to keep the Republicans in lockstep opposition. By any objective measure -- the amount of legislation passed, filibusters conducted, holds applied, executive and judicial nominations blocked -- the Senate has become a more dyspeptic and dysfunctional institution. Again and again, the Senate has failed to fulfill its role as what Walter Mondale once described as ""the nation's mediator."" Thoughtful debate, principled compromise, and pursuit of the national interest have all been subordinated to the permanent campaign for partisan advantage. It has been a particularly cynical strategy because McConnell knows what the Senate should be. Unlike his predecessors, Trent Lott, who hated the Senate when he arrived and resolved to make it more like the partisan, hard-edged House, and Bill Frist, who never really understood it, McConnell grew up in the great Senate of the 1960s and 1970s. In recent speeches and articles, he has invoked the name of Mike Mansfield, the longest-serving Senate majority leader, capturing the essence of Mansfield's leadership quite precisely by noting that Mansfield had built a Senate based on ""mutual trust and respect."" Mansfield lived by the Golden Rule and treated everyone -- Democrats and Republicans, veteran senators and new arrivals -- the way he expected to be treated. Although he was a strong Democrat, bipartisanship radiated from Mansfield, who ate breakfast every morning with his best friend, Republican Sen. George Aiken. He understood that America has one president at a time, and Senate leaders have a special responsibility to work with the president, regardless of party. Mansfield was one of President John Kennedy's closest friends, but he had at least 27 private meetings with President Richard Nixon, and kept his confidences despite their sharp differences on many issues. He was admired for his great knowledge of the world, particularly Asia. He understood that the Senate was the place where senators had to subordinate their individual agendas, to take collective action through principled compromise. In Mansfield's Senate, pursuit of the national interest and commitment to the institution of the Senate were paramount. No Senate leader could differ more from Mike Mansfield than Mitch McConnell. He has shown constant and visible contempt for the President. He has denounced those who disagree with him on campaign finance disclosure as ""liberal thugs."" He has opposed, or reneged on, every deal struck to make the Senate process nominations more swiftly. He famously said that his highest priority was denying re-election to Obama, when in fact his highest priority should have been making the Senate work in the interests of the country. He personifies the unwillingness of many Republicans to accept the results of presidential elections that they lose, and repeatedly, he has been willing to deadlock the Senate for partisan purposes. The Republican response to criticisms of McConnell has been to attack Majority Leader Harry Reid. But there are light years of differences between Reid. Reid is attempting to run the Senate and enact the legislative program of the President, while McConnell is practicing a strategy of total and utter obstruction. The contrast calls to mind the famous comment of Speaker Sam Rayburn: ""Any jackass can kick down a barn, but it takes a carpenter to build one."" To be sure, the partisan divide in the Senate is far larger than it was in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. But that reality makes it crucial to have leaders who can bridge those differences to move the country forward. Sen. McConnell has chosen to exacerbate partisan differences rather than overcome them. Starting in 2013, it was quite clear that many senators -- Democratic and Republican -- shared the anger of the public about the dysfunctional Senate. They were committed to helping the Senate return to ""regular order"": legislating through committees, consideration of amendments, vigorous debate and principled compromise. The Senate showed signs of breaking through the gridlock on a series of issues, including immigration, the budget, the farm bill, and consideration of executive nominations. Progress occurred as Senate Republicans -- veterans and new arrivals -- came forward to work in a constructive, bipartisan fashion. They have always had to work around McConnell. Leaders set the tone, and virtually every serious observer thinks that the Senate would be a far different place if the Republicans were led by someone else, such as Lamar Alexander, Rob Portman, Susan Collins or Bob Corker. In 2012, McConnell was measuring the drapes in the Majority Leader's office, when the nation re-elected President Obama and rejected the Republican strategy of obstruction and extremism. Now he is betting on the President's diminished poll numbers and the impact of a lower Democratic turnout, presenting himself as a leader who can make the Senate function again. It turns out that McConnell does share one thing with the President that he disdains: the audacity of hope. He has the audacity to claim to be a restorer of the Senate, and the hope that people will forget the record of the past 5Â½ years. The voters of Kentucky will decide whether he gets another term, but the verdict on the damage he has caused in the Senate is already in.

"Guatemala City (CNN) -- The courtroom erupted in cheers after former Guatemalan dictator Efrain Rios Montt was found guilty of genocide in May 2013 for allegedly allowing massacres of more than 1,700 indigenous Ixil Mayans in the early 1980s. Hundreds dressed in traditional ethnic ""huipiles,"" crossed their arms over their chests in a sign of gratitude to the tribunal for being the first in the world to try a head of state for genocide in his own country's judicial system. But the verdict would only stick for 10 days. Guatemala's Constitutional Court annulled the conviction and ordered a retrial in 2015, a move critics considered politically motivated. As the one-year anniversary of the Rios Montt trial nears, many -- including U.S. officials -- are sounding the alarm over recent judicial moves they say threaten the country's weak justice system. ""For the proper functioning of democracies, independent and capable public servants are essential,"" the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala said in a recent statement. ""If judges are subject to threats and intimidation, justice will suffer."" Such statements followed two controversial decisions. First, the nation's highest court ruled in February that Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz, who was instrumental in bringing charges against Rios Montt, must step down from her post in May, seven months before her term was to expire. The court's ruling was based on a technical interpretation of Paz's term. The 47-year-old prosecutor was appointed in 2010 after a prior selection process was scrapped due to alleged corruption. The court interpreted that hers was an interim mandate. Then this month, the Guatemalan Bar Association suspended magistrate Yassmin Barrios, the presiding judge in Rios Montt's trial. Just weeks after the suspension was handed down, Barrios was awarded an International Woman of Courage award by first lady Michelle Obama and the U.S. State Department, in part for her role in the genocide trial. Barrios was sanctioned by the Bar Association after attorney Moises Galindo, part of Rios Montt's legal team, accused her of an ethics violation for the way she expelled one of Rios Montt's lawyers from the proceedings for contempt. Both Barrios and Paz were key to the short-lived conviction of the 87-year-old retired general. ""The dirty campaign started last year,"" Alberto Brunori, representative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. ""It's been a series of attacks in the media, etc. by various conservative sectors."" There's no conclusive evidence that the actions against Paz and Barrios are retaliation for their role in prosecuting Guatemala's one-time dictator, but the sentiment among many is that this is exactly what happened. Guatemala's elite have long had a strong grip on power, and some experts say the elite feared that a decision against a stalwart of the old guard like Rios Montt could have opened the door to further prosecutions of former leaders. Longtime critics have also denounced organized crime gangs' collusion with judges and courts. Some experts say these two corrupt factions have too much influence over the judiciary. The trial unearthed Guatemala's complicated relationship with its own history as both protesters and supporters rallied outside the courtroom last year. Rios Montt came to power in a March 1982 coup, only to be overthrown 18 months later. During the trial, prosecutors argued that Rios Montt's junta government oversaw the bloodiest period of the country's 1960-1996 civil war that left more than 200,000 people dead and 1 million refugees, according to various truth commission reports. Leading figures, including President Otto Perez Molina, deny genocide took place in Guatemala. On the same day that the verdict came down in the Rios Montt trial, Perez Molina predicted that it would not stick. ""Today's ruling is not set in stone,"" the President told CNN en EspaÃ±ol that night. ""Let's just say it showed the good, the bad, and the ugly,"" said Jo-Marie Burt of the conviction and subsequent reversal. Paz's ousting and the sanction against Barrios signal that the entire legal system is still at risk, said Burt, senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America and political science professor at George Mason University. Barrios continues to stand by her verdict despite facing what she calls retaliation. ""History cannot be undone,"" she said. But Francisco Palomo, chief counsel for Rios Montt, calls the initial trial a ""farce,"" and with several appeals in play, said it is possible that Rios Montt might avoid a second trial. To date, the general's defense team has lodged over 70 motions and appeals. The most controversial move was a ruling on one of those appeals that basically reverted the trial back to its initial phases, undoing the conviction. ""Perhaps the kernel of light in this whole process is that it was much, much harder for the elites than it would have been 10 years ago,"" said Marcie Mersky, program director at the International Center for Transitional Justice in New York and longtime Guatemala expert. ""They've had to resort to outrageous forms of pressures and measures."" The Guatemalan Congress this week delivered the shortlist to the President of those favored to take the helm of the attorney general's office, and Paz did not make the cut. ""With Paz driven out and being few days from having a new attorney general, this reflects that various power groups continue to benefit from maintaining impunity,"" said Michel Andrade, coordinator of the Dutch watchdog Impunity Watch. For others like anti-impunity commissioner Ivan Velasquez, the future of the judicial system is really a test about the strength of the country's democracy. ""After all,"" he said, ""it's the proper functioning of the judicial system that gives Guatemalan citizens faith in other structures within the state."" Guatemala has one of the highest murder rates in Latin America. The Central American nation of almost 15 million placed fifth deadliest in the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime rankings this year. A recent U.S. State Department report stated that widespread institutional corruption continues to be a concern.","A year ago, Efrain Rios Montt was found guilty of genocide .

"(CNN) -- What are the chances you walk into work and the lead story is Angelina Jolie has had a double mastectomy when you are facing one yourself? I have been struggling for weeks with how to tell my co-workers and viewers that I have breast cancer and have chosen to have a double mastectomy. How much should I share? Will I be an emotional wreck? Do I want people feeling sorry for me? Angelina empowered me to share my story. I was diagnosed with breast cancer five weeks ago, on April 9. Saying it, talking about it, dealing with it has been a complicated journey. Luckily, I have a very early form of breast cancer called DCIS. MRI scans show some questionable areas in my left breast and many in my right. After several consultations with some of the finest doctors in New York and Chicago (my hometown), volumes of research and some serious soul searching, I have chosen to have a double mastectomy. Angelina Jolie chose to bear her soul in writing and I chose to follow her lead in front of all our viewers Tuesday. I identified with some of the issues she candidly discussed, such as her children, her sexuality and her femininity. I never expected to share this news so publicly and I certainly did not want to become the story. But judging from the outpouring of support, I am not alone. I have a history of fibrocystic breast tissue, which is very dense and complicated to read in a mammogram. For years, I've had biopsies and two years ago, prior to starting at CNN, I had a lumpectomy to remove abnormal tissue that doctors thought was cancer. One doctor said that in my case cancer was a matter of when, not if. Still, when I got the call five weeks ago, it knocked me over. My greatest challenge was sharing the news with the people who love me. My son Nico and my daughter Sofia were the hardest. I sat with Nico, 14, and asked him what came to mind when he thought of breast cancer. His response was a fight. I knew then he had the right attitude. I pulled out the book ""Breast Cancer for Dummies"" and explained in great detail what my diagnosis was and how I chose to treat it. He listened intently but still worried I was going to die. I explained that my decision gave me the best chance of survival long term. I promised this would not kill me. I agonized for weeks about how to tell my daughter, and even consulted a psychologist. Would she instantly think her breasts were sick, too? Were they? Would the information scare her and would she be overwhelmed by fear of losing me and potentially getting sick herself? I worried about nothing. I asked her the same question I asked Nico and her response was that breast cancer makes people's hair fall out and that they get sick. I told her neither would happen to me and that I would have surgery and be back in no time. That was plenty for her. I surprised myself by worrying about my sexuality. Logically, I knew that getting rid of all the breast tissue was the best decision for me. But would I still be attractive and desirable to my partner? I was angry at myself for even caring about that, but I did. I was choosing reconstruction, so that to the outside world nothing would look different -- but I knew and he knew. Kenny, my fiancÃ©, was focused on making me whole. He said nothing mattered more to him than having me alive. Yet I still worried. Kenny happens to be executive vice president of the Chicago White Sox and travels nonstop. But he halted his schedule so he could be by my side for every appointment and every moment of vulnerability. He held my hand and sat with me when I cried. We have talked in great detail with doctors about the changes ahead, and privately about our personal feelings. They have been graphic, emotional conversations that have made us stronger. Early on, a very dear friend told me very matter-of-factly to treat this cancer as a pain-in-the-ass inconvenience. Getting there takes time and, in my case, a lot of prayer and a lot of research. I hope that every woman facing this decision takes the time to understand her options and surrounds herself with the support she needs to get through the difficult times. There are challenges to access that need to be tackled, especially for our Latina women. There is a lot of work and I am poised for the challenge to help others like me. I am grateful for the support and information available to me. My goal is to pay my many blessings forward. What I know, you will know. I am not yet on the other side, but judging by all the e-mails I've received from survivors, I am headed to a place that is stronger, wiser and definitely more empowered. My final words here are thank you -- for the many blessings, thoughts, prayers and even hugs you have sent my way today. Keep them coming!","CNN's Zoraida Sambolin discloses that she has breast cancer .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The Indian Supreme Court on Tuesday lifted its foreign travel ban on the Italian ambassador following Rome's recent decision to send two marines back to New Delhi where they face trial over the killing of two fishermen last year, a lawyer said. The court barred Italian Ambassador Daniele Mancini from leaving India last month because of Rome's refusal at the time to return the two marines, who had been allowed to go home temporarily to vote in national elections. Diljeet Titus, a lawyer representing the Italian side, said the Supreme Court had lifted its travel restrictions on Mancini after the two sailors -- Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone -- subsequently arrived back in India. Rome's initial decision not to return the marines angered Indian government officials and Supreme Court justices, who noted that the Italian ambassador had given assurances to the court that they would come back to India after the elections. The two sides appeared locked in an impasse, with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh saying Italy's actions were ""not acceptable"" and warning of ""consequences"" for the two countries' relations. But Rome backed down, announcing on March 21 that it would send Latorre and Girone back after receiving written assurances from the Indian government that the two men's ""fundamental rights"" would be protected. The two sailors agreed to the decision, it said. But the move created some dissent in the ranks of Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti's government: Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi resigned March 26 over the matter. Italy has argued that the February 2012 shooting involving its marines happened in international waters and was therefore outside of Indian jurisdiction. Latorre and Girone say they mistook the Indian fishermen for pirates. On Tuesday, the Indian Supreme court scheduled a hearing for April 16 to seek the Indian governmentÂ¹s response on plans to set up a special court for trying the two Italian men, Titus said. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","The two Italian marines arrived back in India last month .

"(CNN) -- On the morning of April 29, 22 million Americans tuned in to watch Kate Middleton marry Prince William. The following week, the couple was on the cover of dozens of magazines, with people still poring over every detail of their royal ""I do's."" But Kate's turn as a bridal cover girl would be short-lived. Just three weeks later, reality star Kim Kardashian landed herself on the front of People magazine with a big ring (with a 20.5-carat diamond, for those keeping score) and the big news that she was engaged to NBA player Kris Humphries. And with that, the other wedding of the year was under way. Not convinced the Kardashian hoopla rivals the royals? According to several of the countless paparazzi hoping to get a shot of her wedding this Saturday, a high-quality candid photograph of the bride in her wedding dress could sell for the same price as a 2012 Porsche Boxster. Kim, and her ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" co-stars/family members, will also have their own four-hour TV special -- yes, four hours -- to air on E! in two parts, on October 9 and 10. ""Kim is our people's princess,"" Life & Style Weekly's editor-in-chief Dan Wakeford said. ""People empathize with her. ... She's gone through relationship struggles, battles with her weight. Things haven't always gone as planned. [We're happy] to see her find her prince."" ""Weddings do incredibly well for magazines,"" Wakeford said. ""We'll look at a stranger's wedding photos and enjoy them and find them extremely irresistible."" But, Wakeford and other editors agree, the fact that it's Kim Kardashian's wedding is an added bonus on the newsstand. Just look at Kim by the numbers: On Sunday night, 3.2 million viewers tuned in to watch the latest episode of E!'s ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians."" And according to Women's Wear Daily, Kardashian's cover of Shape was the fitness magazine's top seller for 2010. She was W magazine's second-highest and Allure's third-highest-selling covers of the same year. Ipso facto, a cover shot of Kardashian's wedding could be the holy grail of the weekly tabloid world, which is why Life & Style, US Weekly, OK! and People all bid for rights to the exclusive story and photos, a source told CNN. People magazine nabbed the exclusive rights to the wedding photographs for an unknown amount, though figures ranging between $300,000 and $1 million have been reported. ""Exclusive wedding photos can go for a lot of money,"" said Kelly Davis, a writer for celebrity photo site X17online.com. ""It's so rare to get an exclusive -- so rare it's almost accidental."" When there's an exclusive deal in place, as there often is with Kardashian happenings -- Khloe's wedding, Kourtney's baby and now Kim's nuptials -- the photos are more valuable. But, Davis says, they're also harder to get. ""They'll likely have tents [set up] -- everything will be covered,"" she said. ""You have to hope that event planners have left holes in walkways and that you happen to catch them at the right moment. It's a huge challenge. I wouldn't be surprised if no one gets a shot."" Davis added that depending on its quality, a photo of Kim on her big day could sell for more than $50,000. If a magazine with an exclusive deal in place finds out that another photo agency has candid pictures, it might shell out big money to scoop them off the market, she added. ""It's bad business to let a competing magazine run a candid shot."" Justin Smith, a sales manager at Fame Pictures, another photo news agency, says he's not sure if they're ""going to go up in the air"" in a helicopter to cover the wedding. ""It will be a game-time decision,"" he said, adding: ""When push comes to shove, it's just not really worth it to shoot a grainy picture from hundreds of feet overhead and hope that you're circling the mansion ... when Kim and Kris are kissing."" Jill Stempel, the New York bureau chief at WENN, said the agency will send a couple of photographers to cover the event, but they won't be in ""commando guerrilla army mode."" ""We're sending a couple guys to get what they can, but we're realistic in that we don't feel it's worth a huge outlay of money to try and bust that exclusive,"" Stempel said, adding that talk of sending helicopters and a tank to cover the affair is a running joke in the office. ""It's like a war."" Despite the fact that there was an exclusive deal in place for Khloe and Lamar Odom's September 2009 nuptials -- which about 3 million people tuned in to watch -- the wedding was really easy to shoot, Stempel said. ""They all but red carpeted that wedding,"" she said. At one point, she added, the entire wedding party took pictures from the top of a hill, making it really easy to shoot. Though, photographers agree, getting the perfect shot most likely won't be as easy this time around. ""If it's tented, we can't shoot from the air. They'll probably cover them when they're walking. It will be a big game,"" Stempel said. Magazines that don't want to spend the money [on wedding photos] will probably just use a shot of [Kim] in a white dress from the red carpet,"" she added. ""Half the people won't know the difference.""","Kardashian's four-hour-long TV special will air on E! in two parts on October 9-10 .

"(CNN) -- Kyle White now has two pieces of metal to wear -- one, a bracelet inscribed with the names of his six comrades killed in an ambush in Afghanistan, the other, a Medal of Honor given to him for his valor that ensured that death toll wasn't higher. Speaking minutes after President Barack Obama gave him the highest military honor, White insisted the two emblems are equally significant. They both represent his family on that day six years ago -- the seven others who, like him, survived as well as those who did not. The former Army sergeant said Tuesday he owes it to these men, whom he calls ""my heroes,"" to live his life well, even now that he's left the military, and with honor. ""Though I am still uncomfortable with hearing my name and the word 'hero' in the same sentence, I am now ready for the challenge of proudly wearing this piece of blue fabric and carved metal with the same reverence that I wear the bracelet. And I vow to live up to the responsibility of doing so,"" White said. Not long before, Obama recalled White's bravery and that of his colleagues. The President paid tribute to those who died that fall day in Afghanistan and those who survived. They had done everything their country could ask for and more. ""Kyle, members of Chosen Company, you did your duty,"" Obama said. ""And now it's time for America to do ours."" White himself insisted that the Medal of Honor cannot really be an individual award, calling it ""a testament to the trust we have in each other and our leaders."" Still, the President said that he deserved to be singled out. A high school freshman when the Twin Towers fell on September 11, 2001, White joined the Army and was just 20 years old and 21 months into his military service when he faced the ultimate test. He aced it, and in doing so represented the best of what Obama called the ""9/11 generation (which) has proven itself to be one of America's greatest."" ""Today,"" the President said to a crowd that included White, his parents and many of his former comrades, ""we pay tribute to a soldier who embodies the courage of his generation."" Attacked in 'ambush alley' On Tuesday, White dressed in full uniform. But on most other weekdays, he now wears a suit to his job as an investment analyst at a bank in Charlotte, North Carolina -- a job that he's admitted to Obama, with a laugh, is less exciting than his previous job in the Army. The Washington state native joined up after high school, following the lead of his father, a former Army Special Forces member. His service had, like many other members of the military, earned him a ticket to Afghanistan as his platoon's radio telephone operator. He was there on November 9, 2007, walking back from a meeting with elders with his unit of 14 and a squad of Afghan army soldiers. ""They knew not to stop, they had to keep moving,"" Obama recalled of the group walking single-file with a cliff to their right and a steep, rocky slope to their left. ""They were heading into an area known as ambush alley."" In an interview prior to the award ceremony, White told CNN how the group walked ""down this little incline and looking into the valley, (when) I hear this single shot. Then two shots, then the echo, then fully automatic gunfire."" Taking so much fire, members of his patrol were separated as they tried to take cover. White was finishing off his first magazine and beginning to load another one when an rocket-propelled grenade exploded, knocking him unconscious. Moments after he came to, an enemy round hit a rock just inches from his head. The shrapnel and rock fragments cut his face. Dazed, he struggled to take in what was happening. He and four others had been separated from the other soldiers, who'd jumped from a cliff. White administered first aid to one wounded soldier using the only cover available: a single tree. That soldier would survive. It was at that point in the attack that White realized his radio wasn't working. He looked out and saw a member of his patrol about 30 feet away whose wounds were so bad that he could not move. White ran toward him, braving enemy fire. White was able to drag the wounded man back to the tree. But the man's injuries were too severe, and he died. Risking death, again and again . White continued to risk himself to help his fellow warriors, again running from cover into enemy fire to reach the platoon leader. White told the military publication Stars and Stripes that he could see the leader's helmet and assault pack, but he couldn't tell whether the leader was alive. White had to see, he said. White crawled toward the man. It was too late. He was dead. White figured he would be killed. But he would do what he was trained to do. He would carry out his duty. ""It was never a choice,"" he explained to CNN. ""I told myself from the beginning that I was going to be killed, you know... just the amount of fire ... I'm not gonna make it through this."" But he kept focused. The soldier White had dragged to the tree earlier was hit again, this time in the knee, so the White wrapped his belt around the man's leg, creating a tourniquet. Then White found a working radio on a deceased comrade and called for artillery and helicopter gunships to help. Finally, maybe, there could be hope. But then a friendly mortar round landed near White. ""I remember just red hot chunks of metal like the size of my palm just flinging by your head,"" he told Stars and Stripes. Suffering a concussion, White managed to hang on, waiting for helicopters to evacuate him and others with him that day. When help arrived, he told his rescuers to put the other wounded aboard first. A soldier, changed . Speaking with National Public Radio this week, White said the experience -- from the violence to the wait -- seemed like ""forever."" And it hasn't entirely gone away, all these years later. ""It's something you still think about every day,"" White said. ""I still have these images from that day burned into my head. But it's something, as time goes on, it gets easier."" But something inside him changed, he said. ""Even to this day, you know, I can't say if it was something good or bad. ..."" he told NPR. ""And that was pretty much the reason why I decided to leave the Army."" White first returned home and trained other paratrooopers. When it came time for White to re-enlist, he thought hard about whether doing so felt right. He decided against it because he doubted that he could devote his complete heart and mind to it, he told NPR. It was unacceptable to him to continue in the service and then, perhaps, be deployed to Afghanistan. Service members deserve a leader who is all in, he explained. Obama called him on February 10 to tell him he'd be given the Medal of Honor. He's the 10th recipient of that award for his actions in Afghanistan, and the seventh surviving recipient. Four service members received the Medal of Honor -- all posthumously -- for actions in the war in Iraq, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. In a brief statement to reporters after Tuesday's ceremony, White called the Medal of Honor ""a symbol of the responsibility all soldiers knowingly face when they depart for distant lands in defense of the nation, a responsibility that locks us all in the bonds of brotherhood."" As such, White couldn't help but think about his brothers in arms. ""Without the team,"" he said, ""there could be no Medal of Honor. That is why I wear this medal for my team.""

"(CNN) -- I first saw the headline early Tuesday on Real Clear Politics, a political news site where I generally start my morning. It's not where I expect to see a story on breast cancer. Then I checked my e-mail messages -- they all seemed to be about Angelina Jolie's op-ed. Students in my undergraduate class wanted to discuss it in our next session. Colleagues expressed concern and wondered what the right response was. People I don't even know sent e-mails. One, from a research fellow at the International Agency for Research on Cancer, nicely summed up the general concern: ""I fear that this disclosure will motivate other women to undergo preventive mastectomy, even though they do not need it."" Wow. Maybe I should read it. I did. I found it to be a moving story and understood her choice. What I couldn't understand initially was the concern expressed by others. As the day wore on, the story dominated the news. I didn't fully appreciate how much Ms. Jolie is admired and respected and had neglected to consider just how powerful a celebrity personal anecdote could be. If American women saw themselves in Angelina Jolie -- then that would be a problem. Because the logical next question is: Should I get a preventive mastectomy? Then I realized something was missing in her piece; something that should have been printed in big black letters: . NOTE: This story is not relevant to more than 99% of American women. Why? Because more than 99% of women do not have the BRCA1 mutation -- or the BRCA2 mutation, for that matter. Let's be clear, the BRCA1 mutation is a bad thing. Although I might quibble with the exact numbers in the piece, the big picture is this: the mutation increases the risk of developing breast cancer about five fold and increases the risk of ovarian cancer more than 10 fold. It is a powerful risk factor for these cancers -- almost as powerful as cigarette smoking is for lung cancer. When people are at very high risk for something bad to happen, preventive interventions are more likely to be a good deal; that is, the benefits are likely to exceed the harms. I'm not saying that prophylactic mastectomy is the right choice for a woman with BRCA1, simply that it is a reasonable one. When people are at average risk, the deal changes. The opportunity for benefit is less, simply because the bad event is less likely to happen. But the harms of preventive intervention remain roughly the same. It is a fundamental precept of medicine -- one I hammer home with undergraduates (future patients) and medical students (future doctors): Patients with severe abnormalities stand to gain more from intervention than patients with mild ones. Patients with mild abnormalities are more likely to experience net harm from intervention, simply because they have less opportunity to benefit. The vast majority of women don't have the BRCA1 mutation. They are at average risk for breast cancer. They are not Angelina Jolie. They should not have a preventive mastectomy. A few weeks ago, in a New York Times Magazine piece, Peggy Orenstein related her first instinct when facing breast cancer recurrence: take the other breast too. Her oncologist responded with a simple question: ""Would an average woman cut off her breasts?"" I hope not. But there is a second question for women raised by Ms. Jolie's piece: Should I be tested for BRCA1? She seems to believe the answer is yes, pointing to the half-million women who die from breast cancer worldwide each year. But she neglects to point out that 90% of these deaths have nothing to do with the BRCA1 mutation. That's because most women don't have the mutation and because most breast cancer is sporadic. Opinion: Jolie's choice: Risks and benefits . The few women who are likely to have the mutation are also likely to know they may have it based on the oldest genetic test of all: a strong family history of cancer. Population-wide screening raises complex issues. We would want to know more about how often the test is wrong, particularly how often the test is falsely positive. That's important because women falsely diagnosed as a mutation carrier might undergo prophylactic mastectomy unnecessarily. Then there are the psychological effects, not only for the patient but also for her siblings and offspring. We'd also need to know more about what a BRCA1 mutation means in the absence of family history. Ms. Jolie's mother died of ovarian cancer at age 56. I'm no geneticist, but I can guess that puts her at higher risk -- both for having the mutation and for developing a bad cancer. And we'd certainly want an answer to the question: Must the test cost so much? There's no one right choice for a woman in Angelina Jolie's position, but she may well have made the right choice for her. Luckily it is a choice most women don't have to face.

VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Back in the mid-zeroes, I remember reading a lot of stories about a buildup of trash in the Pacific Ocean so massive that it had formed a floating island of waste the size of Texas. Its colorful nickname was the Great Eastern Garbage Patch, and what was even more mind-boggling than the purported scale was that pretty much the only places you could dig up any substantial info about it were in minor oceanographic and environmental publications. You also couldn't find a photo of it to save your life. It was like Garbage Brigadoon. Anyhoo, the idea that one of the biggest environmental disasters of our age had been going on outside nearly everyone's awareness piqued our curiosity, so we decided to head out there (the middle of the ocean) and see it for ourselves. The Garbage Patch is located at a natural collecting point at the center of a set of revolving currents called the North Pacific Gyre. The middle of the Gyre is more of a meteorological phenomenon than an actual place: a consistent high-pressure zone north of the Hawaiian Islands that, combined with the extremely weak currents, helps keep the ocean surface as placid as lake water. Flotsam has been sucked into this area from the encircling currents for as long as the Pacific's existed, but up until the last century this process ended with the refuse safely biodegrading and being reabsorbed into the food chain as nutrients. With the advent of plastics, however, the Garbage Patch has transformed from a fertile feeding ground to the oceanic equivalent of a desert. And a particularly crap-strewn desert at that. See the rest of TOXIC: Garbage Island . We chartered a trip through the middle of the mess with Capt. Charles Moore of the Oceanographic Research Vessel Alguita. Capt. Moore is credited with discovering the Patch in its present, trash-choked state, and at the time was one of the few people studying the extent and effect of the pollution. Our voyage into the center of the Gyre took eight days of round-the-clock sailing on a 50-foot catamaran with a crew of six (including VBS's three-man filming team). Personal tensions mounted. Humor got strange. By the time we got to the beginning of the Patch, anticipation and cabin fever had conspired to make our expectations of ""Garbage Island"" unreasonably high, but what we found still managed to surpass them. To the naked eye it looked no different from any other part of the ocean, except that every few minutes something really strange would float by. For instance, one time it was a hard hat with Korean writing on it. Another time it was a motorcycle tire. Another time it was a child's life preserver with a cartoonish shark bite taken out of the side. Once it was an enormous telephone-pole-shaped thing that could have easily wrecked our ship if we'd been on a slightly different course. Here we were in one of the most remote stretches of water in the world -- thousands of miles from land, hadn't seen another ship in days -- and everywhere around us was civilization's detritus. It would have been some consolation to think that the Garbage Patch was simply the result of careless sailors, but researchers estimate up to 80 percent of the trash originates on land. That not only meant that the shampoo bottle or birthday balloon we scooped up had most likely spent years traveling around the currents of the Gyre before ending up in our path, but that there were countless others in the middle of the same journey. It was a colossal bring-down. Then we started taking some samples of the water, and that's when we realized things were even worse than we thought. Watch what the water samples showed .","VBS travels to a spot in the Pacific where a massive pool of trash churns with the current .

"Winter Park, Florida (CNN) -- The man who police say fled the scene after his SUV hit a car, sending it into a Winter Park day care center and killing a 4-year-old girl, turned himself in Thursday, Florida Highway Patrol spokeswoman Maj. Cindy Williams said. Robert Alex Corchado, who Williams earlier said had gang ties as well as numerous drug arrests, surrendered at the Orange County jail, according to a tweet from the sheriff department. A warrant for his arrest had been issued early Thursday after, authorities say, Corchado drove a Dodge Durango that hit a car, sending it into a crowded KinderCare. One girl died from injuries sustained in the accident and 13 other children were injured, as was one adult. Corchado fled the scene and ditched his Dodge Durango before renting another SUV, Williams said earlier. The warrant alleges Corchado left the scene of an accident ""with death."" Bond was set at $100,000, according to an arrest affidavit. Williams said Corchado, 28, rented a black Mazda CX-5 on Wednesday afternoon after fleeing the accident. Corchado's Dodge Durango was found abandoned a few hours after the crash. Little girl 'deserved so much more' Lily Quintus, 4, was among 50 children at a KinderCare in Winter Park when a car slammed through a wall. She died later at a hospital. Her mother, Nicole Quintus, is devastated, the New York Daily News reported. ""I have no idea how I'm supposed to survive after this. I don't know how I'm supposed to go back to a daily routine. I'm wandering about, lost,"" she told the paper. Nicole Quintus called her daughter ""painfully beautiful"" and said, ""She was incredible and she deserved so much more."" Lily's 7-year-old brother aspires to be an engineer and is building a time machine out of his Erector set so he can bring his sister back, the Daily News reported. Lily's father is a paramedic with the Groveland Fire Department and one of his co-workers set up a page so people could donate funds for medical and funeral expenses. As of Thursday night, people had given more than $33,000. Three released from hospitals . Two children and a teacher were released from hospitals on Thursday, according to a statement from Knowledge Universe, which operates KinderCare. At Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, where eight of the victims were taken Wednesday, five children remained hospitalized, including one in critical condition. Two were listed in serious condition, one was fair and one was in good condition. The hospital said two patients were discharged Thursday, but it was unclear whether they were among the people cited in the KinderCare release. After the incident, which occurred about 3 p.m. on Wedesday, 12 children and one adult were taken to four hospitals, said John Mulhall, a spokesman for Orange County Fire Rescue. Two other people were treated at the scene. One child was pinned by the car that was knocked into the day care through a front wall. Teachers gave kids CPR . ""It was tragic,"" Jeezy Jenkins told CNN affiliate WKMG. He was working on a nearby roof when the accident happened. ""It was just kids on the ground and there was teachers giving CPR. It was horrible. I've never seen nothing like that before, and I hope I never have to see something like that again."" The driver of the car that was forced into the day care center wasn't injured. He waited at the scene as workers loaded his car onto a tow truck. ""We are heartbroken that several of the children in our care and an adult were injured in an accident today,"" KinderCare said in a prepared statement. ""We are pulling for those who have been injured to quickly recover from this tragic accident."" Highway Patrol spokeswoman Sgt. Kim Monte said a telephone tip helped authorities find the missing Durango.

"(CNN) -- In 2010, the Year of the Tiger, about 3,600 of the majestic predators remain in the wild, their existence threatened by habitat-loss and poaching. If there is one man who can give hope to a species whose numbers have plummeted from 100,000 only a century ago, it would be Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Beginning Sunday, Putin and the World Bank will co-host the International Forum on Tiger Conservation, bringing together the leaders of 13 nations to discuss what could be the best and last chance to save the wild tiger. The summit will feature high level officials from every major tiger country, a first in the history of tiger conservation. Putin, the former KGB officer, has a tough political image. But in the conservation community, he is first and foremost a champion of the tiger. For him this is personal. In 2008 he received a female tiger cub as a birthday gift. Mashenka spent at least three days sleeping in a wicker basket at Putin's home before being given to a zoo. The pair met the Russian press and images of Putin with Mashenka flooded the media. In the same year, Putin ventured to Siberia's conservation area where he got between a rampaging tigress and some volunteers. After tranquilizing the animal, he helped put a tracking collar on her and she is now featured on his personal website. ""Does she see anything?"" an official asked of the tranquilized tigress. ""Yes, she does. And she'll remember you,"" Putin joked. Barney Long, the head of the WWF U.S. Tiger Program said the scale of the summit is ""almost solely down to Putin. It is he who is reaching out, turning this from technical meetings into a real political event."" ""It's not often that heads of government do get involved to this degree,"" said Sabri Zain of TRAFFIC, an organization trying to halt illegal trafficking and poaching. Putin will be joined in St. Petersburg, Russia, by the leaders of the last remaining countries where tigers exist in the wild, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam. That is less than 7 percent of their historic range. ""Russia is well placed to host the summit. They are already a leader in terms of taking steps to try and save their own species. The Siberian tiger is one of few success stories,"" Zain said. Russia's far east is now home to roughly 400 Siberian tigers, accounting for 9 percent of wild tigers in the world. And conservation experts agree, the world needs to know that Russia's conservation formula -- strict legislation targeting poaching and illegal trade in tiger parts -- can find success elsewhere. But Russia too must remain vigilant, experts say. It has recently come under fire for relaxing patrol efforts against poachers. Hunters caught with slain, endangered tiger . ""We know how to save tigers. What we don't know how to do is keep the political will and financial support going. We can get a large scale reaction when a population is at the brink, but when recovery starts the pressure comes off,"" said the WWF's Long. India, too, has had some success in recovering wild tiger populations. A recent TRAFFIC report credits India with the most seizures of illegal tiger parts in the past decade, representing up to 533 animals poached, but numbers are increasing. ""In Russia and also southwest India we have seen that with a clear focused effort there is solid evidence of tiger numbers going up,"" said Steven Sanderson, president of the Wildlife Conservation Society. But the tiger country with the richest economy, China, still fuels the market for tiger parts despite government efforts to curb the trade, experts say. In 1993 the Beijing government banned domestic trade in tiger bone. And tiger-based remedies have officially been taken out of medicine books. But devotees of traditional medicine linger, and demand has grown to include an array of tiger-based luxury products for China's elite. TRAFFIC's Zain suggests that a lack of dedication from high level officials means that China is still a prime destination for poachers trying to make a quick profit. In poorer nations like Indonesia and Myanmar, sparse resources outweigh political will, experts say. ""These countries may have the will but not the means to put the boots on the ground. Poachers drive around in SUVs with advanced satellite equipment and often police have to catch a bus,"" Zain said. Conservation officials are hoping for remedies to emerge at Putin's four-day summit. If not, experts say, the wild tiger will be extinct by the next Year of the Tiger in 2022, and that won't bode well for wildlife overall, said Long. ""If we can't rally to save the world's most iconic animal, how are we going to save the rest of the planet?""","13 nations with wild tiger populations meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia .

"(CNN) -- Conducting effective drug testing on site at the 2016 Olympic Games will be hard to implement if construction delays in Rio de Janeiro continue, the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has warned. Craig Reedie, who replaced John Fahey as WADA president in January, told CNN that repeating the stringency and efficiency of the London 2012 Games will be a real challenge. ""It's going to be difficult to replicate in Rio the system that was put in place with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and UK Anti-Doping,"" Reedie told CNN World Sport. ""(The facility and systems) worked beautifully and that's because the national anti-doping organization was very, very good. In Rio, we couldn't say that at the moment ... they don't have a laboratory. Their laboratory lost its accreditation because clearly it was inefficient."" WADA suspended testing at the Brazilian city's LADETEC laboratory last August after it failed to meet the organization's International Standard for Laboratories (ISL). The implications of that suspension have already been felt by football's world governing body FIFA which, as a result, will be transporting players' blood and urine samples to Lausanne in Switzerland during the World Cup which starts in Sao Paulo on June 12. Construction blunders and delays have blighted the buildup to football's showpiece, while concerns over Rio's Olympic facilities are mounting by the day -- a two-week strike over pay and conditions by more than 2,000 Olympic Park workers ended Thursday. Ongoing concerns have prompted the IOC to agree to increase the frequency of visits -- led by IOC Olympic Games executive director Gilbert Felli -- and establish dedicated task forces. Rio organizers announced Wednesday that Brazil will spend 24.1 billion reais ($10.8 billion) on infrastructure projects to ensure the Games are delivered on time. Earlier in the week, Rio's mayor Eduardo Paes said he looked forward to Felli's visit saying that there was ""no reason for concern"" and that the ""Olympic Park has nothing delayed."" Reedie did not write off the city's prospects of delivering first class drug-testing facilities on time, pointing to the fact that the suspended organization is currently being re-established and a new building is nearing completion. But more needs to be done, he said. ""Too often they think of the building being the important thing. Well that's only one thing,"" said the former chairman of the British Olympic Association. ""You actually need to put the proper equipment in it and then above all you need to put the proper people in it. And you then have to work up the proper standards so you can get it accredited again."" LADETEC has yet to respond to CNN's request for comment. Reedie isn't pushing the panic button just yet, but called on Brazil's lawmakers to take responsibility. ""This isn't really an organizing committee problem. This is a government problem,"" he said. ""It's up to them to develop and fund their national anti-doping organization and their laboratory. If they do that, yes it can be done. ""If they don't and it slips, it's a problem.""

"(CNN) -- If there were any doubt that the members of the Monty Python troupe wouldn't be holding back in their farewell show, it came with a rousing version of ""Every Sperm Is Sacred."" The performance of the ""Meaning of Life"" song included a whole range of props, including cannons in the shape of phalluses. And what's the point of bringing out phallus-shaped cannons if you're not going to, uh, set them off? Python has always been equal parts deadpan and silly, highbrow and low, and the ""Monty Python Live (Mostly)"" show -- which concluded Sunday at London's O2 Arena and was simulcast all over the world -- highlighted those distinctions. Among the sketches performed by the group were the Yorkshiremen, in which the four attempt to one-up each another in remembering horrible childhoods; ""Crunchy Frog,"" in which John Cleese's inspector challenges Terry Jones' confectioner over some interesting chocolate creations; and, of course, the ""Parrot Sketch,"" which was combined with the ""Cheese Shop"" sketch, allowing Cleese and Michael Palin to indulge in their fondness for synonyms and euphemisms. In that one, Cleese and Palin seemed to be having a particularly good time, stepping on each other's lines in high-spirited confusion. Cleese also got in an impromptu knock against a British newspaper editor. The ""Monty Python Live (Mostly)"" show has gotten decent reviews (mostly) during its three-week run, many praising the group for its contribution to comedy if lamenting the casualness of the live production. The final show was apparently little changed from the debut, with its many musical numbers and occasional hesitations. There were a couple special guests for the final show -- Eddie Izzard and Mike Myers -- and physicist Stephen Hawking, who joined a videotaped skit, was in the live audience. Nevertheless, if the group didn't break any new ground, then again, it didn't have to. ""It gives the crowd exactly what they want but relies pretty heavily on the fan love and makes a hefty withdrawal from the reputation bank,"" wrote The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw when the show debuted. In a not-quite-full Atlanta theater where the show was simulcast, fans cheered their favorites, anticipating the Spanish Inquisition and singing along with ""The Lumberjack Song."" There were a couple audio glitches at the beginning, but for the most part it was an enjoyable afternoon, with the show functioning more as a celebration of Python history than a demand for new material. Indeed, fans looked on the bright side of Python all over. In Calgary, Alberta, a storm knocked out the audio, but the audience simply started a singalong. As the show came to a close, two frames came up on the O2's big screen: ""Graham Chapman 1941-1989,"" in memory of the late Python member, and ""Monty Python 1969-2014."" If this is indeed the end, Python can go out knowing its legacy is secure. And that's not so completely different.","""Monty Python Live (Mostly)"" concluded Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Flying JetBlue Airways? You might have to wait until your flight crew rests up if your travel includes Boston's Logan International Airport or the three New York City-area airports. Blaming a weekend of bad winter weather and new Federal Aviation Administration rules on pilot duty times, JetBlue canceled nearly all operations from Monday afternoon into Tuesday morning at Logan, New York's John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports, and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. JetBlue, the only airline to say publicly that the new pilot rest rules contributed to its cancellation of flights during this week's winter blast, had asked regulators for a delay in implementing the changes. FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said that JetBlue last year requested an extension to the January 4, 2014, implementation deadline. JetBlue was the only airline to request an extension, she said. The FAA denied the airline's request. On Tuesday morning, JetBlue planned to ramp up operations to about 25% of its regular schedule and expected to become 100% operational by 3 p.m. ET, according to JetBlue spokesman Anders Lindstrom. Lindstrom said Tuesday that the new scheduling rules related to pilot rest time ""are a factor, not a driver, in our recovery from two winter storms and JFK infrastructure issues."" Statements from the airline on Monday suggested the pilot rules were a bigger factor in the carrier's near-halt in the Northeast. While saying JetBlue was prepared for the new rules that increase rest requirements for pilots, scheduling pilots and crews is a ""delicate"" operation under normal circumstances, spokeswoman Tamara Young wrote via e-mail. ""Delays or cancellations disrupt those handoffs placing crews or planes 'out of position' for their flights."" ""In the midst of us repairing those schedules disrupted by this week's winter storms, we're facing an additional challenge as new FAA rules went into effect for crew rest,"" she wrote. ""These rules further impact our ability to operate an already disrupted schedule, causing our pilots to 'time out' even sooner. As a result, additional cancellations are likely to occur as we work to reset the operation."" More than 400 JetBlue flights were canceled Monday, with 120 flight cancellations on Tuesday, the airline said. Nationwide, more than 4,500 flights were canceled Monday, and more than 2,300 flights have been canceled for Tuesday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.com. JetBlue said it is scheduling extra flights to address the backlog and will extend apologies and compensation offers to passengers. Passengers whose flights have been canceled should not go to the airport, the airline said. The airline has compiled its advice to stranded passengers in a blog post, with links to the fee waiver policy and rebooking page. The FAA announced the pilot changes in December 2011, and they went into effect Saturday. Pilot fatigue became a top priority for the Department of Transportation, which oversees the FAA, after the February 2009 crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 near Buffalo, New York. The new rules require a minimum 10-hour rest period for pilots before their flight duty period, which can range from nine to 14 hours, depending on the start time and the number of flight segments and time zones crossed. While other U.S. airlines are delaying and canceling thousands of flights because of severe weather patterns, no other major U.S. airline contacted by CNN has cited the new rules as a cause. An airline pilots union said the airlines had sufficient time to adjust to the new FAA work rules. ""They had two years to anticipate this (work hour rule) and to adjust accordingly,"" said Sean Cassidy, vice president of the Air Line Pilots Association. ""So I think it's overly simplistic to suggest that they could ascribe this disruption -- which happens to coincide with this major, major winter snowstorm -- and just hang it all on that rule-making change."" While the new pilot rest rules may be one of the many things that have disrupted air travel this week, ThePointsGuy.com's Brian Kelly said the airlines are looking to blame others for not hiring enough pilots to withstand disruptions to their schedules. ""The rules are necessary for passenger safety, (and) the airlines have had years to prepare,"" he said. At the end of the day, ""the airlines really can't withstand irregular events like these,"" Kelly said. ""They have really bad emergency management plans in place.""

"(CNN) -- Italy striker Mario Balotelli has condemned racist abuse from his country's own supporters during Wednesday night's international friendly against Romania in Austria. The 20-year-old, who was born in Brescia but has Ghanaian parents, was targeted by a small group of people who raised banners with slogans including ""No to a multi-ethnic national team,"" the Reuters website reported. Balotelli, who is in his first season at English club Manchester City, played for an hour of the 1-1 draw in Klagenfurt before being substituted. ""Honestly, I don't know what to say. If I have to hear those chants every time, you can't go forward like that,"" he told Italian television channel Mediaset. ""I am happy to be in the national team. It wouldn't be right to stop a game because a few fans that turn up to the stadium behave like that. ""We need to change these people, but it's not me that has to do it. Where I live, the people don't reason like these people. A multi-ethnic Italy already exists and we can do better."" Balotelli said he had tried to ignore the insults while on the pitch. ""I've learnt that it's better to pretend that nothing is happening. Thankfully I don't know the people who insult me -- what hurts more are the insults of those who know and love you,"" he said in quotes carried by AFP. ""This time I was good, that way no-one can accuse me of having provoked them, so you can be the judges -- but I will stay angry and bitter."" Italy coach Cesar Prandelli backed the player to shrug off the abuse, having experienced it since he began his career in Serie A with Inter Milan. ""I feel disappointment and anger. We always hear these chants and something has to be done about it,"" he told reporters after the match. ""We feel helpless. He has the support of everyone. His performance was optimum. He has done really well. It's a pity in the first half we didn't have much depth."" Italian Football Federation president Giancarlo Abete added: ""This is something that must be condemned. This is unacceptable behavior."" Meanwhile, Balotelli denied reports claiming that he was set for an early return to Italy to play with Inter's arch-rivals AC Milan despite being seen having dinner with the club's vice-president Adriano Galliani on Sunday. ""The likelihood is that I will be at City up to June. I have a five-year contract and I can't say anything,"" he told Mediaset. ""It's true that I had supper with Galliani after the [Milan] derby.

Wozniacki told reporters: ""I tried my best, but my body didn't want to do the things I asked it today. What I told my brain didn't go to my body. ""It's just unfortunate that my body has been feeling tired. To get sick now is not the best time if you want to beat the top players."" Czech Kvitova faces Agnieszka Radwanska on Friday -- a match that will determine who grabs the second qualification spot in the red group.

And yet you'd happily sit there all night, for many nights to come, for the chance to see nature's most mysterious sight: the northern lights. Lonely Planet: The world's hottest cool places . With little light pollution, optimum weather conditions (very cold, with plenty of clear nights) and its position directly beneath the prime-viewing zone of the auroral oval, Churchill in Canada is one of the best places in the world to see the northern lights. The Arctic tundra and boreal forest surrounding the town see over 300 nights of auroral activity each year. Displays might last hours, or be gone in a minute. Flashing neon pink, turquoise and green, the lights swirl across the sky in myriad imagined shapes (is that a walrus, a witch, a whale?) before whipping back on themselves and disappearing. In the presence of such a spectacle, it's easy to believe local Inuit myth that the aurora borealis are signals from the afterlife, particularly if you hear the sky crackle and swoosh as some claim. What is in no doubt during those moments when the lights whirl above your head is that you're part of the greatest show on earth. 2. Icebound St Petersburg . January in St Petersburg. The city's residents, long used to the cold, don fur hats and heavy coats to stand in line. Nowadays, they wait not for bread, but for art: frozen art. Every winter, sculptors transform blocks of ice into elaborate models of people, animals and objects. It's a tradition that dates back to 1740, when an entire ice palace was constructed to celebrate the birthday of the Empress Anna. Set against a backdrop of golden domes sparkling in the light of the low sun, the exhibit embodies the magic of St Petersburg in winter. Locals bypass the city's bridges, slithering over the ice-covered rivers and canals to make their way across town. The Neva River is frozen solid, except for one large hole in front of the Peter Paul Fortress. This is the plunge pool for the Walrus Club, a group of swimmers who exhort the health benefits of a daily dip. When the cold finally seeps in, Petersburgers warm up with a vodka, served in an ice glass, from the ice bar. ""At least we can do something with all this ice other than slipping and falling on it!"" observes one happy patron. 3. Sweden's reindeer migration . One of the world's greatest migrations takes place each year just over a thousand miles north of Britain. As snow thickens on every surface, lakes freeze over and the temperature drops below -25ËšC, tens of thousands of reindeer make their way across northern Sweden. Descending from summer pastures in the mountains to the west, the herds travel east to spend the long winter foraging in the forests. Accompanying them on a journey that can take ten days or more are their seminomadic Sami owners. While herding methods may have modernized over the centuries (snowmobiles -- and even helicopters -- have replaced snowshoes), reindeer husbandry is still a cornerstone of their culture. To fall in with the Sami and their herds is to be part of a heritage that stretches back millennia -- one of days dictated by the pace of the reindeers' steady trot, and of nights sharing stories round the fire under a chill, star-filled sky. Lonely Planet: The UK's favorite winter pubs . 4. Italy's sunken bell . Head to Italy's South Tyrol this winter and you're likely to come across one of Europe's most bizarre sights -- an apparently amputated church spire poking out from the frozen waters of Lago di Resia. The 14th-century bell tower, pointing like an arrow to the blustery skies above, is a forlorn monument to an entire village drowned beneath the waters of an artificial lake created as part of a hydroelectricity project in the 1950s. Locals will tell you that the tolling of its church bell can still be heard on a cold night -- even though the bell was removed when the valley was flooded. Tall tales may have sprung up around it, but the church and the lake are very much part of local life, particularly in winter. Snow-kiters twirl across the ice, leaping high into the air as their kites catch a gust of wind, keeping an eye out for ice-skaters gliding around the lake's perimeter. Families slip and slide their way to the base of the tower, eager to slap their gloved hands on a piece of history that's out of reach most of the year. 5. Yellowstone's boiling waters . There are few places as beguiling as Yellowstone National Park. It is a landscape created by grinding glaciers and volcanic eruptions, a place of fire and brimstone where the very earth breathes, belches and bubbles like a giant kettle on the boil. Here, in a land roamed by moose, bears and wolves, geysers and hot springs seethe and simmer and finally blow, capturing the imagination as they have done since the park's inception in 1872. It is America made wild and primeval. As the temperature drops and the snow piles high, the park takes on a special drama and grace. The tourist crowds thin, replaced by cross-country skiers silently swooshing along marked trails. Shaggy-coated bison pick their way through the deep snow to warm themselves in geyser basins, waiting for a waft of hot stream from shimmering thermal pools. They retreat a few paces as a hot spring suddenly erupts, sending an arc of boiling water high into the frigid air. 6. Korea's ice festivals . For much of the year, the sancheoneo -- a species of trout -- leads a blameless life in the rivers around Hwacheon, a town that lies in the mountains northeast of Seoul. When the cold, dry Korean winter arrives, the rivers freeze over and the sancheoneo disappear under 40cm of ice. And then the trouble starts. Every January, the Hwacheon Sancheoneo Ice Festival brings a sudden energy to this quiet corner of the country. Hundreds of thousands of thickly clad visitors swarm over every frozen surface to try their hand at ice-fishing. Barbecues come as naturally to Koreans as baguettes to the French, and the smell of charcoal fires wafts along the banks, ready for the latest catch. For a few visitors, dropping a line through a hole in the ice to catch their fish is just not enough of an experience. Dressed in T-shirts and shorts, they plunge into a pool of near freezing water and learn just what slippery customers trout can be. 7. Snowbound London . Ten o'clock on a Monday morning in central London. No buses steam down Piccadilly, belching passengers at every stop. There are no crowds jostling for space on the pavements of Oxford Street and the doors of its department stores remain locked. The tubes stand empty in their tunnels, planes are grounded at Heathrow. The few people who've made it into work in the City turn back when they find their offices closed. This is not the scene from an apocalyptic Day of the Triffids-style film, but the reality of life in the capital on the rare occasion it lies under a thick blanket of snow. The streets empty and all activity migrates to the parks. On Hampstead Heath, a running club has given up shuffling through the snow and is rolling a giant snowball down to the banks of the pond. In Richmond Park, the resident deer paw at the frozen earth, looking for twigs and shrubs. Far to the east in Greenwich, a borough's worth of schoolchildren celebrate their unexpected day off by tobogganing down from the Royal Observatory, the distant skyscrapers of Canary Wharf barely visible through the grey murk. Back in the center, snow falls steadily on a deserted London, bestowing on anyone who ventures onto its streets the unimaginable magic of having a city all to themselves.

"(CNN) -- Lily Warren was just 8 years old when she decided to start her own business with her younger sisters. The girls had already visited a marketplace for young business owners and opened their own bank accounts at the Young Americans Bank in Denver, which touts itself as the world's only bank designed for kids. ""There were tons of young entrepreneurs selling what they made. It was a really cool place,"" said Lily, now 13. When their parents started beekeeping at their home in Littleton, Colorado, the girls found the inspiration they really needed. While they weren't able to harvest enough honey to sell, the sisters noticed that their parents always collected a significant amount of beeswax. Instead of throwing it away, they thought they could find a way to use it. The girls researched what could be made at home with beeswax. By 2009, Lily, Chloe and Sophie were in business as the Sweet Bee Sisters, making lip balm in flavors like strawberry and root beer, and lotion bars in lavender and bamboo. They sell their products at local stores and, for the last three years, at their own stall at the entrepreneurs' marketplace that inspired them. In 2013, the Warren sisters were named finalists in a young entrepreneurs competition and were awarded $250 and mentoring from a business leader. ""Their ability to speak confidently with customers, to make decisions collectively, to work hard for something they want and to designate and fulfill responsibilities has [all] been enhanced through their business experience,"" said Lisa Warren, the Sweet Bee Sisters' mom. Around the country, children -- some of them barely old enough to read -- are turning their big, creative ideas into money-making businesses. And their parents, schools and business leaders are cheering them on. 'It's never too early' Business consultants and serial entrepreneurs say that it's never too early to teach kids the benefits of sound money management and smart business practices. Some business leaders around the country started businesses as kids, including Honest Tea's CEO Seth Goldman, who sold golf balls he dug up from the course near his home, while Vosges Haut-Chocolat's CEO Katrina Markoff, who has said she offered Easy-Bake Oven treats to customers. ""Entrepreneurship comes with the emotional ups and downs,"" said Adam Toren, who co-authored the ""Kidpreneurs"" books with his brother, Matthew. ""Learning how to overcome obstacles at a young age definitely played a huge role in becoming who we are today."" Today, the Toren brothers are serial entrepreneurs who founded Youngentrepreneur.com. Toren said they like to pay it forward by providing businesses with tips and ideas they've picked up over the years. ""Sharpening a child's entrepreneurial skills will equip them with the skills necessary to tackle a limitless future,"" Toren said. That doesn't mean all young entrepreneurs focus their time on business instead of school. Learning entrepreneurial skills can also put young people on the path to more learning. A study of students involved in the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship, a program that teaches business skills to low-income youth, showed just that. Students involved in the program had a 32% increase in interest in attending college, while students who did not participate saw a 17% decrease, according to a Harvard Graduate School of Education study from 2002 to 2004. The study also found an increase in leadership behaviors among students who participated. Christine Poorman, executive director of the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship in Chicago, believes the numbers would be higher today -- a recent alumni survey of 300 students found that 90% were in college. She often sees students who completed the program using money made from their businesses to pay for college. While young entrepreneurship can lead to college and careers, some young people see it as a way to find their owns voices. Nine-year-old Leila Kaufman of New York City didn't like that adults were reviewing technology toys for kids. With the help of her dad, Michael, she created a website called RethinkToys. Together, they produce videos of Leila reviewing the latest tech toys for kids. The project launched a business and helped her create a place to voice her opinion. ""If it's a kid's toy, shouldn't kids be rating it?"" Leila asked. Michael helps Leila make contacts with companies and attend product launches she wouldn't normally be able to access. She's been to media events for video games and sat in on closed-door meetings with a company that created a popular game she reviewed, Kaufman said. Plans to expand and monetize RethinkToys are in the future, but for now, Leila's parents are happy that she's learning to give her opinion honestly, confidently and articulately. ""At all these events, she was the only kid there and just blew everyone in the media away,"" he said. Kid entrepreneurs also have powerful lessons to learn about balance. Leila's mom, Tammy Kaufman, said they have to remind their daughter that she's a kid, and she has other priorities beyond her website. ""I think it's difficult for her to be an entrepreneur at this age,"" Tammy Kaufman said. ""There are a lot of things her parents and her teachers make her do."" 'I teach my kids to fail spectacularly' Canada-based business mentor Cameron Herold, who started his first company at 21, says parents and teachers could do a better job of nurturing ""entrepreneurial traits"" in children. His father raised him to be an entrepreneur when he saw that Herold wasn't likely to be a model student or employee. Herold had little interest in school, where he struggled to pay attention and believed the school system was trying to mold him into something he wasn't. Herold says more schools are trying to build students' confidence in areas that match their interests and abilities, rather than focusing entirely on improving areas where they struggle. ""Let your weaknesses be your weaknesses,"" he said. ""Let's teach kids according to their abilities."" After all, not every child-led business is a precocious success. Michigan high school English teacher Nicholas Provenzano launched ""20 Time"" in his classroom this fall -- a program that gives students an opportunity to explore topics that interest them -- and asked his students to keep blogs that document their progress. The students received only one hour of class time per week for the projects, but most invested time outside the classroom, Provenzano said. Provenzano said the project helps students to lead their own learning and understand how to recover from failure -- one of the core lessons of entrepreneurship. His students' projects ranged from training to run a marathon to knitting hats for newborns to developing a mobile game app to designing and selling clothes. The main thing Provenzano wanted his students to get from this project ""is that failure is a part of life."" In the real world, he wants his students to be able to take risks, he said. ""I teach my kids to fail spectacularly and grow from that experience,"" he said. ""To be effective problem solvers and critical thinkers, failure has to be an accepted part of the process and not something that should stop people from trying."" Emily Fleming, one of Provenzano's students, set out to design a clothing line and set up an Etsy shop to sell it. When she struggled to complete her project, she wrote about the realization that fear of failure and the potential embarrassment often keeps her from pursuing new ideas. ""I had this amazing opportunity to create and explore and I didn't take full advantage because of an irrational fear of failure and embarrassment,"" she wrote on her project blog. ""I want to be able to go out for my presentation and say that I conquered this irrational fear, and created something without a worry that someone wouldn't like it as much as I do. 'Twenty time' is changing for me and I am ready and excited to take this as far as I can."" 'She can be the creator of her destiny' In success or in failure, entrepreneurship can be a powerful early lesson in money management. Rich Martinez, CEO of the Young Americans Center in Denver, says that kids not only need to be motivated to be entrepreneurs, but they also need an environment that will foster the kind of risk-taking that's required. ""Kids are motivated by money, but adults don't give them a chance to make it. We just give it to them,"" he said. That's not the best way for kids to learn how the rest of the world works, he said. ""Somehow we've created a society that isn't OK with failure, that isn't OK with taking risks,"" he said. Seven-year-old Scout Kingsley and her mom, Ashley, started their Happy Wear girls' accessories line one night when they were making necklaces out of colorful paperclips. ""Scout is definitely the artistic director, telling me what looks good and what will sell,"" Ashley Kingsley said. ""I've never crafted before in my life. I had no way to really help her."" Since Happy Wear launched in November, the company has profited more than $1,500 in Etsy sales and marketplace events, Kingsley says. Scout has also participated in the Denver young entrepreneurs marketplace. ""I know Scout loves to make money and we opened a bank account for her. She loves watching her bank account grow,"" she said. They have plans for more markets and would love to see some of the pieces get picked up on a national scale. Scout said her love of dressing up and accessories makes running Happy Wear feel fun. Apart from production, Scout has learned a lot about marketing and packaging, she said. ""I get better every time people order something,"" Scout said. Ashley Kingsley considers Happy Wear to be a learning experience for Scout; it teachers her that there's more than one way to acquire knowledge. ""She's a kid, but she is, I believe, heads and shoulders above the kids her age,"" Ashley Kingsley said. ""I hope this opens up her mind so she knows she can be the creator of her destiny.""

"(CNN) -- ""We are reaching the tipping point and the tipping point according to most scientists will be in less than 10 years. We don't have much time,"" says human rights and environmental campaigner, Bianca Jagger. At the Rio+20 Earth Summit, the former actress and model is hoping to speed up climate action by supporting ""Plant a Pledge,"" a campaign to promote the Bonn Challenge -- a global initiative to restore 150 million hectares (an area almost three times the size of France) of degraded land by 2020. ""It's a project that will bring concrete and tangible change to people, to the environment and to the economy and will make a difference to the way we are tackling the issue of climate change,"" says Jagger. The Bonn Challenge was launched in September last year with the aim of helping achieve the goals of the United Nations REDD+ program and Target 15 (there are 20 in total) of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which was signed by 150 governments at the first Rio Earth Summit in 1992. Organized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in association with European aerospace company, Airbus, ""Plant a Pledge"" is urging governments, businesses and environmental experts to help create what is being billed as the world's biggest restoration project. ""Just think about transforming a landscape that is barren to a landscape where you will be able to make the land fertile, where it can be sustainable, where agriculture can come back, where people can benefit,"" she said. If fully implemented, the Bonn Challenge could inject more than $80 billion into local and global economies, according to the IUCN. It could also cut the emission reductions gap by up to 17%, the IUCN says. Scientists estimate that carbon dioxide emissions need to be restricted to 44 gigatons annually by 2020 to prevent global temperatures rising above two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) during the 21st century. Current predictions suggest that limit will be exceeded by nine gigatons, according to the U.N. Jagger and the IUCN's efforts were rewarded at the Rio+20 this week with commitments from the U.S. government, Rwanda, Brazil and indigenous groups from Mesoamerica to restore more than 18 million hectares of forest. The U.S. will restore the lion's share of that number, pledging to re-plant 15 million hectares of land. ""Many governments are already convinced this will bring financial benefits for their country and they know we will be tackling the issue of food security, we will be improving water sources,"" Jagger said. ""At the same time, I see a lot of governments don't seem to fully understand the threat of climate change and they use the excuse we are living through an economic crisis or a difficult time to not do what is necessary,"" she said. ""We need to do it now, or we will all either live and survive together or we will all perish together. I don't think I am being alarmist. We need to make a difference and we as individuals can make that difference."" A veteran of the first Earth Summit, Jagger watched the Kyoto Protocol being born, but she fears for its future. The agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions adopted in 1997 is due to expire in December with ""no promises in sight,"" she says. ""There is so much we still need to do. Climate change is a reality and we are not doing enough for our planet, for our children, for future generations,"" she said. ""I wish there were more legally binding treaties that are for signature, especially as we go to Rio, but perhaps something will come out that is positive, I hope.""","Environmental campaigner Bianca Jagger throws weight behind initiative to restore barren land to life .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Coast Guard's search for four British sailors missing in the Atlantic Ocean since late last week resumed Tuesday morning, the service said. The Coast Guard, in a statement, said the new search involved six ships and three planes, including a Canadian C-130. The search focused on an area 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The 39-foot (12 meters) Cheeki Rafiki was sailing from the Caribbean to the United Kingdom last Thursday when it began taking on water, according to the yacht's managing agent. ""Unfortunately, we lost contact during the early hours of Friday morning, and we believe the crew abandoned to the life raft,"" Doug Innes said in a statement on Sunday. The Royal Yachting Association identified the missing yachtsmen as skipper Andrew Bridge, 21; Steve Warren, 52; Paul Goslin, 56; and James Male, 23. The Coast Guard's Boston-based 1st District coordinated a multinational search of more than 4,100 square miles for the crew. The Coast Guard said that a merchant vessel Saturday located an overturned hull that matched the description of the Cheeki Rafiki, but there was no sign of the sailors. Innes describes the Cheeki Rafiki on his company's website as ""a performance racer/cruiser and suitable for both the inshore and offshore circuit"" and that she is ""equipped for trans-Atlantic sailing and racing.""

"(CNN) -- Cold water and nude beaches don't necessarily mix well. Add to the equation a very conservative society and the idea of a nude beach seems rather ambitious, if not impossible. In a surprisingly creative tourism push, officials in north east Gangwon Province are aiming to set up South Korea's first nude beach, with the first clothes to be shed in 2017. It's an effort to boost tourism to the peninsula's east coast beaches, which lose out every year to the west coast in luring summer visitors from the capital Seoul. Although the east coast has more beautiful, sandy beaches, the water tends to be colder, the season shorter and the distance from Seoul is greater than the beaches to the west. The massively popular annual mud festival is also held on the west coast. Skinny dip-friendly . ""This is part of our plans to create beaches with specific purpose, like a beach for families, a beach for couples, a beach for pets, and yes, a nude beach,"" said an official from the municipality's Pan-East Sea Division at a seminar on Tuesday, according to the Korea Times. Calls by CNN to officials were not answered on Thursday. Somewhat surprisingly, this is not the first time the subject has been broached by government officials. And in the past it's the public that's shuttered the idea. Gangwon Province tried to launch a female-only nude beach in 2005, while Gangneung City also deliberated, but ultimately scrapped, a nude beach idea due to public outcry. The same happened to a Jeju Island proposal in 2009. Which beach? Officials have not yet decided which beach may be the first to go nude. They are also deliberating over a trial operation for foreigners only. The premise is foreigners will be much more comfortable with the concept than locals. ""Koreans actually love nude beaches when they're traveling abroad, but the problem with having one within Korea is the fact that Korean society is so interconnected,"" Seoul-based travel reporter Chun Kyoung-woo told CNN. ""They won't be able to comfortably go to a nude beach due to the thought that people they know will find out about it quite easily."" That threat is reinforced given the country's has second-highest smartphone penetration rate in the world (73%, just behind United Arab Emirates' 73.8%) and a staggering 82.7% Internet penetration rate. Early reaction to the concept was skeptical. Twitter user @amudoan: ""Doubtful that people will actually go. And even if they do, it'll be 99.99% guys."" @KR_Nanoha tweeted ""why don't they just call it a men's sauna?""

"(CNN) -- With the election getting nearer, Hollywood's few, proudly open conservatives have been heating up the rhetoric. Some have been quietly campaigning in a way that dodges the headlines. Vince Vaughn, for example, endorsed Ron Paul early in the campaign, an act as refreshing as it is sadly redundant. But most of the news reports have been dominated by the antediluvian antics of some pretty aged (and by now probably unemployable) actors. Chuck Norris lambasted the president for trying to get gays into the scouts and Ted Nugent says history might have turned out better if the South had won the Civil War. Jon Voight rushed to the defense of Brad Pitt's mom after she sent a letter to her local newspaper calling Obama, ""a liberal who supports the killing of unborn babies and same-sex marriage."" The modern Republican celebrity ideal, it seems, is all man. He could be a retired action movie star, likely to wear a cowboy hat, almost certainly smokes cigars and typically inhabits a political position to the tea party's right. There's nothing necessarily wrong with any of things, except that the public pronouncements from these modern representatives less suggest someone who happens to be a big fan of Edmund Burke than someone who is undergoing the male menopause. When the Iraq War started in 2003, Bruce Willis actually called the White House and volunteered. He was surprised when an aide told him, ""Sorry, Bruce, you're too old to enlist."" Today's Hollywood Republicanism might come from outside the mainstream of the movie industry, but it wasn't always this way. During the 1944 presidential election, Cecil B DeMille threw a gala for Republican candidate Thomas Dewey that featured elephants, bands and A-list stars like Ginger Rogers, Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck. When McCarthyism hit Hollywood in the 1950s, the industry became more pronouncedly conservative. Actor George Murphy was elected as a Republican senator from California in 1964, and Ronald Reagan entered the governor's mansion in 1966. Richard Nixon, elected in 1968, had movie tastes emblematic of Golden Age conservatism: According to historian Mark Feeney, he publicly denounced cussing in films and walked out of ""West Side Story"" halfway through because he thought it was anti-American. When he threw a re-election booster for his Hollywood backers in 1972, one guest described it as ""a cocktail party at the Hollywood Wax Museum."" The invitation list might not have changed much from 1944, but it was still impressive: Frank Sinatra, Charlton Heston, Glen Campbell, Clint Eastwood, Jack Benny, Jimmy Durante, George Hamilton and Sammy Davis Jr. Most of these people were former Democrats and the dress code was formal, not Chuck Norris denim. The president told his staff that they should offer ""the very best brands of scotch and bourbon, not the ordinary stuff we've used in the past."" This was one of the last occasions when a Republican Hollywood crowd was used to communicate sophistication rather than rebelliousness; Nixon was trying to cement an image as godfather of the nation. But the president also understood that as liberalism became more fashionable among the young, so conservatism was gaining momentum as a counter-cultural force of its own. That's why Nixon invited Clint Eastwood (aka The Man With No Name) to be a delegate at that year's Republican convention, while the movie introducing the president was narrated by John Wayne. Nixon was the first Republican president to tap into the electoral appeal of the cowboy star as the faded mascot of the silent majority, the gentleman of the rugged West who got by fine without welfare and who shot bad guys when he had to. It had a commercial appeal, too. That's why in the 1970s, while Hollywood as an institution culturally drifted to the left, the movie industry also churned out movies that played upon suburban paranoia about crime, like ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Death Wish."" In short, an actor isn't just an actor, but a brand carefully built and marketed to sell movies. Those brands can be found on both the left and right. In contemporary Hollywood, Sean Penn has taken the archetype of an angry man burdened by liberal compassion to extremes, launching a tirade at Cannes against ""the whole ... world"" for abandoning Haiti. Likewise, Alec Baldwin's perpetual threat to run for mayor of New York or Betty White's reinvention as a gay icon demonstrates that political branding can give actors an appeal beyond TV and movies. Branding isn't a straightjacket for some, however. When Clint Eastwood made ""Gran Torino"" in 2008, some critics took it to be a classic example of the ""red state movie."" It was full of messages about family, crime and self-reliance. But when Eastwood made the ""Halftime in America"" ad for the 2012 Super Bowl, some Republicans complained his tight-lipped, rugged style was being used to promote Obama's policies. On the whole, Hollywood conservatism has adapted to suit the culture warrior style of the tea party. First comes the market, then comes the brand. Hence, if celebrity Republicans seem outrageously reactionary, it's an indicator of where the GOP and its base have moved and what it looks for in its screen idols. The party of Thomas Dewey or Richard Nixon, men who basically spoke for the social establishments of their day, has now become something more populist and more rooted in working-class anger. Sometimes, the men and women who are the advertisements for that brand can become consumed by the image and evolve into a pastiche of it. Is there not something slightly absurd about the vain, aged machismo of The Expendibles 2, a movie about violent septuagenarian mercenaries? Most of the Republican stars look like they couldn't withstand a vigorous game of bridge at the Del Boca Vista retirement home. The interesting question is how easily the anti-establishment antics of Chuck Norris or Ted Nugent sit with the preppy elitism of Mitt Romney, which is aimed more at the independent voter market. The answer is that they don't, and that's just one more problem that Mitt has to overcome in November. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Tim Stanley: Conservative celeb ideal today is manly-man action hero, right of tea party .

"(Mental Floss) -- All a summer camp used to need to keep kids entertained throughout the warmer months was a good ball field and a place to go swimming. Now, though, campers can while away their summer days doing all sorts of specialized camping. Let's take a look at some camps that appeal to kids with very specific interests. 1. Wizards and Warriors Camp . Finally, there's a solution for kids who don't want to leave their role-playing games for a week at camp: a camp that is one big RPG. At Charlton, Massachusetts' Wizards and Warriors Camp, campers create their own characters and then spend their days fighting together against villains and searching for treasure. The camp sounds like it integrates educational elements into the fun -- a potions-making class provides real-world lessons on chemistry -- all while giving children a valuable opportunity to mingle with trolls. Mental Floss: 5 alternative World Cup tournaments . 2. Nudist Camp . Since the early 1990s, the American Association for Nude Recreation has offered summer Youth Leadership Camps at various resorts around the country in order to let young people ages 11 to 18 enjoy some nude summer camp fun. While the notion of a camp full of naked teenagers may strike non-nudists as a bit strange (or completely appalling), a 2003 New York Times profile detailed how the camps were perfectly legal because the nudity wasn't of a lewd nature. (The camps go to great lengths to desexualize the nudity in an effort to combat the teens' surging hormones.) The result: camps where teens go to enjoy mundane activities like sports and arts and crafts, all while in the buff. The clothes-free policy certainly must make packing for camp easier. 3. Hollywood Stunt Camp . California's Pali Overnight Adventures offers a number of camps for the show-biz hopeful, but their Hollywood Stunt Camp sounds like it would be particularly fun. Campers spend either one of two weeks working with real Hollywood stuntmen on topics like taking a high fall, simulating hand-to-hand combat, and sword fighting. (Seems like a good idea.

"(CNN) -- It looked like it was going to be all Amy Winehouse -- until the end. Herbie Hancock also won best contemporary jazz album for ""River: The Joni Letters."" Winehouse, the troubled singer and songwriter who was let out of rehab to perform via satellite at the 50th annual Grammy Awards Sunday night, took home awards in five of the six categories in which she was nominated, including three of the big four general categories: record of the year, song of the year (both for ""Rehab"") and best new artist. But when it came time for the final announcement, album of the year, the award went to 67-year-old jazz legend Herbie Hancock for ""River: The Joni Letters,"" his album of Joni Mitchell interpretations. The decision appeared to shock many, though Hancock wasn't caught off-stride.  Watch the night's highlights » . In his acceptance, the pianist, who had earlier co-performed George Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue,"" paid tribute to a number of his predecessors, most notably mentor Miles Davis. ""I'd like to thank the Academy for courageously breaking the mold this time, in doing so, honoring the giants upon whose shoulders I stand, some of whom like Miles Davis, John Coltrane ... unquestionably deserved the award in the past,"" Hancock said. ""But this is a new day, that proves that the impossible can be made possible."" ""River"" is the first jazz album to win album of the year since Stan Getz and Joao Gilberto's 1964 ""Getz/Gilberto"" pulled off the trick. The two works are the only jazz albums to have done so. Still, Winehouse can consider it a good night. Besides her Grammys, the singer performed a biting medley of ""You Know I'm No Good"" and ""Rehab"" via satellite and seemed genuinely thrilled for the honors she received.  Gallery: Check out the stars in their finery » . Upon winning record of the year, just after her performance, she appeared unaware the cameras were on her as she and her band whooped it up after winning record of the year. But she recovered, giving a rousing thank-you speech in which she said the award was for ""my mom and dad, for my Blake, my Blake incarcerated, and for London!"" ""Blake"" is her husband Blake Fielder-Civil, currently behind bars awaiting trial on assault and trial-fixing charges. Kanye West, who received eight nominations total, won best rap album for his ""Graduation,"" giving him four wins. West gave a powerful performance of ""Stronger"" and ""Hey Mama."" The latter song, in particular, was written for his mother and appeared on West's 2005 album ""Late Registration."" Donda West died November 10 of a heart attack after surgery. ""I appreciate all the support, I appreciate all the prayers,"" he said regarding his mother while accepting the best rap album award. Then, addressing his mother, he said, ""I know you want me to be the No. 1 artist in the world. And, Mama, all I'm gonna do is keep making you proud."" Vince Gill's ""These Days"" won best country album, an award presented to him by Ringo Starr. ""I just had an award given to me by a Beatle,"" Gill said with wonder, and then looked at West -- who's often been vocal at a perceived lack of mainstream industry acceptance -- in the audience. ""Have you had that happen yet, Kanye?"" West smiled as the audience burst into laughter. The Foo Fighters' ""Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace"" won best rock album. ""This doesn't get old,"" frontman Dave Grohl said, dedicating the Grammy to his daughter Violet, who ""inspired me to write this record."" The first award of the night, female R&B performance, went to Alicia Keys, who also opened the show with a ""duet"" with a virtual Frank Sinatra, captured on video in an old performance. The pair sang ""Learnin' the Blues."" ""I hope to one day be as classic as he [is],"" she told CNN on the red carpet.  Watch Keys describe her Grammy thrills » . The night's performances ranged from stirring -- West's ""Stronger""/""Hey Mama,"" a duet featuring Josh Groban and Andrea Bocelli, and a John Fogerty-Jerry Lee Lewis-Little Richard medley of classics were highlights -- to offbeat, including a Beatles tribute from Cirque du Soleil and the film, ""Across the Universe,"" and a lighthearted duet of ""That Old Black Magic"" between Keely Smith and Kid Rock. The evening's other winners included Bruce Springsteen, who received three Grammys, including best rock song for ""Radio Nowhere,"" as well as the White Stripes, Justin Timberlake and Mary J. Blige. Also earning a Grammy was Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, who defeated two presidents -- Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter -- to take home the award for best spoken-word album. Obama won for his book, ""The Audacity Of Hope: Thoughts On Reclaiming The American Dream."" For Hancock, the Grammy fulfills a dream of his own.

"(CNN) -- The question has dipped in and out of the national conversation for decades: What should the United States do about marijuana? Everyone has heard the arguments in the legalization debate about health and social problems, potential tax revenue, public safety concerns and alleviating an overburdened prison system -- but there isn't much new to say. The nation has moved from the abstract matter of ""if"" to the more tangible debate over ""how,"" said Beau Kilmer, co-director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center and co-author of ""Marijuana Legalization: What Everyone Needs to Know."" Changing attitudes about weed are part of a larger shift in the country's collective thoughts on federal drug policy. Just this week, on the heels of CNN's Sanjay Gupta reversal of his stance on medical marijuana, Attorney General Eric Holder announced an initiative to curb mandatory minimum drug sentences and a federal judge called New York City's stop-and-frisk policy unconstitutional. ""Between Attorney General Holder's announcement, the decision made on stop-and-frisk and Dr. Gupta coming out with his documentary, it was a big week for drug policy,"" Kilmer said. Peruse the Marijuana Majority website and you'll see decrying pot prohibition is no longer confined to the convictions of Cheech and Chong. Today's debate involves an unlikely alliance that unites conservatives Pat Robertson and Sarah Palin with rapper Snoop Lion (aka Snoop Dogg), blogger Arianna Huffington and Jon Stewart of ""The Daily Show."" In June, the U.S. Conference of Mayors cited organized crime, a national change in attitude, the efficacy of medical marijuana and exorbitant costs to local governments in its resolution supporting ""states setting their own marijuana policies,"" a stance similar to the one endorsed by the National Lawyers Guild and the Red Cross. ""I'm surprised by the long-term increase in support for marijuana legalization in the last six or seven years. It's unprecedented. It doesn't look like a blip,"" said Peter Reuter, a University of Maryland public policy professor with 30 years experience researching drug policy. Reuter, who co-wrote the book ""Cannabis Policy: Moving Beyond Stalemate,"" said he believes two factors are spurring the shift in national opinion: Medical marijuana has reduced the stigma associated with the drug, making it ""less devilish,"" and the number of Americans who have tried the drug continues to rise. Resistance fading . When Washington and Colorado legalized pot -- with strict controls by established state agencies and a coherent tax structure -- opponents weren't able to raise the money to fight the initiatives, which Reuter considers an ""important signal that the country is no longer willing to fight this battle."" As important as the lack of resistance, Reuter said, is the subsequent response. Though he doesn't see federal legalization on the horizon, he noted that the White House could easily shut Washington and Colorado down, either via a Justice Department crackdown or an IRS prohibition on tax deductions for the purchase of marijuana, which Reuter said would be a ""killer for the industry."" Instead, this week saw Holder make his mandatory minimum announcement without so much as a word about what's happening in the states. Likewise, Congress has been reticent, Reuter said. ""It may be that everyone's waiting to see what happens,"" he said. ""I take their silence to be some form of assent."" In 1969, a Gallup poll showed 12% of Americans supported pot legalization, and it estimated that same year that four in 100 Americans had taken a toke. Last week, Gallup reported that number had spiked to almost four in 10. Gallup, Pew and CNN/Opinion Research Corp. polls conducted in the past three years indicate a nation evenly divided, and Gupta's documentary plants him among a loud chorus that has sung the drug's praises since California approved medical marijuana in 1996. Since then, 20 other states and the District of Columbia have passed similar laws, while Colorado and Washington state have legalized it for recreational use -- a move Alaska, California, Nevada and Oregon each twice rejected between 1972 and 2010, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Sixteen states have decriminalized possession of personal amounts of marijuana since 1973, including Colorado, which approved decriminalization 37 years before voters legalized cannabis in 2012, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. Mark Kleiman, a UCLA public policy professor who has been tapped to mold Washington's legal pot industry, noted that even in states where recent ballot initiatives were shot down, there are telling results. Perennial red state Arkansas' medical marijuana vote in November, for example, was a squeaker, failing 51% to 49%. ""When 49% of voters in Arkansas are voting for legal pot, we aren't in Kansas anymore,"" said Kleiman, who co-wrote ""Marijuana Legalization"" with Kilmer. A savvier debate . The tone of the debate is also a sign that the country is nearing a tipping point at which public opinion effects political change. Rather than engaging in a simple yes-vs.-no debate about legalization, proponents are asking more nuanced questions: Should ""grows"" be large or small? What should the tax structure look like? Should potency be limited? Will the model involve for-profit companies? How will weed be distributed? ""The discussion over time -- and I think it's for the better -- the discussion is starting to focus more on the details,"" Kilmer said. ""Before, nobody has ever really had to confront those decisions. ... Those decisions are really going to shape the cost and benefits of policy change."" President Barack Obama's drug czar, Gil Kerlikowske, said in 2010 that marijuana legalization was a ""nonstarter,"" an assertion the Office of National Drug Control Policy says holds true today. The office emphasizes that the administration's 2013 drug policy takes a new tack with the realization that America can't arrest its way out of its longtime drug epidemic. The White House policy, announced in April, favors prevention over incarceration, science over dogma and diversion for nonviolent offenders, the office says. Arguments for marijuana legalization, however, run counter to public health and safety concerns, the Office of National Drug Control Policy says. The federal government may have a difficult time maintaining its stance, experts predict. John Kane, a federal judge in Colorado, said in December he sees marijuana following the same path as alcohol in the 1930s. Toward the end of Prohibition, Kane explained, judges routinely dismissed violations or levied fines so trivial that prosecutors quit filing cases. ""The law is simply going to die before it's repealed. It will just go into disuse,"" Kane said. ""It's a cultural force, and you simply cannot legislate against a cultural force."" Kleiman, who is also chairman of the board for BOTEC Analysis Corp., a think tank applying public policy analysis techniques to the issues of crime and drug abuse, said the federal government may have tripped itself up in the 1970s by classifying marijuana as a Schedule I drug with no medicinal use and a high potential for abuse. If the government had made it Schedule II, the classification for cocaine and oxycodone, 43 years ago, it would be easier today to justify a recreational ban, he said. States to take lead . Kleiman said the infrastructure he is helping establish in Washington could provide a model for other states, but ideally, he'd prefer a model that involved federal legalization and permitted users to either grow their own marijuana or patronize co-ops. ""All the stuff I want to do you can't do as long as it's federally illegal,"" Kleiman said. ""By the time we get it legalized federally, there will be systems in place in each state,"" which will make uniform controls at a national level tricky. The push for legalization has gained momentum, though, he said, and he doesn't foresee it moving backward. In 10 years, proponents might even move politics at a national level, he said, though predictions are problematic so long as pot prohibition endures. ""It's sustained right now. Whether it's going to be sustained is another question,"" he said. In the meantime, states are expected to continue to lead the charge. Alaska could put a legalization ballot before voters next year, while Maine, Rhode Island, California and Oregon may give it a shot in 2016, when the presidential election promises to bring younger voters to the polls. ""I think a lot's going to depend on how legalization plays out in Colorado and Washington -- also, how the federal government responds,"" Kilmer said. ""We still haven't heard how they're going to address commercial production facilities in those states."" The next White House administration could easily reverse course, just as it could on mandatory minimums, Kilmer said, but while pot's future is nebulous, the nation's change in attitude -- not only since the 1960s, but even since a decade ago -- is clear. That makes proponents hopeful, if reluctant to make predictions. ""I didn't see this (shift in opinion) coming, and I think that's true of my collaborators,"" Reuter said. ""So much for experts.""","In legalization debate, nation has moved from ""if"" to ""how,"" drug policy expert says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Department of Homeland Security will hire up to 1,000 cybersecurity experts over the next three years to help protect U.S. computer networks, an Obama administration official said.

"(CNN) -- In the Roman poet Ovid's ""Metamorphoses,"" one of the great works of Western literature, King Tereus of Thrace rapes his wife's sister, Philomena, then cuts out her tongue. In ""Titus Andronicus,"" Shakespeare references Ovid with an even more grotesque rape and mutilation, while including multiple acts of murder, torture and cannibalism. Kathleen Kennedy, associate professor of literature at Penn State University-Brandywine, says, ""Everyone is traumatized by Titus."" Over the last few months, students, faculty and administrators at a number of universities have been debating whether faculty should be obligated to place ""trigger warnings"" on their syllabi before assigning content that might trigger a traumatic episode in one of their students. Before assigning Ovid, Shakespeare or any topic about human cruelty and suffering, what should teachers be obligated to tell their students? Proponents of trigger warnings, reasonably, argue that students will be unable to learn when confronted with content that triggers traumatic recollection. This isn't about students just being uncomfortable, they say, but about ensuring students don't have to choose between their education and their sense of safety. Critics of trigger warnings, also reasonably, contend that education requires pushing students to engage with difficult material that makes them uncomfortable. Professors worry about academic freedom and having to address a whole cascade of ""isms"" as they design and execute their syllabi. Furthermore, they see the focus on trigger warnings now as part of the corporatization of higher education, in which syllabi are designed not to structure learning but to prevent lawsuits. Professors are concerned about trauma, but don't want to slap labels on their syllabi that are the equivalent of ""Caution: This Coffee is Hot."" To some extent, both sides are right. Some students suffer from serious trauma, but there's no feasible way a blanket policy on trigger warning can really work. Fortunately, we can solve the situation though a combination of best-teaching practices and the application of pre-existing policies. The biggest problem here emerges from the nature of trauma. Triggers are extremely personal and, from the outside, unpredictable. Professors cannot review their course material and know, with any certainty, what might or might not function as a trigger for their students. We worry about surprising students with triggering content and re-victimizing them. We don't need a vague if well-intentioned policy, however, to address most cases. Instead, let's just rely on good teaching. Tressie McMillan Cottom, writer and sociologist, noted that the real problem with triggers is when they catch you by surprise. She writes, ""Trigger warnings make sense on platforms where troubling information can be foisted upon you without prior knowledge, as in the case of retweets."" In a classroom, where the subject matter ought to be reasonably transparent, such surprises should be rare. We should all know what we are going to encounter in classes on the Holocaust, on human rights law, on the history of race in America, or countless other clearly labeled topics that of necessity must deal with often graphic and upsetting stories. If you sign up for such a class, be ready. Students might not be so ready for Ovid or Shakespeare. Why not prepare them for the reading? Don't do it because you are worried about trauma, but because it will help them learn. I would never want my students to be surprised by something horrific in their reading, whether the ""Red Wedding"" on ""Game of Thrones"" or the rape of Philomena in Ovid. Instead, I want them ready to work with challenging texts so they learn. Spoilers might be bad for entertainment, but they are good for education. Once most students know what they are likely to encounter in their work, the surprise factor in triggering situations ought to be mitigated. For a small percentage of students, however, this kind of preparation may not be enough. The word ""disability"" has been largely missing from the debate on trigger warnings in higher education. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a psychological disability. It doesn't just affect soldiers. Students (or anyone) suffering from PTSD are not just ""uncomfortable"" when their trauma is triggered. Valeria M. Souza, a lecturer of Portuguese at Washington University in St. Louis and a blogger about disability and education, has noted that universities already have, or at least should have, robust systems to ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and to provide reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. It would be entirely reasonable to help a student with a disability who is best accommodated by avoiding certain triggering material in the classroom. That said, avoidance is not always the best approach for people with trauma. One method of treating PTSD is called ""exposure therapy,"" in which patients repeatedly engage with their traumas in order to desensitize themselves to potentially triggering moments. The classroom is not a therapist's clinic, but the practice does suggest that avoidance is not the only choice. Moreover, it's a decision for a patient and a therapist or doctor to decide and advise a university, rather than for faculty or administrators to decide for themselves. As educators and as a society we need to respect trauma and create conditions in which healing is possible. Part of that respect is to recognize that we don't know how any given person's trauma might manifest, so we can't assume we know what is or isn't a trigger. And we don't have to know. If professors follow good teaching practices and help students be ready for the course content as it unfolds, while universities provide well-funded and expert disability support services, we should be ready to handle whatever trigger issues lurk undetected. We don't need a whole new set of warning labels.","Universities have debated putting warning labels on violent, abusive scenes in literature .

"Washington (CNN) -- It was supposed to be a week focused on domestic issues to bolster the chances of Democrats in November midterms. President Barack Obama wanted to drive down a virtual highway, talk about rebuilding infrastructure while standing in front of a bridge, and otherwise push his proposals to build middle class opportunity -- all rejected so far by Republicans. Instead, violence erupting in the sky over Ukraine and on the ground in the Middle East set the agenda. On three straight days, Obama ended up in front of reporters for previously unscheduled statements on the volatile developments halfway around the world that obscured the planned White House messaging. Such buffeting by world events adds to a perception driven by Obama's critics that he lags behind foreign policy issues instead of getting out front. ""There is a sense that this White House is being driven by events as opposed to sort of driving its own agenda,"" noted CNN political analyst and Politico reporter Maggie Haberman. Toss in the immigration crisis along the southern border, with tens of thousands of unaccompanied children overwhelming available facilities, and ""it adds to a sense that Obama is sort of adrift in an out-of-control world,"" Haberman said. Facing a low approval rating in polls and the possibility of losing control of the Senate to Republicans in November, the White House has tried to focus on an Obama staple -- the struggle of everyday Americans to get by. In recent weeks, the President has shared burgers in Virginia, sipped beer and shot pool in Colorado, and munched on Texas barbecue to demonstrate his connection to working Americans. Gaza crisis boils over . The past week offered similar opportunities. On Tuesday, Obama tested out a car simulator in McLean, Virginia, and used the occasion to criticize his GOP foes. ""Republicans in Congress keep blocking or voting down some of the ideas that would have the biggest impact on middle-class and working families,"" Obama said at the research facility. Meanwhile, the Middle East crisis reached a boiling point with mounting violence between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza. Wednesday, he called for meetings on domestic policy issues, but then Secretary of State John Kerry came to the White House after returning from China, Afghanistan and the Iran nuclear talks in Vienna. Late in the day, Obama announced a new set of economic sanctions against Russian banks, energy companies, defense companies and some officials due to the administration's contention Moscow has failed to take steps to end the Ukraine conflict. No domestic issues came up. ""I've repeatedly made it clear that Russia must halt the flow of weapons and fighters across the border into Ukraine; that Russia must urge separatists to release their hostages and support a cease-fire; that Russia needs to pursue internationally mediated talks and agree to meaningful monitors on the border,"" Obama told reporters in the White House briefing room. Obama also discussed a recount of votes in the Afghanistan presidential election, the nuclear negotiations with Iran and the collapse of a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. Ukraine tragedy upstages infrastructure event . Thursday was little different. Obama traveled to Wilmington, Delaware, for remarks on infrastructure funding, followed by a trip to New York for Democratic fund-raising events. Again, a development abroad dominated the focus -- reports from Ukraine of a Malaysia Air jetliner apparently shot down by a surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people aboard. With images of burning debris on TV screens across the nation, Obama started his remarks in Delaware with a reference to what happened. ""The world is watching reports of a downed passenger jet near the Russia-Ukraine border. And it looks like it may be a terrible tragedy,"" he said. ""Right now, we're working to determine whether there were American citizens on board,"" he added, before getting back to creating jobs to help the middle class. Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden explained why he was late to speak to a class of African-American women enrolled in a technology training course in Detroit: He was on the phone with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko talking about the plane ""blown out of the sky."" When Obama flew to New York that evening on Air Force One, he spoke with Poroshenko and Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia. Later he would also talk with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Kerry. Before arriving back in Washington late that night, Obama also spoke with his national security team and was briefed on the latest efforts to support an investigation into the air disaster. Friday morning, after meeting with members of his Cabinet, Obama again appeared in the White House briefing room to state what many suspected -- the United States believed that the plane was downed by a missile shot from an area of Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed rebels. ""This was a global tragedy,"" he said. ""An Asian airliner was destroyed in European skies, filled with citizens from many countries. So there has to be a credible international investigation into what happened."" He also said he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the worsening violence and Israel's ground invasion of Gaza. Minutes later, Obama got back to his domestic agenda, stopping by the first lady's ""state dinner"" for kids who created winning healthy lunch recipes. He told the audience how much he loved the event, and rather than having to focus on bloodshed around the world, he described how he loses his mind over a good bowl of chips and guacamole.

Along with Ahmadinejad's aide, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, the name of former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was also notably absent from the list of approved nominees, as was that of former Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki. The vetting process was carried out by Iran's Guardian Council, the country's most influential clerical body, which operates under the watchful eyes of Supreme Leader Seyed Ali Khamenei. Iran in 2013: Three possible crises . Ahmadinejad appealed for his supporters to be patient Wednesday, saying on his website that he would seek help from Khamenei. Ahmedinejad said ""the rights of the oppressed will not be trampled on in a country where there exists a supreme religious leader,"" referring to Khamenei, and insisted that he expected the issue to ""be resolved."" Ahmadinejad, who is term-limited and so cannot run for a third consecutive term, has been grooming Mashaei to take over for years. The head of Rafsanjani's election campaign office said the former president will not object to the Guardian Council's decision, Press TV reported. The eight approved nominees, whose names were released by Iran's Interior Ministry late Tuesday, are: . -- Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel, a former Parliament speaker whose daughter is married to Khamenei's son; . -- Saeed Jalili, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, who also represents Iran in talks with the European Union; . -- Mohsen Rezaei, currently a member of the Expediency Council and formerly the country's top commander during the war with Iraq; . -- Hassan Rouhani, currently head of the Center for Strategic Studies and Iran's chief nuclear negotiator under former President Mohammad Khatami. -- Mohammad Reza Aref, an education minister in the Khatami presidency who could be characterized as independent; . -- Mohammad Ghalibaf, a member of the Revolution Guard's Corp and currently the mayor of Tehran; . -- Mohammad Gharazi, a minister during Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's presidency; . -- Ali Akbar Velayati, twice foreign minister during the Rafsanjani presidency and currently the supreme leader's top adviser. Among the approved nominees, only Gharazi, Aref and Rouhani are not known to be devout followers of Khamenei. The run-up to the elections has been characterized by factionalism and political infighting, observers say. Four years ago, Ahmadinejad's reelection sparked mass protests amid claims of electoral fraud. His chief rival, reformist Mir Hossein Moussavi, became a leader of the opposition Green Movement along with Mehdi Karrubi. The two subsequently were placed under house arrest, where they remain. Amanpour: Is Iran's next president the face of its nuclear program? Rafsanjani's last-minute registration on Saturday had the potential to change the face of the election. Rafsanjani, who served two terms as president from 1989 to 1997, has long been a staunch critic and bitter political rival of Ahmadinejad. Weeks after the 2009 elections, Rafsanjani condemned the regime's violent crackdown against the opposition movement and spoke out for the people's right to peacefully protest. He later toned down the attacks and made statements of apparent support of the regime and Khamenei. He is widely believed to be one of the wealthiest and most politically powerful men in Iran. A government news website cited the Interior Ministry's elections chief, Seyed Solat Mortazavi, as saying official campaigning would begin on Friday and last for 20 days, ending June 12. Voters also will elect members of city and rural Islamic councils on June 14. Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency said the eight presidential candidates would collectively have 539 hours of free TV and radio time to outline their plans. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Reza Sayah, Tara Kangarloo and Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","NEW: Official campaigning by the 8 approved presidential candidates will start on Friday .

"(CNN) -- During her morning jog in north Houston, Hong Nguyen stumbled across an unusual sight: a baby girl partially hidden in the bushes near the side of the road. Strapped into a car seat on the ground, the 8-month-old child was crying. ""I called 911,"" Nguyen said. ""And I stayed there with the baby."" The chance encounter Monday in an unpopulated area near an industrial zone may have saved the little girl's life. She had been missing for about six hours after a man stole the car she was in from outside a gas station in the early hours. Her mother had stopped to buy a soda, leaving the car keys in the ignition. Bitten by ants . Authorities had been frantically searching for the baby, identified by CNN affiliate KTRK as Genesis Hailey. The car was recovered a few blocks from the gas station about two hours after it was stolen. But there was no sign of the child or her car seat. Police said Genesis appeared to be in good health when she was found, apart from being hungry and suffering what appeared to be several ant bites. ""I did spot a couple of ants on the baby and I was able to get them off,"" said Albert Pizana, the officer who responded to the jogger's emergency call. 'Middle of nowhere' But police officials said they couldn't comprehend the decision to leave the baby in such an isolated place. ""I don't know what kind of an animal would do this to a child,"" said Lt. H. Lopez, of the Houston Police Department's homicide division. ""Leaving the child in the middle of nowhere."" Police officials also faced questions from reporters about the mother's decision to leave her child in the car with the engine on. They said she was in the gas station's store for a matter of seconds before she saw the thief jump in the car and start driving away with the door still open. He was in such a rush that he backed the car into the railing of the gas pump before he sped off with his infant passenger in the back. The mother ran out of the store but wasn't quick enough to catch the car. ""It's a good reminder for the public not to leave their vehicles running, especially with a baby inside,"" Lopez said. Swaddled in a uniform . Police are still looking for the suspect, a man in his late teens or early 20s. It's unclear exactly when the baby was taken from the car and put in the bushes. Police said it's possible she had been left there since the early hours of Monday. Pizana said Genesis was crying intermittently when he and his partner got to her. They took her inside their car, and he swaddled her in his uniform shirt to try to calm her. His partner retrieved her pacifier for her. Pizana declined to speculate what could have happened to the baby if the jogger hadn't taken that particular route Monday morning. ""It makes you want to go home and hug your kids even tighter,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Did Florida just accidentally make all computers and smartphones illegal? The state recently passed a bill to crack down on gambling in Internet cafes. In a potentially unfortunate twist for anyone using a computer or smartphone in the state, a new lawsuit alleges the wording on the bill is so broad that it could be interpreted as a ban on any device connected to the Internet. A new bill passed two months ago by the Florida legislature expanded the definition of a ""slot machine"" so that it would include regular computers being used as makeshift slot machines, closing a loophole in state laws that legislators said allowed some gambling centers to operate as Internet cafes and adult arcades. The crackdown was kicked off by a multi-year investigation of a number of Florida gambling cafes that were masquerading as part of a charitable organization. It resulted in more than 50 arrests, the resignation of Florida Lt. Governor Jennifer Carroll and the new bill banning Internet cafes. ""There are unintended consequences of hastily passed legislation in the wake of a scandal,"" said attorney Justin Kaplan, whose firm Kluger, Kaplan, Silverman, Katzen & Levine is representing the plaintiff in the suit. This lawsuit, which was published by the Miami Herald, is being brought on behalf of Incredible Investments, LLC, and its owner Consuelo Zapata. The company ran an Internet cafe in Homestead, a farming community south of Miami. Zapata's cafe offered game promotions to visitors, When they purchased time on one of the machines they could use the computer to see if they'd won anything. The lawsuit compares these ""sweepstakes drawings"" to common company contests such as McDonald's Monopoly game. Florida's new, expanded definition of a slot machine includes ""any machine or device or system or network of devices"" used to play games of chance or skill, which can be activated by not just inserting money, but an ""account number, code, or other object or information."" According to the lawsuit, this new definition could include any smartphone or computer in Florida since, in theory, any device with access to the Internet could be used to play an illegal game. ""The possibilities of going on the Internet and using your phone generally turns every single smartphone, computer, whatever, into an illegal slot machine,"" said Kaplan. For example, a recent Bud Light advertising campaign shows a man entering a code from a case of beer into his smartphone to see if he won a prize from the company. ""Clearly you have a device which is activated by input of a code that indirectly, by any element of chance, entitles you to a payout,"" said Kaplan of the contest. Anyone can walk into a public library and use its computers to participate in a March Madness contest, such as Yahoo's annual Tourney Pick 'em, which offers a grand prize of $10,000. According to Kaplan, the owner of that network of computers could be in trouble for running illegal slot machines. The definition of what is or isn't a slot machine isn't the only issue with the new law. Kaplan says that the law is unconstitutional because of an amendment that presumes a device is a slot machine if ""it is used to display images of games of chance"" and involves a payout of anything of value. ""Here the burden is shifted,"" said Kaplan. ""It's saying you are presumed to be guilty, now prove to us this really wasn't a slot machine."" Arcades and business with standalone gaming machines are being impacted as well, and more than 1,000 Internet cafes have already been shut down under the new law, according to the Tampa Bay Times.","Florida recently passed a law to crackdown on gambling in Internet cafes .

"(CNN) -- Gear-grinding buses jamming up parking lots. Gawping packs of wide-eyed clods in sandals and floppy hats. Fanny packs. Amateur travelers hopping in and out of said buses, snapping photos while a peppy guide gushes over some run-of-the-mill attraction. ""This is the Fabric Museum. You have an hour here. Then lunch!"" Anyone who's traveled past their front door has seen the benighted tour group and recoiled in revulsion. Is this any way to see the world? Who travels this way? More: Why ""travelers"" think they're better than ""tourists"" -- and why they're not . There's a tendency for many to disparage group tours, snicker over the doltish stereotypes and, in the process, feel like superior world citizens. But tours come in all shapes and sizes and, regardless of what you might consider ""real travel,"" they play an important role in the travel world. They're not all big bus tours filled with flag-waving tour guides. Many consist of small groups who stay longer than an hour in each place. It was a package tour through Costa Rica that gave me my love of travel and made me comfortable traveling alone. It helped make me what I am now -- a travel writer and occasional tour group leader. This year I began running small-group tours for readers of my budget travel blog in order to do for them what that tour to Costa Rica did for me. There are a number of reasons even seasoned travelers shouldn't be afraid of tours. 1. Instant friends . For people not comfortable meeting strangers on their own, tours provide an easy environment in which to make friends right away. Although most of us want to meet people on the road, many find it hard to strike up conversations. Tours help you make that leap. And even if you don't, guides want everyone to have a great time -- they make sure travelers don't sit around staring at each other like kids at a junior high school dance. More: World's worst airports to sleep in ... and the best . 2. Tour guides create a more meaningful experience . I've had some amazing guides in my time. On a tour in Australia, our Aboriginal guide/driver suddenly braked, ran out of the car and called us over to look at a trail of ants that locals use for cold medicine. The ensuing conversation led to some ant eating -- I'd have never done that on my own -- and a greater understanding of the local culture. 3. Tours teach you how to travel . Tour guides are old hands at travel. They can teach you to spot scams, illustrate the best ways to find food on the road and much more. The skills they impart will likely inform a traveler's future trips. On a tour I led in Paris, I had to save one of my tour members from falling for a common local scam. We were outside the Louvre when he was asked to provide a signature and donate to ""charity,"" an old ruse run by Paris con artists. He had his hand in his pocket just as I came up to him. I'm sure he hasn't made that mistake again. Guides make new travelers better travelers. More: More camels than koalas ... and 19 other Oz discoveries . 4. Tours ease fears . Traveling alone can be a scary proposition, particularly when you haven't done it before or don't speak a local language. A tour provides a support system that allows travelers -- even experienced ones -- to feel more comfortable taking a chance on new experiences. Tours are floaties for world travelers -- they allow you to dip your toes in the pool without the fear of getting in over your head. 5. Tours get you places you can't get yourself . While independent travel is great, many places in the world can't be accessed by solo travelers due to license and government restrictions. Many big destinations -- the Galapagos, Antarctica, African safaris -- need to be explored as part of organized trips. There are many exciting, once in a lifetime activities you won't be able to experience if you don't take part in a licensed tour with a guide. More: ""Star Wars"" attraction in Tunisian desert being consumed by sand . 6. Package tours can be cheaper . While this may seem counter-intuitive since traveling alone allows you more flexibility, many tour companies are able to secure bulk rates and other deals. Small group operators can be cheaper for mid-range travel than if you were to price out the same trip for yourself. One diehard independent traveler I know wanted to visit the wild but scattered Solomon Islands. Lack of infrastructure and traditional tourist services meant going to all the obscure places he wanted to see -- including some historic World War II battlefields -- would have cost upward of $10,000 for charters and services. Instead, he spent $3,500 on a package tour, enjoyed every minute of it and remains in touch with several members of the tour, including a still-active World War II vet. What's more, saving on the cost of excursions means you'll have more money to splurge on a memorable dinner with your new friends or a ridiculous souvenir for your family. 7. Tours provide safety . When you're on your own, you're a more tempting target for thieves, scammers and criminals. By traveling with a group, you have safety in numbers and don't have to venture into unknown places without a companion. Additionally, tour guides can advise you on what areas to avoid that you wouldn't otherwise have known about. More: Year's 10 most stunning wildlife photos . Do you take package tours?

"(CNN) -- In this period of gloomy economic forecasts, Africa's rise has become a widely discussed international policy topic. The sweeping optimism about Africa's economic prospects has been reinforced by 2013 projections that the continent will grow faster than the world average. The content of the growth, however, has been a source of discomfort among African leaders. They worry that this growth is linked to a commodity boom which is fueled largely by China's demand. Africa's ability to sustain its current growth will depend largely on how quickly it will be able to shift from reliance on traditional commodity markets to modern economic structures that focus on technology-driven development. The focus on innovation is emerging as a key theme in the Africa Union's long-term strategy, Agenda 2063. Read this: 10 African tech startups you need to know . The African Union appointed a high-level panel on science, technology and innovation to provide proposals on how the continent can leverage the world's fund of technological knowledge for economic transformation. The panel is chaired by myself and Professor Ismail Serageldin, director of the Library of Alexandria in Egypt. Building on emerging trends across the continent, the panel's draft report, ""On the Wings of Innovation: Africa 2024,"" makes key recommendations related to harnessing emerging technologies, constructing basic infrastructure, investing in higher technical training, and promoting entrepreneurship. As a latecomer Africa has the benefit of tapping into vast quantities of technological knowledge available worldwide. The continent's leapfrogging into the mobile revolution illustrated the power of latecomer advantages. Africa is now the origin of new industries such as mobile money transfer. The mobile revolution is still in its infancy and is already being extended to other sectors such as health, education and agriculture. Biotechnology . Another important area that promises to transform Africa is agricultural biotechnology. To date, only four African countries (South Africa, Burkina Faso, Egypt and Sudan) have adopted transgenic crops. African scientists in additional countries such as Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria and Ghana are at the forefront of leveraging biotechnology to address local agricultural challenges. They are focusing on problems such as pests, disease, drought and low nutritional content of staple crops. In addition to technical work, policy makers across the continent are starting to review the laws that govern the same development of biotechnology to create freedom to innovate. This is akin to past efforts to liberalize the telecommunications market to create space for the entry of mobile phones. Biotechnology is already a multi-billion dollar industry and the associated technical knowledge can be adapted to other sectors, such as health, industry and environment management. The experience gained in adopting mobile technologies and biotechnology will make it easier for Africa to move into other fields, such as nanotechnology and new materials. The debate over biotechnology is therefore a strategic battle to position Africa as a global player in the field of new technologies. Infrastructure . The draft report focuses on the urgent need to invest in basic infrastructure, such as energy, transportation, irrigation and telecommunications. The World Bank has estimated that the continent will need to invest nearly $93 billion a year in the next decade to meet its infrastructure targets. African countries are already starting to respond to the challenge. For example, last year South Africa allocated $97 billion to infrastructure projects over the next three years. This magnitude of investment will require considerable creativity that will involve the participation of sectors such as the military. In addition, it offers a new opportunity for building up the much-needed capacity in engineering by creating new research and technical training institutes to support national infrastructure backbones. Read this: Building roads in Africa? Send in the troops . Training . ""On the Wings of Innovation"" pays particular attention to the importance of technical training of the youth and recommends the creation of a new generation of universities that combine research, teaching and product commercialization. There is a prototype for universities: The Nelson Mandela Institute of African Science and Technology in Arusha, Tanzania. The institute is located in the Ministry of Telecommunications, Science and Technology. Africa's technology-based line ministries have a wide range of research and technical institutes that can be upgraded to create a new family of universities that promote innovation for economic development. Their success will also inspire traditional universities to adjust their missions, syllabi and teaching methods to become more relevant to the challenge of human improvement. Tech entrepreneurs . Finally, the report stresses Africa's need to foster technology-based business incubation. There are two areas that require attention. The first is supporting start-ups. There are good examples of this across Africa, which include initiatives such as iHub in Nairobi and InnovateLagos in Nigeria. The next frontier of policy focus should be scaling up new businesses. Read this: Tech hub working on 'Nigeria's next big idea' Flying on the wings of innovation will require long-term vision, policy focus and change-management capacity among African leaders at the continental, national and sub-national levels. Much of the practical action will occur in sub-national regions such as cities, provinces and counties. It will demand smarter governance styles that are supported by evidence rather than political rhetoric. Creating technology-driven economies will demand greater investment in smart government than is required in the age of extractive industries. Countries that fail to upgrade their governance systems to reflect the competitive challenges of modern global markets will fall by the wayside.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Los Angeles judge ordered doctors to resume water, nutrition and medication infusions for Casey Kasem on Monday. The decision came during a hearing in which a lawyer for the iconic radio host's wife accused Kasem's daughter of denying food, water and medication to her father to hasten his death. Monday's hearing was the latest in a series of court battles over control of health decisions for Kasem, 82. He suffers from Lewy body dementia, which has no cure, according to court documents. The retired ""American Top 40"" host is in critical condition at St. Anthony Hospital in Kitsap County, Washington, where his wife, Jean Kasem, took him last month amid the legal dispute with her stepchildren. Kasem's children hope family will put aside dispute in his last moments . Kasem ""won't be with us much longer,"" Danny Deraney, the representative for daughter Kerri Kasem, said Friday. Jean Kasem's lawyer Steve Haney called Kerri Kasem ""a godless woman"" after Monday's hearing, referring to his contention that she is a member of the Church of Scientology. Deraney denies that Kerri Kasem has ever been a Scientologist, adding, ""She loves studying religions. Jean picked out the most controversial one to distract from what's really going on."" Haney told reporters outside the courthouse that Kerri Kasem's motive for speeding up her father's death was financial. ""She's in a pretty serious economic situation that would be dramatically improved as the result of her father's death,"" Haney said. She ""could cash in immediately"" on her share of a $2 million life insurance policy when he dies, he said. Kerri Kasem was in Washington with her father Monday and not at the hearing, but her lawyer defended her. ""I think Kerri has conducted herself in a way that demonstrates she's solely concerned about the health of her father,"" attorney Troy Martin said. Martin attacked Jean Kasem for ignoring court orders and removing her husband from a Los Angeles nursing home ""where he had no bedsores, where he had no infections, and took him on a road trip, over a thousand miles, to a place that wasn't his home, and didn't give him proper medical care."" Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel Murphy will reconsider at a hearing Friday who should make medical decisions for Kasem: his daughter, wife or a neutral party. He ordered Kasem's court-appointed lawyer to travel to Washington to assess his medical condition and try to communicate with him. ""He's not a vegetable.Â  He can communicate,"" his wife's lawyer told Murphy. But the daughter's attorney told the judge that was false.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Halle Berry and the father of her daughter settled their differences in family court Thursday, a week after a driveway brawl with Berry's fiancÃ© landed the dad in jail. ""From all counsel, the parties have reached an amicable agreement. There will be no further statements regarding this matter,"" said a printed statement shown to reporters by Berry attorney Blair Berk. The agreement ended a private session at a Los Angeles County courthouse among Berk, ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry and his lawyer, Shawn Holley, Thursday afternoon. The actress did not attend. While the lawyers would not elaborate on what the agreement covers, the fiancÃ©, Olivier Martinez, and Aubry, have each taken legal action against the other after the Thanksgiving Day scuffle at Berry's Hollywood Hills home. Berry's legal battle . Martinez had Aubry arrested, accusing him of battery, while Aubry filed for a restraining order against Martinez, saying he started the fight. Berry obtained an order banning Aubry from having contact with her or 4-year-old Nahla. Berry, 46, and Aubry, 37, have been engaged in a bitter legal fight over custody of Nahla since their five-year romance ended in 2010. The battle heated up last year after the Oscar-winning actress announced her engagement to Martinez and asked a family court to allow her to move with the daughter to Paris. Aubry, in a sworn statement that helped him gain a temporary restraining order against Martinez on Monday, said the fight was apparently motivated by the custody battle, which Berry recently lost. Berry, who pays Aubry child support under the shared custody agreement, was told she cannot move to Paris with the child unless Aubry goes there as well. In his statement, Aubry said: ""While he was attacking me physically, Mr. Martinez said to me in an aggressive and threatening voice, 'You cost us $3 million. When you see the judge, you're going to tell him you're going to Paris or I'm going to kill you. You're going to Paris, you're going to get your 20 grand a month in child support. From now on you're going to do drop-offs on the street.'"" Aubry's lawyer attached several photos to the filing to show his blackened, swollen eyes, cut lip and bruised face. Aubry was treated at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for a fractured rib and several bruises on his face and forehead, and he required stitches to repair three cuts in his mouth, the filing said.

"(CNN) -- Notice anything unusual about the World Cup this year? It has been an absolute goalfest. In fact, it's on pace to be one of the highest-scoring tournaments in the 84-year history of the World Cup. Over the first 12 games, the average number of goals per match has been 3.66, partly because of the Netherlands' 5-1 blowout of Spain. But nine of the 12 other matches have seen three or four goals scored. The average number of goals per match in South Africa in 2010 was 2.27, and FIFA calculates that the average since 1930 has been 2.86. You have to go back to 1954 to find a World Cup with a higher average number of goals per match. That year's competition, in Switzerland, saw the humiliation of goalkeepers with an average of 5.38 goals per match, the highest ever. It's also unusual that there have been no draws yet this year. Every match has had a winner and a loser. Since group stages were introduced in 1950, one out of four group matches has ended in a draw, with nearly a third of them resulting in a draw in 2010. It also feels like there has been an unusual number of come-from-behind victories this year. Five of the 12 matches have seen the team that scored first go on to lose, if you count Brazil's own goal in the tournament's opening match against Croatia. It's hard to come by reliable data for how often teams come from behind to win in the World Cup, but it was very unusual in Euro 2012. The team that scored first in that contest went on to win more than 70% of the time, according to an article in the International Journal of Sports Science. World Cup Schedule of Matches .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Nelson Mandela was many things to many people, but when I pause to consider his life, mostly I smile and think of his sense of humor, his dry wit and his remarkable ability to render someone speechless with a well-placed one-liner. He was not the kind of man to fall over in laughter or to guffaw loudly. He did not make silly gaffes, inappropriate innuendos or stupid jokes. Instead, just like the rest of him, his humor was dignified, statesmanlike and perhaps a little old-fashioned. Some of Mandela's jokes were well-used and a bit cheesy, but that did not detract from their simplicity and effectiveness. He had a small arsenal of one-liners he used for different people. If he met a married couple, he demanded to know from the lady, ""When did you propose to your husband?"" Of course, for Mandela, with his early 20th century, patriarchal value system, it was hugely amusing to imagine anything as audacious as a woman asking a man to marry her. And of course, his question was always met with nervous, unnaturally loud laughter that broke the ice. I am not sure whether his jests were merely a Mandela social tic or a deliberate public strategy. Either way, Mandela won over foes, disarmed critics and charmed the media with his cutesy, gee-whiz humor. Besides the jokes, he could also lather complete strangers with devastatingly flattering compliments. He often said to those whose lives are not distinguished by public office or marked by accolades, ""I am so honored to meet you."" As a television reporter for the SABC, South Africa's national broadcaster, and then later as a CNN correspondent, I watched him from the sidelines, time and time again, use humor to put people at ease. More often than not, he would poke fun at himself with classic comic timing. He would often start off a speech by thanking everyone for coming to listen to ""such an old man."" Later, after he stood down after one term as South African president, I heard him win over a group of staid, white South African businessmen by telling them, ""Nowadays, I am just a poor pensioner. I am jobless. Maybe you could hire me?"" Self-mockery was a typically savvy Mandela ploy to ensure that people would relax around him. The cult of Mandela had become so pronounced that celebrities, world leaders and ordinary people often became tongue-tied and gibbering when they met him. So, joking about his failings or mistakes was just another way of Mandela saying: ""Chill! I'm cool. Relax."" Mandela walked with a ramrod gait, straight-backed and stiff. Over the years, I watched many people meet him for the first time, and without exception, they came away from the encounter amazed at how tall and regal-looking he was. How a UK pop-song helped free Nelson Mandela . Only children seemed unintimidated by his height and fame. There is something about Mandela that kids loved. I saw little children run to him without knowing why they were doing it and toddlers rustle around his legs like purring kittens. For them, and even us adults, perhaps he was like a smiling South African Santa Claus? The feeling was mutual. Mandela mined children for their opinions and views of the world. He seemed to relish their brutal honesty and innocent humor. One of Mandela's favorite anecdotes -- often told in public -- was of a conversation he had with a 4-year-old girl who asked him how old he was. Mandela replied, ""I can't remember, but I was born long, long ago."" She then asked him why he went to jail. Mandela replied, ""I didn't go there because I liked it. Some people sent me there."" She asked how long he had been in jail. Mandela again replied, ""I can't remember, but it was a long, long time."" Mandela then relays to his audience that after a thoughtful pause the little girl said, ""You are a stupid old man, aren't you?"" Mandela's good humor and jovial demeanor were not just a public ploy to charm crowds or disarm nervous guests. He used it to great effect in his political life. A familiar story in South Africa is how, during multiparty negotiations before the 1994 democratic election, he would often gently tease the leader of a rightwing Afrikaner party, Gen. Constant Viljoen, by saying, ""We have to let the white man talk; after all, he is from the supreme race."" Again, a slightly naughty, cheeky grin would subsequently appear, by which time the chilly, racially charged atmosphere would have been warmed up by nervous laughter. For Mandela, sports were a major weapon against racism . Mandela even amused the British royal family with his casual, overfamiliarity with the Queen, whom he called ""Elizabeth"" and not ""Your Majesty."" It was a deliberate snub against pomp and protocol for the simple, humble Mandela. ""Well, she calls me Nelson,"" was his repost, when one of his grandchildren asked if it was not perhaps in bad form to call the Queen by her first name. One only wonders the response from the British establishment when Mandela complemented ""Elizabeth"" on her figure; ""Why, Elizabeth, you've lost weight!"" he reportedly said to the famously stiff-upper-lipped monarch. Mandela's humor was centered in his inherent sense of self. He played the fool or jester sometimes, all the while knowing that he was fundamentally deeply content with himself. For me, it is a very powerful indicator of greatness. While some leaders flounder with self-doubt, or others primp with self-congratulations, Mandela was merely a twinkle away from nudging you in the ribs with a self-knowing smile.

"(CNN) -- Candidate Abdullah Abdullah on Wednesday demanded an immediate halt to the counting of ballots in Afghanistan's presidential runoff election, alleging widespread fraud. In a live news conference on Tolo TV, Abdullah said his campaign was suspending ""engagement with the (election) commission"" and recalling his party monitors from election commission offices. He said there was ""no way the counting could continue in the absence of (his campaign's) monitors."" Noor Mohammed Noor, a spokesman for the election commission, said the count would proceed. He said the commission could not predict whether the counting process has been successful at this stage. Noor asked that any complaints be withheld until a winner is announced. The results have been scheduled to be released July 22, according to the election commission. Abdullah, who dropped out of the presidential race in 2009 because of what he called large-scale voter fraud, took to Twitter to amplify his case for stopping this year's count, saying: . -- ""It is the right of the people to defend their vote. Fraud is taking place in every corner of the country and hurting the Afghan people."" -- ""Counting process should be stopped because this process is not transparent at all. I declare this as a candidate for Afghanistan's presidential election."" Saturday's runoff between Abdullah, the nation's former foreign minister, and former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani was marred by violence. Afghan Deputy Interior Minister Gen. Mohammad Ayoub Salangi said 10 Afghan soldiers, 14 civilians and 19 insurgents were killed in a day that saw nearly 150 attacks throughout the country. In the general election on April 5, Abdullah secured 45% of the vote, and Ghani was second with 31.6%. A candidate must receive more than 50% of the votes for the election to be decided without a runoff. Although once an ally of outgoing President Hamid Karzai, Abdullah has in recent years become an opponent and vocal critic of the Taliban. Ghani -- also a former adviser to Karzai and finance minister in his cabinet -- was once a U.S. citizen, but gave up his passport to run for the Afghan presidency in 2009. CNN's Masoud Popalzai and Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","Candidate Abdullah Abdullah wants vote count stopped .

"(This Old House)  -- Your bathroom's becoming a refuge, so why not light it adequately? When it comes to interior lighting, bathrooms are probably given the least consideration of all the rooms in the house. The average client I meet doesn't think to invest there -- save it for the living room or kitchen, they say. I see a lot of baths with inadequate lighting at the mirror. Often there's just a single ceiling fixture that's supposed to do it all. But as the bathroom increasingly becomes a place to relax and recharge, complete with steam shower and spa tub, the lighting requires extra thought. And when it's done right, the payoff is great. After all, this is the room where you start and end your day. A good lighting plan is a series of layers -- placing ample light where it is needed for showers, shaving, or putting on makeup, for instance, while other light sources enhance the overall mood of the room. Decoding the layers of light . Task lighting . Vanity lighting gets top consideration because these fixtures work the hardest to illuminate the head and face for grooming. The most common mistake people make is putting recessed ceiling fixtures directly over the mirror. These cast shadows on the face, making daily grooming rituals more difficult. Vertical fixtures or sconces mounted on either side of the mirror are best for casting an even light across the face. But given the size and positioning of some vanity mirrors, sidelights can be impractical (mounting them directly to the mirror is always an option, but at greater planning and cost). Only then do I suggest a fixture for over the mirror. It should be placed 75 to 80 inches above the floor and, like all vanity lighting, contain at least 150 watts -- ideally spread over a fixture that's at least 24 inches long so that the light will wash evenly over the hair and face. This Old House: Bath Lighting . The shower is a secondary area of task lighting. In smaller bathrooms, if the stall has a clear glass door, a dedicated fixture may not be necessary. Otherwise, I recommend a recessed light with a glass lens (plastic will yellow). Similar recessed fixtures work well over a freestanding tub or the toilet. Ambient lighting . This ""fill-in"" light serves as a substitute for natural light. It is most often supplied by a central fixture, usually a surface-mounted ceiling light. I encourage clients to think more creatively in their choices, suggesting they consider a pendant lamp or chandelier instead. Another option is ""cove lighting"" -- rope lights hidden behind a molding dropped several inches below ceiling height -- which adds a soft glow around the perimeter of the room. Accent lighting . A small recessed spotlight directed at a piece of decorative art or a beautiful powder room basin creates another layer of light in the bathroom. Similarly, a recessed shower fixture can be angled (most can be tilted up to 35 degrees at installation) to highlight nice tilework or fixtures and make them sparkle. Lighting the vanity right . To eliminate shadows under the chin, eyes, and cheeks, fixtures should be mounted on either side of the vanity mirror (or on the mirror's surface, if it's large), 36 to 40 inches apart. The center of each fixture should be roughly at eye level, or about 66 inches above the floor. This will guarantee even illumination across the face for grooming. This Old House: Double space, light in the bath . Other considerations . Choosing bulbs . A crisp white light tends to render skin tones most accurately. Halogen bulbs set the gold standard. Low-voltage varieties (with a built-in transformer that converts 120 volts to 12 volts) are especially compact, and the smaller bulb gives a nice sparkling effect. Halogen bulbs cost a few dollars more than standard incandescents but can last three times as long. Many feature screw-in bases; those labeled medium-base (MB) are shaped like standard incandescents, so they fit most fixtures. The newest compact fluorescent bulbs also offer good color rendering and are up to 10 times more efficient than regular incandescent bulbs. This Old House: Energy-saving bulbs . Think dimmers . These are a lighting designer's best friend because they grant absolute control over the lighting, and thus the mood, of the room. In a very small space like a powder room, dimming the vanity fixtures might even provide all-in-one task, ambient, and accent lighting. Plus, dimmers conserve energy. The total savings depends on how much you dim the bulb, but one dimmed just 10 percent will last twice as long as a bulb at full brightness. Today's dimmers work for every kind of light source, though you need to know what to ask for. A 120-volt incandescent or halogen light source will need an incandescent dimmer, while low-voltage and fluorescent fixtures require their own compatible dimmers. Occasionally, dimmed bulbs will buzz as the filament vibrates. Switching to a lower-watt bulb (which has a smaller filament) should reduce or even eliminate the noise. Safety first . Attention to aesthetics in the bathroom doesn't diminish the importance of safety. Electricity and water are still lethal companions, and nowhere do they mingle more closely than in the bathroom. Always consult a certified electrician before tackling even the simplest lighting project. The National Electric Code requires all new outlets to have GFCIs, ground-fault circuit interrupters; the newer ones can be retrofitted to existing outlets. Even with a GFCI, freestanding plug-in lamps should never be placed near a sink or tub. Fixtures that are going to be within a certain distance of the tub or shower (usually 6 feet, though local codes vary) must be ""wet"" or ""shower-location"" rated. Don't confuse this with the less rigorous ""damp-location"" rating that's ascribed to most outdoor lighting. E-mail to a friend . Get 2 Free Trial Issues .

"(CNN) -- Pete Cahall gripped a microphone with his left hand, a few pages of handwritten notes in his right. Both hands trembled nervously throughout the speech he struggled to deliver on Wednesday before the student body at Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington, D.C. Odd, since Cahall is the school's principal, and has spoken in front of these very same students countless times before. But he had never given a speech like this before. In fact, he had never spoken publicly about what he was going to say. ""I am a proud gay man that just happens to be the principal of Wilson High School,"" he said to thunderous applause. The announcement came at the school's annual gay pride celebration. Mayor Vincent Gray and openly gay City Council member David Catania were in attendance. ""I never made this declaration before because I did not want my kids to think differently of me or to not respect me,"" Cahall told the students. ""I have been in the shadows, but I am liberated today."" Later, the principal spoke of the moment. ""What I kept thinking was, how can I be the principal of Wilson and oversee a pride day and tell kids to be themselves and be who you are and then not do that? It's hypocritical,"" Cahall told CNN affiliate WJLA. ""That was so unexpected,"" senior Tao Marwell told WJLA. ""I had no idea. I have so much more respect for him now."" Gray, whom Cahall thanked in his speech for his ""care, leadership and support,"" had some strong words for Westboro Baptist Church after the controversial congregation threatened to protest Woodrow Wilson for hosting a pride day. ""In my best biblical reference, my words to the people of Westboro in Kansas is they can go straight to hell,"" said the mayor, according to WJLA. Cahall said that he was inspired to come out by openly gay professional athletes Jason Collins and Michael Sam. He also said that a recent birthday might have had something to do with it. ""I just turned 50 a couple weeks ago, and I'm tired of hiding."" State-by-state: A frenzied few months on the same-sex marriage front . 'Game of Thrones' actor comes out as gay .

"(The Frisky) -- When ""Dazed and Confused"" came out in 1993, my sophomore year of high school, my friends and I saw it at the dollar movie theater no less than 16 times. We memorized lines like, ""Check ya later,"" ""Fry like bacon you little freshman piggies!"" We took trips to the Salvation Army to scavenge for Levi cutoffs like Darla's (Parker Posey), fringed vests like Michelle's (Milla Jovovitch), or bell bottoms like Jodi's (Michelle Burke). We scoped for dudes to crush on like Mitch (Wiley Wiggins) or Pickford (Shawn Andrews). The movie struck a nerve with us-we were caught in the jaded whirlwind of 90s grunge, à la Nirvana. The kids of Lee High elicited a magical nostalgia of what it must have been like to be a teen in the 70s, when times were simpler and we could have made bongs in shop class and gone to KISS concerts. I thought my love for the film may have been a ""high school thing,"" but when I caught it on TV this past weekend, it was just as magical as ever. In fact, it was even better. So where are they now, the cool kids of Lee High? What did they grow up to be? Matthew McConaughey as ""David Wooderson""  Then: David Wooderson was that slimy older dude who was working for the city by day and partying at the Moon Tower by night. Even with the creepy 'stache and the skin-tight pants, he still managed to exude sex appeal.  Now: Matthew is still exuding sex appeal as a rom-com king in movies such as ""How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days,"" ""Fool's Gold,"" and ""Failure to Launch."" Yup, he does his best work with his shirt off. The Frisky: Texas math teacher wins lottery 4 times . Ben Affleck as ""Fred O'Bannion""  Then: ""Fafffleck"" (""fat Affleck"") played haze-happy, fifth-year senior Fred O'Bannion.  Now: Ben is much thinner, much hotter, much richer, and much more famous now. He's an A-List movie star married to another A-List movie star, Jennifer Garner. If you haven't heard of him or don't know what he's been up to lately, then you've been living in an isolated cave since 1993. The Frisky: ""Bachelorette"" Ali's 6 steps make any man fall madly in love . Marissa Ribisi as ""Cynthia Dunn""  Then: Cynthia Dunn was the apple of Wooderson's eye as the smart chick with a red afro that she combed with a pick.  Now: Marissa, twin sister of actor Giovanni Ribisi, has had reasonable success in her career since the film came out. She guest starred on ""Friends"" and ""Felicity,"" and co-wrote her own film in 1998 called ""Some Girl."" However, for the last few years she's stepped away from the spotlight and has focused on her marriage to musician Beck. Coincidentally, Marisa was delivered as a baby by Beck's mother; the two were both raised Scientologists and are raising their own children, son Cosimo and daughter Tuesday, as Xenuphiles as well. Ribisi also has a clothing line, Whitley Kros, which launched in 2007. The Frisky: Bristol Palin's friend may be pregnant with Levi Johnston's child . Adam Goldberg as ""Mike Newhouse""  Then: Every high school has a token misanthrope who just wants to dance but ends up getting in a fight by calling someone a ""male dominant monkey [expletive]....."" Mike Newhouse did the honors at Lee High.  Now: Adam is certainly no misanthrope in the entertainment industry. He made a name for himself with his neurotic charm appearing in a bajillion things, including ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""A Beautiful Mind,"" ""Entourage,"" or ""2 Days In Paris"" with Julie Delphy whom he also dated. Parker Posey as ""Darla Marks""  Then: Darla Marks was the senior with an attitude you did not want to piss off before first period for fear of being tarred and feathered.  Now: Parker went on to become an indie film queen appearing in lots of films you saw at your local art house theater. I loved her the most in the Christopher Guest films ""Waiting for Guffman"" and ""Best In Show."" You may have seen her on the small screen recently in ""The Return of Jezebel James"" and ""Bored to Death"" as Jason Schwartzman's love interest. The Frisky: 8 totally inappropriate celebrity couplings . Jason London as ""Randall 'Pink' Floyd""  Then: Randall ""Pink"" Floyd was the hot football player with a rebellious streak. Yum.  Now: Don't get Jason confused with his twin brother Jeremy, the one with the drug problem. Jason is on the straight and narrow and has continued to act since the film. You may have seen him on ""7th Heaven,"" ""Grey's Anatomy"" or, most recently, ""NCIS."" Joey Lauren Adams as ""Simone Kerr""  Then: Pink's girlfriend, actress Simone Kerr, did not go around inhaling helium balloons. That was just Joey Lauren Adam's natural voice.  Now: We remember Joey best as lesbian Alyssa Jones in ""Chasing Amy,"" which Ben Affleck co-starred in. Most recently you may have seen her in ""The Breakup"" or as Pammy in the ""United States of Tara"" starring Toni Collette. The Frisky: 6 roles written for men, but cast as women . Wiley Wiggins as ""Mitch Kramer""  Then: Oh, Mitch Kramer. Mitchy, Mitchy, Mitchy. What a crush we had on that little nose-grabbin' freshman just trying to avoid his hazing and make it with the ladies.  Now: Wiley's all grown up now. You can find him acting in films, writing, making art, or doing web design in Austin, Texas. You can follow him on Twitter but he'll punch your face if you ask him to touch his nose ... according to his bio. Darn. Christin Hinojosa as ""Sabrina Davis""  Then: Sabrina Davis was the lucky freshman chick that the older kids took a shine to.  Now: Christin left behind her acting career after a brief appearance in ""Clueless"" the television show and became an anti-war activist. She's married and lives in Oakland. The Frisky: 30 things every woman should quit doing by 30 . Shawn Andrews as ""Kevin Pickford""  Then: Who can forget Kevin Pickford? You know, the guy with the amazing abs who was throwing a keg party at his house before his parents caught on? Fun fact: during the filming of ""Dazed and Confused,"" Shawn eloped with co-star Milla Jovovich, who also played his girlfriend, Michelle Burroughs, the hot girl who didn't really talk. She was only 16 at the time, so her mom had the marriage annulled after two months. Oh, young love.  Now: Since then, Shawn has appeared in a handful of other movies, most recently ""Fix"" opposite Olivia Wilde, but apparently, he never really bounced back from wedding a teenager. At least he still looks amazing. The Frisky: 4 myths about women that aren't true . Catherine Avril Morris as ""Julie Simms""  Then: Julie Simms was the lucky sophomore who got to make out on a blanket with Mitch Kramer. I was super jealous. Fun fact: Catherine scored the part because she was actually the film's casting assistant.  Now: Now Catherine is a middle school Language Arts teacher and writer in Austin, Texas. She has her own blog, ""Of Course I Write Romance Novels,"" and is a member of the Romance Writers of America. She's also learning to play Whitesnake on her accordion and has a great working knowledge of Astrology. Rory Cochrane as ""Ron Slater""  Then: Lovable Ron Slater was the long-haired hippie always ready with a silly catchphrase at the ready like, ""Hey man ... are you cool?"" or ""Check ya later."" Now: Since the movie, Rory has done relatively well for himself, appearing in ""Empire Records"" alongside his ""Dazed and Confused"" costars Ben Affleck, Jason London, and Renee Zellweger-who made a cameo in the film and was his live-in girlfriend for four years-as well as the Richard Linklater film ""A Scanner Darkly."" Most recently he was in the movie ""Public Enemies"" with Johnny Depp and a series regular on ""24"" and ""CSI: Miami."" He's reuniting with another one of his ""Dazed"" costars, Milla Jovovich, in the 2011 film ""Bringing Up Bobby"" written by actress Famke Janssen. The Frisky: Mel Gibson's set pranks humiliated his female co-stars . Anthony Rapp as ""Tony Olson""  Then: Why wouldn't Sabrina fall for the sweet, sensitive intellectual Tony Olson? He was dreamy.  Now: While Anthony continues to do some film and television, he has achieved major success in the theater world. You may have seen him as struggling musician Mark Cohen in ""Rent,"" both the original Broadway production and the film. The Frisky: 7 celeb ladies who are missing their belly buttons . Michelle Burke as ""Jodi Kramer""  Then: Jodi Kramer was Mitch's sexy, two-timing, meddling older sis.  Now: Currently, Michelle is working on a movie with Miley Cyrus, Demi Moore, Ashley Greene, and Thomas Jane called ""LOL: Laughing Out Loud."" Gee, I really hope the film lives up to its title. If Michelle is as funny as she was as Connie Conehead on film, everything should be fine. TM & © 2010 TMV, Inc. | All Rights Reserved .","Affleck played haze-happy, fifth-year senior Fred O'Bannion .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Prita Mulyasari has become an ""accidental hero"" in Indonesia, spawning a social movement among many Indonesians in support of her battle with the country's legal system. About a year ago, she sent a private email to a list of friends complaining that the Omni Hospital in Jakarta had misdiagnosed her illness. Somehow the hospital got hold of the email and reported her to police, pressing charges of defamation. That was only the beginning. The police promptly arrested the mother of two, throwing her in jail for two weeks before her trial had even begun. Then, she was tried and convicted in a civil suit -- twice -- before the criminal proceedings had even started. On December 4, a court ruled in the hospital's favor and ordered Prita Mulyasari to pay more than US$20,000 in damages -- many times the annual salary of many Indonesians. ""For one year, I've gone through this legal process,"" said Prita, who is known by her first name. ""There's no certainty in the legal system. It's not clear at all."" She smiled softly and said, ""I'm just very, very confused and really very tired."" Her case has gotten widespread attention -- and public sympathy -- among Indonesians who believe she has been treated unfairly by a legal system that favors the rich at the expense of the poor. ""When you've got money you can do anything,"" said her lawyer, OC Kaligis. ""It's always the small people that are victims of this injustice."" The hospital, prosecutors and -- even Prita -- did not expect what happened next: a major support movement driven by the power of Indonesia's growing middle class and its mastery of social media. It started on sites such as Facebook and Twitter. ""Free Prita"" became the rallying cry. Images of the clearly distraught Prita, separated from her two young children, generated a wave of sympathy from ordinary Indonesians and quickly made her a cause celebre. Soon, the country's leading politicians were flocking to have their photos taken with this soft-spoken woman in a modest, Muslim headscarf. ""She's just like us,"" explained one Indonesian housewife. ""If this could happen to her, it could happen to me, to any one of us."" When the courts handed down the fine of $20,000 -- a small fortune in Indonesia -- bloggers began ""A Coin for Prita"" campaign. They encouraged the public to send in 100 rupiah coins -- little more than a cent -- to help pay off Prita's fine. ""When we heard about the fine, we all thought, that's just not right,"" said Yusro Santoso, one of the organizers behind the campaign. ""We thought the courts have treated this case as worthless as small change. And we thought, okay, then let's collect all the small change to at least pay that fine."" The response was overwhelming. From street performers to business tycoons, thousands of Indonesians sent in contributions. The vast majority were coin collections, but a few wealthy donors chipped in thousands of dollars in cash. ""It's a sign of reprimand to all the judges and the police that you can't do what you want anymore,"" explained Prita's lawyer, OC Kaligis. ""The conscience of the small people, they are crying why is there no justice for them?"" Volunteers stayed up until the early morning hours for a week to count the coins that kept coming in. Schoolchildren were seen counting next to retirees. One wealthier woman had enlisted the help of her entire domestic staff to help count. ""Seems to me she's not at fault, right?"" said one girl still in her school uniform delivering a collection of coins from her class. ""Everyone has the right to criticize others, yet she was sentenced for it."" By December 20th, volunteers counted more than $60,000 -- far exceeding the amount needed to pay off the fine. No one seems quite sure what to do with all this generosity. Organizers have handed it all over to Prita, but she insists the money needs to go to charity. ""In my heart, my wish is to be acquitted. This money from the people shouldn't be given to people who already have money,"" she told CNN. ""They probably earn that money in a month. But for us, it really means a lot. This money has to be used for humanitarian purposes. It's the people's money, so it has to be for the people to navigate the justice and health system."" In the wake of the public outcry, the Omni Hospital has offered to drop the case and waive the fine that Prita owes -- if she submits a written apology. The Omni Hospital maintains that the previous court rulings were fair and just. Omni's lawyers have an interesting take on the ""Coin for Prita"" phenomenon. ""This coin collection, legally speaking, is effectively an admission of Prita's guilt, even though she is still appealing,"" Heribertus Hartojo, Omni's lawyer told CNN. ""We have won in the state court and the high court. Prita was proven to be guilty. So, of course, we expect the same result in any appeal."" But Prita is refusing to apologize. Instead, she is vowing to appeal to the country's Supreme Court while she waits for criminal proceedings to conclude. She also plans a countersuit against Omni hospital. ""I think Indonesians are just tired. They are fed up with the injustices in this country,"" she says. ""These coins can speak for us. After all, anyone can give a coin so anyone can be a part of this.""","Prita Mulyasari sent email to friends complaining a Jakarta hospital misdiagnosed her illness .

"(CNN) -- A defiant Donald Sterling calls the NBA ""a band of hypocrites and bullies"" in a written statement the longtime Los Angeles Clippers co-owner sent to the media through one of his lawyers. He also wrote that the NBA needs to examine its own ""discriminatory practices"" rather than try to take away his personal property. ""We have to fight for the rights of all Americans. We have to fight these despicable monsters,"" Sterling wrote in the statement, provided to CNN by Bobby Samini. In Sterling's 420-plus word statement, he says the NBA has been able to ""exact its reign of terror"" through revenues from the fans. He slams new Commissioner Adam Silver, who has worked for the league since 1992 but took over the top spot in February. Sterling said Silver is ""focusing his energy on violating my rights, attempting to take my property, and signing autographs for TMZ."" Talking to ABC about the Sterling accusation at the halftime of an NBA finals game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Miami Heat, Silver said he had ""no idea what he's talking about."" ""This is about Donald Sterling and his conduct,"" the commissioner said. ""And if he wants to litigate, he'll litigate."" Sterling said the NBA has been sued many times for discrimination. He said Silver and the NBA need to look at their own conduct and the conduct of the other 29 owners in the league and they are centering their attention on him to ""draw attention away from their own discriminatory and repulsive conduct."" The statement comes as a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN that Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly Sterling, intends to ask a California probate court on Wednesday morning to ""verify her standing"" as the head of the family trust and rule that she had the right to sell the Clippers. Referring to this apparent disagreement between the Sterlings about what to do with the Clippers, Adam Silver said the NBA is planning to step back and let the situation play itself out. ""This is really now a dispute between the Sterlings,"" he told ABC. ""So we're on the sidelines."" Shelly Sterling announced May 30 that she had reached an agreement to sell the franchise that her husband bought in 1981 to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for a record $2 billion. Technically, a family trust owns the Clippers. Last month, two sources with detailed knowledge of the situation told CNN that two neurologists have deemed Donald Sterling to be mentally incapacitated. According to one of the sources, there is a provision in the Sterling family trust that says if either Donald Sterling or Shelly Sterling become mentally incapacitated, then the other becomes the sole trustee. Donald Sterling is mentally sound, another lawyer, Maxwell Blecher, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""It strikes me as totally incredible to argue that this man -- I talk to him every day -- is incapable of making decisions and is mentally incompetent,"" Blecher said on Tuesday afternoon. ""And I don't believe any court is going to make a finding to the contrary."" Donald Sterling initially vowed to fight the sale and filed a lawsuit against the NBA, then said he was going along with the sale -- until Monday, when he again pulled his support. ""From the onset, I did not want to sell the Los Angeles Clippers. I have worked for 33 years to build the team,"" Donald Sterling said. Sterling, 80, has been embroiled in controversy since a recording of a conversation with his friend V. Stiviano surfaced. The recording included a series of racist comments. The comments, first posted on TMZ, sparked outrage among NBA players, executives and fans. The commissioner fined Sterling $2.5 million and banned him for life from the NBA. In Tuesday's statement, Sterling said he has apologized for the remarks and his apology is sincere. He also made inflammatory comments to CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" about African-Americans, which the NBA had planned to use as part of its evidence against Donald Sterling in an owners' meeting where a vote would be taken on whether to terminate Sterling's ownership rights. The meeting was canceled. His lawsuit makes clear that he believes the NBA has no right to force such a sale, and the league was wrong in banning him for life and fining him. In addition to damages, the lawsuit seeks a restraining order.

Jason McWilliams, 25, turned himself in Sunday night to detectives who are investigating the shooting at the Centennial Hill Bar and Grill in Montgomery early Saturday. Doe B, a 22-year-old Montgomery native whose real name is Glenn Thomas, and Kimbrele Johnson, a 21-year-old college student, died from gunshots, police said. Six other people were wounded. ""The circumstances surrounding the shooting were initially unknown, but further investigation indicates that the shooting stemmed from an ongoing dispute between McWilliams and Thomas,"" a Montgomery Police news release said Monday. A patch over Doe B's right eye became the entertainer's trademark after he was wounded in a previous shooting, according to Billboard magazine. Coincidentally, the mug shot of McWilliams, who is being held without bond on two counts of capital murder, showed the suspect wearing a black patch over his right eye. On the cover of his new album, ""Baby Jesus,"" a baby is pictured dressed like Doe B with the eye patch and with additional bullet wounds on the left arm. The nightclub where Saturday's shooting happened got a reputation with city officials after a shooting there last year, which Montgomery media reported. Back then, it was called the Rose Supper Club, but it changed its name after the violence. Montgomery's mayor shut the club down after the latest violence. The city had given Centennial Hill repeated warnings, Mayor Todd Strange said in a statement. ""I believe it is not a matter of 'if,' but 'when' the next tragic incident occurs at this business,"" Strange said. ""That is unacceptable, and that is why we have ordered the business to be closed effective immediately."" Thomas had recently been on tour. Colorful placards announcing his performances marked the path of his December concert rounds through his state and to Atlanta. He then returned to the club in his hometown, where his life was taken. CNN's Ben Brumfield and Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","Murder suspect Jason McWilliams, 25, turned himself in Sunday night .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Chinese farm admitted to dumping dead pigs into Huangpu River, which had about 6,000 bloated carcasses pulled from its water this week, state media reported. The labels in the ears of the pigs indicated Jiaxing City as their birthplace, according to Xinhua, the Chinese state-run news agency. The city is south of Shanghai, in the Zhejiang Province. Earlier, local Chinese media had suggested the dead pigs had come from the area with local officials blaming dumping on ""local pig farmers who lack awareness of laws and regulations."" The city's government said a total of 70,000 pigs died from ""crude raising techniques and extreme weather"" at the beginning of the year, according to Xinhua. But it also insisted that the collected corpses were disposed safely. The selling of diseased pigs appears to be a bigger problem in the area as on Wednesday, a court in Zhejiang Province, issued prison sentences for 46 people convicted of selling meat from diseased pigs, Xinhua said. The sentences ranged from six months to 6 and a half years in prison, the report said. Shanghai water concerns . The ""dead pig dumping scandal"" in Shanghai has been growing since Friday, Xinhua reported. Chinese officials have said they expect to find more carcasses in the river -- but they insist the Shanghai water is fine. The scandal has incredulous residents one-upping each other on the country's popular microblog service, Sina Weibo. ""Since when is finding dead rotting pigs in a major river not a public health problem?"" Weibo user, @Muyunsanjun2011, asked. ""Answer: When this happens in China."" A report in the Shanghai Daily newspaper earlier Wednesday said that no pollution had been found in the river. ""Since apparently, the water has not been contaminated, big leaders, please go ahead and have the first drink,"" Weibo user,@_Nina_Burbage quipped. However, a later water sample was found to contain a porcine circovirus, Xinhua said. The World Health Organization says there are two types of porcine circoviruses, but neither is known to cause disease in humans. An official from a Shanghai water plant was quoted in Xinhua saying, ""If the water is contaminated, we will put more the disinfectants and activated carbon to purify the water."" 'Dead pigs all around' Sanitation workers, clad in masks and plastic suits, have been fishing the bruised pig bodies surfacing in the Huangpu River. The pink, decomposing blobs have wreaked foul odors and alarmed residents. ""There were dead pigs all around and they really stunk,"" one local resident told CNN. ""Of course, we're worried, but what can you do about it? It's water that we have to drink and use."" If the water treatment process is very effective and can handle the sudden glut of contaminants, it's possible to minimize the impact, said Julian Fyfe, a senior research consultant specializing in water quality at the University of Technology Sydney. However, ""most treatment plants would not be designed to accommodate that level of shock loading. It's such an unusual event,"" he added. Fyfe spoke in general terms about water quality issues, as he is not involved with Shanghai's water treatment. ""If they are chlorinating heavily, which a lot of places may do, especially if they've got a very polluted water body to start with, then the effects could potentially be small,"" Fyfe said. Pig corpses that have been in the water for days would leak blood, intestinal fluids and other pollutants, which could alter the taste and color of tap water. Many residents have begun drinking bottled water due to fears of contamination, according to the Global Times, a Chinese newspaper. Ripe for satire . The agricultural commission in China said it had tested organ samples from the pigs and the results suggested the animals had contracted a porcine circovirus. On Tuesday, national officials acknowledged the pig incident in a press conference Tuesday. ""According to monitoring statistics, there's no evidence to show that there's an outbreak of any major animal epidemics,"" said Chen Xiaohua, the national vice minister of agriculture. ""But in the meantime, the incident shows how we need to improve our work in the future."" The situation appeared ripe for satire. A movie poster for ""Life of Pi"" was doctored and replaced with ""Life of Pigs,"" with the main character's boat filled with dead pigs, and the water dotted with the bruised corpses. One weibo user, @Fujiadiandianxiaoya, joked: ""I finally figured out why drinking boiled water makes me gain weight -- because it is in fact pork soup!"" Local authorities say they're looking into how the pigs ended up in the river. CNN's Madison Park and Dayu Zhang reported from Hong Kong; CNN's Josh Levs reported from Atlanta. CNN's David McKenzie and Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report.","NEW: Chinese media say a pig farm admits to dumping pigs into Huangpu River .

"London (CNN) -- Channeling his best Muhammad Ali, Usain Bolt showed his greatness Thursday on the track then made sure everyone was clear on the brilliance they had just witnessed. ""I have done something that no one else has done before,"" the Jamaican superstar declared after winning the 200 meters to complete a sweep of the showcase sprints -- the 100 and 200 meters -- for the second consecutive Games. ""I am the greatest,"" he said. And Bolt has one more race, and the opportunity to become the first man to win a double-triple -- if Jamaica can win the 4x100 relay as it did in Beijing. Considering his countrymen Yohan Blake and Warren Weir were second and third in the 200, they seem a strong favorite. At the Olympic Stadium, Bolt, running in an outside lane, came off the turn well ahead going down the home stretch. ""There wasn't a doubt after I won the 100 meters,"" Bolt said. ""I was really confident. Loads of people were talking, but they can stop talking; I am a legend."" Bolt, who at 26 is in his prime, can't say if he'll try for a third Olympics. He talked to Blake, also the runner-up at 100 meters, before the 200 final. ""I said, 'Yohan, it's not your time, it's my time. After the Olympics, it's your time.' '"" Blake agreed warning people and his competitors to watch out at next year's world championships. As Bolt made his history, the U.S. women's football team got revenge for its loss in the 2011 World Cup final, beating Japan 2-1 to win its third consecutive Olympic gold medal and fourth overall. Carli Lloyd scored twice for the United States, which also got several classic saves including a spectacular late-game diving effort from goalie Hope Solo to preserve the win. ""It's a team effort, but I'm proud to contribute finally,"" Solo said. Lloyd notched up a goal in each half, with an early header off a cross from Alex Morgan and a long run up the right side of the field that ended with a cracking strike from just outside the penalty area. ""It opened up and I just kept going and just unleashed it,"" she said of the second goal, which provided the match-winner. An Olympic record crowd of 80,203 watched the match, played at Wembley Stadium. Canada defeated France in the closing moments of their bronze-medal game to take the third spot on the podium, with the winning goal from the boot of midfielder Diana Matheson. Another American women's team won gold Thursday when the water polo squad defeated Spain 8-5. ""We played great defense today and that is what won us the medal,"" Brenda Villa said. For Villa, who had been on silver medal winning teams in 2000 and 2008 and the bronze medalists in 2004, it was her last competitive game. ""I got my fairytale ending,"" she said. The U.S. continues its successful athletics meet as Ashton Eaton won the decathlon and Christian Taylor won the triple jump. The Americans have won 24 of their Olympics-leading 90 medals at Olympic Stadium. The crowd there was also treated to a world record in the men's 800 meters as Kenyan David Rudisha ran 1:40.91. ""To come here and get a world record is unbelievable,"" he said. ""I had no doubt about winning. Today the weather was beautiful. I decided to go for it."" In the women's 4x100 meter relay, the United States had the fastest qualifying time with a 41.64, just .04 away from an Olympic record set by East Germany in 1980. Female fighters firsts . History was made in the boxing ring Thursday, as Great Britain's Nicola Adams became the first woman ever to win an Olympic gold and Team USA's Claressa Shields followed with the middleweight title. ""I think I will wear (the gold medal) every day for the first year,"" Shields said. Adams' triumph in the flyweight final over China's Ren Cancan was greeted by ear-splitting screams of delight by the home crowd. ""It sounds really good, it's like a dream come true,"" Adams said. ""I've wanted this all my life and it's finally come true. I'd really like to thank all the supporters here and elsewhere. I'm so happy and overwhelmed with joy right now."" Shortly after, Ireland's Katie Taylor came out on top in the first Olympic women's lightweight final, making a spirited comeback in the last round to beat Russia's Sofya Ochigava by 10 points to 8. Taylor fell to her knees in joy and relief as the victory was announced, giving her country its first gold medal of the Games, before doing a lap of honor around the ring draped in the Irish flag. Photos: The youngest female boxer . Shields' 19-12 victory against Russia's Nadezda Torlopova is a remarkable achievement for the 17-year-old from Flint, Michigan -- and makes her the first American woman to take an Olympic boxing gold. Flyweight Marlen Esparza, from Texas, took a bronze. Women's boxing was an exhibition sport in the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis but only made its debut as a full Olympic event at the London 2012 Games. It has proved hugely popular with the crowds and seen skillful sparring in the ring, defying the critics who argued boxing was a man's game. Read more: Sex, Games and Olympic Village life . Roller coaster day for Pistorius . There was disappointment in the Olympic Stadium earlier Thursday for those hoping to see South Africa's Oscar Pistorius, the first double amputee to compete at the Games, run in the 4 x 400-meter relay. The baton never reached the hands of the man nicknamed the Blade Runner, for the artificial blades on which he runs, after the second South African runner, Ofentse Mogawane, fell before he could pass it over. However, in a dramatic turn of events, the South African team was reinstated on appeal and will contest the final Friday, after officials accepted that Mogawane had fallen as a result of obstruction by a Kenyan runner. Pistorius was delighted by the turnaround in his team's fortunes, the official Olympic website reported. ""It's been absolutely phenomenal, just stepping out there again today on the track in front of a crowd like this has been awesome. This whole experience has just been mind-blowing for me,"" he is quoted as saying. And the relay final won't be the last time for the crowds to see Pistorius in action, as he's set to return in the Paralympic Games later this summer to defend his 100-meter, 200-meter and 400-meter titles. Trinidad and Tobago won the first 4 x 400-meter relay heat, with Great Britain and Cuba in second and third. Team USA, the defending champions, and Russia also qualified for the final, as did the tiny Caribbean nation of the Bahamas. Venezuela also made it into the relay final on appeal, meaning nine teams will contest the final for the first time. Read more: Gender testing 'imperfect' for female athletes . Women's hoops, volleyball finals set . At North Greenwich Arena, site of the basketball tournaments, the American women earned a spot in the gold medal game, beating fierce rival Australia 86-73. The U.S. was forced to rally after trailing at halftime by four points. ""We've played a lot of basketball in the last month and I don't think anyone's played better against us than Australia in that first half,"" U.S. coach Geno Auriemma said. Tamika Catchings said the team recommitted itself during the intermission. ""At halftime we had a heart-to-heart about where we want to be,"" she said. The U.S. women's volleyball team made it through to the final with a win over South Korea, where it will face Brazil. Team GB stars at the horse park . Over at Greenwich Park on day 13 of the Games, Great Britain's Charlotte Dujardin, took gold in the individual dressage final, only two days after helping Team GB win the team dressage gold for the first time. Dujardin, who only started riding in top level dressage competitions last year, held the Dutch rider Adelinde Cornelissen to silver. Team GB's Laura Bechtolsheimer took bronze and compatriot Carl Hester, who trains Dujardin on her horse Valegro, took fifth. Dujardin got ready for the event Thursday without the help of her coach, Hester. ""I warmed up on my own. I'm pretty confident with the horse,"" she said. ""I've had Carl in my left ear for the past nine or 10 days. So, if I haven't learned by now, I need shooting."" The latest successes cap a remarkable Games for Britain's equestrian competitors, who have also taken medals in show jumping and eventing. Read more: Where is Australia? Odds and ends . China won a gold medal for the 33rd consecutive day over the past three Olympics, one day better than the United States' previous mark set in the Games of 1996 to 2004. Hopes were high for Team GB's Keri-Anne Payne, the 10-kilometer open water world champion and Beijing silver medalist, to repeat her success in the Serpentine lake in Hyde Park. After a hard-fought two-hour race Payne could only manage fourth, though, with gold going to Hungary's Eva Risztov and silver to America's Hayley Anderson. Thousands of spectators gathered in the sunshine on the banks of the lake, more usually home to swans and geese, to watch the grueling swimming marathon. Earlier, Germany took two golds in a busy morning on the waters of Eton Dorney lake. One went to Franziska Weber and Tina Dietze, who clinched top spot in the women's kayak double (K2), with Hungary in silver and Poland taking bronze. The other was won by German duo Kurt Kuschela and Peter Kretschmer, who triumphed in the men's kayak double (K2) 1,000-meter canoe sprint final. After a slow start, Australia is now climbing the medal table. Their latest victory came courtesy of Tate Smith, Dave Smith, Murray Stewart, and Jacob Clear, who took gold in the men's kayak four (K4) 1,000-meter canoe sprint. Danuta Kozak took gold for Hungary in the women's kayak single (K1) 500-meter final. Video: How athletes are partying in London .","Usain Bolt captures first Olympic sprint double-double .

"(CNN) -- The wearable technology movement is in full effect, and exercise-based activity trackers lead the way. Now, it's becoming child's play. Leapfrog, the maker of education-oriented tablets and apps for children, has unveiled LeapBand, a wearable activity tracker designed with kids in mind. Selling for $40 and designed for children ages 4-7, the LeapBand ""encourages active play and healthy habits"" with 50 different games and other challenges. It will be available in August, the company said in a written release. ""We understand that helping a child reach their potential not only includes making sure they are versed on the ABCs and 123s, but they are encouraged through play to establish healthy habits and get the exercise they need every day,"" said Dr. Jody Sherman LeVos, director of LeapFrog's Learning Team. ""LeapBand is a great way to get kids up and active and help them develop a strong foundation for healthy lifestyles."" The band fits around the user's wrist and looks a lot like a kids version of a smartwatch. By performing actions like ""walk like a crab,"" ""spin like a helicopter"" or ""pop like popcorn,"" kids can unlock new games and a group of Pokemon-like ""digital pets"" on the device. The band connects to a website or app that lets parents monitor their children's activities and choose which challenges they can select, and which they can't. Unlike some adult fitness trackers, what can be done with the information that the LeapBand collects is limited, abiding by federal regulations on data-collection of children. Data can be provided to parents, but no one else (like advertisers). The band will be available online and at retailers in the United States. It comes in pink, green and blue. Moving past smartphones and tablets, wearable tech has become arguably the hottest digital trend in the past year or so. Google Glass and the Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch are just two of the most high-profile wearables that have joined fitness trackers like FitBit, Jawbone and Nike FuelBand (which appears on its way out). Apple has not yet entered the game, although virtually everyone in the tech world expects a long-anticipated smartwatch n the near future.","LeapFrog is making a fitness tracker for kids .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Is Congress capable of doing anything right? It's a question worth asking as Democrats and Republicans threaten for the third time this year to shut down the federal government. Americans faced the same prospect during spring budget talks and the summer debt ceiling debate. Now it's happening over what was expected to be passage of a routine bill to fund Washington through mid-November while replenishing disaster relief funds. Friday is the latest deadline to avoid a partial shutdown. The Federal Emergency Management Agency -- tasked with helping states hit hard by Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Lee, and a series of recent wildfires and tornadoes -- will likely run out of money even sooner. The details have differed with each threatened shutdown, but the basic plot remains the same. Democrats want to spend more while Republicans are using a series of statutory deadlines to force an agenda of spending cuts. The two sides have proven incapable of compromising until the last possible second. Meanwhile, analysts warn that the repeated partisan brinksmanship is undermining consumer and business confidence, and may help bring on a double-dip recession. Congress bickers and you suffer. They brawl; your 401(k) falls. To make matters worse, there's no one villain to blame. If you want to know why Congress is repeatedly taking Washington to the brink and raising the country's collective economic anxiety, you have to look at a number of factors. Some are political, others perhaps psychological. We have a ""political system that looks manifestly broken,"" Democratic Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said last week. ""The gridlock and partisanship in Washington right now is disgusting,"" Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, said Monday. ""It's unacceptable for Congress to add more uncertainty to the marketplace by threatening another government shutdown."" Jon Krosnick, a professor of political science, communications, and psychology at Stanford University, highlights what psychologists refer to as a ""diffusion of responsibility"" -- a diminished sense of individual blame when a person acts as part of a much larger group. ""When people are told by the leadership of a group to do something, and lots of others are doing it as well, people feel less guilt in doing it,"" he says in reference to the hyper-partisan ""us versus them"" culture of Capitol Hill. ""In fact, they might feel more guilt if they don't follow orders."" People in every corner of the country are disgusted. Congress' approval ratings are abysmal -- hitting a record low of 14% in an August CNN/ORC International Poll. Can't we all just get along? Or at least not inflict pointless pain on ourselves? Barack Obama's campaign slogan was ""Yes We Can."" But the sad truth is -- no we can't. At least not judging from Congress' performance since the midterm elections. There are a number of explanations for Congress' behavior. None of them bodes well if you're hoping for more cooperation among Washington's power brokers. Start with the politics. Some experts say this year's repeated Capitol Hill showdowns reflect a political culture where the vital center has collapsed. Once upon a time, legislators known as liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats roamed the halls of power. Those days are pretty much gone. Today's congressmen and senators -- particularly on the tea-party-infused Republican side of the aisle -- are more fearful of primary than general election challenges. Growing numbers of federal elected officials are more worried about tending to a political base screaming for radical change than appealing to independent or crossover voters. This is especially true in the House, where districts are drawn with scientific precision to be overwhelmingly Democratic or Republican. Now more than ever congressional elections are a general election incumbency racket. The GOP landslide of 2010? Eighty-five percent of House incumbents won another term, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. And that was the lowest percentage since 1970. The changing rules of the political game have policy consequences. Congressmen seeking a long political career are probably better off catering to the wishes of their party's most extreme activists, not some vaguely defined middle-of-the-road voter. ""Some Republicans are ideological purists,"" said Adam Sheingate, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University. But ""others are running scared, fearful they could lose a primary challenge to a more extreme candidate."" Second, for all the talk of a growing independent electorate, there's evidence that voters themselves are more polarized. The rise of a more partisan, fragmented media may play a role in this development. More choice in news may be good, but it often comes at a cost of viewers and readers seeking affirmation of their opinions rather than a challenge to their world views. In that kind of an environment, analysts note, elected officials are more likely to be punished than rewarded for compromising with the other side. Third, a growing number of congressmen and senators -- especially those backed by the tea party -- are ideological true believers. If economic damage is inflicted by repeatedly taking the country to the brink, it may be seen as unfortunate but necessary in order to start turning the country in the right direction. ""There's a surgery metaphor here,"" says Krosnick. ""I have to cut you open to get the cancer out. And any surgery has risks."" Wendy Schiller, a Brown University political scientist, says that ""the fight now is really about dismantling the New Deal and the Great Society. It is about finishing what Ronald Reagan promised to do, but never really accomplished."" Schiller argues that ""there is a genuine belief among tea party Republicans that if you shut the government down, all the non-essential things that the federal government does go away, but the essential things -- such as Social Security and defense -- keep flowing. So you strip the federal government to its bare essentials and see how it runs."" Tea partiers, Schiller says, ""may be hoping that the American people actually accept a stripped-down federal government, and the pendulum on federal spending finally turns their way. Of course, as in (the government shutdown of) 1995, that can backfire and simply remind voters how much they need most of what the federal government provides."" Fourth, some congressional Republicans may be calculating that a disgusted, alienated electorate is more likely to blame the incumbent party when they go to the polls in 2012. And while Republicans control the House, the incumbency label is usually tied to the party that controls the presidency. ""People are more unhappy with the Republicans than with the president,"" Krosnick says. Indeed, only 33% of Americans held a favorable view of the GOP in an August 5-7 CNN/ORC International survey -- a lower favorability rating than that for either President Obama or the Democratic Party as a whole. But a lot of congressional Republicans ""believe they have to do whatever is necessary to get Obama out of office"" and bring about major change, Krosnick argues. ""It's to their benefit to be able to communicate that government is stalled, inefficient, and unable to do anything on the average person's behalf,"" he says. ""So they may decide that they're willing to take a hit in public opinion right now if they think Obama will end up taking the hit in 2012."" Do members of Congress feel a sense of guilt for engaging in behavior that may be adding to the country's economic woes? ""They may very well feel guilty or conflicted,"" Krosnick says. ""No matter what they say publicly, it'd be hard to imagine the folks in Congress who are taking this approach and forcing these repeated confrontations aren't feeling somewhat conflicted if the result is some form of economic pain."" But any sense of guilt is likely mitigated -- particularly on the Republican side of the aisle -- by the creation of ""shared strategy"" and ""sense of mutual confidence"" for rank-and-file members, Krosnick claims. Krosnick also argues that there's a degree of separation between Capitol Hill and the rest of the country that makes it easier for some congressional officials to take steps that may be exacerbating the country's economic pain. ""You've got to work hard to convince people that the economic hit they just took is the direct fault of Washington,"" he says. ""They may draw a connection between Washington and the broader economic outlook in the country, but they rarely tie Washington to their personal financial situation. As for members of Congress, he adds, burning ideological imperatives can trump reports of economic distress among people they don't know and interact with rarely -- if ever. If the prognosis is grim, it may be worth remembering a line from that old congressional critic, Will Rogers. ""We cuss Congress,"" Rogers said. ""But they are all good fellows at heart, and if they wasn't in Congress, why, they would be doing something else against us that might be even worse.""","Congress is threatening the third potential government shutdown this year .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Google's chairman said Monday that he and other executives from the Internet search giant recently traveled to Cuba to advocate for greater access to the Internet. ""Access to the internet can bring better education, better business, and a more open, accountable government to Cuba,"" Chairman Eric Schmidt said in a statement. ""Our visit confirmed that the government recognizes some of the benefits of increasing access for Cubans, but it has not gone far enough in implementing the policy reforms needed to open the country to the web."" Cuba has the lowest level of Internet access in the Western hemisphere. ""If Cuba is trapped in the 1950's, the Internet of Cuba is trapped in the 1990s,"" Schmidt wrote in a blog post after visiting with three other executives from the Internet search giant to promote ""a free and open Internet."" Schmidt said on a posting on his Google+ account that the executives had traveled to the island with a U.S. Treasury business license. Under a five-decades-old embargo, U.S. citizens need to apply for U.S. government permission to visit Cuba or face potentially hefty fines. The visit, the first by a team from Google, was not reported in Cuba's official state media. The government tightly restricts access to the Internet but also regularly criticizes tech companies like Google for blocking certain services to users in Cuba. Cuban blogger and government critic Yoani Sanchez said the Google team met with her Friday at her apartment in Havana. On her online newspaper, she wrote that the executives complained about the slow speed of Internet connections in Cuba and restrictions on information. ""It was a night of technology without technology,"" Sanchez wrote on her site, 14ymedio. ""No one surfed the web on their mobile phone, that's not possible in Cuba, no one thought to show us the latest doodle (on the Google website)."" In 2013, the government opened navigation centers across the island where people can access the Internet. Though users lined up, many complained that the $4.50 hourly cost was too steep in a country where the median salary is about $20 a month. In his post, Schmidt said he met with government officials and Cuban techies skirting state restrictions on connectivity. ""Cuba will have to open its political and business economy,"" Schmidt wrote. ""And the US will have to overcome our history and open the embargo. Both countries have to do something that is hard to do politically, but it will be worth it.""

"(CNN) -- More than 10 years after her death, Linda Lovelace probably remains America's best known porn star (apologies to Jenna Jameson and Traci Lords). It's an unlikely distinction given that Lovelace -- by her own estimation -- only spent a total of two and a half weeks working in the adult film industry. But those two and a half weeks included shooting ""Deep Throat,"" the X-rated film that turned into a pop culture phenomenon after its release in 1972. It became the first adult film to cross over to mainstream audiences, earning an astounding $600 million. There are many reasons the film became such a breakout hit. Some have described ""Deep Throat"" as the first porno film that attempted to tell a story, albeit a ludicrous one. "" 'Deep Throat' had a plot,"" said Darwin Porter, author of ""Inside Linda Lovelace's Deep Throat: Degradation, Porno Chic and the Rise of Feminism."" ""I mean, not a great plot, but a plot. ""It had certain comedy overtones to it, too, and this was very unusual and bizarre (for a porno film at that time),"" Porter told CNN. Porter says ""Deep Throat"" also benefited from a legal and moral crusade waged against the film. ""So many people wanted to ban (the film), beginning with the government and certainly Mayor John Lindsay of New York,"" Porter said. ""When (Lindsay) banned it in New York, he made the movie famous all over America."" Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt offers a more straightforward explanation for the film's broad appeal. He told CNN it amounted to fascination with Lovelace's gift for a particular sex act suggested by the film's title. Flynt told CNN, ""I think it's the unique talent shown during the film is what piqued a lot of excitement."" The huge success of ""Deep Throat"" might lead some people to imagine that its star led a charmed life. But that was far from the case, to judge from the recent biopic, ""Lovelace,"" starring Amanda Seyfried in the title role. The film actually presents its audience with two versions of the Lovelace story. For most of the film, she is shown as being manipulated into porn by her then-husband, Chuck Traynor. But in an darker version of events shown toward the film's end from Lovelace's point of view, she is depicted as essentially a sex slave. Neither scenario is a happy one. Flynt, who says he knew Lovelace and Traynor, seems to believe the darker version. ""She was just being used every step of the way,"" he told CNN. ""It wasn't something where she'd wake up every morning and think, 'I can't wait to get to work in the morning.' That wasn't the situation."" Flynt said Traynor prostituted Lovelace, forcing her to make adult films. ""That type of coercion did exist,"" he said. ""I think she was being very much controlled by Chuck (Traynor). ... That's why I refer to him as a pimp."" But not everyone sees the matter as that black and white, including actor Chris Noth, who plays ""Deep Throat"" producer Anthony Romano in ""Lovelace."" ""I'm not clear if she was totally pushed into it,"" Noth told CNN. ""In the scope of what you can read and see about her, it's hard to believe that situation in totality."" Porter believes Lovelace was coerced into doing porn ""to a degree."" The author says Lovelace demonstrated considerably more free will during the three years after ""Deep Throat,"" during which, he says, the actress capitalized on her fame to run with a celebrity crowd. ""She dated the top stars of Hollywood, and nobody forced her to do that,"" Porter said. Porter claims many a Hollywood luminary -- including John Wayne, Burt Lancaster, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin -- was eager to ascertain whether Lovelace's sexual technique lived up to the legend. Porter says it was another member of the Rat Pack who helped her make the rounds of Hollywood's A-list. ""Sammy Davis Jr. did more than anyone to make her the queen of porno chic,"" Porter said. ""He suggested that the 'in thing' to do was to have a date with Linda Lovelace. He was virtually her publicist."" Lovelace eventually renounced ""Deep Throat"" and Hollywood. She divorced Traynor, married another man, raised a family and lived, in her words, as a ""typical housewife."" For a time, she publicly campaigned for the elimination of pornography. ""Linda Lovelace became a spokesman for the anti-pornography movement,"" Porter noted. ""She was adopted by the leading feminists, the most important of whom was Gloria Steinem."" This phase of Lovelace's life was to have been portrayed in the biopic. Demi Moore was cast to play Steinem, but she dropped out. The part then went to Sarah Jessica Parker, but her scenes were later cut from the film. Lovelace later split with the feminists. ""Linda felt that ultimately she was being used by them,"" Porter said. Lovelace, who preferred in later years to go by her married name, Linda Marciano, died in 2002 as a result of a car crash. Traynor, her ex-husband, died a few months later of a heart attack. Toward the end of Lovelace's life, her views on pornography and ""Deep Throat"" continued to evolve. ""She started attending porno conventions and started selling 'Deep Throat' memorabilia,"" Porter said. ""It was almost a turnaround, a reversal for her."" As for her legacy, Flynt says Lovelace will always be an icon because ""she was in the right place at the right time."" And that time, he said, was a turning point in the culture. ""At that point in our history the Supreme Court was trying to figure out how to deal with pornography,"" he told CNN. ""Suddenly 16 millimeter film was available and it wasn't long before Beta and VHS became available and you could move these movies directly into the homes. So you see a very budding industry there (in the '70s) that was no longer something that was in the seedy back room of some adult bookstore."" Porter also sees Lovelace as a historic figure. ""She did launch a billion dollar industry and she is the queen of it all -- a very unlikely queen, but history sometimes selects unusual people to put on thrones.""","More than 10 years after her death, Linda Lovelace remains a porn icon .
Over the course of her career, she embraced and denounced ""Deep Throat""
Some, like Larry Flynt, believe Lovelace was used as a sex slave by her husband ."
"(CNN) -- For five turbulent years, ""Breaking Bad"" has charted the underworld rise and moral decline of Walter White, the mild-mannered Albuquerque chemistry teacher who evolves into a ruthless drug lord after being diagnosed with cancer. On Sunday, August 11, after 54 increasingly dark chapters of the fearless AMC drama, we begin Walt's final ride. It's probably about time. It's a testament to the power of ""Breaking Bad"" that it keeps you invested in its characters even after some of them do horrible things. But it's not easy to watch a gentle family man -- the goofy dad from ""Malcolm in the Middle!"" -- morph into a megalomaniacal monster. And the show can't sustain Walt's high-wire act much longer without losing all plausibility. Among AMC's marquee shows, ""Breaking Bad"" has never attained the retro-chic cachet of ""Mad Men"" or the big ratings of ""The Walking Dead."" But it's won seven Emmys -- mostly acting nods for star Bryan Cranston and sidekick Aaron Paul -- and received widespread critical acclaim for its taut writing, vivid characters and inventive jolts of violence. 8 ways to get your 'Breaking Bad' fix in Albuquerque . Like ""The Sopranos"" before it, the show is about a middle-aged father of two whose seemingly mundane suburban existence -- wife, kids, swimming pool -- conceals toxic secrets. In both shows, Walt and Tony Soprano must grapple with family tensions while keeping a tenuous grip on their criminal empires. Unlike Walt, however, Tony never developed the world's most abominable mid-life crisis. One of the greatest strengths of ""Breaking Bad"" is how its plotlines pit characters -- Walt, wife Skyler, meth-cook partner Jesse, DEA agent brother-in-law Hank and assorted drug-world bad guys -- against each other in a complex, ever-shifting geometry of alliances and manipulations. How will these machinations play out in the show's final act? We're about to find out. Here are five questions ""Breaking Bad"" fans may be pondering as the show begins its last eight episodes (SPOILER ALERT: Read no further if you're not caught up). What will Hank do now that he suspects Walt? Federal agent Hank Schrader has long been obsessed with nailing his near-mythical ""Heisenberg,"" the shadowy figure supplying crystal meth to most of the American Southwest. But he has no conclusive evidence against Walt, and his new chief suspect is married to the sister of Hank's wife, who will not be pleased to see her family torn apart. Complicating things further: Unbeknownst to Hank, Walt's drug money paid for Hank's medical care after he was seriously wounded by members of a Mexican cartel. And it won't do wonders for Hank's career when people discover his elusive meth king was right under his nose all along. Hank's got to tread carefully here. What will become of Jesse? When we last saw Jesse Pinkman, he had grown weary of the bloody criminal lifestyle and had parted ways with Walt. The street-smart, but emotionally fragile Jesse has somehow managed to retain his humanity amid the horrors engulfing him, and many viewers are rooting for him to find a new life. Will he reunite with ex-girlfriend Andrea and her son Brock? Invest his drug money in a new venture? Uncover Walt's betrayals and seek vengeance? Either way, Jesse would appear to deserve some redemption. Whether he gets it -- ""Breaking Bad"" is rarely predictable -- is another question. How 'Breaking Bad' should end, according to Bryan Cranston . Can Skyler keep it together? Oh, poor Skyler. She has witnessed her husband launch a secret life of crime without her knowledge, lie repeatedly, endanger her and their children and become a callous sociopath. She's trapped in a horrific situation. No wonder she tried to drown herself in the backyard pool. But Skyler is also shrewd and resourceful. She knows she's become complicit in Walt's crimes, and that for the sake of her freedom and their kids she needs to keep his secret. Unless, of course, she finds some brilliant way to extricate herself. What was up with that flash-forward scene of Walt in the diner? This prologue scene at the start of Season 5 sure offers some tantalizing clues. It takes place almost a year in the future, on Walt's 52nd birthday. Walt has grown his hair back, although he coughs and pops some pills, suggesting his cancer may have returned. He is alone and seems paranoid, glancing about the diner anxiously before meeting his gun dealer and opening the trunk of a car to reveal a machine gun. Why does he need a machine gun? Also, Walt shows the waitress a New Hampshire driver's license with his photo and a fake name on it. Did he go underground and flee to New Hampshire? And if so, why did he come back to New Mexico? The episode is named after New Hampshire's state slogan -- ""Live Free or Die."" Hmm. Read into that what you will. How will the series end? In other words, will Walt die? It would seem fitting, given how many other lives he's cut short or ruined. A cancer relapse is possible, if not all that dramatic. Prison would be an anticlimax, and seeing him and his family survive intact, ""Sopranos"" style, doesn't seem realistic. There's no shortage of people who might want to kill him: Jesse is probably the leading candidate here, although Hank or even Skyler could surprise us. Do the machine gun and the ""Scarface"" scene foreshadow a last-stand shootout? Will Walt finally sample his own product and die of a hugely ironic overdose? Fake his own death and sneak off quietly to Vegas? Series creator Vince Gilligan will likely opt for a climax that's unexpected yet somehow makes sense. Gilligan told TV critics last month that ""I think most folks are going to dig the ending."" Let's hope so. In eight more weeks, fans of ""Breaking Bad"" will finally know everything.","The final eight episodes of acclaimed AMC drama ""Breaking Bad"" begin Sunday .

"Cairo (CNN) -- A day after at least 580 died amid ferocious clashes between protesters and security forces, Egypt's government defended its actions in the face of sweeping condemnation -- insisting its troops fired in self-defense and weren't even responsible for many of the deaths. The violence stirred world leaders, some of them longtime Egyptian allies, to sharply criticize the Cairo government for going too far in its treatment of supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy, whom the military forced out of office several weeks ago. In addition to the hundreds killed, the Egyptian Health Ministry reports more than 4,000 were injured Wednesday in clashes that began when security forces moved in to break up protesters demonstrating in support of Morsy, according to state TV. There is no disputing the violence was Egypt's worst since the 2011 revolution that ousted President Hosni Mubarak. Yet Egypt's ambassador to Great Britain said his government's forces had done what it needed to do, and done it responsibly, blaming protesters for inciting and carrying out the violence. ""What the Egyptian government did, and the police, is an obligation from any state towards its people, to defend its interests and to protect them,"" said Ambassador Ashraf Elkholy. ""And 48 days of occupying an area in Egypt, stopping civilians going to their homes or their businesses or their schools, is unaccepted in any community."" The Muslim Brotherhood -- the Islamist group that Morsy had led and that was the target of the crackdown, which it says left even more of its supporters dead -- had a very different take. Its officials have characterized the government's action as a massacre and vowed to continue protests until Morsy is restored to power. ""The protests never stopped throughout the night and we will continue our sit-ins and demonstrations all over the country until democracy and the legitimate rule are restored in Egypt,"" Muslim Brotherhood leader Essam Elerian said Thursday. True to Elerian's word, pro-Morsy protesters kept up the pressure on the interim government, staging a sit-in in Nasr City, blocking a road near the country's iconic pyramids and storming a government building in Giza, according to state media. Authorities evacuated the building, which caught on fire. Four people also died Thursday in clashes between Muslim Brotherhood members and residents of the city, state-run Nile TV said. State-run TV also said Morsy supporters were attacking police stations, hospitals and government buildings in areas outside Cairo, despite a state of emergency declared Wednesday by the military-backed interim government that limits public gatherings and gives more power to security forces to make arrests. Security forces were active overnight Thursday as well, including entering a mosque in the Nasr City section of Cairo where the bodies of people killed in Wednesday's violence were being held. State TV reported that Morsy supporters left the mosque after being searched -- peaceably after negotiations -- and five ambulances left with the bodies. Adding to the tension, the Interior Ministry announced that police would be using live ammunition to fend off any further attacks on government buildings or security forces. That announcement came as yet more protests were expected on Friday, which raised the possibility of more violence. Gehad El-Haddad, a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman, tweeted that anti-government protests would start Friday from mosques around Cairo and converge at a massive rally in Ramses Square in the heart of the capital. Tellingly, El-Haddad coined what was expected to come as a ""Friday of Anger."" Obama condemns Egyptian military crackdown on civilians . World condemnation . The bloodshed that's already occurred has brought criticism from officials from numerous countries, threatening to further destabilize Egypt's already precarious economy and political situation. Among them is U.S. President Barack Obama, who accused the Egyptian government of choosing violence and arbitrary arrests over an opportunity to resolve its crisis through peaceful dialogue. World urges Egypt to show restraint . He further announced the cancellation of joint U.S.-Egyptian military training exercises scheduled for next month -- a move Pentagon spokesman George Little shows Washington's ""strong objection to recent events"" -- and warned that the traditional cooperation between the two nations ""cannot continue as usual when civilians are being killed in the streets."" Obama was among those who urged Egyptian leaders to lift a monthlong state of emergency put in place Wednesday. The declaration mirrors the kind of stifling police state that the nation lived through under Mubarak, before the Egyptian people rose up in protests that resulted in his overthrow and eventually Morsy's rise to power as the country's first democratically elected president. Pleading for calm, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay asked for an investigation into the violence. ""The number of people killed or injured, even according to the government's figures, point to an excessive, even extreme, use of force against demonstrators,"" she said. ""There must be an independent, impartial, effective and credible investigation of the conduct of the security forces. Anyone found guilty of wrongdoing should be held to account."" The U.N. Security Council convened an urgent meeting Thursday evening on the crisis. ""It is important ... that the parties exercise maximum restraint, and there was a common desire to stop the violence and advance national reconciliation,"" Argentine U.N. Ambassador Maria Cristina Perceval said on behalf of the council members. Germany, France and other nations summoned Egypt's ambassadors to their nations to express dismay over the violence, with Italy typical among them in criticizing the ""force used by police (as) brutal, disproportionate and ... not justifiable."" Denmark suspended economic aid to the country. As to the United States -- which provides about $1.6 billion in annual aid to Egypt -- it is continuing to review such programs ""in all forms,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday. Even predominantly Muslim nations voiced displeasure, with Turkey recalling its ambassador in Egypt to return to Ankara in light of the crisis, a Turkish foreign ministry spokesperson said. Mom's desperate text to daughter killed in Egypt . Raids followed by chaos, attacks on churches . The violence erupted as security forces raided pro-Morsy camps Wednesday after weeks of simmering tension. Clashes and gunfire broke out, leaving pools of blood and bodies strewn in the streets. Authorities bulldozed tents and escorted hundreds of people away. Some mothers and fathers managed to whisk away their children, gas masks on their faces. Morsy supporters also reportedly attacked a number of Christian churches. It's not clear how many were targeted, but Dalia Ziada, of the Ibn Khadun Center for Development Studies, said Thursday that her group had documented the burning of 29 churches and Coptic facilities across the country. ""This is horrible to happen in only one day,"" she said. The Bible Society of Egypt said 15 churches and three Christian schools had been attacked, some set on fire. At least 84 people, including Muslim Brotherhood members, have been referred to military prosecutors for charges including murder and the burning of churches, the state-run EGYNews site reported. Nile TV said Morsy supporters attacked another church Thursday in Fayoum, southwest of Cairo. The Egypt raid, at a glance . Muslim Brotherhood leader defiant . Rather than uniting Egypt after Mubarak's fall, divisions intensified during Morsy's time as president. Critics accused him of being authoritarian, trying to force the Muslim Brotherhood's Islamic agenda on the country and failing to deliver freedom and justice. Morsy's supporters say the deposed president wasn't given a fair chance and say his backers have been unfairly targeted for expressing their opinion. Though Morsy has not appeared in public since he was taken into custody, his supporters have amassed on the streets nationwide to slam military leaders and demand his reinstatement. Experts: What the bloodshed in Cairo means . Meanwhile, Elerian -- the senior Muslim Brotherhood member still at large -- said he's not deterred by calls for his arrest. ""They can arrest me and 100 of us, but they can't arrest every honorable citizen in Egypt,"" Elerian told CNN on Thursday. ""They can't stop this glorious revolution."" CNN's Reza Sayah reported from Cairo; Michael Pearson wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq, Ian Lee, Frederik Pleitgen, Laura Smith-Spark, Greg Botelho and Holly Yan also contributed to this report.","NEW: Morsy supporters peaceably leave mosque where bodies were being held .

"(CNN) -- Arvind Mahankali, a 13-year-old eighth-grader from Bayside Hills, New York, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee on Thursday, correctly spelling the word ""knaidel."" ""It means that I am retiring on a good note,"" said Mahankali, who attends Nathaniel Hawthorne Middle School 74 and was in his last year of eligibility. ""I shall spend the summer, maybe the entire day, studying physics."" Mahankali, who wants to become a physicist, had finished third in the two previous national bees, being eliminated after misspelling words with German roots. ""I thought that the German curse had turned into a German blessing,"" he said, when asked what he thought when he heard the final word, a German-derived Yiddish word for a type of dumpling. Pranav Sivakumar, a 13-year-old from Tower Lakes, Illinois, finished second. He missed on ""cyanophycean"" before Mahankali nailed ""tokonoma"" and ""knaidel"" for the victory. The annual contest offers the winner a healthy dose of classroom cred, $32,500 in cash and savings bonds, a trophy and a library of reference materials. Contest isn't bee-all and end-all . Eleven million schoolchildren participated in preliminaries leading up to the national contest this week. Of those, 281 children made the trip to Oxon Hill, Maryland, just outside Washington, for the national bee. Eleven spellers made it through to the finals. Among them were 63 children who had been to at least one national bee before, and had to prepare for some changes in the rules for this year's events. For the first time, participants had to demonstrate proficiency in vocabulary in addition to spelling. Organizers also added an additional computer test for the semifinals, imposed time limits on computer-based spelling and vocabulary tests and added a rule that resulted in automatic elimination for any participant who misspelled a word on stage in the second or third rounds.

"(CNN) -- Three aid workers kidnapped in Somalia have been released after nearly two years in captivity. International Aid Services said the kidnappers seized their employees in July 2012 in Puntland, Somalia. ""Extended discussions with the actual kidnappers resulted in the release of the hostages,"" the relief agency said in a statement. The three were abducted while traveling in two cars that included three local police officers, who were wounded but not kidnapped during the attack. The three hostages, Janet Kanga, Martin Kioko and Abdinoor Boru, were released Thursday, according to the relief agency. United Nations officials helped transport them to a safe location, where they'll be held until they're reunited with their relatives in Kenya.

"(CNN) -- One by one, surviving family members and friends stepped up to a podium in Arlington National Cemetery. Before them were short lists of names, which included their loved ones -- fathers, sisters, sons and more. Slowly, they read the names, each one punctuated with a ring of a bell, to honor and remember who was lost. A quarter of a century ago Saturday, Pan Am Flight 103 exploded in the evening skies above Lockerbie, in Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and 11 more on the ground. Events Saturday in the United States and Britain marked the 25th anniversary of a bombing that devastated families on both sides of the Atlantic. It remains the deadliest act of terrorism on British soil. At Arlington, a crowd used to gathering in bitter cold to remember this day each year sat beneath unseasonably warm Virginia skies. They heard from dignitaries, including Attorney General Eric Holder and Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell. And they paid tribute to their collective loss, their fight for justice and aviation security reform, and their sense of community -- not just with each other, but with those in Lockerbie. ""You created light out of darkness, and out of that light has come a lasting legacy,"" said former FBI Director Robert Mueller. ""We mark your strength... May the thought of your loved ones bring a smile to your lips."" A bagpiper honored the anniversary with ""Amazing Grace."" Children placed flowers at the cemetery's Lockerbie Cairn. A wreath was laid and taps was played. The explosion left 189 Americans dead. Across the Atlantic, services of remembrance were held Saturday evening at Westminster Abbey in London and at Dryfesdale Church in Lockerbie. The anniversary was also marked at Syracuse University in New York, which was especially hard hit by the disaster. ""Today marks the 25th anniversary of the tragic crash of Pan Am Flight 103 in Lockerbie,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a press statement. ""That day, 270 innocent lives, including 35 students from Syracuse University who were returning home for the holidays, were taken from us. As we commemorate those we lost in this horrific terrorist attack, the families and loved ones of the victims are in the thoughts and prayers of all New Yorkers. Our state and nation will never forget their loss."" The service, in the university's Hendricks Chapel, started at 2:03 p.m. ET, the time the bomb exploded (7:03 p.m. in Scotland), and was scheduled to include the recitation of a specially composed ""Common Prayer for Peace."" Composed jointly by Hendricks Chapel Dean Tiffany Steinwert and the Rev. Sandy Stoddart of Lockerbie, it includes these lines: ""Rising up from the ashes of tragedy, we proclaim our commitment to creating a better, more just world."" Remembrance services were also planned at the university's Lubin House in New York City. UK Prime Minister David Cameron, in a statement, paid tribute to the ""fortitude and resilience"" of those affected by the bombing and said it demonstrated how ""terrorist acts cannot crush the human spirit."" He said, ""Though 25 years have passed, memories of the 243 passengers, 16 crew and 11 Lockerbie residents who lost their lives on that terrible night have not dimmed. ""Over the last quarter of a century, much attention has been focused on the perpetrators of the atrocity. Today, our thoughts turn to its victims and to those whose lives have been touched and changed by what happened at Lockerbie that night."" Cameron said a strong bond between the town of Lockerbie and Syracuse University, which offers scholarships to two Lockerbie students each year, represented a ""lasting and optimistic legacy"" that had emerged from tragedy. After a three-year investigation, U.S. and British investigators indicted two Libyans for murder in the bombing of the New York-bound Boeing 747. Only one, Abdel Baset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, was convicted. Megrahi died last year in Libya, having been released from prison in Scotland in 2009 on compassionate grounds because he had terminal cancer. Libya agreed in 2003 to pay $2.7 billion in compensation to the families of the bombing victims, although its late leader, Moammar Gadhafi, always remained cagey about admitting official Libyan involvement in the bombing.","Services are held in the United States and Britain to remember those killed .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Protests against Spain's economic crisis took a new turn Wednesday as social media networks fueled calls for demonstrators to take to the streets before local elections a few days away. Thousands returned late Tuesday to Madrid's central Puerta del Sol plaza -- where the main protests began Sunday. A few hundred demonstrators camped out there overnight, while similar but smaller protests were held in Barcelona and other Spanish cities, a protest organizer said. ""The economy and unemployment are key to the protest because that binds all of us together,"" said Jon Aguirre Such, a spokesman for the Real Democracy Now, one of many groups convening the demonstrations. ""In this crisis, while some have gotten rich, most people have less income,"" Aguirre said. Demonstrators are protesting Spain's 21% unemployment rate and a record 4.9 million jobless. Protesters say a plethora of temporary labor contracts offer few or no job benefits. In addition, some are protesting against the political and financial establishment that they say is to blame. The protests come in the closing days of the campaign for local elections set for Sunday. Spain's 8,000 cities and towns will elect mayors, along with 13 (out of 17) regional presidents and parliaments. Opinion polls in Spanish media predict major gains for the opposition conservatives over Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's ruling Socialist party. Zapatero, squeezed by the nation's prolonged economic crisis, announced last month he won't seek a third term in national elections due by March 2012. For the past few years, as Spain's rate of unemployment remained tenaciously high, most of the protests were organized by major trade unions. But the latest protests appear to be grass-roots movements fueled by social networks, sparking more attention. Elena Ortega, who says she's managed to find only a part-time secretarial job, helped spread the word on Facebook about the protests on Wednesday. ""If this is happening, it's because the unions weren't doing what was needed, when it was needed. They haven't delivered,"" she said. She said she's worried about her 20-year-old son, who has only found temporary jobs in the past four years. ""Forty percent of our young people are unemployed and don't have a chance,"" Ortega said. The movement does not appear to be linked to the unions or political parties, the traditional protest heavyweights in Spain, said Economist Fernando Fernandez of the IE Business School in Madrid. ""I think we really don't know what we're seeing,"" Fernandez said. ""This is the very beginning of a new movement. I don't expect it to become a very large social response or protest against the unemployment perspective in Spain."" But hours later, on Tuesday night, several thousand protesters returned to Madrid's central plaza. By Wednesday morning, dozens remained in their overnight encampment. The social media networks call for renewed protests on Wednesday evening in Madrid and three dozen other Spanish cities. The aim is to continue the protests at least through the elections on Sunday, Aguirre said. But Wednesday afternoon, Madrid's elections board banned the planned demonstration at 8 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) at the Puerta del Sol plaza. The board said there were not ""extraordinary and serious reasons"" to allow the demonstration on short notice, according to the central government's main regional office in Madrid. The election board vetoed the demonstration -- which would have come during the final days of the election campaign -- on the grounds it could affect the right of citizens to vote freely, a regional office spokesman said. Organizers of many large demonstrations in Madrid seek and receive prior authorization, usually days or weeks ahead of the event. But the economic protests since Sunday have sprung up on short notice. Spain's El Pais newspaper reported that authorities planned to have sufficient police officers on hand to prevent the demonstration.","NEW: Madrid's election board bans demonstration planned for Wednesday evening .

"(CNN) -- It was the cruelest of ironies unleashed by Super Typhoon Haiyan. One of the strongest ever recorded, the storm put the Philippine port city of Tacloban underwater, and storm chaser James Reynolds was there filming the natural disaster at what's been regarded as its ground zero. Then, when evening fell, the town caught fire. There was water, water, everywhere -- yet nary enough to put out a fire, Reynolds said. The surge of sea water was followed by a sea of flames. Interactive map of the storm . The futility -- and absurdity -- of the moment was captured by one merchant using buckets of water against the inferno in his shop. It was hopeless. The merchant didn't stand a chance, said Reynolds, who's from Oxford, England. ""One block of the city was up in flames, a raging fire was burning uncontrollably,"" Reynolds said in telephone interview from the Philippines. ""I honestly felt like it was some sort of disaster movie. It was so bad, it didn't seem real. This struck home hard that this was a city in a desolate state,"" he said. 'Worse than hell' Nothing else like this storm . Haiyan was the worst storm that Reynolds, 30, has ever chased. Since 2005, he and his Earth Uncut Productions crew have filmed 35 typhoons -- plus a couple of major volcanic eruptions including Mount Merapi in Indonesia in 2010. They also covered the aftermath of the Japanese tsunami in 2011. ""It was without a doubt the most catastrophic event I've witnessed before my eyes,"" Reynolds said of the super typhoon. ""To actually go through a disaster as it takes place and then be there afterward just compares to nothing. It'll probably be the only time in my life."" The experience wasn't without casualties to crew and gear, however. One team member suffered a six-inch gash down to the bone of his leg, Reynolds said. So the team managed to get a helicopter ride to the Tacloban airport. Road travel wasn't possible because downed trees and utility poles closed streets. From the airport, the Philippine military was kind enough to give the film crew a plane ride Saturday to Cebu City, where medical care was available. The storm also destroyed most of Reynolds' camera gear, so he used a small backup camera and even his iPhone to film the biblical-like flooding of Tacloban -- until his batteries began to die. Philippines gets more than its share of disasters . The team had no choice but to cut short its extraordinary work in Tacloban. Reynolds and his crew filmed the height of flooding while at a Tacloban hotel. There, guests on the first floor had to be ferried out of danger while afloat on mattresses, including one elderly woman escorted by good Samaritans wading through the waist-high water. The first-floor guests couldn't open their doors against the rising water, so they smashed windows to try to exit. A CNN crew assisted; its members also were staying at the hotel. ""It was really put the cameras down, we've got to get out there and help these people. Otherwise possibly they could drown,"" Reynolds said. The first-floor guests were taken to higher ground. ""The water was coming in everywhere, even in the heart of the hotel,"" Reynolds said. ""And my camera gave up. All the batteries were drained, and there was no electricity."" 'You could feel the whole hotel ... shaking' Reynolds chose the hotel because it was made of concrete, was about five miles inland and had an elevation of four stories, well above the surge of ocean that was expected to sweep over the coastal city -- and did. The crew got lucky: they checked into the last available room on the fourth floor. Even if there was no room at the inn, they would have slept in the hallway of the fourth floor, just for the safe refuge, Reynolds said. ""During the height of the storm, the scream of the wind was deafening. We could hear just thunderous crashes of debris flying through the air. At some points, you could feel the whole hotel, which was made of solid concrete, shaking,"" Reynolds said. To film the apocalyptic moment, the crew arrived in Tacloban on Thursday from their Hong Kong offices. They initially checked into small waterfront hotel and then moved to a beach resort, but they abandoned both places as they received reports of the impending storm's ferocity. Tacloban emerges as one of Typhoons Haiyan's most damaged targets . For all their efforts, they found the most cinematic moment in the silence after the super typhoon passed. It was Friday night, and Reynolds was standing on his hotel's roof. A blackout enveloped the town. Then the sky became afire. ""You could see the city skyline illuminated by lighting. The city was up in flames. And it was surreal,"" Reynolds said. For all the peril and loss, would Reynolds do it again? ""Yes!"" he said. But not for a while, he added. How to help survivors .","James Reynolds and his production crew arrive in Tacloban just to film the super typhoon .

"(CNN) -- It was a moment of triumph amid a personal tragedy for Malaysian leader Najib Razak. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, he could finally stand in front of his nation with news of a deal -- the breakthrough to release MH17's flight recorders from rebels' hands, and, as important, to bring home the remains of the victims. Najib's own step-grandmother was on the flight, which was shot down near the Ukrainian-Russian border last Thursday. The second wife of his grandfather was flying to Malaysia to celebrate Hari Raya -- the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. As he comforted his own family, as well as others who had lost loved ones, the Malaysian leader was working to unlock a standoff that had generated a political firestorm, said a source close to the prime minister. Where was the anger? Hundreds of bodies lay amid wreckage in an isolated field in what was described as ""the world's biggest crime scene."" They were being guarded by armed separatists who were refusing to give international monitors access to the site and material evidence. Days after the crash, critics had started to question why the Malaysian leader had not made the same angry demands for answers heard from other world leaders. The Boeing 777 shot down over Ukraine was the country's national carrier. It was carrying 298 people who trusted they'd reach their destination. It was the second catastrophic event to hit the airline in five months, following the unprecedented disappearance of flight MH370. And, behind the Netherlands, Malaysia lost the greatest number of citizens on flight MH17: 43 people, including 15 crew. Where was the Malaysian leader's condemnation? ""It's really important that he did not start blaming anyone before getting what he needed,"" said Wan Saiful Wan Jan, a political commentator and CEO of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs in Kuala Lumpur. ""If he had taken an aggressive stance right form the beginning we may not get the bodies and the black boxes,"" he said. Strategy of 'quiet diplomacy' From day one, according to the source, Najib had set his own diplomatic course; a strategy of quiet diplomacy. Working with a small group -- less than a handful -- he set about making personal contact with the self-declared leader of the Donetsk separatists, Alexander Borodai. Although Najib was in touch with the leaders of Russia, Europe, Ukraine and the United States, he was also using back channels to get to the man who controlled the crash site, the source said. ""He is a well-connected man. He was talking to people who could contact Borodai and eventually he came up with someone. And then he made personal contact,"" the source told CNN. The first contact was made last Saturday, nearly two days after MH17 was downed. From then on, the two had ""numerous"" conversations, the source said, including some on Najib's personal mobile phone. According to the source, Malaysia was regarded by the rebel leader as a non-aligned party in what had become a war of words between Russia and the West. On top of that, the prime minister is seen by some as having a reputation as a deal-broker. He was instrumental in securing a peace deal between Islamic separatists in the southern Philippines and Manila. Were claims over-stated? However, Najib's claims to have brokered the deal with the pro-Russian rebel leader have been met with skepticism by some who say his role in the negotiations may be over-stated. ""I think he wanted to do the right thing there -- he calls it quiet diplomacy. He calls it a victory.... I don't think it can be called a success,"" said Gerhard Hoffstaedter from the University of Queensland, Australia. Hoffstaedter said many of the bodies may have been handed over to authorities -- but not all of them. In addition, he said, the handover came much later than many Muslims would have hoped. According to religious custom, bodies should be buried as soon as possible after death. The victims of MH17 had been left in a field in Ukraine for three days before their removal. It's also unclear what Malaysia promised the rebels in order to secure the deal, Hoffstaedter added. International pressure was growing on Borodai to co-operate with investigators, but Malaysian staff who were involved with the process believe the one-on-one contact was critical, and that a non-threatening Malaysia was the perfect negotiating partner. ""This has been a huge success for Najib domestically. He is clearly more popular now, the opposition is siding with him, even his critics are praising him,"" Wan Saiful said. Prime minister under pressure . After facing international criticism of the country's handling of the MH370 disaster, the prime minister was under pressure to prove he was able to act quickly and decisively in the case of MH17. The relief that his diplomacy had paid off was palpable when Najib began to speak to the nation in a televised address. As he announced the deal with Borodai, he also gave the first public hint of his strategy. ""In recent days, there were times I wanted to give greater voice to the anger and grief that the Malaysian people feel. And that I feel. But sometimes, we must work quietly in the service of a better outcome,"" he said. However, Wan Saiful said the real test of Najib's leadership will come when it's time to speak out against the perpetrators. ""The government should be more aggressive when there's concrete evidence. When that happens, it's very important to work with the international community, and to form a coalition to call for the perpetrators to be punished and brought to justice. ""When that happens, it's not really a matter of whether the PM is willing to be aggressive or not. He has to, otherwise it shows weak leadership,"" he said. Bodies en route to the Netherlands .

"(CNN) -- AS Monaco signaled their intention to use their financial muscle in the summer transfer window with an audacious double swoop Friday for Porto pair Joao Moutinho and James Rodriguez, . Monaco, backed by Russian billionaire owner Dimitri Rybolovkev, will return to France's Ligue 1 next season after wrapping up the second-flight title, and other high profile signings are expected. Portuguese champions Porto said the deal was worth 70 million euros ($90.6 million) with 21-year-old Colombian international striker Rodriguez valued at 45 million euros and midfielder Moutinho worth 25 million euros. A statement on their website described the deal as the ""biggest in Portuguese football history"" and the club has made a profit of over 50 million euros from the original fees they paid for the players in 2010. Monaco confirmed that both had signed five-year deals. The 21-year-old Rodriguez, who has helped Porto to three straight domestic titles, was reportedly a target for English Premier League champions Manchester United, while Moutinho nearly join their EPL counterparts Tottenham Hotspur last season. Monaco, coached by Italian Claudio Ranieri, have also been linked with Atletico Madrid's Colombian striker Radamel Falcoa, who carries a 60 million euros price tag and is wanted by a clutch of Europe's elite clubs. Watch: What makes Ibrahimovic tick? With money apparently no object, the team from the principality, will look to rival the new French champions Paris-Saint Germain, who have Qatari backing, enabling to sign such names as Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the now-retired David Beckham. Monaco were regular participants in European club competition, reaching the final of the Champions League in 2004. But a steady decline set in, culminating in their relegation to Ligue 2 in 2011. Rybolovkev took over at the end of that year and has pumped in money to help the return quickly to the top flight under the stewardship of former Chelsea coach Ranieri.","AS Monaco swoop for a pair of Porto players .

"(CNN) -- As the fallout from WikiLeaks continues, the debate over whether or not the alleged leaker is a treasonous villain or a First Amendment hero is being debated in Berkeley, California. There, the City Council was set to vote on a resolution that hails Pfc. Bradley Manning a hero, calls for his immediate release and for charges against him to be dropped.  That vote was postponed on Thursday, pending more information on Manning's involvement. Here, the author of the resolution, Bob Meola, tells CNN why he thinks Manning is a hero, while City Council member Gordon Wozniak explains why he is against the measure. --Kevin Conlon . Manning: An American hero . Bob Meola is a commissioner and immediate past chair of the city of Berkeley's Peace and Justice Commission. He is a national committee member of the War Resisters League, member of Courage to Resist Organizing Collective, an organization that supports GI war resisters, and a member of the steering committee of the Bradley Manning Support Network, which raises money for Manning's defense. On Tuesday, the City Council of Berkeley, California will vote on whether or not to pass a resolution recommended to it by the Berkeley Peace and Justice Commission, which asks it to support Pfc. Bradley Manning and proclaim him a hero -- if he is indeed the whistle-blower who leaked the ""Collateral Murder"" video and numerous classified documents to WikiLeaks. Manning is charged with illegally leaking classified information and faces 52 years in prison if he is convicted of the charges against him. I wrote the resolution that is before the City Council. I believe that if Manning is the whistle-blower, he is an American hero and should be released. Berkeley should set a courageous example for the rest of the country by acknowledging the good that has been done by whoever blew the whistle. Manning is alleged to have written in e-mail exchanges made before he was arrested that the results of his actions would be ""hopefully worldwide discussion, debates, and reforms."" In another exchange, he allegedly wrote: ""I want people to see the truth regardless of who they are because without information, you cannot make informed decisions as a public."" Manning's case cannot be discussed without also discussing WikiLeaks. Whoever released the video known as ""Collateral Murder,"" which documents an incident in a suburb of Baghdad on July 12, 2007, should be thanked by the people of the world. That video shows the killings of 12 unarmed civilians, including two Reuters journalists by a U.S. Army Apache Helicopter crew. Two children were severely injured in the attack. WikiLeaks released the ""Collateral Murder"" video in April. In July, it released the Afghan War Diary. In October, it released the Iraq War Logs, and last month it released diplomatic cables. The Afghan War Diary tells us of corruption and cover-ups in Afghanistan, the killing of innocent Afghanis. The Iraq War Logs document numerous war crimes and suppression of evidence of torture, and the recently released diplomatic cables shed an embarrassing light on the conduct of diplomats around the world. WikiLeaks has been accused of endangering the lives of Afghan informers by not redacting their names. Beginning with the release of the Iraq War Logs, WikiLeaks did redact names. But the accusers of WikiLeaks persist in the game of ""what if."" What if it endangered lives? The mistake of nonredacted names must be weighed against the reality of the lives already destroyed by the wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq and the lives that would be lost if this information was not leaked in an effort to end some illegal acts of war. What if these revelations, in the name of compliance with law and morality, were not revealed? How many more innocent lives would then be sacrificed? Democracy must be transparent or it is not democracy. It is the duty of citizens to participate in democracy and shine light on truth. Thomas Jefferson said that given a choice between having government and having newspapers, he would choose newspapers. Blowing the whistle on war crimes is not a crime. It is the war criminals who should be prosecuted. Daniel Ellsberg has been saying that Manning is a hero of his and that when he released the Pentagon Papers, everything that is now being said about Manning, including that he is a traitor, was also said about Ellsberg at the time. Manning, or whoever leaked the information he is accused of leaking, deserves our thanks. It took 30 years for the heroes, who interrupted the My Lai massacre to be honored with the awarding of the Soldiers Medal, the U.S. Army's highest award for bravery not involving direct contact with the enemy. At the award ceremony, Army Maj. Gen. Michael Ackerman said, ""It was the ability to do the right thing even at the risk of their personal safety that guided these soldiers to do what they did,"" and that the three ""set the standard for all soldiers to follow. The city of Berkeley has a long tradition of standing up for peace and for justice. It has opposed the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan, it has opposed torture, and it is one of the cities that called for the impeachment of George W. Bush. Manning and the case against him now represent the culmination of all the horror and repression that we have experienced in the last decade. The Berkeley City Council now has the opportunity to weigh in on the side of all that is right on the road to repairing the damage done to the world by the policies and the cover-ups of the last decade. For the greater good, Berkeley should ask the secretary of the Army, the Honorable John M. McHugh, and chief of staff of the Army, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., to release Manning from pretrial confinement and drop the charges against him. If Manning is the whistle-blower, justice necessitated his actions. It's irresponsible, premature to declare Manning a hero . Gordon Wozniak was elected to the Berkeley City Council in 2002. A retired nuclear chemist, he was a research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for more than 30 years. He was a commissioner on the city's Planning Commission, Parks and Recreation Commission, and the Environmental Commission, and currently serves on the Alameda County Waste Management Authority. Yes, I am a City Council member in Berkeley, a place known for bucking the establishment and for opposing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I also oppose these wars, but unlike some of my colleagues in city government, I do not believe that Pfc. Bradley Manning should be declared a hero or freed from prison before all the evidence against him is presented in court. Manning is accused of disclosing classified information to WikiLeaks, including diplomatic cables and military logs of incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq. A military grand jury is investigating charges that he mishandled classified information in a way likely to cause injury to the United States. He is being held in military confinement pending trial. Berkeley's Peace and Justice Commission has publicly proclaimed Manning a hero for releasing classified information about the wars it opposes. It's odd enough to lionize someone accused of breaking the law and potentially putting individuals and our government in harm's way. But the commission's declaration is even odder in this case, because Manning has pleaded not guilty and denied the charges against him. What Berkeley's commission members seem to have forgotten is that before their hero can be judged innocent or guilty, he deserves a fair trial with all the due process rights guaranteed by our Constitution. When Manning joined the Army, he swore to uphold the Constitution. He signed papers promising to keep secret all classified documents to which he had access. He was aware of the laws governing the unauthorized release of secret documents. If he stole classified documents and released them to WikiLeaks, he broke both his word and the law. If he did not like the war, the Army or the conduct of his country, there are ways to make his dissent known without breaking the law and damaging our country. To achieve peaceful solutions to international conflicts involves diplomacy, which requires confidential communications. Stealing and publishing secret diplomatic dispatches obviously harms this effort. Furthermore, publishing a secret list of vital infrastructure, from pipelines to smallpox-vaccine suppliers -- without regard for the potential consequences -- is deeply disturbing. The city of Berkeley has many important problems, including high taxes and unemployment, severe rates of property crime, a decaying physical infrastructure and location next to a major earthquake fault. In addition, it needs to improve the business climate to create more jobs and revenue for vital public services. Berkeley businesses were harmed by a boycott after the Marine Corps recruiting station was deemed ""unwelcome."" Now the Manning resolution has led people to call for a boycott again. In this difficult economic climate, the city's business community can ill afford such bad publicity and associated financial losses. It was irresponsible and premature for the Peace and Justice Commission to recommend the release of Manning before hearing the evidence presented in his trial and the council should deny this resolution. The council should not encourage military personnel to leak classified material by declaring Manning a hero. Many young men and women are serving overseas in two very difficult wars with no defined front and an enemy who does not wear uniforms. Let us work together to resolve these conflicts honorably and welcome the troops home. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors.","Bob Meola authored a resolution for Berkeley City Council calling Pfc. Bradley Manning a hero .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- One of the most respected ballistics experts in South Africa disputed key elements of the prosecution case against Oscar Pistorius on Friday, saying that the girlfriend he killed last year did not appear to have been in a defensive position when he shot her. Tom Wolmarans, a former police officer, suggested that Reeva Steenkamp did not have her hand over her head when Pistorius fired four bullets at her. ""The left hand cannot have been against her head"" because there were no wounds and no brain tissue on the inside of her hand, he said. His analysis runs against one of the most dramatic parts of the prosecution case, when a police ballistics expert cowered with his hands over his head, imitating the position he thought Steenkamp was in when she was killed. Pistorius, 27, is accused of murdering Steenkamp, a model, reality TV star and law school graduate. She was 29 when she was killed. He admits that he fired four bullets through a closed door in his house, killing her, but says he thought he was protecting himself from a burglar. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has argued aggressively that Pistorius argued with Steenkamp before killing her. If she was crouched defensively when she was killed, that could support Nel's case, implying that she knew what was coming. If the judge believes Wolmarans, on the other hand, it could suggest Steenkamp was taken by surprise. Fierce cross-examination . Nel battered Wolmarans as the cross-examination began, demanding to know how many different versions of his analysis he gave the defense team, whom he consulted about it and whether he had changed any of his report. Flustered and occasionally appearing angry, Wolmarans said he had fixed some of the English in his report -- it not being his native language -- but not his conclusions. He also said he would not have changed his conclusions based on conversations he had over beer with another defense expert, Roger Dixon, because Dixon is not a ballistics expert. Nel pounced, demanding whether the court should also disregard Dixon's testimony. Once the questioning turned to the specifics of the night Steenkamp was killed, Wolmarans recovered his composure and stood his ground. Nel disputed the former police officer's description of where Steenkamp was when the final bullet hit her in the head. The prosecutor said that if her position was as Wolmarans described it, there were have been no space for her head. The ballistics expert disagreed. He also stepped into the reconstruction of Pistorius' bathroom in the court, to demonstrate, leading to one of the few light moments in the trial. He closed the door as he stepped into the toilet cubicle and then said to the judge, ""I'm sorry, my lady, you can't see me,"" prompting laughter in court. Weeping witness . Wolmarans earlier agreed with prosecution witnesses who said Pistorius, a double amputee, was on his stumps when he shot Steenkamp. Before the murder trial began, the state had said Pistorius put on his prosthetic legs before killing his girlfriend -- implying that the killing was premeditated -- but Nel shifted his position when the trial began. Wolmarans is in court for a second day. On Thursday, defense witnesses included probation officer and social worker Yvette van Schalkwyk, who testified that Pistorius was not faking the dramatic suffering he has shown in court. The gripping trial has seen Pistorius break down repeatedly, crying, wailing and sometimes throwing up as the court sees and hears evidence about Steenkamp's death. Evidence has included graphic photos of the wounds; testimony from neighbors, friends, police and pathologists; and the actual door through which Pistorius fired four hollow-tipped bullets on the fateful night. Judge's decision . There is no dispute that Pistorius shot and killed Steenkamp in his home early on the morning of Valentine's Day 2013. Prosecutor Nel tore into Pistorius over five days in court in April, saying the Paralympic medalist had argued with Steenkamp and killed her on purpose. He tried to force Pistorius to look at a picture of Steenkamp's head after the shooting, accused Pistorius of being selfish and possessive, and said he refused to take responsibility for his actions. Judge Thokozile Masipa must decide whether Pistorius genuinely made a terrible mistake or whether he murdered Steenkamp intentionally. Live blog: Pistorius on trial . Lead defense lawyer Barry Roux has said he expects to conclude his case on Tuesday. Pistorius himself testified for seven days in April. The defense team is seeking to cast doubt on the state's case and needs only to show there is a reasonable doubt that Pistorius meant to kill Steenkamp. Its case will be followed by closing arguments. Masipa will decide the verdict in collaboration with two experts called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials. If Pistorius is found guilty of premeditated murder, he faces life in prison. He could be convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide, which would leave his sentence at the discretion of the judge. The trial has gripped South Africa and sports fans worldwide who considered Pistorius a symbol of triumph over physical adversity. His disabled lower legs were amputated when he was a baby, but he went on to achieve global fame as the ""Blade Runner,"" winning numerous Paralympic gold medals on the carbon-fiber blades that gave him his nickname. He also competed against able-bodied runners at the Olympics. Only those in the courtroom saw Pistorius on the stand, because he chose not to testify on camera. His testimony could be heard in an audio feed. Oscar Pistorius trial enters new phase after blistering cross-examination .

"London (CNN) -- More than three meters above east London's Sclater Street is a mural of sprinter Usain Bolt, captured in explosive color by artist James Cochran. The street artwork, more than four meters high and six meters wide, is a dramatic sight, designed by Cochran to celebrate London's Olympic Games. Cochran, known as ""Jimmy C,"" has a style which combines his background in graffiti art and academic training in figurative realism. The UK-born artist is based in London's Shoreditch, having spent much of his life in Australia. After his mother died in a car crash when Cochran was 12, his family life deteriorated. At 16, he spent three months on the streets where he began painting with aerosol cans. Cochran later completed a visual arts degree at the University of South Australia, before going on to complete a masters degree. The Olympics miss: Why street art should be embraced not snubbed . His art often depicts the homeless, as he seeks to capture ""a more raw essence of the human subject."" Cochran's style has evolved from what he calls ""aerosol pointillism,"" with its impressionist overtones, to ""atomic pointillism, in which the subject appears to atomize. Why gritty East End is London's gold standard . Cochran also explores the relationship between individuals and the urban landscape, which has led to paintings of buildings sprouting from heads -- one of which can be seen in this Sam Taylor-Wood directed REM video. Cochran's canvases sell for thousands of pounds. But he continues to paint on the streets, and his work can be found in cities including Paris, Berlin and New York. ""When you paint on the street there is a lot more rawness to it,"" Cochran says. ""Anything can happen."" East London, where the city's Olympic Games are based, is a hub for street art. ""That's the great thing about Shoreditch and Hackney,"" says Cochran.

"London (CNN) -- Two former News of the World editors, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, were told Wednesday they will face trial in September next year over claims of phone hacking at the now-defunct tabloid newspaper. Brooks, Coulson and half a dozen other former News of the World managers and staffers accused of conspiring to hack voice mail messages remained free on bail after the hearing at London's main criminal court. A proposed trial date was set at the Old Bailey for September 9, 2013. The phone hacking accusations have reverberated through the top levels of British politics and journalism and prompted a parliamentary committee to issue damning criticism of Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp. owned the News of the World through its UK subsidiary, News International. After the scandal, Murdoch stepped down from a string of company directorships and abandoned a multibillion-dollar bid to acquire satellite broadcaster BSkyB. Suspected hacking victims include some of the world's biggest celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Jude Law, Paul McCartney and soccer star Wayne Rooney, as well as victims of crime and the July 7, 2005, London terrorist attacks. Brooks and Coulson were close to British Prime Minister David Cameron. Coulson, who edited the News of the World from 2003 to 2007, went on to become Cameron's director of communications before resigning early last year. Brooks was a friend of the prime minister and his wife. Brooks, formerly chief executive of News of the World's parent company, News International, part of Murdoch's News Corp. empire, also faces a charge of perverting the course of justice. But the most explosive charge against her is plotting in 2002 to eavesdrop illegally on the voice mail of missing British schoolgirl Milly Dowler, who was later found murdered. Public anger after the revelation last year that the missing girl's phone had been hacked forced Murdoch to close the News of the World, which Brooks edited at the time of the hacking. She then became editor of The Sun newspaper before taking up the chief executive role. Brooks, Coulson and fellow former News of the World employees Stuart Kuttner, Greg Miskiw, Ian Edmondson, Neville Thurlbeck and James Weatherup are accused of conspiring between October 3, 2000, and August 9, 2006, ""to intercept communications in the course of their transmission, without lawful authority."" Specifically, the charge asserts that they listened to ""voice mail messages of well-known people."" Brooks, Coulson, Kuttner, Miskiw, Thurlbeck and Glenn Mulcaire face an additional charge of intercepting Dowler's messages. Brooks, her husband Charlie Brooks and a former personal assistant also face a separate set of charges of conspiring to obstruct the police investigation into phone hacking. They were charged in May, along with Brooks' former driver, a security guard and members of News International security staff, with attempting to pervert the course of justice. The hacking scandal prompted Cameron to set up an independent judge-led inquiry -- named for Lord Justice Leveson, its chairman -- to make recommendations on journalistic ethics and examine the relationship of the press with the public, police and politicians. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson are accused of conspiring to hack voice mails .

"(CNN) -- ""The (airline) bar is closed."" More flight attendants should say that to more passengers. This might seem like heresy to the millions of travelers who enjoy free drinks in the upper classes and on international flights, but maybe it's time airlines consider putting a cap on drinks, or charging passengers for their alcohol after the first drink or two. Recently, Jennifer Lauren, niece of fashion designer Ralph Lauren, was allegedly misbehaving on a Delta Air Lines flight after getting ""dangerously drunk"" and abusive toward other passengers. It got so bad that the New York bound plane made an unscheduled stop in Ireland to remove her from the flight. She was arrested for endangering other passengers. Let's not be shocked by this. These days, a month doesn't go by that I don't hear about an intoxicated passenger getting into fights with flight crews or their fellow travelers. The Jennifer Lauren episode is fresh in our memory, but drunks on planes are nothing new. A few years ago, French actor Gérard Depardieu made the headlines when he, allegedly drunk, urinated in the aisle during an Air France flight from Paris to Dublin, Ireland. And let's not forget ""Dracula"" star Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who was banned from flying on United Airlines after drinking heavily in the carrier's first class lounge in a flight from New York to Los Angeles. The crew noticed he had become belligerent and disruptive, so they refused to let him board the flight to L.A. In an August 2013 report on unruly passengers, the International Air Transport Association, which represents airlines from around the world, noted that ""many"" carriers said alcohol was the major contributor to disruptive behavior. ""They observed that passengers, in numerous instances, may have been intoxicated at the time of boarding the aircraft or had access to their own alcohol supply on board."" Similarly, the Toronto-based International Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers said air rage tends to occur in unfamiliar and over-stimulating environments, including airports and airplanes. The rage is fueled by ""overcrowding, delays, lack of information, lack of manners and boorish behavior, as well as arguments with transportation or service personnel."" Furthermore, ""Heightened stress levels, alcohol and drug misuse, as well as smoking prohibitions in many public places, are common factors inciting rage."" Unfortunately, some travelers choose alcohol before and during a flight, and in extreme cases, end up in conflicts with passengers and crew and attempt to open emergency exits and even storm the cockpit. The bottom line is flight crews and passengers need to be more mindful. Flight attendants, like it or not, are the final line of defense when it comes to drunk passengers. They need to be empowered to cut off passengers when a fellow traveler brings up a legitimate complaint or if they see bad behaviors escalating. And in our post-9/11 travel world, passengers are much more willing to help flight crews with unruly passengers in case there isn't an air marshal aboard. Those who choose to drink excessively and become abusive not only should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, but they also need to be sued to recover the costs for any diversion or damages they may cause others during their inebriated state. There are always travelers who will drink, whether it's free or not. By imposing fees and/or limits on the number of drinks, airlines would not only reduce alcohol consumption, but also make a profit from a common-sense regulation. Maintaining good order during flights is one of the best ways that airlines can serve their customers well. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Benét J. Wilson.","Benét Wilson: Let's not be shocked by drunken passengers misbehaving on planes .

"(CNN) -- The failed-startup story is familiar by now. A pair of Stanford grads come up with a million-dollar idea, let's say Uber for cats. ""Mewber"" joins a startup accelerator, builds an iPhone app, gets a few million dollars from a venture capital firm, moves into a hip office in San Francisco and hires a handful of bright 20-something employees. Things are looking great. Then they discover that cats hate cars, rarely have important appointments they need to keep and are all mysteriously using Windows Phone 8 devices. The product fails, and Mewber shuts down. Betaworks is a New York-based startup studio that does things differently. Instead of going all-in on one product, Betaworks gives multiple ideas room to grow, and even die, in order to single out the most promising sites, apps and tools. ""We try to fail fast and small,"" explained founder and CEO John Borthwick. Borthwick describes Betaworks as a creative company of builders. Its employees work together in a studio atmosphere to conceive, build and grow multiple products at a time. If one idea isn't working, they can refocus their energies on something new. ""Every place I've worked before has always been trying to make a specific product or company work, so you had no alternatives,"" said Paul Murphy, Betaworks' senior vice president of product, who formerly worked at Microsoft and Aviary. ""We don't have that constraint here."" Many of Betaworks' more popular offerings help people discover or organize news and other content, like Digg, Reader, Tapestry and most recently Instapaper. And the 6-year-old company recently branched out into games with the release of ""Dots,"" a deceptively simple game that requires players to connect colored dots with swipes of a finger. The abstract and addictive iPhone game shot up Apple's charts, attracting a million users in its first four days and 3 million users in the month since it launched. Betaworks says 250 million games of ""Dots"" have been played. The company is moving fast to capitalize on the buzz and on Thursday released an iPad version of the game. Like most of Betaworks' offerings, ""Dots"" was created quickly (the team started in January), and its design was kept minimal. To come up with a product, the team starts with a running list of about 80 things they feel should just be better, from weather apps to business cards. Every four to six months, they'll go through the list and pick up to a dozen things that they want to prototype. After one month, they'll look at the first version of the app or site and, if it addresses a need, get it into the hands of 100 beta testers. In the past four months the company has been focused on launching five small companies, part of its ""Hacker in Residence"" program. In addition to ""Dots,"" there is Giphy, a search engine for GIFs; Poncho, a personalized weather app; Blend.io, which allows musicians to collaborate on music online; and Telecast, which lumps YouTube videos together based on the viewer's specific interests. Even once they're launched, these products can be shut down by Betaworks at any time. Killing off an app isn't a big deal for Betaworks, unlike a startup that's pouring all its energy into a single idea. And instead of losing their jobs, the developers and designers just move on to the next Betaworks idea. ""What makes it easier for us is, we sort of celebrate the ones we kill off as much as the one we spin off,"" Murphy said. The company also buys and rebuilds established tech properties such as Digg, Reader and Instapaper. When it bought the once-mighty Digg, that site cost $230,000 a month to run. Betaworks stripped Digg down and rebuilt it completely in just six weeks, creating a far simpler version of the curated-news site that costs only $19,000 a month to operate. ""If you think about the dynamic of what Digg was, a crowd-sourced news site, I think Twitter figured out a more scalable mechanism,"" Borthwick said. ""What Digg was needed to be rethought from the ground up."" Some products are spun off into standalone companies, like traffic-analytics tool Chartbeat and URL shortener Bit.ly. Others have been sold off to large tech companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Zynga for a tidy sum. Betaworks also invests seed money in young startups, many of which, like Kickstarter, Groupon and Tumblr, have gone on to be hugely successful. The business model and minimalist approach to apps is working out swimmingly for Betaworks. According to Borthwick, the company is ""wildly"" profitable.","New York startup studio behind the hit game ""Dots"" has a unique business model .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A car bomb exploded in a busy market in eastern Afghanistan Tuesday, killing more than 40 people, officials said, in what is said to be the single worst attack in the country this year. Afghan Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayoub Salang said 42 people were killed and more than 30 others were wounded in the attack in the Urgon district of Paktika province. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan had different figures, stating that at least 43 civilians, including eight children, were killed, and 67 were wounded. The car was driven by a suicide bomber who detonated explosives after police ordered him to stop his car, said Nissar Ahmad Abdulrahimzai, deputy police chief of Paktika province. Abdulrahimzai said he feared the death toll would rise and there is at least one government official reporting more deaths. The United Nations, which calls the assault a suicide attack, says it's the single deadliest strike this year in the country. ""Today's appalling attack during Ramadan -- an occasion that should observed in a spirit of peace and compassion -- should be condemned in the strongest possible terms and the perpetrators must be held accountable,"" UNAMA head Jan Kubis said. The Taliban denied involvement. Another attack in Kabul . Meanwhile, in the capital, Kabul, the Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack early Tuesday on a vehicle used by presidential palace employees. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement to media that three people were killed and six others injured in the explosion. Hashmatullah Stanekzai, a spokesman for the Kabul police chief, earlier told CNN that at least two people were killed and five injured. He said all the victims were working in the presidential palace media department. Security remains a major concern in Afghanistan, from which the United States is due to withdraw most of its troops by year's end. The latest violence comes amid disputes over the country's recent presidential election. During a visit to Kabul on Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced that an audit of votes would be carried out to decide the outcome of the election. Both candidates, Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani, have alleged large-scale vote fraud and manipulation during the runoff last month.","NEW: More than 40 killed in Paktika market attack .

"Paris (CNN) -- Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was called in for questioning Tuesday as part of a corruption investigation in connection with an inquiry into alleged abuse of power. Financial prosecutor Eliane Houlette confirmed that Sarkozy was called in around 8 a.m. local time by police in Nanterre. Investigators have been looking into Sarkozy's campaign financing, CNN's French affiliate BFMTV reported. They are trying to establish whether the former President, who led the country from 2007 to 2012, obtained confidential information on legal cases concerning him from top magistrates in exchange for the offer of a prestigious post, the channel said. Under French law, Sarkozy can be held for questioning for a day, which can be extended once by another 24 hours. The situation is unprecedented for a former president, BFMTV reported. His lawyer, Thierry Herzog, and two high-ranking magistrates were called in for questioning in the Paris area Monday, according to BFMTV. Their police custody was extended by another 24 hours Tuesday. Sarkozy left office in May 2012 after he lost in the presidential election to Socialist rival Francois Hollande. In recent months, speculation has grown that he might be positioning himself for a political comeback at the head of his center-right party, the UMP. CNN's Jim Bittermann reported from Paris and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy is called in for questioning, prosecutor says .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- At least 10 people living in a squalid refugee camp in the capital of Bangladesh died in a riot and arson attack Saturday, police and other government officials said. ""Most of the victims are women and children and the government has already ordered an investigation,"" district relief and rehabilitation officer Ekramul Haque told CNN. Police and witnesses said violent clashes erupted between locals and people living in the camp, who are widely known as ""stranded Pakistanis,"" in the Mirpur district of Dhaka. The incident followed an altercation when a group of children set off firecrackers during a religious event earlier on Saturday. Police said nine people were burned to death while the other was shot dead during the clashes. Urdu-speaking camp residents allege that several hundred Bengalis carrying machetes and logs attacked the shanty town and set fire to their houses; firefighters later extinguished the flames. Police told CNN they opened fire and lobbed tear gas shells to disperse the angry mob; they said they detained more than 50 people at the scene. A leader of the refugees, Abdul Jabbar Khan, claimed the attack was a part of a move by local influential politicians who wanted to evict the refugees from the camps. But Elias Mollah, a member of parliament from Mirpur, who belongs to the ruling Awami League party, denied the allegations. Khan who heads the Stranded Pakistanis General Repatriation Committee (SPGRC) told CNN about 2,000 people were living in the camp when it came under attack on Saturday. He said about 300,000 Urdu-speaking people live on government land in around 70 shanty towns, known as ""Bihari camps."" During the partition of India in 1947, several hundred thousand Muslims, mostly from the Indian state of Bihar, came to Dhaka and other cities in what is now Bangladesh. After Bangladesh gained independence, Pakistan refused to repatriate most of the Urdu-speaking people and they remained stranded in refugee camps. In 2008, Bangladesh's Supreme Court ruled that those who were born after independence had the right to Bangladeshi citizenship. 12 dead, dozens missing after Bangladesh ferry capsizes .","Arson attack, riots leave 10 people living Dhaka refugee camp dead .

"(CNN) -- In court, the South Carolina neo-Nazi couple seemed remorseful for the 2013 murder of a sex offender, but they changed their tunes when their life sentences were handed down. ""Child molesters do not deserve to live,"" Jeremy Moody said as he was led out of a Union County courthouse Tuesday wearing handcuffs and striped prison scrubs. ""Had to do it over again, I'd kill more."" As his wife, Christine Moody, was placed into a police car for transport to prison, she added, ""I have no regrets. Killing that pedophile was the best day of my life."" The couple was charged in the murders of Charles Parker, 59, and his wife, Gretchen, 51, in July. The Moodys went to their Jonesville home pretending to have car trouble, entered the home and killed the couple, Union County Chief Deputy Perry Haney said at the time. Jeremy Moody, 31, told police he killed the Parkers because Charles Parker was on the South Carolina sex offender registry, Haney said. He was convicted in 1991 of sexual assault on a child and again in 2003 of third-degree criminal sexual misconduct involving a 31-year-old woman, CNN affiliate WHNS reported, citing police and court records. Gretchen Parker was not a registered sex offender, Haney told CNN. The Parkers were found dead July 22. They'd been stabbed and shot with a .380 handgun, Haney said. Police used images from the Parkers' home surveillance system to track down their killers, he said. Integral to identifying Jeremy Moody, police said, were his tattoos: In addition to the words ""white power"" atop his bald head, he also has the word ""skinhead"" tattooed almost ear to ear beneath his chin. In bond court, Christine Moody, 37, called Charles Parker a ""demon,"" and she and her husband claimed to be part of a white supremacist group called Crew 41, WHNS reported. The pair pleaded guilty Tuesday to two counts of murder, two counts of kidnapping, two counts of possession of a firearm during a violent crime and first-degree burglary, the station said. Prior to their sentencing, both Moodys expressed remorse for their crimes, as Jeremy Moody told the court, ""Not a day goes by that I don't regret the incident that happened, and I know that what I've done is a sin."" Christine Moody also feigned contrition, reading from the Bible and saying, ""I truly believe God has forgiven Jeremy and I. I hope you do, too."" They told the court they suffered from mental problems and had a history of sexual abuse in their families. The Moodys' defense attorney asked for 30-year sentences, WHNS reported. But Circuit Judge Lee Alford wasn't buying it. ""I saw you smiling at each other in court,"" he told them, handing down life sentences. And with that, so went the Moodys' remorse. ""See you perverts later,"" Jeremy Moody said as he was escorted out of the courtroom. ""That's what child molesters get."" Outside the courthouse, Christine Moody told reporters that she and Jeremy have ""a love that will withstand"" their life sentences, and if given the opportunity, they'd kill Parker again. Reporters challenged her about her apparent change of heart: Was she lying when she told the court she had repented? ""No, it's not true. My lawyer made me say it,"" she said. And did she have anything to say to Parkers' families? ""May they die also,"" she said before officers placed her in the back of a squad car. Family members told WHNS they were pleased with the Moodys' sentences and unsurprised by their vitriol. That doesn't mean Charles Parker's sister was happy about being taunted. ""It made me mad. They was laughing about what they did, took somebody's life the way they did it,"" Brenda Franklin told the station. ""Nobody should die like that. Nobody.""","Jeremy and Christine Moody got life in prison for the 2013 murder of a sex offender .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration suspended Saturday yet another air traffic controller for sleeping on the job, the seventh apparent incident this year the agency has disclosed. The incident occurred at the Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center during the midnight shift early Saturday morning, two days before the FAA is expected to conduct meetings on air traffic control safety and professionalism, the FAA reported. According to a preliminary review of air traffic tapes, the controller did not miss any calls from aircraft and there was no operational impact, the agency said in a statement. The incident was reported to a manager by another controller, the FAA said. There were 12 controllers and two managers on duty. Last week, Hank Krakowski resigned as the head of the FAA Air Traffic Organization amid revelations that several controllers fell asleep on the job this year. All the incidents occurred during the midnight shifts, but the similarity ends there. Some occurred at local control towers, one occurred at a regional radar facility and the latest at a high-altitude center. In at least one incident, the FAA has said the controller deliberately went to sleep, while some of the others appear to have been accidental. Prior to the start of the midnight shift at the Miami facility, all the controllers were given a briefing on professionalism and the importance of reporting to work fit for duty, the FAA said. The controller who fell asleep has been suspended, the agency said. Other incidents of sleeping controllers have been reported in Washington, D.C.; Knoxville, Tennessee; Seattle, and Reno, Nevada. There have been two suspected cases in Lubbock, Texas. FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt disclosed the latest incident in a statement saying he is prohibiting scheduling practices that may be contributing to fatigue. The changes will be effective within 72 hours, Babbitt said. Paul Rinaldi, head of the controller's union, said Saturday his union and the FAA agree that fatigue and scheduling must be addressed. ""This latest incident earlier today is of great concern, as it is never acceptable when we don't provide the level of service expected and required of us on every shift. We take our responsibilities very seriously and believe fatigue is a significant factor in these instances,"" he said. Babbitt and Rinaldi on Monday will begin a cross-country tour of air traffic control facilities. Their first stop will be at an Atlanta-area regional radar facility. ""We are taking swift action to ensure the safety of our aviation system,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement Saturday. ""There is no excuse for air traffic controllers to be sleeping on the job. We will do everything we can to put an end to this."" On Thursday, Krakowski, resigned amid the furor caused by the controversy. David Grizzle, the FAA's chief counsel, was named acting chief of the unit during a search to fill Krakowski's post. Saturday morning, Grizzle briefed LaHood and Babbitt about the latest incident. ""We are taking important steps today that will make a real difference in fighting air traffic controller fatigue,"" Babbitt said. ""But we know we will need to do more. This is just the beginning.""","The head of the controller's union says fatigue and scheduling must be addressed .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Since the 2011 revolution, Egyptians have seen near non-stop protests, the toppling of two presidents, six elections, and a seemingly endless political crisis. But what they haven't witnessed yet is what has been demanded all along -- a better economy. As the country goes to the polls next week to elect a new president, both candidates insist this is something they can be trusted to deliver. Former army chief Abdel Fattah el Sisi pledges new roads, housing, airports, jobs and an end to the energy crisis. Sisi's lone opponent, left leaning politician Hamdeen Sabahi, has vowed to dish out millions of dollars in investments to help reopen government factories, create new jobs, build new housing and improve health care. These are lofty promises. But has either candidate offered specifics on how they will get things done? ""Not yet,"" said Cairo based economist, Angus Blair. ""We've still got a few weeks before elections but the pressure is growing on both of them to come up with plans and that includes Sisi."" Blair believes that in order to deliver on campaign promises, Egypt's next president must attract investors from both inside and outside Egypt through large scale economic reform. ""It's not going to be easy,"" he added. ""The problems are surmountable but I have to say the structural problems of Egypt's economy are enormous."" These problems include rising food prices, unemployment at roughly 14% and a crippling budget deficit of around 12% of GDP. On top of all that, passions are still running high over the ousting and trial of former president Mohamed Morsy who was removed from his post by the army in 2013. A critical step to recovery, many business-minded economists say, is cutting costly food and fuel subsidies that eat up roughly one third of Egypt's budget. But for the country's poor, cutting subsidies will be an extremely tough pill to swallow. To ease the impact, Blair says Egypt's next leader must launch projects to help the masses -- like improving transport and affordable housing -- that can be kick-started by billions of aid received from Gulf Arab states. ""If the right policies are in place, Egypt will respond quickly,"" Blair said. ""But changing sentiment is the key by putting right policies and right people in place to show something is changing."" Only then, he concludes, can Egypt's next president truly improve the economy and meet the demands of millions of Egyptians still waiting for a better life three years after revolution came to the country.

"Beijing (CNN) -- A prominent Uyghur scholar arrested by Chinese authorities for ""separatist activities"" has maintained his innocence from jail as his lawyer was allowed to meet him for the first time in months. Ilham Tohti, an economics professor at Beijing's Minzu University, was detained by police in January and taken to his native Xinjiang, China's restive far-western region where a spate of recent violent incidents have been blamed by the government on Uyghur separatists. Li Fangping, Tohti's lawyer, saw him Thursday in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang, and learned that his client was put in shackles for three weeks upon arrival at the jail. ""He went on a hunger strike for some 10 days in January after they refused to provide him with Muslim food,"" Li told CNN on Friday. ""They also denied him food for about 10 days in March after the Kunming incident."" On March 1, alleged Uyghur separatists stabbed 29 people to death at a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming. ""He looked okay but said he lost 16 kilograms and complained about ailments throughout the body, including in the liver, heart and eyes,"" Li added. The lawyer had feared that Tohti received a secret trial and heavy sentencing. Li describes himself as ""slightly more optimistic"" after Thursday's meeting and plans to push for more access to his client. Although a trial date remains unknown, Li said Tohti emphasized that he has never supported separatism. ""He reiterated that he has advocated to improve the rule of law, democracy and ethnic harmony in Xinjiang,"" Li said. CNN's repeated phone calls Friday to the Xinjiang government spokesman went unanswered. Vocal critic . Tohti is known for his research on Uyghur-Han relations and has been a vocal critic of the government's ethnic policies in Xinjiang, a resource-rich region long inhabited by the Turkic-speaking, largely Muslim Uyghurs. The arrival of waves of Han, China's predominant ethnic group, over the past decades has fueled ethnic tensions. Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward the Han majority in recent years over what they describe as harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and loss of economic opportunities to Han people in Xinjiang. Amnesty International has said that Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in employment, housing and educational opportunities, as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization. Other critics, including exiled Uyghur activists, have attributed the rise of violence in Xinjiang to Beijing's increasingly repressive rule there -- a claim the government vehemently denies. In the region's deadliest violent incident in recent history, a suicide bombing last month killed 39 people at a street market in Urumqi. Another apparent suicide bombing left three dead in April at an Urumqi train station. The Chinese government has responded by launching a massive anti-terrorism campaign as well as pouring more economic resources into Xinjiang . Executions . Last week, China executed 13 people convicted of terrorism charges related to attacks on public places in Xinjiang in recent months, state media reported. The same day, a court in Urumqi sentenced three people to death for their roles in a deadly attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square last October. Defendant names revealed by state media all sounded Uyghur. ""Repression plus economic incentives -- that has continued to be the government response,"" said Maya Wang, a Hong Kong-based researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""Economic development and job opportunities are important to the Uyghurs, but these things must be done in a way that respects their culture and freedom of expression. ""Unfortunately, the government is more interested in projecting what it wishes to do in Xinjiang rather than looking at what the real problems and ethnic grievances are in the region.""","Detained Uyghur scholar meets with lawyer for the first time in months .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Last weekend's 143 million-pound beef recall -- the largest in U.S. history -- was initiated not simply because cattle that couldn't walk made it into the U.S. food supply, but because they weren't reinspected after becoming immobile. Since 2004, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has required that cattle be able to walk to slaughter after an inspection by a USDA veterinarian -- largely as a precaution against bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. If the animal goes down after a veterinarian's pre-death inspection, which consists of observing the animals ""at rest and in motion,"" veterinarians must reinspect the animal before it can enter the food supply, according to a USDA spokesman. This rule was put in place when the first cow with mad cow disease was found in Washington state at the end of 2003. The symptoms of mad cow disease aren't always the obvious stumbling or odd posture seen in video of mad cows from England over a decade ago. The USDA says they also include changes in temperament, like nervousness or aggression, and decreased milk production. Cattle that can't walk to slaughter on their own are deemed ""downer cows"" because they may be sick. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer said Sunday in a statement that the recall was prompted ""because the cattle did not receive complete and proper inspection"" and were determined to be ""unfit for human food."" Only rarely does a cow pass pre-slaughter inspection, somehow become unable to walk, and then get re-examined by a veterinarian and pass for slaughter, according to Dr. Kenneth Petersen of the USDA. He says a likely explanation for such situations is an animal falling and injuring itself to the point where it can't walk. The animal could break a leg because ""it stepped onto a broken concrete floor or runs into a fence post,"" he suggested. That ""wouldn't be an illness,"" added Peterson, the USDA's executive associate for regulatory operations, office of field operations for the Food Safety and Inspection Service. Last year, the USDA decided to make permanent an exception to the ""no downer cattle should enter the food-supply rule"" by allowing a downed cow to go to slaughter if it had already passed pre-slaughter inspection and then passed another inspection after it lost its ability to walk. ""We proposed this to the public, got the comments, and this led to the final decision that the animals be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and could pass for slaughter,"" Petersen tells CNN. However, some strongly disagree with this decision, including Dr. Linda Detwiler, a former USDA veterinarian who trained other veterinarians to detect mad cow disease. She says the USDA should not make any exceptions to the downer cow rule. In making her case, she submitted several public comments that said that in the two cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy reported by the USDA, neither was set aside as a BSE suspect. ""The Washington State case [in 2003] was passed for human consumption because she was determined to have a calving injury,"" Detwiler said. A Canadian cow, also in 2003, was condemned because it had pneumonia. BSE was discovered in the cow only after it was rendered and its meat and bone meal distributed. Detwiler expressed concern about the USDA's chances of finding the disease before slaughter. Based on a Harvard risk assessment, agency inspectors expect to catch 95 percent of BSE cases in cattle that can walk, and 85 percent in cattle that can't. But in the United Kingdom, where the overwhelming number of BSE cases have been seen, veterinarians say they've been able to detect only half of BSE cases in pre-slaughter inspections. Petersen insists that few animals go down after pre-slaughter examination. He says, ""My veterinarian makes that determination"" if a downer animal can go on to slaughter -- ""they are under no pressure"" to let the animals pass inspection because ""the vets aren't interested in the plant's disposition."" But Detwiler says it's not possible to see the underlying neurological illnesses that could lead cattle to stumble, fall and break a leg. ""If I know the animal's history, then I can probably tell you what it went down with,"" she says. ""But if I see it for the first time, [as the USDA inspectors probably would], when it's down ... you don't know the underlying cause."" So far, 200 people worldwide have become infected with mad cow disease from eating beef from an infected cow. It can take many years for symptoms to appear. In the U.S., the first of three documented cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of mad cow disease, was a young woman named Charlene Singh. She got sick 13 years after living in England, where she probably consumed tainted beef at the height of the mad cow scare. The California plant at the center of the current controversy, Westland/Hallmark, is now shut down, and the San Bernardino district attorney has filed charges against two employees. One, Daniel Navarro, was taken into custody and has posted bail. The other, Luis Sanchez, remains at large. The plant can no longer operate because the USDA withdrew its inspectors after the Humane Society of the United States provided video of animal abuse at the plant and the USDA learned that some animals, so-called ""downer cows,"" were slaughtered without reinspection. Without USDA inspectors on site, the plant is not allowed to operate. The USDA says that the food supply is safe and that only two cows in the U.S. have been found to have BSE. Officials credit the low number to Food Safety and Inspection Service regulations prohibiting downer cattle from entering the food supply. Of the 143 million pounds of recalled beef produced by the Westland/Hallmark Meat Packing Company, 37 million pounds were provided to the federal food and nutrition programs. Consumers wondering whether they consumed some of the meat probably don't know because the USDA doesn't release the names of retailers who sold recalled meat, something the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest has been pushing for since the first mad cow scare in 2003. The USDA tells CNN that changing this rule is a priority for Dr. Richard Raymond, undersecretary for food safety, and ""we expect that the rule will be published and implemented this year.""

"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- The Humane Society of the United States is partly responsible for the magnitude of the largest beef recall in the nation's history, Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer said Thursday. Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer denies there is any food safety hazard with the recall. The Agriculture Department Sunday ordered the recall of 143 million pounds of beef that came from a California processing plant. Animals at the site were videotaped falling down and being hoisted by forklift to get them to slaughter. The tape is thought to have been made in October.  Watch what sparked the recall » . ""For four months they sat on that information,"" Schafer said, referring to the video, which prompted the USDA to withdraw its inspectors and close the facility. The Humane Society posted the video in late January and said it was part of the group's undercover investigation of conditions at the Westland/Hallmark Meat Packing Company of Chino, California. Schafer, expressing concern Thursday the group failed to immediately tell his agency about the footage, said they ""sat on four months of production that went out into the marketplace that's now being recalled."" Humane Society president Wayne Pacelle said any delay in releasing the video was caused by a request from a California district attorney's office that has since filed charges against two men who worked at the plant. Pacelle said his group went to local authorities because ""we have seen the USDA time and time again not take action."" But San Bernardino County District Attorney Michael Ramos was slow to respond and the Humane Society then decided to post the video to ""goad"" authorities into taking action, Pacelle said. ""Our food safety system should not have to depend on a non-government organization to unearth violations of the law,"" he said. The newly appointed agriculture secretary, in a briefing with reporters after remarks at a farm conference, declined to list additional retail outlets that may have bought and distributed the recalled meat products, some of which went to public school systems across the country. Federal regulations consider the information proprietary, but proposed changes are being reviewed. Schafer denied there is a food safety hazard with the recall. He said ""one cow that we know of went down just before moving into the gate, and we were supposed to be notified and were not."" Since 2004, the government has required that cattle be able to walk to slaughter after an inspection by a USDA veterinarian -- largely as a precaution against bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. If the animal goes down after a veterinarian's pre-death inspection, which consists of observing the animals ""at rest and in motion,"" veterinarians must reinspect the animal before it can enter the food supply, according to a USDA spokesman. A congressional panel on food safety plans hearings next month on the beef recall and will have questions about inspections and the level of voluntary compliance with rules on animal processing. ""Had they not been presented with the undercover video of Westland, this problem probably would not have been discovered or even investigated by USDA,"" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the Connecticut Democrat who leads the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture Administration. As of Thursday afternoon, officials had located 15.2 million pounds of the 143 million pounds of recalled beef. Agriculture officials said another 20 million pounds has already been consumed. The largest portion of the recalled beef -- 50.3 million pounds -- went to federal food and nutrition programs, according to updated numbers from Schafer in a Thursday afternoon phone call with reporters.

"(CNN) -- China's top soccer official has been sacked after being questioned by police as  part of an investigation into match-fixing. Nan Yong has been replaced by former water sports chief Wei Di, state-run news agency Xinhua reported on Friday, having been appointed head of the Chinese Soccer Administrative Center early last year. Deputy director Yang Yimin and head of referees Zhang Jianqiang were also questioned by police, Xinhua said. China's General Administration of Sport (GASC) made the decision to replace Nan with Chinese football in disarray following a series of scandals and with the national team having failed to qualify for the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. ""The GASC has decided to appoint Wei Di as the new director of China's Soccer Administrative Center,"" its vice-minister Cui Dalin told reporters, according to Xinhua. ""The decision to remove Nan Yong as director and Yang Yimin as deputy director has also been made since both of them are now helping the police in investigations into the commercial bribery and match-fixing cases."" Wei Di, who was head of China's Water Sports Administration, has little experience in football, having also been in charge of Chinese boxing and weightlifting. Nan, Yang and Zhang were summoned by police in the northeastern province of Liaoning to help with a probe into several cases of gambling and match-fixing in domestic league games, Xinhua reported . The Chinese Ministry of Public Security (MPS) is continuing investigations which saw four people detained for suspected bribery in November. More arrests were made in December, including two leading officials from the Chengdu Blades club, Xinhua said. China began its clean-up campaign in March last year with the creation of a high-profile committee charged with stamping out corruption in the sport.","China's top soccer official sacked after being questioned by police in match-fix probe .

"(CNN) -- No doubt about it, Republicans have latched on to a red hot potato when it comes to the controversy of who-did-what-when in Benghazi. The awful story of a terrible embassy attack, a botched aftermath and finger-pointing about what more could have been done has already been the subject of an exhaustive internal State Department investigation and congressional hearings. And the truth is that mistakes were made, everyone is somehow to blame and four people are dead who should not have died. It's a terrible mess. It seemed to be settling down a bit until last week. That's when the State Department -- after a request made under the Freedom of Information Act -- released a memo by a senior White House adviser that tried to ""underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader policy failure."" Republicans cried foul, especially when the White House offered the weak explanation that the e-mail was not specifically about Benghazi but rather about the ""general dynamic"" of the Muslim world at the time. Never mind that it was written as then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice was about to go on Sunday shows to discuss the event. So now comes a congressional inquiry -- a new panel with 7 GOPers and 5 Democrats. This time, it's the Democrats who are crying foul, and they're threatening to boycott the committee. I get it: They believe it's a witch hunt, and they don't want to participate. Why legitimize it? Why give it more credence? Why play into GOP hands? Here's why: If you don't participate, you can't defend. And if you can't defend -- or explain -- you lose. It's as simple as that. This is what's truly going on. This is a short-term political play by Republicans that, they hope, could also have some long-term implications for Hillary Clinton as a presidential candidate in 2016. After all, this happened on her watch as secretary of state. That job is one of the major line items on her resume. If the public's assessment of that tenure is called into question, then the value of that job experience is diminished. But there's a more immediate political play here. Midterm elections are occasions for partisan mobilization, plain and simple. In presidential years, the candidates are about the business of persuading independent voters to give them a shot. In midterm elections, it's about the partisans. Of the 40% of the electorate that generally shows up, almost no one is up for grabs. Candidates just need to get their party's loyalists to turn out. For Republicans, Motivator No. 1: Obamacare (or Obama). Motivator No. 2: Benghazi (or Hillary). So long as the economy keeps chugging along nicely, these issues become even more paramount. Sure, there's a danger of overreach. There always is. (See: Bill Clinton and impeachment.) But Republicans aren't worried about that now, because their partisans are, well, partisan. This is a play for November. In presidential elections, there's often a huge public appetite for a more forward-looking and affirmative candidate with a plan and a positive message and vision. But midterms are different. They're about partisan bloodletting. So if the Democrats decide to boycott the committee, it's at their own risk. They will lose out on the conversation, no matter how silly they think it is. They will be uninformed about witnesses, strategies, subpoenas. As Democrats learned during their participation in the ""Fast and Furious"" investigation, access to documents is a plus. You can play the game the way you want, leak what you want, tell your own narrative with the facts as you see them. No storyline left behind. If the Democrats boycott, they may see themselves taking the high road. Trouble is, it could lead them nowhere.

"(CNN) -- Turkey fired on Syrian government targets in response to the shelling of a Turkish border town in which five civilians were killed Wednesday, according to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office. The town of Akcakale ""was hit by artillery fire belonging to the Syrian regime forces,"" a statement from Erdogan's office said, in the first clear assertion of blame for the shelling. ""Our armed forces on the border responded immediately to this atrocious attack within the rules of engagement, and points in Syria determined by radar were hit with artillery fire,"" it said. ""Turkey, within the confines of the rules of engagement and international law, will never leave these types of provocations aimed at our national security unanswered."" Syrian refugees in Turkey: Police are forcing us from homes . The retaliatory artillery fire marks a significant increase in tension between the two countries, and CNN affiliate CNN Turk reported that witnesses observed intermittent artillery fire from Turkey into Syria continuing into the early hours Thursday. Syrian authorities are ""offering sincerest condolences on behalf of the Syrian government to the family of the deceased and the Turkish people"" and are investigating the source of the gunfire, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA). ""In case of border incidents that occur between any two neighboring countries, countries and governments must act wisely, rationally and responsibly, particularly since there's a special condition on the Syrian-Turkish borders in terms of the presence of undisciplined terrorist groups spread across the borders who have varying agendas and identities,"" said Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi. Opposition groups in Syria said artillery fire from Turkey fell on a government military center near Tal Abyad in northern Syria's Raqqa province. Turkish military reinforcements are deployed near the border, they added. The artillery shell fired into Turkey came from Tal Abyad, according to Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency. The North Atlantic Council, NATO's most senior political governing body, said it stands by Turkey. The alliance ""demands the immediate cessation of such aggressive acts against an ally, and urges the Syrian regime to put an end to flagrant violations of international law,"" the council said after an emergency meeting. The Syrian government has a recent pattern of ""aggressive attacks"" at NATO's southeastern border, it said. Akcakale Mayor Abdulhakim Ayhan said earlier that three children, their mother and a female neighbor died when a house was hit. Two police officers were among those hurt, he said. Nine people were injured when the shell landed on the town in Sanliurfa province, near the Syrian border, the Turkish prime minister's statement said. Relations between Turkey and Syria were already under strain over Damascus' response to an 18-month-long uprising against the government of President Bashar al-Assad. Civil war in Syria . A senior U.S. defense official said the Pentagon is watching the situation with some degree of concern, ""but at this point, there's nothing to suggest it's going to become a broader conflict."" The official said the reciprocal fire appeared to be a smaller-scale border skirmish rather than a large-scale aerial bombardment. ""We think this is Turkey basically saying, 'Don't mess with us. Whatever is going on inside Syria, don't mess with us,'"" the official told CNN. Both nations would have an interest in not allowing the conflict to escalate, according to the official. ""In some ways, Turkey would have more to lose in that kind of fight than Syria. They've already got a potential refugee problem coming from Syria, and a fight would only make that worse, the official said, adding that ""Syria has so many problems right now, the last thing the government needs is to add another."" Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to express his government's ""deepest concern"" about the shelling, U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said. Before launching its military strike against Syrian targets Wednesday, Turkey reached out to NATO and U.N. chiefs. Ban issued a statement expressing condolences to the shelling victims in Turkey. He called on Syria to respect the territorial integrity of its neighbors. The U.N. Security Council privately discussed the situation. Syria's internally displaced languish in squalor at Turkish border . ""The secretary-general has repeatedly warned that the ongoing militarization of the conflict in Syria is leading to tragic results for the Syrian people,"" Ban said. ""Today's incidents, where firing from Syria struck a Turkish town, again demonstrated how Syria's conflict is threatening not only the security of the Syrian people but increasingly causing harm to its neighbors."" Musa Ozer, who lives next to the house where the artillery shell landed, was crying as he spoke on the phone with CNN in the aftermath of the attack. ""The bomb fell on us. My head's really not in the right place right now,"" he said. ""My uncle was injured and his wife died. What am I to make of this?"" Ayhan said the shell landed on one house but debris from the impact scattered across a wider area, leading to the high number of injuries. He also voiced the concern felt by residents of the southeastern town. ""The people of Akcakale are rising up against this. They live in fear,"" he told CNN Turk. The mayor said the shell that caused the deaths was the second to land Wednesday on Akcakale. Salih Aydogdu, a local neighborhood mayor, called for authorities to act to prevent such incidents. ""Over the last month, we've had these types of incident five or six times. This is a small place; every time it happens, we can hear it. We are right on the border with Syria,"" he said. ""The people of Akcakale are upset. We want the governor and the police to take precautions. This was Turkey's most peaceful and tranquil area. Now we have neither peace nor tranquility."" For the past two weeks, schools have been closed in the town, and the teachers have left, he added. Akcakale has been rocked by previous fighting just across the border in Syria. Last month, Turkish residents watched as Syrian shells crashed into Syrian territory, barely a stone's throw away from the Turkish border fence. The close artillery barrage forced Turkish authorities to temporarily shut schools in Akcakale and close off roads leading to the Syrian border. Rebel leadership announces move from Turkey to Syria . Only two years ago, Syria and Turkey enjoyed cozy bilateral relations. The neighbors had instituted visa-free travel for their citizens, and cross-border trade was booming. Diplomatic relations ruptured, however, months after the Syrian uprising began. Last March, Turkey shuttered its embassy in Damascus and the Syrian government declared Turkey's ambassador, Omer Onhon, persona non grata. Erdogan has repeatedly denounced Syrian President al-Assad, publicly calling on him to step down after accusing him of massacring his own people. The Syrian government, meanwhile, has accused Turkey of arming and funding Syrian rebels. CNN journalists have witnessed light weapons in the form of assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns coming from Turkey to Syrian rebels. In addition, Turkey is currently hosting more than 93,000 Syrian refugees in camps. Turkish officials estimate another 40,000 to 50,000 unofficial refugees live in Turkey outside refugee camps. This is not the first deadly cross-border incident between the two neighbors. On Tuesday, Turkish officials announced at least two suspected Kurdish fighters were killed after a clash broke out along the border in Turkey's Mardin province. In June, the Syrian government announced it had shot down a Turkish military reconnaissance jet after it crossed into Syrian airspace. Two Turkish pilots were killed in the incident. The Turkish government continues to insist the jet was shot down by a surface-to-air missile after it left Syrian airspace -- claims that the Syrian government denies.

"London (CNN) -- Gareth Williams, the MI6 codebreaker found dead inside an externally locked bag in his apartment in 2010, was probably not killed as previously believed, London's Metropolitan Police said Wednesday, citing a lack of evidence otherwise. Taking a different position from a coroner's report last year that said it was likely someone killed Gareth Williams, London's Metropolitan Police said its three-year investigation suggested that Williams most likely locked himself inside the large bag. Read more: Coroner finds spy likely suffocated or poisoned . ""We believe that it is a more probable conclusion that there was no other person present when Gareth died,"" Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt said. But the Met said that despite its investigation, there remained insufficient evidence to be definitive on how Williams died. ""There are holes in what we understand about the circumstances of Gareth Williams' death,"" Hewitt said, admitting that some of the evidence is ""odd."" This includes the lack of Williams' DNA on the padlock used to lock the large red bag his body was found in and the lack of hand prints on the edge of the bath where it was found, he said. ""What we are left with is either individual pieces of evidence, or a lack of such evidence, that can logically support one of a number of hypotheses,"" Hewitt said. The case has gripped the British public since Williams, known for his mathematical genius and code-breaking talent, was found dead at age 31 in August 2010. Among the theories aired by UK media were that Williams might have died at the hands of foreign intelligence agents or as a result of a kinky sexual encounter gone wrong. Added to that speculation was the discovery of women's clothes, wigs and cosmetics in Williams' apartment. At the inquest into his death last year, coroner Fiona Wilcox shot down that speculation, saying she thought Williams bought them out of an interest in fashion, rather than any sexual motivation. Read more: Mysterious spy death grips Britain . Other reports about the ""body-in-a-bag spy"" detailed how two experts spent days trying to figure out whether Williams could have contorted himself in such a way as to lock himself into the North Face holdall bag, with a key to the padlock inside. Video of two experts trying to recreate the scene was showing to the court. One had tried 300 times without success, but neither ruled out definitively the possibility Williams could have somehow done it alone. ""It is now proven that it is theoretically possible for a person to lock themselves in that exact holdall, with the same type of lock, and in the configuration in which Gareth was found. It is important to note that this fact was found to be a possibility by the inquest,"" Hewitt said. Meanwhile, family members suggested Williams had been murdered by killers versed in the ""dark arts"" of espionage. Referring to speculation that Williams' flat might have been forensically cleaned by unknown people responsible for his death, Hewitt said Wednesday that a deep-clean would have removed all traces of Williams' DNA as well that of visitors to his flat. He said 10 to 15 traces of DNA had been found that were too insignificant to use to build a full profile and said advances in forensic science could ""present opportunities for progress."" For the time being, however, there are ""no active lines of enquiry that it is proportionate to pursue."" Williams' family expressed their regret that mystery still surrounds his death but said they agree with the coroner's verdict ""on the basis of the facts at present known."" ""We are naturally disappointed that it is still not possible to state with certainty how Gareth died and the fact that the circumstances of his death are still unknown adds to our grief,"" they said in a written statement. The family reiterated their disappointment that Williams' employers at MI6 had not checked on his welfare when he failed to attend work on August 16, 2010. Williams was finally reported missing by a co-worker on August 23, more than a week after the normally punctilious employee had last shown up at work. ""We believe that if proper steps had been taken in the same manner as any reasonable employer would have undertaken, further information relating to the cause of his death might have become apparent and not have been lost due to the length of time before Gareth's body was found,"" they said. The family also noted that the Met's investigators ""were at last able to interview directly members of (UK intelligence agencies) GCHQ and SIS."" Addressing media, Hewitt disputed a suggestion that police had been ""blindsided"" in their investigation by intelligence agencies but acknowledged that their method of interaction had improved during the investigation. ""We didn't get it right at the beginning,"" he said. Initially, he said, the only Met officers to deal with the intelligence agencies were those in SO15 -- or counterterrorism command. The SO15 officers had assessed Williams' vetting and personnel files and found nothing relevant to the case. After the inquest, the senior investigating officer in the case personally requested and was granted access to the files and came to the same conclusion, Hewitt said. ""The investigation into Gareth's death will remain under review, and any new significant information or evidence will be robustly investigated,"" he said. ""If it is possible for us to give his family more answers we will do so.""","MI6 codebreaker Gareth Williams' body was found locked in a bag in his apartment in 2010 .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- It's a large district in and around Philadelphia. It's not a swing seat; it's a safe Democratic strongholdâ€”not a nailbiter. But in this midterm election, the 13th Congressional District race has attracted some national attention and some rock star fundraisers: Bill and Hillary Clinton. Why such attention and star power? Because the candidate is Marjorie Margolies: related by marriage to the Clintons and tied to the former President by history. Margolies first gained national attention 20 years ago. She lost her seat as a freshman House member after voting for Bill Clinton's 1993 signature economic plan. It was about to go down after multiple Democratic defections. He needed one vote; she was it. ""I don't regret my vote,"" she said at the time. ""Nor do I apologize for it."" Clinton remained in her considerable debt. Neither she nor the President could have known then that they would be bound in another way: Her son, Marc, married Chelsea Clinton, who is now expecting their first child. And while the Clintons have raised money for her campaign, they're not exactly campaign regulars. In memoir excerpts, Clinton honors her mom . The political question: how much Clinton is enough? ""We always knew that if they came in too much we would be blamed for their coming in too much. If they don't come in enough, then people would say they didn't come in enough. You're kind of damned if you do, damned if you don't,"" Margolies told CNN. ""They have done everything we've asked them to do, and I am running on what I have accomplished in the last 20 years and not on my affiliation with the Clintons."" But that's hardly something she can, or really wants to, escape. A campaign ad using Bill Clinton's appearance on her behalf went up on the air Wednesday with him saying ""If you send Marjorie to Congress she will make you proud ... and this district will be well-served if you elect her."" Hillary Clinton is headlining a fundraiser in New York City for her Thursday evening. And her vote to pass Clinton's economic plan back in the day is a subject she does not shy away from as he campaigns in her old district that was once largely Republican, but is now largely Democratic. Predictably, she's come under some criticism about how her campaign has used the Clintons. One of her opponents, Daylin Leach, released an ad featuring some of Bill Clinton's remarks touting Margolies. Then Leach's daughter comes on the screen saying ""While some cling to the past, we just can't go backwards."" How many pro-Clinton super PACs is too many? The campaign hopes the Clintons can gave Margolies a last minute boost in fundraising and turnout. ""I want to get one thing out of the way. I would be here if her son wasn't my son-in-law,"" President Clinton said at a campaign event for Margolies last month. ""I'm not saying vote for her because 20 years ago she saved the economy."" She also saved the Clinton presidency, according to a top former aide, Paul Begalaâ€”and knowingly lost her job. ""I'm quite sure he knew that that was a political death knell for somebody who had just won by the narrowest of margins. And he was very impressed by that,"" Begala said of the President's reaction. Margolies remembers the day of that vote in August of 1993. ""The Republicans were high fiving, saying it's going down,"" Margolies recounted in the interview. ""A lot of Democrats were talking about changing their vote."" The President called her. ""He said what would it take?"" she recalled. ""I said I will only be your last vote. I know how important it is."" That point was not lost on the President. Clinton and senior White House staff huddled around a small television in an office just off the Oval Office. They watched Margolies walk the plank. Hillary Clinton steps further into politics with Margolies fundraiser . ""Republicans stood there and taunted her and said 'bye bye Marjorie,"" said Begala. They were right. Her deciding vote may have saved Clinton, but she would end up losing her seat the next year. In the book of isn't-this-a-small-world, Margolies is now part of the extended Clinton family. In fact, she and the Clintons are preparing to be co-grandparents. But as voluble as she is on politics, she's just as silent when it comes to the Clintons. When asked about family matters, she becomes downright monosyllabic. When asked if she has anything to say about her and Hillary Clinton being co-grandmothers she responded ""no."" Asked if she and the Clintons are friends she said ""It's an area that I will not get into,"" adding: ""They are lovely. The Clintons couldn't be any nicer."" And when asked what it was like for her son to marry into such a political dynasty, Margolies told CNN ""It's surprisingly normal."" That depends on how you define normal. As for the race itself, Margolies has a fight on her hands. She's locked in a tight four-way Democratic primary despite being the early frontrunner. The district is now solidly Democratic and runs from the affluent suburbs into the blue-collar area of North Philadelphia. She campaigns as an advocate for abortion rights and boosting the middle class. She has been attacked by opponents for misusing campaign funds which she denies. She also got hit for not campaigning aggressively in the early days. She has ramped up her schedule and participated in more debates. How strong is Hillary? Karl Rove is attacking her .","Former Rep.

"(CNN) -- A 22-year-old Boston University graduate who fell down an elevator shaft at Boston's Fenway Park remains in serious condition, and ""her prognosis is uncertain,"" a lawyer for her family said Tuesday. Elisabeth Scotland of New Jersey fell into the elevator shaft after a Red Sox game Friday, the day of her graduation from the Boston University's School of Management. Though the cause of the accident remains under investigation, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security said ""extreme force"" against the bottom of the elevator door probably caused a break of the ""fasteners and metal back-up safety system"" that kept the door in place. Spokesman Terrel Harris said investigators believe that the force caused the door to give, but the cause of the pressure is unclear. He said the elevator, which was operating properly during its last inspection in February, remains out of service. ""The Scotland family appreciates the many expressions of concern and support that have come from the Boston community and the Red Sox organization,"" said a statement released by Patrick Jones, a lawyer for Scotland's family. ""They acknowledge with gratitude the outpouring of love and support from their South Jersey community."" The statement added, ""At this time Lizzy continues to receive medical and surgical care and attention at Beth Israel; her condition is serious and her prognosis is uncertain."" Scotland was transported to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center after the fall. ""Somehow (the) elevator shaft doors on floor 4 opened,"" the Boston Fire Department said on Twitter. Scotland fell into the shaft, landing on the roof of the elevator, the department said. She'd fallen ""anywhere from 20 to 30 feet,"" fire department spokesman Steve McDonald told CNN affiliate WCVB. ""The firefighters went to the upper floors and were able to look down and see her,"" McDonald added. ""She was not moving."" Firefighters cut power to the elevator after stopping it on the second floor, the fire department said. Rescuers did not wait for a ladder; they used a chair and boosted themselves up through a hatch to the roof. They immobilized the victim and lowered her through the hatch, the fire department said. In a statement before Saturday night's game against the Detroit Tigers, the Red Sox said: ""The Massachusetts Department of Public Safety and the Boston Police Department are working to determine exactly what happened. Due to the ongoing investigation, and out of respect for the family of the young woman who was injured, the Red Sox will have no further comment at this time."" The Red Sox lost Friday night to the Tigers 1-0. The incident occurred shortly after the game ended.

"(Skift) -- American Airlines had the lowest number of on-time arrivals of any airline this September, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation's Air Travel Consumer Report released Thursday. Only 58 percent of American flights arrived on time and 3.1 percent of its flights were canceled. Weather is the most common cause of delays for carriers. Factors within the airline's control, such as maintenance and crew problems, are the second most common cause. In the case of American Airlines, factors within the airline's control were the primary cause of the exorbitant delays. The bankrupt airline has had long, drawn-out negotiations with pilots over their contracts, and its relationship with maintenance and ground crews is strained because of layoffs and pay cuts. During the September delays, American management accused its pilots of intentionally delaying flights by calling out sick or writing up last-minute maintenance issues to protest new work and pay rules imposed by the airline. ""There is no sick out. The union does not condone it,"" said Captain John S. Diacsuk, an American Airlines pilot who has flown for the airline for over 23 years.Â . American announced earlier this week that it would attempt to make up for its poor performance this fall by offering double elite qualifying miles for any flight flown in November and December this year.Â . Skift: Moving to Canada? Read this first, disgruntled voters . It wasn't just about the pilots . On September 30, a flight from Boston to Miami was forced into an emergency landing at New York's JFK airport when a row of seats became unbolted during flight. A second incident occurred the following Monday evening, prompting American to ground eight planes as it further investigates the cause of the safety issues. The FAA replied to an inquiry into the cause of the maintenance issue stating, ""preliminary information indicates that a row of three seats in the coach cabin apparently became loose. Three passengers were accommodated in other seats before the aircraft landed safely at JFK."" The FAA also previously announced in August that it was seeking up to $162 million in fines from American for safety violations and had placed American under close scrutiny following its declaration of bankruptcy last November.

"(CNN) -- The head of the National Security Agency denied Tuesday that the United States collected telephone and e-mail records directly from European citizens, calling reports based on leaks by Edward Snowden ""completely false."" ""To be perfectly clear, this is not information that we collected on European citizens. It represents information that we, and our NATO allies, have collected in defense of our countries and in support of military operations,"" Army Gen. Keith Alexander, the NSA director, told a House committee reviewing the agency's surveillance activities. The statement by Alexander before the House Intelligence Committee came as a number of lawmakers called for changes to the way intelligence is collected. The hearing, billed as a discussion of potential changes to the 35-year-old Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, commonly known as FISA, follows a report by the German magazine Der Spiegel that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. Some reports also suggest the United States carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens. It was the latest in a series of allegations that stem from disclosures given to news organizations by Snowden, the former NSA contractor who describes himself as a whistle-blower. Rocky relations . The allegations have rocked U.S.-European relations with a number of countries calling for investigations. Germany has threatened to cut off the ability of the United States to track bank transfers associated with terror groups. As the nation's spy chiefs testified, two ranking lawmakers from opposing parties introduced bills that call for greater transparency and oversight of the NSA's surveillance programs. But during the hearing, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said collecting foreign intelligence was important to protecting Americans and allies from terrorism. ""Every nation collects foreign intelligence. That is not unique to the United States,"" said Rogers, R-Michigan. ""What is unique to the United States is our level of oversight, our commitment to privacy protections, and our checks and balances on intelligence collection."" Alexander said media outlets misinterpreted documents that were leaked. He said the NSA legally collected metadata from some phone calls, and the rest of the metadata came from U.S. allies. He said European intelligence services collected phone records in war zones and other areas outside their borders and shared them with the NSA. Alexander vigorously defended the agency's intelligence gathering activities, saying it has saved lives ""not only here but in Europe and around the world."" 'Fundamental given' Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said that trying to determine the intentions of foreign leaders -- by getting close to them or getting their communications -- is a ""fundamental given"" among intelligence services, and one of the first things he learned in his 50-year intelligence career. Asked by Rogers if he believes U.S. allies conducted espionage activities against U.S. leaders, Clapper said, ""Absolutely."" Snowden's revelations about U.S. intelligence-gathering activities have been ""extremely damaging,"" Clapper said. But, he added, the activities themselves have been lawful, and ""rigorous oversight"" has been effective. Top senator: Obama didn't know of U.S. spying on Germany's leader . Even so, Clapper admitted there have been mistakes. ""We do not spy on anyone except for valid foreign intelligence purposes and we only work within the law. Now, to be sure, on occasion, we've made mistakes -- some quite significant,"" Clapper said. ""But these are usually caused by human error or technical problems and, whenever we have found mistakes, we've reported, addressed and corrected them."" But it is those mistakes that have prompted calls for reform, including from a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. FISA ""must be reformed"" to improve transparency about and restore the public's confidence in the United States' intelligence gathering activities, Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, said. ""We must improve transparency, privacy protections and thereby restore the public's confidence."" Yet, the reforms must preserve the intelligence community's abilities to help protect the nation, he said. Ruppersberger said authorities were considering a proposal to require a declassification review of any FISA Court decision order or opinion ""to improve transparency without threatening sources and methods."" The FISA Court grants or refuses surveillance rights requests from U.S. government agencies. Meanwhile, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, introduced legislation to limit the NSA's collection and analysis of cell phone calls and emails. It was an about-face for the two men, who were the leading authors of the Patriot Act in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Reporting mistakes . Alexander, the NSA director, said that of the billions of records of personal data collected last year by the agency, just 288 of them were reviewed. And technical safeguards exist to ensure that the data are not available to non-authorized personnel, he said. Only 22 people at NSA are authorized to look at certain phone numbers, he said, and about 30 are authorized to look into the database that contains those numbers. Referring to the unauthorized release of documents about the NSA's activities, he said, ""Nothing that has been released has shown that we are trying to do something illegal or unprofessional; when we find a mistake, a compliance issue, we report it to this committee, to all our overseers, and we correct it."" Opinion: Does Obama still have faith in Government? In his testimony Tuesday, Clapper noted that he had ordered the declassification of a series of documents in recent months to inform the public debate on the matter, and would continue to do so. ""These documents let our citizens see the seriousness, the thoughtfulness and the rigor with which the FISA court exercises its responsibilities,"" he said, adding that the NSA comprises ""honorable people."" Though changes must be made, he urged lawmakers to ""remain mindful of the potential long-term impact of overcorrecting."" Most of the documents released by Clapper date to 2009, when the administration was pushing lawmakers to reauthorize sections of the Patriot Act that were set to expire. Most of the newly declassified documents describe the aggressive push by the NSA, FBI and the Justice Department for lawmakers to save the bulk telephone data collection effort, known as the 215 program, because it was important for their efforts to thwart terrorist threats. NSA spying claims: Five things you need to know . The collection of mobile phone data, or metadata -- including numbers called and date, time and length of calls -- began in 2006 and matched the NSA's collection of land line telephone data. At the same time, lawmakers were urged not to discuss the classified program for fear it would hurt national security, the documents say. This year, after Snowden released the cache of classified documents, including court orders detailing the 215 bulk data program, many lawmakers said they were shocked about the extent of the program.

"(CNN) -- Possible tornadoes cut a wide swath through north Texas on Wednesday night, killing at least six people and injuring more than 100 others, officials said. There were ""multiple fatalities"" in the wake of the storm that touched down in Granbury, said Kathy Jividen, a spokeswoman for the Hood County sheriff's office. Hood County Sheriff Roger Deeds said six people were killed when the powerful storm struck a Habitat for Humanity neighborhood in the area. There were about 120 homes in the neighborhood and most of them were destroyed, Deeds said. About 100 people were injured, said Matt Zavadsky, a spokesman for MedStar Mobile Healthcare. He said the tornado touched down several times in Hood, Tarrant, Dallas and Parker counties. ""With these types of tornadoes, they touch down; they lift up; they touch down. They tend to hopscotch,"" he said. ""This is truly breaking news, and again the darkness doesn't help, but the crews on scene are doing a really good job to try and reach out to the folks that might be trapped or unable to get to a shelter or the triage area."" There were reports of homes in Granbury being flattened with people inside, Hood County Judge Darrell Cockerham said. Donna Martin, a worker at a local veteran's organization, said some suffered injures. ""There are a lot of traumatic injuries,"" Martin said. ""My husband told me that a car was lifted in the air. It just came in and hit so fast"" City officials were sending school buses to affected neighborhoods to help with evacuations. The National Weather Service warned that a mile-wide tornado reported by spotters had shifted its track and was moving ""right at the city of Cleburne,"" a community of about 15,000 people in north Texas. ""If you are in its path ... take cover immediately to protect your life,"" the weather service alert said. The National Weather Service also said 32 counties in Texas and four in Oklahoma were under a tornado watch until 1 a.m. CT. Officials hadn't confirmed that a tornado actually touched down in Dallas but said the storm was capable of producing one.

"TBLISI, Georgia (CNN) -- Russian forces launched an airstrike against a military airfield near the Tbilisi International Airport early Sunday, despite international calls for Russia to stand down from the escalating conflict, Georgian officials told CNN. The attack near the Georgian capital city came after a day of intense fighting in the former Soviet republic, with dozens of Russian warplanes bombing civilian and military targets in Georgia on Saturday. As many as 2,000 people had been killed in the capital of separatist Georgian province South Ossetia, according to a Russian ambassador. ""The city of Tskhinvali no longer exists. There is nothing left. It was wiped out by the Georgian military,"" the Russian news agency Interfax said, quoting the Russian ambassador to Georgia, Vyacheslav Kovalenko. Tskhinvali residents who survived the bombardment by hiding in basements and later fled the city estimated that hundreds of civilians had died. They said bodies were everywhere, according to The Associated Press. CNN could not independently confirm any death tolls, which varied greatly depending on the source. Alexander Lomaia, secretary of Georgia's National Security Council, said dozens of Georgian troops had lost their lives.  Watch Georgian minister describe fighting in South Ossetia » . ""Our losses are mounting ... as many as 40 military servicemen killed and over 100 wounded,"" he said. ""The losses are also mounting among civilian population in the cities."" Lomaia said Georgian troops in Tskhinvali were engaged in fierce ground battles on Saturday with Russian troops, whom he said were engaged in a full-scale military operation. The operation included tanks, armored vehicles, heavy artillery, soldiers and paratroopers, Lomaia said. Military aircraft were crossing the Georgian border about every 15 minutes, he said, hitting civilian, economic and military targets. He said that at least 50 military jets were being used.  Watch images of crashed Georgian war plane » . ""Frankly, we have not expected the Russian invaders to hit our residential buildings, to hit our peaceful cities, to hit our peaceful citizens,"" he said. He said he couldn't confirm whether Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, had been hit. ""From the legal point of view, our actions are absolutely justified and legitimate,"" Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said in Vladikavkaz, the capital of the Russian region of North Ossetia. ""Moreover, they are necessary."" He arrived in the region that borders South Ossetia on Saturday night. Putin's press secretary told Interfax that the premier was concerned about the flood of refugees arriving in Russia from South Ossetia. Russian officials said that more than 30,000 refugees have left South Ossetia and crossed into Russia over the past two days, Interfax reported. ""The actions of the Georgian authorities in South Ossetia are a crime, of course, primarily a crime against their own people,"" Putin said. ""This aggression led to numerous casualties, among civilians in particular, and virtually caused a real humanitarian catastrophe. And that is already a crime against the Ossetian people,"" he said. ""At the same time I would like to stress that Georgia has always been greatly respected in Russia and Georgians regarded as brotherly people,"" the premier said. Russians struck several major targets Saturday, including the Black Sea port of Poti, an airport, a major pipeline and a military base and train station in Senaki in western Georgia, Lomaia said. Georgian officials said that a center housing civilians had also been hit. Eight Georgians died in the port town, Georgian officials said. The Kodori Gorge in upper Abkhazia -- a second breakaway province in Georgia -- was also bombarded by at least 12 Russian jets, Lomaia said. Georgia's public television station reported a second round of bombings in Abkhazia at just before 11:30 p.m. Military bases at Vaziani and Marneuli also came under attack, the British Foreign Office said, and Russian aircraft bombed the Georgian town of Gori, about 35 miles northwest of Tbilisi, Georgian officials said. An Associated Press reporter who visited Gori shortly after the Russian airstrikes Saturday saw several apartment buildings in ruins, some still on fire, and scores of dead bodies and bloodied civilians. The elderly, women and children were among the victims. A Russian naval fleet was anchored in the Black Sea port of Ochamchire in Abkhazia province, Lomaia added. ""We have managed to down 10 Russian jets, and one of the pilots has been captured alive and is being treated in a military hospital,"" Lomaia said. ""We have also destroyed up to 30 Russian tanks and heavy military [vehicles]."" The situation in South Ossetia escalated rapidly from Thursday night, when Georgia said it had launched an operation into the region after its unilateral cease-fire was met with artillery fire from separatists that killed 10 people, including peacekeepers and civilians. It accused Russia of backing the separatists. Russian tanks began rolling into Georgia on Thursday night. On Saturday, the Georgian parliament approved President Mikhail Saakashvili's request to impose a ""state of war"" for 15 days, officials said. The order is not a formal declaration of war and stops short of declaring martial law, according to Georgian officials. It gives Saakashvili powers he would not ordinarily have, such as issuing curfews, restricting the movement of people or limiting commercial activities, those officials said. Saakashvili asked Western leaders to pressure Russia to agree to an immediate cease-fire. ""We are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers, which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences,"" Saakashvili said Saturday afternoon. U.S. President Bush, speaking from Beijing, China, called for an immediate halt to the violence, a stand-down by all troops and an end to the Russian bombings. He urged the sides to return to ""the status quo of August the 6th.""  Watch Bush express concerns over situation » . ""The attacks are occurring in regions of Georgia far from the zone of conflict in South Ossetia. They mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis,"" Bush said in a statement while attending the Olympic Games, according to The Associated Press. Bush spoke Saturday evening to Saakashvili and Russian President Medvedev, a White House spokesman said. The war, Saakashvili said, ""is not about South Ossetia. It has never been in the first place. It is about destroying a small democratic nation aspiring to live in peace, freedom and liberty."" ""This unprovoked, long-time-ago-planned invasion and aggression must stop,"" he said. It was unclear which side controlled Tskhinvali on Saturday. The Georgians said fighting raged, but the Russians said they had ""liberated"" the city. ""Battalion task forces have fully liberated Tskhinvali of Georgian armed forces and started pushing Georgian units out of the area of responsibility of the peacekeeping forces,"" General Vladimir Boldyrev, commander of the Russian Ground Forces, told Interfax. Colonel-General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, said that Georgians had shot down two Russian aircraft, contradicting Georgian claims. Georgia, a pro-Western ally of the United States, is intent on asserting its authority over South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Both have strong Russian-backed separatist movements. Inside South Ossetia, civilians have been without water, electricity and basic services for more than a day, said Maia Kardava, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Tbilisi. She said the Red Cross was unable to reach colleagues based in Tskhinvali because their phones had lost power and they were huddled in bomb shelters.

"(CNN) -- Rowing across the Atlantic Ocean may be an extreme test of human endurance but an all female crew who completed the feat discovered a secret tactic to ease the physical burden -- rowing nude. ""We spent a lot of time rowing naked because when the sea water gets inside your clothes it increases friction against your skin which can cause sores,"" says Debbie Beadle, Skipper of the Row for Freedom team. ""If you row naked it means you don't rub as much and you also get dry much quicker instead of constantly having wet clothes,"" she adds. The unconventional ploy worked to perfection as Beadle and her fellow crew members -- Julia Immonen, Katie Pattison-Hart, Kate Richardson and Helen Leigh -- smashed the existing Atlantic crossing record for a boat of five rowers, taking just 45 days. The British team also became the first all female boat to complete the 2,600 mile voyage between the Canary Islands and Barbados, although they were sure to don clothing as they approached their final destination last month. See also: Teenager's historic round the world sail . ""Getting the records was just amazing,"" says Beadle. ""It was something we worked hard for and were really determined to achieve when we set out."" The trip followed a route previously used to transport slaves between Europe and the Americas in the 19th century, raising money for UK-based anti-human trafficking charities the A21 Campaign and ECPAT UK. Beadle, whose day job is a youth worker at ECPAT UK, says the motivation to achieve something notable for such a worthy cause far outweighed any inhibitions that she or the crew may have held. ""We got to know each other very well,"" says Beadle as she recalls airing her sores in front of her ship mates after a particularly hard day of rowing. ""What's been most inspiring since we got back however is that some of the young people that I work with have told me they've been inspired by us to take up a 10 kilometer run which is really quite sweet,"" she says. As well as having to improvise to counter boils and sores, Beadle and her crew faced numerous other unexpected challenges during the course of their epic voyage. She highlights the steering on the boat breaking and losing much of their food when hatches became flooded with sea water as two of the most daunting issues to arise. ""Our water maker, which made most of our water, also broke but in the end we were brought closer together by everything that happened. We even used to sing to each other to keep our spirits up,"" says Beadle. ""By the end we were quite dehydrated,"" she adds. ""But it was a great feeling when we realized what we had achieved."" See also: Round the world rowing and cycle challenge . Beadle and her crew mates have since returned to their day jobs but are already busy plotting their next mission. ""Because of our focus on human trafficking we are considering traveling across some of the deserts in North Africa which are major trafficking routes,"" she says. But no matter what the crew end up doing next Beadle thinks it likely and preferable that the task will be completed fully dressed. ""It was a necessity at the time but our next mission will definitely be with clothes on,"" she says.","An all female team has rowed across the Atlantic Ocean going naked most of the way .

"(CNN) -- Michael Strahan loves the mega-romantic film ""The Notebook,"" isn't afraid to admit his fear of snakes, supports same-sex marriage and makes Kelly Ripa giggle like no one else. Is it any wonder he's a media darling? The former NFL star is a rising star of another sort these days with gigs as co-host on the popular morning show ""Live with Kelly and Michael,"" as a sports commentator and now reports that he may be joining ""Good Morning America."" Michael Strahan on verge of joining 'Good Morning America' It's an interesting trajectory for the 6-foot-5-inch, gap-toothed Strahan, who spent his entire professional athletic career playing for the New York Giants and proudly sports a Super Bowl championship ring. Strahan grew up in Germany, the son of a military man, and briefly played high school football after his family sent him to the States to live with relatives. After playing for Texas Southern University, he was drafted by the New York Giants, where he played from the 1993 to 2007 season. He enjoyed a 15-year career in the NFL and after retiring in 2008, Strahan followed the route of many former athletes by venturing into sports commentary and signing on as an analyst with Fox Sports in 2008. He also ventured into the world of acting with commercials for various entities including Vaseline, Subway and with the very short-lived Fox sitcom ""Brothers,"" which premiered in 2009. But it was multiple appearances guest-hosting on the then ""Live with Regis and Kelly"" morning show that helped him secure a spot as co-host in 2012 after Regis Philbin retired. The pair have become favorites among fans with their easygoing chemistry and obvious adoration for each other. ""He really gets it,"" Ripa told Katie Couric in an interview in 2012 after Strahan was selected following a massive search for her new co-host. ""He gets what we're about."" ""It's how it is all the time,"" Strahan said of his relationship with Ripa, whom he calls his work wife. ""What you see on camera is what you get behind the scenes."" The former jock has also scored in his personal life. After two previous marriages, the second of which was so explosive it provided plenty of fodder for the New York tabloids, Strahan has been engaged for the past few years to Nicole Murphy, who has five children from her marriage to actor Eddie Murphy. Between Strahan and Murphy, the pair have nine children in their blended family. Appearing on ""Live with Kelly and Michael"" in 2013 to promote her reality show ""Hollywood Exes,"" Murphy shared 10 things most people didn't know about Strahan, including the fact that he can't ""stand to be tickled,"" once had a pet pig and ""Michael loves to spoon."" Such romance is to be expected from a man who is very open about his love of at least one ""chick flick."" "" 'The Notebook' gets me every time,"" Strahan told Elle magazine. ""It's a great love story. Boy from the wrong side of the tracks. They get on each other's nerves, but they can't live without each other. It almost makes me shed a tear."" Now it looks as if Strahan may be about to bring all that personality to ""Good Morning America.""

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Taliban and the government of North West Frontier Province in Pakistan have agreed to a permanent cease-fire in the nation's volatile Swat Valley, an official said. Girls study this week in Pakistan's Swat Valley. Education for girls is an issue in peace talks there. Syed Mohammad Javed, commissioner for the Malakand region, which includes Swat Valley, told reporters in Mingora that the two parties had agreed to make permanent a 10-day cease-fire declared earlier this week. Javed said the agreement meant boys schools will reopen on Monday and camps will be set up for Swat residents who have fled the fighting or whose homes had been destroyed. The agreement comes as part of ongoing talks between Sufi Mohammad, a pro-Taliban cleric, and his son-in-law Maulana Fazlullah, the Taliban commander in Swat. Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan confirmed the cease-fire. However, Fazlullah spoke on the radio Saturday, saying although the commissioner announced a permanent cease-fire, the Taliban will meet again after the 10-day truce expires and decide whether it will be extended. Earlier this week, Pakistani government officials announced they had agreed with the Taliban to allow strict Islamic law, or Sharia, to be implemented in the entire Malakand Division.  Watch what sharia law requires » . It marked a major concession by the Pakistani government in its attempt to hold off Taliban militants who have terrorized the region with beheadings, kidnappings, and the destruction of girls' schools. The fighting has displaced nearly half of Swat's population, according to government sources. Fazlullah said Saturday the implementation of sharia law was very important for peace. Like Javed, he said schools for boys will be opened soon. He said he was not against education of girls, but against the syllabus of their education. The issue of education for girls was still under discussion, Javed said. Nearly 8,000 people died as a result of militant-related violence in Pakistan in 2008, according to the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies. On Saturday, a NATO oil tanker truck was the target of a roadside bombing on its way to Afghanistan. One one person was killed, a local official said. Two other people were wounded in the attack Saturday morning in the Landi Kotal area of Khyber Agency, one of seven semi-autonomous tribal agencies along the Afghan border, said the official, with the Khyber Agency political agent's office.","Government, militants agree to make 10-day cease-fire permanent .

"Beijing/Anhui (CNN) -- Zhou Xia walks briskly and with a certain purpose. Carrying three small bags and layered up for the Beijing night, she weaves through traffic and over crowded pedestrian walkways. These are her first steps in a thousand-kilometer trip home to Anhui province. Zhou is elated. ""I feel great, because I am going home,"" she says. ""I only get home once a year or sometimes maybe twice. I want to go home to see my parents and children because I miss them."" Like many migrants, Zhou came to Beijing for the money. She works two jobs as a maid and her husband gets odd jobs as a foreman. Together they earn around $1,200 a month to support their extended family. ""I don't really like Beijing,"" she says. Her life here is crowded and the work is constant. But opportunities to earn in China have drained from the countryside into the cities. And migrants are everywhere in Beijing's sprawl. They clean homes, run fruit stands on wheeled carts, make crispy pancakes on gas fires for the breakfast rush, clean garbage off the streets and clip hedges by hand. They help run this city of more than 20 million. During the Lunar New Year, they post handwritten signs on their shops, receive red ""Hong Bao"" envelops stuffed with bonuses, and leave in their millions. Many Beijingers don't notice them until they are gone. Zhou joins the throngs milling outside Beijing Railway Station, an imposing Maoist and Soviet-style landmark. Everywhere migrants sit on stools and buckets surrounded by their luggage, puffing on cigarettes in the cold. ""I bet you haven't experienced anything like this before,"" says Zhou as we jam through the bottleneck to board. We're stuck right in the middle of giant swathe of humanity. A muffled announcement, a shove forward, a half step backwards, then we shuffle forward all together. ""Don't push me,"" shouts one man as he gets a duffle bag shoved against his head. China has built up an impressive network of high-speed trains. But not the 8 p.m T63 to Hefei. She's a stately string of carriages in bold blue, red and white, designed for comfort, not for speed. Even that is compromised during Lunar New Year. Chinese take more than three billion trips during this period, more than 200 million by rail, so just getting a ticket is a bit like winning the lottery. Tickets online to Hefei sold out in seconds, says Zhou, so she bought one to the first stop in Tianjin, hoping the conductors wouldn't throw them off in this time of goodwill. ""Any pregnant women, young children, or elderly in this carriage,"" says the lead conductor, in a sharp navy blue uniform with officer-style cap as the T63 clatters out of the station. It appears nobody in our carriage could get a ticket beyond Tianjin. So the conductors register us to be distributed through the train. Some get sleepers in three-tiered bunks; others jam in where they can. There is a saying in China: ""Rich or poor; get home for the holiday"" ( 有钱没钱，回家过年). It has become a bit of a cliché. But for Chinese, and Chinese migrants in particular, going home for the Lunar New Year, or Spring, festival is near mandatory and often the only time of the year they can be with their families. ""I really do miss my children,"" says Zhou. ""It's not like we are separated by a month or two, it's for a whole year. That is a long time and there is such a huge distance between us."" Zhou's family mirrors changes in China. Her father's generation worked the fields near their village, but pollution and urbanization made farming untenable. Zhou missed out on an education, so she works doggedly to support the whole family. Her daughter works at an appliance factory. But her son is in university studying physics. He is their big hope. ""His tuition costs thousands and we have to pay,"" says Zhou. ""But I am full of hope he will graduate and find a good job with a steady income and he will contribute to the family. Everything we do is for our children and our family."" Migrant families are full of these sorts of burdens and dreams. So, for many, ten hours in a crowded train is no real hardship at all. Others on the train, like Mr. Fan, who runs a breakfast stand in Beijing, are also happy to suffer the cramped conditions. ""We go home once a year to see my kids and my parents. This travel is nothing to me. I am totally content,"" he says. Around him people sleep on the carriage floor, others pack in three abreast in standing room. They eat, try to sleep and play Shengji, a popular Chinese card game. ""Only eight minutes to go,"" says Zhou in the pre-dawn gloom as we approach Hefei. ""I am feeling great, but I am sure you are tired."" Soon there will be the reunion, the meals, the fireworks. Gossiping with friends and seeing family. But Zhou has only one thought. ""Every year when I get near my home I feel so happy. But going back is so hard. I feel so sad then that every time I cry."" CNN's Dayu Zhang contributed to this report.","A migrant worker in China travels home to be with her family for the New Year .

"Off Garden Island, Australia (CNN) -- Docked at the largest naval base in Western Australia Monday is a ship with a bright red hull and the weight of the world resting on the shoulders of its 30-member crew. To some, the ship represents their only chance at closure after the disappearance of loved ones on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. To others, it's the best chance of solving one of the greatest mysteries in modern aviation. Departing just after sunset, the Australian Defense Vessel Ocean Shield sets out to the search zone in the southern Indian Ocean, one of the most remote places on Earth, some 1,100 miles off the coast of Western Australia. It will take three days just to get to this corner of the world, where waves are taller than many buildings, and the seas conceal mountain ranges. CNN asked to ride with the crew of the Ocean Shield to document their journey. But the mission is too long and too important to allow for the added burden of carrying journalists onboard. Anxious wait . So we sit in a chartered fishing boat named Thunder and wait anxiously for the Ocean Shield to begin its journey. Our expectation of a Monday morning departure is quickly dashed. So we wait on the water, watching the boat and filing hourly live updates. The 6:30pm departure time is pushed back an hour. At 7:30pm, the ship still sits at the dock. The Ocean Shield finally departs just before 8pm, cloaked in darkness, only its deck lights guiding the way from Garden Island, out of Cockburn Sound, and into the Indian Ocean. We watch as the Ocean Shield makes its way up the narrow channel headed for the open sea, traveling so fast our 60-foot fishing boat can't keep up. ""We started out, he was running about 8 to 10 knots and started picking up speed,"" says our captain, Ray Ruby. ""I think by the time he was doing about 15 knots we were still in the channel."" Battery race . And there's a reason that the team aboard the Ocean Shield is in a hurry. The batteries on the underwater locator beacons, or pingers, attached to the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder have less than a week before they're set to expire. And these crew members are the only ones equipped to find them. They carry the latest technology from the U.S. Navy, including a towed pinger locator, or TPL-25, a giant underwater microphone that will listen for the pings from the black boxes. Then there's the Bluefin-21, an underwater robot that can scour the ocean bed, looking for signs of wreckage. But there's a problem. More than three weeks after MH370 is believed to have gone down in the southern Indian Ocean, no wreckage has been sighted. And that means the team aboard the Ocean Shield doesn't know where to look. ""No matter how specialized or sophisticated this equipment is, it won't do any good unless that search zone can be narrowed,"" says Commander Mark Matthews of the U.S. Navy, in charge of the 11-person team on board who will operate the TPL-25 and Bluefin-21. Matthews says in order to have a hope of hearing the pingers, the search area needs to be reduced from more than 100,000 square miles (259,000 square kilometers) to less than 1,000 (2,590). And the only way to do that is for search teams to find and confirm debris from the airliner, and to use computer models that can trace back currents and conditions and help pinpoint where the plane went down. Disappointment . But with each new day in the search zone, and each new discovery, comes new disappointment. Objects sighted by search aircraft and pulled from the ocean have no link to the missing airliner. And while the water is like glass here in Cockburn Sound and the waters are less than 100 feet deep, out in the search zone, it's 14,000 feet to the bottom, with conditions that are some of most punishing on the planet. As the Ocean Shield opens up its throttle, we try to keep its striking red hull in sight, hoping to follow it on its mission for as long as we can. But then, a nearby vessel flashes an S.O.S. signal with its spotlight. Our captain makes the call to divert and try to help. ""Tomorrow it could be me,"" Ruby says. We pull alongside, where we learn another charter boat has blown its engine in the middle of a busy shipping lane. As we tow the boat to safety, the Ocean Shield disappears on the horizon, closing the gap in its search for MH370. Perhaps a few miles closer to finding even the smallest bit of closure for the families of the missing. And answers for the rest of the world.","An Australia ship has left port to try to locate ""pings"" from missing airliner MH370 .

"(CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry has decided to send 1,000 National Guard troops to ""secure"" the U.S.-Mexico border. At least 52,000 children have arrived unaccompanied to the United States since October, most coming from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. They have been greeted by protests in border regions across the United States. But military might hasn't ever and won't solve the problem; it is much broader than that. What has been glaringly absent from discussion of this humanitarian crisis is any attempt to address its underlying causes, which rest fundamentally in drug policy reform. At its core is the longstanding drug war the United States has waged in Central and South America. In the early years of the drug war, U.S. policy was aimed at curtailing the rise of socialism and communism as well as stopping the production of narcotics in this region. The United States has used military intervention, crop dusting and possible political subversion in order to achieve these policy objectives. More recently, the United States implemented a militarization campaign, providing funding to law enforcement officials in Latin American countries to combat narco-trafficking. This policy destabilized major regions of Central America, increasing murder rates and corrupting any viable political or economic opportunities to bring about change. Corruption in government and law enforcement results in an environment of extreme violence, as gangs of criminals battle for control across borders. Parents in these countries are faced with deciding whether to send their children on the treacherous journey to America, where they have at least a possibility of safety and a better life. We cannot just summarily send these children back to the desperate situations they escaped. Two Texas lawmakers are trying to do just that, quickly, by introducing legislation to amend the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. The bill, which has been met with protests, would speed up the deportation process and send these 52,000 children back to the violent environments they escaped. Sen. John Cornyn and Rep. Henry Cuellar even have the audacity to call it the HUMANE Act, for ""Helping Unaccompanied Minors and Alleviating a National Emergency."" Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley was right when he recently said: ""It is contrary to everything we stand for as a people to try to summarily send children back to death . . . in a place where drug gangs are the greatest threat to stability, rule of law and democratic institutions in this hemisphere."" Although the arrest of a drug lord or corrupt government officials may catch our attention, we fail to sufficiently consider those throughout Latin America who have fallen victim to violence related to the drug war. So many have been murdered, have disappeared or have been forced to leave their homes in search of refuge. In 2010, nearly 50,000 Latinos were incarcerated for nonviolent drug offenses and, according to a recently released TRAC report, nearly one-quarter of a million people were deported for nonviolent drug offenses in just the past six years. Nearly 10,000 were deported in 2013 for marijuana-related offenses. Prohibition and the failed drug war has led to more than 60,000 deaths in Mexico from 2006 to 2012. As the region that has most suffered the brunt of the war on drugs, it is no surprise that the loudest political voices calling for reform are coming from Latin America. Leaders within Latin American countries have been on the record in recent years calling for this change. In a groundbreaking report released in 2011 by the Global Commission on Drug Policy, three former Latin American presidents -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, CÃ©sar Gaviria of Colombia, and Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico -- and a host of other notable global figures, such as Kofi Annan, Richard Branson and Paul Volcker, called for ""breaking the taboo"" on discussing alternatives to drug prohibition and encouraging ""experimentation by governments with models of legal regulation of drugs."" Now, sitting presidents Juan Manuel Santos in Colombia, Otto Perez Molina in Guatemala, and JosÃ© Mujica in Uruguay have echoed these demands for reform.

"(CNN) -- Russia looks set to slice off a part of Ukraine and keep it for itself. With heavily armed Russian-speaking troops patrolling the streets, the Crimean Parliament voted Thursday to join Russia and put its decision to a referendum. The all-but-inevitable annexation of Crimea is moving forward, despite protests, warnings and threats from the U.S. and its allies. We have entered a new Cold War. The clash between Vladimir Putin's Russia and the forces arrayed in support of Ukraine's independence-minded leaders has crashed the vaunted ""reset,"" ending hopes that Moscow and the West would smooth relations and work hand-in-hand toward common objectives. Nobody can predict with certainty how this conflict will end. But the world can already glean important lessons. Unfortunately, most of those lessons are cause for deep concern. Here are five clear messages from the crisis in Ukraine. 1. Nobody's scared of America, but American and European values hold strong appeal. Lest we forget, this all started over a move by the now-deposed Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych, who broke his promise to sign a partnership agreement with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Moscow. Ukrainians were enraged, not just because they want more trade with Europe but because they have seen what Western standards can bring to a society. They were fed up with corruption, authoritarianism and stagnation. They wanted their country to be free of Moscow's interference, and many gave up their lives to fight for an ideal of stronger democratic institutions, rule of law and fair play. As strong as the pull of these values is, their principal advocate, the U.S., has lost much of its ability to stare down its foes in support of those who want to institute democratic principles in their countries. We saw it when President Barack Obama declared -- years ago -- that Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad must step down. We saw it when then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was pelted with tomatoes in Egypt. And we saw it in Ukraine, when Obama warned Putin to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity, only to see the Russians capture Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. America does not intimidate. Its loss of influence means strongmen and dictators have a freer hand. 5 possible directions in Ukraine . 2. You don't mess with Putin without paying a price. Even if Moscow were to relinquish all control of Ukrainian territory today, Putin has already achieved a main goal. He has sent a clear message to countries that were once part of the Soviet Union -- and perhaps to the USSR's former Eastern European satellites -- that they cannot defy his wishes without paying a painful price. In that sense, Putin has won. A top Putin aide warned last summer that Ukraine was risking ""suicide"" if it dared to defy Moscow. Now we know this was no bluff. Putin is serious about protecting Moscow's sphere of influence. It's not clear how closely he wants to control what are supposed to be independent countries. Opinion: Did you expect Russia to ignore Ukraine chaos? 3. If you are a vulnerable state, you may regret surrendering nuclear weapons. This may be the most dangerous of all the lessons from this crisis. Ukraine had a sizable nuclear arsenal at the end of the Cold War, but it agreed to give it up in exchange for security guarantees. In the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine committed itself to dismantling the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. Russia, in exchange, vowed to respect Ukraine's borders and its independence. Now, Russia has clearly violated those commitments. If Ukraine still had its atomic weapons, Moscow would have thought twice before seizing parts of Ukraine. 4. Don't expect support from all international peace activists (unless the U.S. invades). To liberal activists in Ukraine and Russia, the reaction from international peace movement must be a hard pill to swallow. Parts of Ukraine have been captured at the point of a gun by a regime that actively suppresses dissent. When liberal Russians protested, police arrested hundreds of anti-war demonstrators. While Russia's invasion of Ukrainian territory and its harsh crackdown on local protests have been criticized by some human rights activists, the reaction among some prominent ""peace"" activists has been astonishing. Several have mimicked Putin's line, blaming the U.S. for the crisis. Instead of taking a clear stance in support of a country with invading military forces on its soil, some so-called anti-war groups have taken the opportunity to dust off their anti-American vitriol. A favorite line of discussion is whether Washington has any right to criticize Russia's invasion of Ukrainian territory after the U.S. invaded Iraq, a country that was ruled by one of the world's most brutal, genocidal dictators. However misguided America's Iraq invasion, even drawing the comparison is an insult to Ukrainians. Opinion: Putin's Ukrainian endgame . 5. The use of brute force to resolve conflicts is not a thing of the past. One day, if history moves in the direction we all wish, countries will solve their disputes through diplomacy and negotiation. Sadly, that day has not arrived. John Kerry has expressed dismay at Putin's ""19th-century"" behavior, but power politics, forcible border expansion and brazen aggression have not been relegated to the history books; witness events in places like Syria, the Central African Republic and now in Ukraine. Those are the first five lessons. But allow me to offer a bonus, a work in progress that could join as No. 6: When the stakes grow high enough, the U.S. and Europe may rise to the challenge. Western nations seemed caught off-guard by Putin's ""incredible act of aggression,"" as Kerry termed it. Some of Putin's gains (see No. 2) may be irreversible. But the U.S. and Europe have been shaken up by events, and they may yet send a message of their own, helping Kiev's government succeed and prosper as it sets out to chart a future of its own and limiting Putin's ability to replicate his acts of intimidation. Kerry's visit to Kiev was a powerful moment. His unvarnished message to Putin, if backed by action, was a respectable start. The U.S. would prefer to see this crisis resolved through negotiations, he declared, but if Russia chooses not to do so, Washington's and its partners ""will isolate Russia politically, diplomatically and economically."" Already the EU is offering Ukraine an aid package comparable to the one Putin used to lure it away. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel is boosting ties with Poland and the Baltic States, and economic sanctions are under discussion. If Putin wants another Cold War, he has one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis says Russia looks ready to claim Crimea; it's a new Cold War .
Crisis shows that U.S., EU are not feared, but their values first prompted protests .
Other lessons? Mess with Putin at your peril; giving up nuclear weapons leaves you vulnerable .

"(CNN) -- You've heard of Aspen, Jackson Hole and Whistler, but how about Copper Mountain, Grand Targhee and Revelstoke? These ski resorts may lack the buzz of their more glamorous neighbors, but they make up for it in snowfall, value and fewer crowds. So hop on a lift before winter winds down. Revelstoke Mountain Resort - British Columbia . Opened in 2007, Revelstoke has remained largely off the radar thanks to its relative inaccessibility in British Columbia's Selkirk Mountain range. It's a five-hour drive from Calgary and two hours from the nearest international airport, but it's unlikely to stay that way for long. With some 60 feet of annual snowfall at the highest elevations, 5,620 feet of vertical -- the longest descent of any resort in North America -- and lift, cat-skiing and heli-skiing from one village base. Copper Mountain - Colorado . Sandwiched between Breckenridge and Vail, Copper Mountain has long been a local favorite, but a new high-speed quad-lift and ski-in, ski-out lodging put it on par with its big-name neighbors. Naturally divided terrain separates skiers and snowboarders by ability, which gives the entire resort more elbow room. Bonus: Guests get free snow cat access on Tucker Mountain. The ""High Four"" deal this season packs in four days of skiing or riding for $234. Grand Targhee Resort - Wyoming . Perched on the western slope of the Tetons, Grand Targhee is perfectly positioned to reap the lion's share of powder from eastern-moving storms. ""There can be times when Jackson Hole can receive zero snow and the Grand Targhee can get a foot,"" says Dan Sherman, spokesman for ski.com. Plus, he adds, ""The terrain is fantastic."" This year, the resort is offering free skiing and snowboarding to lodge guests with a 2012 season pass to any ski resort in the United States or Canada to make up for the lack of snow elsewhere. Lodging typically starts at $99; adult lift tickets run $69. Mad River Glen - Vermont . Stowe or Killington may be Vermont's most recognizable resorts, but Mad River Glen best reflects the Green Mountain state's independent streak. The cooperative-owned ski area doesn't groom its trails, forbids snowboarding and keeps snowmaking to a minimum. ""We prefer it from the heavens not the hoses,"" says resort spokesman Eric Friedman. Ski magazine has ranked its terrain as the most challenging on the East Coast. The resort's biggest claim to fame is its single-chair lift, the only one in North America. The mountain doesn't own lodging, but there are plenty of classic ski lodges and cozy bed and breakfasts nearby, with rates from $85. Adult lift tickets start at $45. Schweitzer Mountain Resort - Idaho . High up in Idaho's panhandle nine miles outside of Sandpoint, Schweitzer isn't as accessible as other West Coast resorts. As a result, it's unlikely you'll wait more than five minutes in the lift line. Then there's the 2,900 skiable acres -- more than neighbor Sun Valley. While the mountain is known for its off-trail skiing among the trees, the terrain varies from the bunny hill to steep, double-black pitches. The 6,400-foot summit affords skiers panoramic views of Idaho, Montana, Washington and Canada, as well as Lake Pend Oreille. Slopeside digs start at $164; adult lift tickets at $67. Tignes, France . With its postcard-perfect Alpine scenery, breathtaking verticals and charming chalets, Val-d'IsÃ¨re is one of the most beloved ski resorts in Europe. But Tignes, its neighbor in the L'Espace Killy -- a ski area in France's Tarentaise Valley named for famed alpine ski racer and native son Jean-Claude Killy -- offers a similar experience and then some. A slew of off-beat activities like ice-karting, bungee-trampoline and ice-diving under a frozen lake appeal to families. Together, the resorts, which are linked by cable cars, tunneled funitels and gondolas, offer nearly 200 miles of runs serviced by 102 lifts. Valle Nevado, Chile . Serious skiers know the season doesn't end come summertime. It just shifts south of the equator. Come August, Valle Nevado Ski Resort, 35 miles northeast of Santiago, is blanketed in deep powder. Newer than the storied Chilean resort of Portillo, Valle Nevado has all the bells and whistles of most modern mountains, including the only high-speed quad lift in South America, a brand new gondola and an onsite heli-pad. Backcountry skiing: Beauty and fear . At roughly $200 a shot and up to 4,500 feet of vertical in one run, heli-skiing is a relative bargain here. (Can't wait for that first run? Hitch a chopper ride straight from Santiago. The resort will send your bags ahead). Lodging ranges from the budget Hotel Tres Puntas to the luxe Hotel Valle Nevado. Hotel Tres Puntas runs $2,266 for seven nights (Friday to Friday) for two people, including lift tickets. Seven-night packages include two interconnect tickets to neighboring resorts La Parva and El Colorado, opening up 7,400 acres of skiable terrain.","New features put Colorado's Copper Mountain on par with its big-name neighbors .

"(CNN) -- Standing a head taller than the worthy, conventional and mostly rather dull entries in this season's lackluster Oscar race, David Fincher's ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is a risky romantic epic, grand in ambition and design, alternately flawed and fabulous in execution. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett star in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" Sophisticated but oddball, ""Button"" will be a challenge for the marketing men, but audiences who take the plunge will likely find themselves entranced -- if occasionally enervated. F Scott Fitzgerald's slim novella presents enormous difficulties to the filmmaker. It is the story of a man born into a wizened and infirm body who gets younger as he ages. At 10, he has the physique of a diminutive septuagenarian. At 20, he looks like a 60-year-old. And so on, all the way to infancy and death. Between them, Fincher, star Brad Pitt, all the actors who play Benjamin at various ages, and some triumphant makeup and digital effects teams stitch together a character who is completely believable from first to last -- or last to first, if you prefer. Pitt, in particular, has never been better, and surely merits an Academy Award nomination even if his list of thanks would presumably entail extra minutes at the podium.  Watch a preview of ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" » . Benjamin's adoptive mother, a practical-minded African-American woman named Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), accepts the boy's unusual condition with the forbearance of someone accustomed to life's vicissitudes. In a clever invention from screenwriter Eric Roth (""The Good Shepherd"" and ""Forrest Gump""), Queenie runs a caring home for the elderly, so Master Benjamin fits in reasonably well, though one old lady is disconcerted by his fondness for her granddaughter Daisy. Fitzgerald's story is a pregnant philosophical conceit, like a peculiarly refined ""Twilight Zone"" episode, set among Baltimore's 19th-century gentry. Roth expands it into a rich Louisiana picaresque, ranging far and wide as Benjamin tastes romance in Russia with the wife of an English diplomat (a beguiling Tilda Swinton), comes off second-best in an encounter with a German U-boat, and pursues Daisy, the love of his life, first to New York and then to Paris. If Daisy (Cate Blanchett) is a nod in the direction of another beloved Fitzgerald character, Button is more akin to a slightly savvier Gump than to Gatsby, constantly buffeted by time's arrow and his outrageous fortune. He has better luck than Gatsby when it comes to romance -- though that has its own twist. The movie bides its sweet time, not all of it well spent. A framing device with Daisy on her deathbed, Hurricane Katrina brewing in the background, is cumbersome and not always as clear as it might be. A vignette with Elias Koteas as a clockmaker who loses his son in World War I and manufactures a station clock to turn back time is beautifully told, but it's gilding the lily. Likewise, there's an infuriatingly computer-generated hummingbird that pops up twice, a self-consciously poetic touch that feels heavy-handed and false. Despite these flaws, and others, the film's bittersweet reverse angle on the aging process is inescapably moving. There is something beautiful about the trajectory which sees Benjamin and Daisy's lifelong love affair blooming briefly in middle age, at the point where the scales come into balance, though Fitzgerald's dry account of the relationship gradually falling apart is probably more honest. All the same, we're left with a terrible sense of loneliness and loss as time inevitably takes its toll. David Fincher is famous for dark thrillers like ""Seven,"" ""Zodiac"" and ""Fight Club,"" but this bizarre and graceful love story is as morbid in its own way. Everybody dies. Even that ornately decorated New Orleans architecture is doomed to crumble. But, even if ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" ultimately falls frustratingly shy of enduring greatness, Fincher does a beautiful job. After all, it takes an artist to make time stand still. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is rated PG-13 and runs 167 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's take, click here.","""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" about a man who ages backwards .

"(CNN) -- If Real Madrid does fail in pursuit of 'La Decima' then at least it will always have 'the decimation'. On a night where the champion was dethroned in brutal fashion, Real flexed its muscles and showed it is ready to end the long wait for a 10th European triumph. A stunning 4-0 success in Munich completed a 5-0 aggregate victory and paved the way for a final clash with either city rival Atletico or former manager Jose Mourinho and his Chelsea side. Not since 2002 has Real, Europe's most successful club, managed to acquire the continent's top club prize. No team has ever retained the Champions League title and Bayern Munich, so highly fancied once again this year, rarely looked like repeating its glorious triumph of last season. Trailing 1-0 from the first leg in Madrid, Bayern endured a nightmare first half as Real produced an astonishing performance to lead 3-0 at the interval. Sergio Ramos scored twice in four minutes before Cristiano Ronaldo rounded off a fine counter attack to claim his 15th goal of this season's competition -- a new Champions League record. Ronaldo added a fourth late on with a free-kick to cap a remarkable performance to make it 51 goals in 50 Champions League career appearances. ""It's a fantastic result for us,"" winger Gareth Bale told ITV. ""We've been working hard, got our tactics right, played well and deserved the win. ""We are happy to be in the final but still have one game to go. Everybody put in 100% -- no matter who it was, they put in a performance. ""This is why I wanted to come to the biggest club in the world - to win trophies in massive games. ""We still haven't won it yet, we have a difficult game in the final whoever it may be but I'm looking forward to it."" Bale will remember this occasion for many a year to come -- but for most of those who were packed inside the Allianz Arena, this was a night to forget. This was a painful and merciless destruction of a Bayern side which had looked unbeatable earlier in the season. While Real played with the belief and purpose of champions, Bayern appeared cumbersome, disjointed and a shadow of the side which had waltzed to last season's title. But for all of Bayern's deficiencies, it would be churlish to take away from the achievement of Carlo Ancelotti's side. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola had spent the past few days instilling belief and confidence into his players. Much of that had evaporated within the opening 20 minutes as Real's pace and power tore through the home defense. Labored and predictable in possession and embarrassingly open in midfield, Bayern allowed Real to use the likes of Ronaldo and Bale at every opportunity. Yet, for all the attacking talent at its disposal, it was through an old-fashioned set-piece routine which Real forged ahead. Luka Modric's corner parted the Bayern defense and Ramos rose highest to head an unstoppable effort past Manuel Neuer. Shocked and stunned by conceding, the home team was then hit with a real knockout blow four minutes later. Again it was Ramos who found the net, producing a fine header to guide Angel Di Maria's cross into the far corner. For Ramos, this was sweet revenge. Two years ago, the Spain international missed from the penalty spot as Real was defeated on spot kicks by Bayern in the last four. This time, it was he who was dancing with delight as Bayern heads began to drop. Dazed and downbeat, Bayern looked beaten. Real, defeated in its past three semifinal appearances, began to play with the style and swagger long associated with the club from the Spanish capital. And with 11 minutes of the first half remaining, it produced a breathtaking move to claim a third. Karim Benzema released Bale and the Welshman ran half the length of the field before picking out Ronaldo to coolly fire home. Needing five goals to qualify for the final, Bayern's case looked hopeless and so it proved. Real, happy to sit and defend deep, was rarely troubled and only a fine reflex save by Neuer prevented Fabio Coentrao from adding a fourth. Bayern enjoyed plenty of possession after the interval but Iker Casillas in the Real goal was rarely tested. In the end, it was left to Ronaldo to have the final word. With just over a minute of normal time remaining, the Portuguese star unleashed a low free-kick which flew past Neuer to add further gloss. ""La Decima"" is within touching distance -- only Atletico or a certain Mr Mourinho can stop Real now.","Real Madrid qualifies for Champions League final .

"(CNN) -- The early Friday release of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was one of the most eagerly anticipated movie events of the summer. On Thursday, movie ticket seller Fandango reported that the last installment in the Christopher Nolan-directed Batman trilogy was ""outpacing summer blockbuster 'The Avengers' in ticket sales at the same point in the sales cycle."" ""The final chapter of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy has sold out on Fandango more than 2,000 showtimes nationwide and it's currently on track to become one of Fandango's top-selling movies of all time,"" the ticket seller reported. An attack by an armed gunman in Aurora, Colorado, at a midnight screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was met with shock and grief throughout the country, and cast a shadow over what for fans was set to be a blockbuster weekend. Gunman kills 12 in Colorado movie theater . Experts said it's difficult to determine what, if any, effect the tragedy may have on either ticket sales or fan turnout in the days and weeks to come. ""For somebody to go into a movie theater, a place of fun and escapism, and bring that kind of violence into that world is shocking and tragic,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box office division of Hollywood.com. ""How this will affect the movie, I just don't know."" Shooting turns movie into surreal horror . According to Exhibitor Relations, the film did brisk business for its midnight screenings, raking in $30.6 million. Many fans had pre-purchased tickets for screenings across the country. Dergarabedian said the current focus has been rightfully on those injured and killed because of the violence. Beyond that it is up to Warner Bros., the studio that released the film, to decide how to proceed with marketing in the wake of the tragedy, he said. Theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media . Warner Bros., which is owned by the parent company of CNN, has been heavily marketing the action film that includes scenes featuring lots of gunplay and violence. A full-page newspaper ad heralding the opening weekend contains a pull quote from Marlow Stern, assistant culture editor of Newsweek, which says, ""A monumental conclusion to the epic trilogy. Audiences will be blown away."" Warner Bros. pulled the trailer for the film ""Gangster Squad,"" which had been running before showings of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" That film trailer features scenes of men armed with machine guns attacking a movie theater. A representative for the company told CNN that Warner Bros. did not plan to cancel any screenings. Thelma Adams, contributing editor for Yahoo Movies, said the tragedy poses a conundrum for the studio. ""I know people at Warner Bros. who were called and woken up this morning who now have a huge problem on their hands,"" she said. ""I think in the long run, a lot of the money is made globally with a movie like this and that will not have an impact."" Theater offers 'perfect killing' zone, expert says . Adams continued, ""Also it's not just an opening weekend movie. There (are) no other movies kind of in competition this weekend as a lot of other movies stepped off this weekend and next weekend. Yes, there will be some impact of the revenue stream, but it's not going to really hurt."" Warner Bros. canceled the film's planned premiere in Paris on Friday and released the following statement: ""Warner Bros. and the filmmakers are deeply saddened to learn about this shocking incident. We extend our sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims at this tragic time."" An official with Paris police told CNN there was a police presence outside the Bristol Hotel, where cast members of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" were staying before the premiere, to ""protect all those who could be threatened."" Actor Gary Oldman, who portrays Commissioner Jim Gordon in the film, said in a statement, ""My prayers and deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families of this horrific act."" Scott Beggs, managing editor of the website Film School Rejects, said the film franchise has been popular because ""at the heart of (the film) is a central heroic figure that gives hope to people."" In Aurora, the agonized seek answers . Beggs pointed out that the death of actor Heath Ledger from a toxic combination of prescription drugs in 2008 cast a bit of a pall over ""The Dark Knight,"" but did not taint the legacy of what went on to become a critically acclaimed film. Ledger was posthumously awarded an Academy Award for best supporting actor for his role as The Joker in that movie. ""(That second film) was touched by tragedy, but I believe the art ended up speaking for itself,"" Beggs said. ""(The shootings in Colorado) were a tragic event that took place, which hopefully will not stop us from living our lives."" Are you there?

"(CNN) -- Does anyone want to win La Liga? All three sides challenging for the Spanish title failed to win on the season's penultimate weekend ensuring the title race will go to the final day. Atletico Madrid drew 1-1 at home to ten-man Malaga, Barcelona were held to a scoreless draw away to Elche while Real Madrid fell to a 2-0 defeat at Celta Vigo. The results mean only Barcelona or Atletico can now win the title. Both sides will face each other in the season's final round of fixtures at the Nou Camp next weekend in what is sure to be a dramatic and emotional occasion. Atletico will be particularly disappointed with their failure to win Sunday as three points against 13th placed Malaga would have seen them crowned champions in front of a passionate Vicente Calderon crowd. The Rojiblanco, who were without top scorer Diego Costa due to injury, missed numerous chances in the first period and fell behind in the 66th minute after mistakes by defender Toby Alderweireld and goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Alderweireld allowed an aimless long-ball bounce over him enabling Malaga striker Samuel Garcia to nick the ball off Courtois who had come needlessly charging from his goal in an attempt to make up for his teammates initial error. Garcia then composed himself before bundling the ball into the empty Atletico net. Lesser teams may have crumbled under the pressure of such a misstep but Atletico and Alderweireld were undimmed by their carelessness and hit back shortly after. The Belgian defender rose to head a Diego Ribas corner beyond Malaga goalkeeper Willy Caballero to level the scores at 1-1 after 74 minutes. Aware Barcelona were being held and Real losing, Atletico went for the kill. Caballero saved well from David Villa twice before Malaga were reduced to ten men after defender Marcos Angeleri was harshly shown a second yellow card for bringing down Villa at the edge of the away side's penalty box. Jose Sosa hit the side netting from the resultant free-kick as injury time approached -- but Atletico would have one final chance to win it. Adrian Lopez tip-toed his way into the Malaga box before striking a curling shot that looked to be heading towards the top corner only for another heroic Caballero save to deny the Atleti sub. Speaking after the match, Atletico manager Diego Simeone maintained he was proud of his team despite the result, telling reporters that ""the players gave their maximum."" The Argentine also revealed he hopes star striker Diego Costa will be fit for next weekend's showdown where ""nobody believes we can win in Barcelona."" While that last comment may be an early attempt at mind games, Atletico's draw means Barcelona's failure to win at Elche is not as catastrophic as it could have been. The Catalan's will still have to beat Atleti on the final day to secure the championship, however, something they have failed to do in five attempts this season. Andres Iniesta came closest for a laboring Barca against an Elche side who are struggling to avoid relegation. The Spanish international midfielder smacked the crossbar with a ferocious first-half volley while Alexis Sanchez and Lionel Messi also both missed good opportunities to secure victory. ""What a league final awaits us on Saturday,"" tweeted Iniesta after learning of Atletico's failure to win. ""With our people we can get it."" Defender Dani Alves also took to twitter to add: ""There is no glory without suffering, no glory without a fight."" While Barca and Atletico have one final chance to claim glory next weekend, the same cannot now be said for Real Madrid. Two major defensive errors handed Luis Enrique's Celta Vigo an impressive 2-0 victory in Spain's Northwest. A dithering Sergio Ramos was dispossessed by Celta striker Charles Dias de Oliveira who went on to round Diego Lopez and fire the ball into the Madrid two minutes before half-time. Xabi Alonso's careless backpass in the 63rd minute then enabled de Oliveira to double the home side's advantage. The striker again rounded Lopez after intercepting Alonso's misplaced pace and slotted into an empty net. After the match, dejected Real Madrid midfielder, Isco, told the club's website that Real had ""let the league slip because of our own mistakes."" ""Now we just have to learn from it and put our minds on the last league match as a preparation for the final of the Champions League.""","All three sides chasing the La Liga title failed to win Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Five Indian soldiers were killed in an attack on the Line of Control in Indian-administered Kashmir early Tuesday, India's government said. Indian Defence Minister AK Antony told parliament the ambush was carried out by approximately 20 ""heavily armed terrorists along with persons dressed in Pakistan army uniforms."" The chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir denounced the attack on Twitter. ""These incidents don't help efforts to normalise or even improve relations with Pak & call in to question the Pak Govt's recent overtures,"" Omar Abdullah tweeted Tuesday morning. Pakistan denied playing a part in the attack. ""No such incident has taken place,"" the military said, while Pakistan's ministry of foreign affairs also rejected the claim. ""These are baseless and unfounded allegations. Our military authorities have confirmed that there had been no exchange of fire that could have resulted in such an incident,"" a statement from the ministry said. The incident could cast a shadow on the resumption of India-Pakistan talks when the prime ministers of the two countries meet in New York for the U.N. General Assembly in September. The two South Asian neighbors have had a cease-fire along the de facto border, known as the Line of Control, since November 2003. But it has been violated repeatedly, with both sides accusing the other of offenses. Tuesday's ambush came close on the heels of the Indian army's operations against militants infiltrating into the Indian side of Kashmir, resulting in the deaths of 13 militants last week. One Indian army soldier was also killed in one of the gunfights in north Kashmir's frontier Kupwara district, according to the defense spokesman. ""This action is a likely consequence of frustrations of the terrorists' tanzeeems (outfits) and Pak army due to successful elimination of 19 hardcore terrorists in the recent months of July and August along the Line of Control and in the hinterland of Jammu and Kashmir,"" the defense ministry statement said. India's defense ministry said Tuesday that it has recorded 33 ceasefire violations by the Pakistanis between February and July -- resulting in one death and three injuries. The conflict over Kashmir dates back to 1947, after Britain relinquished control of the Indian subcontinent, giving birth to modern India and Pakistan. Kashmir was free to accede to either nation. Maharaja Hari Singh, the ruler of the kingdom at the time, initially chose to remain independent but eventually opted to join India, thereby handing key powers to the central government in New Delhi. In exchange, India guaranteed him military protection and vowed to hold a popular vote on the issue. The South Asian rivals have fought two full-scale wars over the territorial issue. Islamabad has always said that majority-Muslim Kashmir should have been a part of Pakistan. A United Nations resolution adopted after the first war called for a referendum allowing the people of Kashmir to choose which country they wanted to join, but that vote for self-determination has never been held. Pakistan wants that referendum to take place. India says that Pakistan lends support to separatist groups fighting against government control and argues that a 1972 agreement mandates a resolution to the Kashmir dispute through bilateral talks. CNN's Neha Sharma reported from New Delhi, with Mukhtar Ahmad reporting from Srinagar. CNN's Shaista Aziz in Islamabad, Pakistan; and Aliza Kassim in Atlanta contributed to this report.","NEW: Indian official: Terrorists, people in Pakistan army uniforms carried out ambush .

Now 30, he is entering the twilight zone of his time on court with the opportunities to provide for his retirement decreasing every day. The problem for the World No.39 is that the cost of competing at the highest level is soaring, meaning he must collect $200,000 in prize money each year just to break even. It's not a problem for those in the top 10 -- but with rising expenses and endless airfares to pay for, those unable to win the grand slams or attract big name sponsors are facing a conundrum. For Tursunov the choice is clear -- shell out the cash now and hope the investment pays off. Splashing the cash . ""I don't have a long career left so I decided to spend whatever is necessary,"" he told CNN's Open Court. ""I want to get the best results I want to get out of the game knowing I gave it my best and that I didn't try to save up on anything. ""Roughly, I probably spend $100,000 on traveling, plus or minus $10,000, it's kind of hard to say because I think the expenses are going up, the tickets are getting more expensive. ""I think also a lot of the times you have to fly business, not out of luxury, but it's the only time you can get some rest and sleep. ""If you are sitting in a little shrimp position, it's going to take you two days to recover, especially the older you get. ""I didn't believe that but I am starting to believe it. It takes me two or three days to get out of the travel."" Tursunov travels with his coach and physio, paying for their flights, accommodation and wages. He reckons he spends over $200,000 on his staff each year. The last of his seven singles titles came in 2011 and while he has bounced around the circuit picking up prize money, the opportunity to earn the big bucks continues to elude him. According to Forbes Business Magazine, the 10-highest paid tennis players in the world earned a combined $60 million in prize money between June 2012 and June 2013. Roger Federer, the 17-time grand slam winner, is estimated to have earned $71.5 million in that time from sponsors, endorsements and exhibition matches, not to mention the $6.5 million in prize money. In the women's game, Maria Sharapova leads the way, earning $29 million a year, making her the highest paid female athlete in the world. It is a world away from where Tursunov lives -- a man who has earned just shy of $587,000 in prize money so far this year. ""You play against very good players,"" he said. ""It's hard for people to grasp but you are playing against someone top 100 in his profession in the world which is pretty impressive. ""If you play a top 100 golfer in the world, doctor or basketball player, all these guys are making ridiculous money. ""But again it's hard to compare the sports but the expenses are a lot higher than even in basketball because we don't have a team who are paying our expenses."" Tursunov does not travel with a hitting partner as Andy Murray does, nor does the Russian have the backing of lucrative sponsors. And while he accepts that he has not done badly, earning nearly $5 million during his career, he says the costs of competing on the circuit are constantly spiraling. ""There are certain expenses you can't escape such as airline tickets and so forth but then you have coaches, if you want to compete well, if you want to make it in to the top 50 there's no way you can do that without a coach,"" he said. ""I've tried. Roger has done it for some time but he's still traveling with a physio, the guy who strings his racquets and those are all expenses you pay yourself. ""You pay a salary to your coach, then you pay his and your travel expenses as well as food. So it adds up. I think to travel with a coach you are probably going to hit $200,000 a year in expenses."" Tursunov was just 12 when he left his native Russia to try his luck in the U.S. after being introduced to a tennis coach through his father. Following a one-month trial, it was decided that this prodigious young talent had a real talent -- and after that there was no looking back. ""The coach felt like I was someone,"" remembered Tursunov. ""He saw some potential in me and I decided that I had a one-way ticket to the U.S. and my dad left me after a month."" While he has never managed to prosper at the grand slam tournaments, Tursonov has enjoyed his time in the sun. Cast your mind back to Wimbledon 2005 and it was the Russian who played the pantomime villain on Centre Court by defeating British favorite Tim Henman. Amidst the searing pressure cooker heat of a tense five set match, it was Tursunov who prevailed 8-6 in the fifth to silence the raucous home crowd. A year later, he played an integral role in Russia's Davis Cup victory over the U.S. by defeating Andy Roddick in dramatic fashion, 17-15 in the fifth. ""After that long fifth set, my dad said 'I'm really sorry I put you in to tennis'. ""I felt he actually meant it -- the match lasted nearly five hours. I think he was pretty exhausted."" Exhaustion is a feeling Tursunov knows all too well. He is a keen sleeper, taking advantage of every possible second in his hotel bedroom to catch forty winks. In his opinion, it's getting tougher at the top with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray pulling away from the old master, Federer. Not since 2006 has Tursunov made it into the top 20 and the prospect of him repeating that feat looks unlikely given the amount of competition. ""I feel like it's getting closer and closer in terms of the top 100 guys,"" he added. ""You see a lot of these results where Federer and Nadal lost early in tournaments. ""I can't remember a time when Pete Sampras lost that early, or John McEnroe, he didn't lose that early ever in his lifetime. I think it's getting a little bit tougher. ""Obviously there's a lot more money involved and the players in order to compete we have to be a lot more professional and so I think the level of professionalism is getting a little bit higher. ""It's hard for me to say what it was like 20, 30 years ago, but I feel like when I first started there were a couple of matches where you looked at the draw and said 'OK this is a fairly sure win'. ""But I feel like there's almost no easy matches unless you know the guy's injured or he's coming from a different continent. It's getting tougher.""","Dmitry Tursunov is ranked 40th in the world .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Twenty men are engaged in fiery debate on a sidewalk near Nairobi's Westgate mall, where terrorists stormed the shopping center and killed at least 67 people. A man at the center gestures emphatically as some listen and nod. Others shake their heads. Here and at coffee shops and barbershops and social spots the debate is much the same: Should Kenya withdraw its troops from Somalia after terrorists stormed the mall? The terrorists who attacked the mall on Saturday claimed to be members of Somalia-based Al-Shabaab and barked out their resentment of Kenyan troops in their country. ""They said, 'We are the Al-Shabaab, we are here to kill you for killing our women in Somalia,'"" said Jane Kamau, who hid in a box when attackers opened fire at the mall. Kenya entered a high-stakes gamble two years ago when it sent troops to neighboring Somalia to flush out the Islamist militants it accused of kidnapping and killing foreigners in the coastal area. The abductions affected Kenya's once-bustling tourism industry, a major hit to the nation's revenue. Al-Shabaab vowed to attack Kenya until it withdrew its troops. Since then, grenades have landed at bus stops, churches, mosques and bars, killing dozens. Militants have regularly taken to social media to brag about their attacks and to threaten more. 'We need to protect our borders' John Mutua, part of the sidewalk debate, said keeping troops in Somalia is not the best option. ""We need to get them out,"" said the 34-year-old businessman. ""They'll keep killing us, and we'll continue killing them --- it will never end. We should all stop fighting, start afresh."" Next to him, bank teller John Kamau, 28, shakes his head vehemently. ""That's nonsense, it's not that easy,"" he said. ""We're already in too deep. We will be considered cowards if we get out. They (Al-Shabaab) started it by killing and kidnapping people in our own land."" Mutua waves him off. He tries to draw in a Kenyan soldier standing guard near the cordoned-off area near the mall. ""Do you guys like being in Somalia?"" Mutua asks. The soldier glares at him and turns the other way, clutching a long rifle. At a barber and hair-stylist shop about 20 miles from the mall, a similar debate is under way. Jane Njeri sits under a buzzing hair dryer. She pops her head out long enough to give her two cents, before tucking her head back. ""The reason the troops invaded is because our borders were porous to begin with,"" she said. ""We need to fix our security. We need to protect our borders. Those troops fighting in Somalia, we need to bring them home to help with those efforts. If we fix our security, we don't have to fear terrorists."" Philex Ambani, 23, said sending the troops there was not a good idea to begin with. But they should stay, he said. ""If they want our soldiers to get out, they need to stop killing us,"" he said. ""It's that simple. It wasn't worth it to go there over a bunch of tourists, but we are already there. We can't give up now. "" The Westgate mall standoff ended Tuesday, according to government officials. It was the worst terror attack in the nation since al Qaeda blew up the U.S. Embassy in 1998, leaving more than 200 dead. Kenya's president steadfast . Kenya is East Africa's biggest economy and a crucial trade route into the rest of the continent. It is also a major U.S. ally in the war against Islamist militants in the region. It provides an important buffer of stability in a region that includes the fledgling Somali government and the politically tense Sudans. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has ruled out the withdrawal of the military, which is now part of the African Union forces battling the militants in Somalia. ""We went as a nation to Somalia to fight the war against terror unleashed on Kenyan people, Somali people and people around the world,"" Kenyatta said this week. ""This is not a Kenyan war, this is an international war."" Godwin Murunga, deputy director of the African Leadership Centre in Nairobi, said the threat facing Kenya is complex and withdrawal from Somalia is not advisable. But revamped security in the nation, he said, will go a long way. ""Kenya needs to bring its citizens together to recognize security threats, to mobilize them into a common security consciousness and surveillance system that they trust and have confidence in,"" Murunga wrote in an opinion piece for CNN. 'Don't ask me about Shabaab' Having seen what happened to many of the victims of the mall massacre, Agnes Mumbua said she will do whatever she can to help protect herself. A Catholic, she plans to learn how Muslims pray and the names of major Islamic figures. Survivors of the mall massacre have said attackers asked victims whether they were Muslims. Those who failed to answer questions about Islam were killed, they said. ""If learning the Quran will help save me, I will do what it takes,"" she said. ""It seems the Kenya government is not leaving Somalia soon, so I might as well protect myself."" Government officials have said the terror attack killed 62 people and five of the suspected 15 terrorists. At least 61 people remain missing, the Kenyan Red Cross has said. Back on the sidewalk near Westgate, insurance agent Frederick Omolo shakes his head when asked his opinion about Al-Shabaab. ""Don't ask me about Shabaab. I don't want to hear that word in my life, ever,"" he said. He's listening to the debate on the militant group, a brown envelope in his hand. In it are life insurance documents for his friend John, whom he was going to meet at a coffee house at the mall. He was in the parking lot on his way to drop them off for John to sign when he heard gunshots and took off, clutching the envelope. His friend never left the mall. No one has seen him since. ""On second thought,"" Omolo said, ""let's improve our security big time, post armed cops in major public venues, do a sweep of areas suspected of harboring terrorists, then keep our troops in Somalia to do the job."" Omolo passed by the mall every day during the hostage crisis and sat on a sidewalk behind the police barricade, holding the insurance papers. They are still in the brown envelope.","Kenyan troops have been in Somalia since 2011 to try to root out terrorists .
The terrorists who killed dozens in Nairobi said they resent troops' presence .
Some Kenyans say it's time to get out and start afresh .
Others say withdrawing is a sign of cowardice and that border security is key ."
"(CNN) -- ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,"" the astronomer Carl Sagan once said. In the case of the extraordinary claim concerning the possible discovery of the wreck of Santa Maria, the flagship of Columbus' fleet, it's clear that we aren't there yet. In fact, we seem to be getting further away from proof all the time. The potential discovery of the wreck, which happened on the first of Columbus' four voyages to the Americas, has become a flashpoint for the difficulties of determining the authenticity of artifacts honored in memory but difficult to locate in the present. The discoverer, underwater explorer Barry Clifford, says he has quite a few reasons to believe he's found the right ship in the Caribbean Sea. Columbus left details in his diary about the location of the sinking, which happened near Haiti on Christmas Day in 1492. Clifford maintains that description matches the shipwreck's whereabouts. 500-year-old mystery solved? As the author of ""Columbus: The Four Voyages,"" which surveys the explorer's career, I was naturally drawn to this remarkable find -- if that's what it is. Love him or hate him, Columbus made a difference. No one doubts that he led some of the most important voyages of discovery ever undertaken, and that's why the fate of Santa Maria matters today. The story of this wreck is well-known, and documented by Columbus himself. On Christmas Eve 1492, crew members of all three ships were celebrating, drinking and looking forward to a speedy voyage home to Spain. (The outward-bound trip had taken just 33 days, a testament, in part, to Columbus' navigational genius.) Columbus said he stretched out for a nap at this time. As the fleet traversed the northern coast of what is now Haiti, the ship's master turned over the tiller to a 14-year-old ship's boy, and soon after Santa Maria ran into a reef and began to disintegrate. Columbus managed to rescue everyone -- in fact, he never lost anyone at sea in his eight transatlantic crossings -- and to gather valuable items from the ship before it sank into an estimated 15 to 25 feet of water. That's a summary of what we know, and the wreck should take these factors into consideration to be considered authentic. For starters, Columbus described in his log how the mainmast of the ship was cut away, and, as he wrote, ""she lay on her beam ends. ... The planking opened."" Any discovery should be consistent with these descriptions, but so far no information about that is forthcoming. And then we also have to account for erosion -- tides and hurricanes -- changing the shoreline and the reef over half a millennium. It's entirely possible, indeed, likely that reefs encountered by Santa Maria have shifted significantly over time, altering or moving the wreck. Next, there's the evidence in Columbus' own hand: his map of the coastline where the ship supposedly sank. Again, it represents how things looked to him 500 years ago rather than in the present. And, most frustrating of all, perhaps, Columbus occasionally fudged his navigational records. Why? To prevent others from exploiting his discoveries. Finally, it's unlikely that any of the wooden parts of the ship have survived after all these years. Other ships have sailed through those same waters over the years, and perhaps collided with the reefs. How to tell one ancient wreck from another? All of these factors make finding Santa Maria difficult. How can a shipwreck hunter make his claims stick? Clifford has pointed to ""ballast"" in the form of stones from the ship as evidence to identify Santa Maria. But ships in those days probably didn't have stone ballast to steady them; heavy cargo such as wine casks served the same function. And then there's the intriguing ""smoking gun,"" as Clifford calls it, the lombard, or cannon, aboard Santa Maria. Just before his presentation at the Explorers Club in New York in 2006, Clifford discovered that these items were missing from the site, ""looted,"" he explained. That's frustrating, especially because back in 2003, he was aware of the wreck and its probable lombards, if that's what they were, and he was touting a visit to the site as part of an auction held by the Explorers Club. But now the lombards, if that's what they were, are gone. There's not much left to go on. Exploration is all about finding something unknown, which often means shaking things up, disproving rather than confirming to arrive at something new. Since 2006, it seems that little was done to secure or explore the site, and given its potential importance, I wonder why that is. Given its potential historic significance, let's hope this wreck will finally receive the careful and responsible attention it deserves.","Explorer says he found wreck of Santa Maria, flagship of Columbus' fleet, off Haiti .

"(CNN) -- Two years after a Fort Bragg soldier disappeared after visiting a North Carolina bar, police believe they have found her remains. ""We are deeply saddened that the discovery of the apparent remains of Army Spc. Kelli Bordeaux now concludes our final hopes of her returning safely,"" Col. Christian Karsner, Task Force Bragg's chief of staff, said Wednesday. The remains were found Wednesday near the I-295 corridor in northern Fayetteville, police said. Nicholas Michael Holbert, 27, has been arrested and will be charged with first-degree murder in connection with Bordeaux's death, authorities said. Fayetteville police said more charges might follow. Holbert led police to a shallow grave where the soldier's apparent remains were found, according to The Fayetteville Observer. Holbert, a registered sex offender, allegedly knocked Bordeaux unconscious in the parking lot of a bar before killing her behind the tavern, the Observer reported, citing arrest warrants. Bordeaux was assigned to the 601st Area Support Medical Company, 44th Medical Brigade and served as a combat medic, Fort Bragg said in a statement. ""Our new hope is that her family, members of her unit and her friends will take some comfort from this news and the degree of closure it may bring, as well as the information that this discovery may reveal,"" Karsner said. 'Got home safely' In April 2012, the 23-year-old soldier left the Froggy Bottoms bar early on a Saturday, police said at the time. She had been drinking and was given a ride home by a bar employee, according to a U.S. Army official who spoke on condition of anonymity at the time of that story. At some point, the Army official said, Bordeaux sent two text messages. One said, ""got home safely."" The official did not know who the text was sent to or the contents of the second text message. In the months following Bordeaux's disappearance, throngs of police, military members and volunteers scoured the area for Bordeaux. Bordeaux was described as a ""very good soldier, not the type of person that would come up AWOL or missing,"" Fayetteville Police Chief Tom Bergamine said in 2012. Bordeaux was reported missing when she failed to report for duty, the official said at the time. Bordeaux's mother, Johnna Henson, has said police told her that someone had gave her daughter a ride to the bar, where Bordeaux sang karaoke. The medical examiner's office in Raleigh will try to determine the positive identification of the remains. CNN's Phil Gast and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","Army Spc.

"(CNN) -- Spc. Ivan Lopez vented about a range of subjects on Facebook before his shooting rampage at Fort Hood in Texas, including his outrage at Adam Lanza's mass school shooting in Connecticut. He wrote of experiencing overpowering fear after an insurgent attack in Iraq and the hatred that consumed him after getting ""robbed."" Lopez took his own .45-caliber handgun onto the sprawling post Wednesday and killed three people and wounded 16 more before taking his own life, according to authorities. They are trying to piece together what in his background and psychiatric treatment could have triggered a new round of bloodshed at the same Killeen post where an officer killed 13 people in 2009. A 34-year-old Iraq war veteran with a history of depression and anxiety, Lopez was being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder before his shooting spree. He arrived at the post in February after being transferred from Fort Bliss in El Paso. His Facebook posts, which were obtained from a Lopez family friend, appeared under the account name of ""Ivan Slipknot,"" a reference to a heavy metal band. A family spokesman confirmed the account belonged to Lopez. It is unclear whether his posts might help explain his mental state or a possible motive in the shootings. Authorities have said the motive is not known. ""Given that the alleged shooter is deceased, the possibility does exist that we may never know exactly why the alleged shooter did what he did,"" said Chris Grey, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command. In early March, around the time investigators said he purchased the .45-caliber pistol used in the shootings, Lopez wrote: ""My spiritual peace has just gone. Full of hate. Now I think I'll be damned. Last night I was robbed and I'm pretty sure there were 2 skinny ones. Green light and thumb down. That easy."" The details of the robbery are unknown. Killeen, Texas, police said the records department was closed Saturday. In another Facebook post, Lopez talked about Lanza, 20, who killed his mother, Nancy, before fatally shooting 20 children, six staff members and himself at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December 2012. Three soldiers slain at Fort Hood identified . Lanza wanted his minute of fame, Fort Hood shooter writes . Lopez wrote that Lanza ""pretends to be a victim of a mental illness followed by addiction to violent video games"" and that the shooter sought ""international attention"" and a ""minute of fame as a villain."" He added, ""It is stupid to me that anyone can have easy access to a powerful weapon without being mentally evaluated. This makes the government indirect accomplice... These bastards have perfected their way of attacking studying previous massacres to gain publicity and their minute of fame as a villain. But thanks to Hollywood and the sensational profiling by the media [they] give more power to those intelligent cowards."" Another post dealt with his time in Iraq: ""Celebrating life. It has been exactly 1 year and 2 days since left Iraq seeing in Fallujah the most brutal explosion... I was left paralyzed and started a discussion over the radio... I was only focused on breathing deeply so that I don't lose focus and continue the mission. [Those] were hours of agony waiting for an attack by the insurgency but we were able to exit Fallujah all alive. I was in vehicle #6.The worst was that #5 was a diesel truck, the perfect target. And I was only thinking about getting back with my family."" Lopez added: ""To be in the line of fire is f----- up but even more f----- is the suffering of the families."" Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, the post's commanding general, said Lopez did not experience direct combat in Iraq. ""So far, we have not discovered any specific traumatic event, wounds received in action, contact with the enemy or anything else specific that he may have been exposed to while deployed,"" the general said. Grey said authorities had ""credible information"" that Lopez ""was involved in a verbal altercation with soldiers from his unit just prior to him allegedly opening fire."" Messages left Saturday by CNN for Grey about the Facebook posts were not immediately returned. In a statement Friday, Lopez' father, also named Ivan, asked for prayers for all those affected. He described the soldier as ""a calm family man"" and ""a good son."" ""My son could not have been in his right mind,"" he said. ""He was not like this."" Lopez was Iraq vet being treated for mental health issues . Looking for clues into GI's actions, motive . Before Wednesday's shooting, Lopez stopped at the post's personnel office to pick up a leave form, according to the sister of one of the soldiers injured in the attack. Armetra Otis, sister of Sgt. Jonathan Westbrook, said on CNN's ""The Lead"" that her brother ""was at work and a guy came in and asked for a leave form."" The soldier was told he would have to come back later, Otis said. ""And apparently I guess he didn't want to hear that, so he came back and just opened fire, "" Otis said. Westbrook was shot four times, but released from a hospital Friday, his sister said. Law enforcement sources told CNN that investigators were searching for possible motives, including whether Lopez was angry over canceled leave. If Lopez sought a leave this week, it wouldn't be his first. Glidden Lopez Torres, a family spokesman, said Lopez' mother, Carmen, an emergency room nurse in their hometown, died of a heart attack in November. A month earlier, Lopez' grandfather had died in Guayanilla, a tight knit seaside community of 22,000 on the southern coast of Puerto Rico. The spokesman, not related to the soldier, said Lopez attended the funeral but was disappointed that it took about five days for his 24-hour leave to be approved by the military. In Friday's statement, the soldier's father said his son's medical treatment, the recent deaths of his mother and grandfather and changes related to a transfer of military installations ""surely affected his condition.""

"(CNN) -- Is anyone else wondering why the Steubenville, Ohio rape victim's two best friends testified against her? With this week's arrest of two other girls who ""menaced"" the teen victim on Facebook and Twitter, we have the beginnings of an answer. Rape culture is not only the province of boys. The often hidden culture of girl cruelty can discourage accusers from coming forward and punish them viciously once they do. This week, two teenage boys were found guilty of raping a 16-year-old classmate while she was apparently drunk and passed out during a night of parties last August. Everyone who was there and said nothing that night was complicit; if we want to prevent another Steubenville, the role of other girls must also be considered. On the night in question, girls watched the victim (Jane Doe) become so drunk she could hardly walk. Why didn't any of them help her? Why, after Jane Doe endured the agonizing experience of a trial in which she viewed widely circulated photos of herself naked and unconscious, did one of the arrested girls tweet: ""you ripped my family apart, you made my cousin cry, so when I see you xxxxx, it's gone be a homicide."" Why were two lifelong friends sitting on the other side of the courtroom? The accusation of rape disrupts the intricate social ecosystem of a high school, one in which girls often believe that they must preserve both their own reputations and relationships with boys above all else. This is a process that begins for girls long before their freshman year and can have violent consequences. From the earliest age, girls are flooded with conflicting messages about their sexuality. They are socialized to be ""good girls"" above all: kind, polite and selfless. Yet they are also told -- via media images, the clothing that's marketed to them and the messages conveyed by some adults -- that they will be valued, given attention and loved for being sexy. The result is a near-constant anxiety about not being feminine or sexy enough. Opinion: Steubenville case shows how the rules have changed . Meanwhile, girls consume romance narratives that tell them the most important relationships they can have are with boys who love them. They also observe a huge amount of psychological aggression among girls on television and in movies, often portrayed as comedy. Last year, researchers found that girls of elementary school age were more likely than boys to commit acts of social aggression at school after viewing them on television. No surprise, then, that when the first crushes are confided in elementary school, it's not uncommon for girls to turn on each other if they believe a friend is competing for the attentions of a boy they like. It often does not occur to them to reprimand the boy. This pattern is fairly innocuous in childhood, but by adolescence, it could have far more serious implications: Instead of grabbing the hand of a girl too drunk to consent and taking her to a safe place, some girls may instead angrily watch the drunken girl leave with a boy, figuring she deserves what she gets. From late elementary school onward, the label ""slut"" hovers dangerously over girls' every move. Most girls who are called sluts are not even sexually active. The word is used to distinguish ""good"" girls from ""bad,"" and the definition is constantly shifting. Few girls are let in on the criteria for who gets called a slut in the first place. The insecurity creates an incentive to call out someone else lest you be next. In 2011, a study by the American Association of University Women found that girls in grades 7-12 were far more likely than boys to experience sexual harassment, including rumors, both in person and online. And Leora Tanenbaum interviewed 50 girls and women for her book, ""Slut! Growing Up Female With a Bad Reputation;"" all of them told her girls, far more than boys, were at the forefront of the slut rumor mill. I am not saying that Jane Doe was raped because of girls' silence. Girls may choose not to speak up for many reasons, but it's hard to ignore the power of a culture that pushes them to choose boys over each other and punish other girls to protect their own reputations. We must talk to girls about their responsibility in situations like this. If we want to prevent another Steubenville, we need to teach children from an early age about gender-based violence. The word ""slut"" is not just an epithet; it is a word that has given adolescents permission to abandon and hurt each other when a girl needs support most. Girls must understand not only their moral obligation but their power to be allies to each other at parties and other potentially unsafe spaces for girls. If boys knew that girls banded together to support each other, they would be less inclined to share on social media, much less commit, these horrific acts of sexual violence. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rachel Simmons.","Rachel Simmons: Some of Steubenville rape victim's girlfriends testified against her .

"(CNN) -- Canada could have an exploding whale problem. The carcasses of three blue whales, the world's biggest mammals, washed up on the western shores of the island of Newfoundland this month, and now two towns with carcasses in their boundaries find themselves facing a huge predicament: How do they get rid of the decomposing leviathans before something bad happens, like an explosion? That's the fear of some of the 600 residents of Trout River, where an 81-foot-long, 60-ton carcass is bloating on the waterfront as methane gas inside expands, according to a report from CTV. ""I'm not sure with the heat and gases that are trapped inside of this mammal if at some point in time it will explode,"" Emily Butler, Trout River's town clerk, said in an interview published in The Star. Jack Lawson, a scientist with Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans, said a whale explosion is unlikely. He's more worried someone could fall inside the decomposing beast. ""The (whale) skin is starting to lose its integrity and if someone were to walk along, say, the chin -- that is full of all that gas -- they could fall in the whale. The insides will be liquefied. Retrieving them would be very difficult,"" Lawson, told the National Post. Excluding either of those scenarios, the decaying whales poses a stinky problem as tourist season nears. ""Normally we advertise whales to get people to come, where the restaurant is right on the beach and we often have whales in the cove frolicking about, but we don't want a dead whale as an attraction,"" Jenny Parsons, who owns the Seaside Restaurant in Trout River, told CBC News. A second blue whale carcass is in Rocky Harbour, where Mayor Walter Nicolle said the smell is getting worse by the day. He said the Canadian government has said local authorities in the town of 1,000 people must bear the responsibility and cost of removal, just as they must do in Trout River, according to the CBC. But Butler, who told the Western Star she originally considered asking local fishermen to tow the carcass out to sea, said her town doesn't have the money or expertise to do so. ""I'm not willing to take on the responsibility,"" she is quoted as saying. ""If that whale does explode, we don't know what danger that would be to our infrastructure, the longliner (fishing boat) itself, or to people."" And she said if the whale were towed out to sea, it could be considered a hazard to navigation by federal authorities. Lawson told Global News in most cases whales would be left to decompose where they lie. ""Normally, it would have washed ashore on a beach somewhere and would have slowly rotted away and the carnivores and predators would have worked at it until, in a few years time, there would only be bones left,"" he said. Butler hopes that's not the case in Trout River. ""It's only going to be a matter of time before it warms up and the smell becomes unbearable,"" she told Global News. The whales are believed to be among nine of the endangered species crushed or drowned by ice while feeding, according to a CTV report. While it is not unusual for marine mammals to be trapped by shifting ice, a denser ice pack has made the problem worse this year.","Dead blue whales have washed ashore in two Newfoundland towns .

"(CNN) -- Ever wonder what your toddler would say about your homemade baby food if she had an acid tongue and a Twitter account? Bunmi Laditan thinks she knows. Laditan's tweeting alter ego, the Honest Toddler, has been making followers guffaw at the wry observations of a semi-fictional baby pundit for about a year now. Laditan, a social media and online marketing manager based in Montreal, works from home so she can be with her children. She is set to release ""The Honest Toddler: A Child's Guide to Parenting"" in May. Inspired by her spunky daughter, Tali, Laditan began a Twitter account that expressed what might really be going through her toddler's mind during a particularly tantrumy week. ""She had the ability to speak, but if she could fully articulate, what would she say?"" Laditan wondered. Clearly, many of her nearly 200,000 Twitter followers would like to know the same thing and get a kick out of Laditan's interpretation. CNN reached out to Laditan to find out why toddlers are so sassy, how Twitter fits into modern motherhood and what makes it all worthwhile. An edited transcript of the talk is below: . CNN: What gave you the idea to do Honest Toddler? Laditan: My 3-year old, who was 2 at the time, we were having a really hard time. I have an older child, I've been through the toddler stage before, but I think I blocked it out of my memory. She was being defiant and I was busy with work, and literally it was the worst week we'd ever had. I just started (The Honest Toddler) for fun. I was so surprised by the response. Not in a million years did I think a bunch of people would read it. CNN: Working moms wear a lot of hats. What did you do before ""supervising,"" as your book cover says, The Honest Toddler? Laditan: I began in social media ... nowadays the first place you go, in terms of a really quick sense of community, is online. Just because it can be really hard to get in the car and find the mom group. It was difficult for me to navigate (being a mother). Wanting to read about motherhood, work-at-home moms, writer moms. Can I still have a career? How do I do it? How are other people managing? So I began taking a real interest in the parents online, and since my background is in marketing, I really wanted to incorporate that in how I would earn an income from home. So I began doing social media for companies. One was ""Tasty Baby,"" who made online organic baby food, and from there, I kept working and expanding and taking classes and working with other PR firms, learning how to do my job better. I've always loved writing, but ""I can love it, it's just not going to be my bread and butter,"" is how I always felt. But I wanted to keep writing, so I wrote for sites like ""Mothering,"" ""iVillage,"" ""Huffington Post,"" and really just enjoyed it. CNN: There seems to be a lot of very seriously toned parenting media on the Internet these days, and The Honest Toddler is anything but. Why do you think that is? Laditan: I get that there has to be an authority source. I've been in that mode, too, when writing. I think it's about trying to regain control and trying to help people feel as if there is a how-to. Even though at this point we all know there really isn't any one way. At one point or another you realize, there is no one way to do it, it's going to be messy, we can pretend all we want with our Instagrams and Facebook photos that it's all going great. But it's a struggle, so we do have to support each other and give each other a little bit of slack. CNN: Honest Toddler is pretty unique with regards to the content on Twitter, too. Laditan: I've seen Sarcastic Rover or when people tweet from the perspective of an inanimate object or animal, and I think they probably match up much closer to Honest Toddler than most parenting tweets. I think it's that different perspective. One of the reasons I believe it's popular -- and I don't think it has anything to do with me or my writing ability or anything like that -- is it has to do with parents who have already wondered what their kids are trying to say. Who have already thought, I know, if my child had the ability to articulate, they would say something like that. They have the opinions of people long before they have control of their bowels. They really believe we are on the same level. They believe we are peers. They see their mother and father as the ones who take care of them and where they go for comfort, but they really believe they have an equal vote. CNN: That's a lot of sass for such a tiny human. Are toddlers sassy? Laditan: Toddlers are ... people without filters. They're exactly like us but they don't have all the etiquette and social norms. So they say things that we would say if we didn't fear the social consequences. CNN: How much of The Honest Toddler is rooted in the real life experiences of your children that you observe? Laditan: Much of it is. I'm scared to say how much because I know that -- one of the reasons I love being anonymous is because that didn't feel like I would be judged. Not for my lack of parenting but just the situations are so crazy. And I know those situations happen to other people, too. On Friday, I was tweeting about Tali's ear infection and going to the pediatrician's office. She told me right away, ""I don't like the doctor."" And I knew it was going to be a struggle. CNN: At the end of the day, what makes a parent's struggle worth it? Laditan: The number one thing that really makes it all OK is knowing that it won't last forever. When you contextualize any difficult experience, that's what makes it bearable. With my first child, I had no idea what a contraction would feel like. Only what I'd seen on TV, like TLC, all these women screaming, 'I'm going to rip in half, this is going to be terrible!' But one woman (in a prenatal class), who had six kids said, 'You can handle 10 seconds of anything.' And she said the worst part of a contraction will probably last around 10 seconds. And when I was actually in labor, I thought of that. Knowing that made it bearable. It's the same thing when both my kids are still in their pajamas, crying, we're late for school, I'm thinking, ""Great, now we're going to have to go to the secretary's office and she's going to see that they're late again and that I'm not dressed, and I have weird stuff in my eyes from sleeping so I obviously didn't wash my face or brush my teeth before I drove them there."" I'm thinking all those terrible things and then I think, ""They're going to grow up and I'm not going to be doing any of this and I know I'm going to miss it, and they're going to want to be with their friends and not with me."" So that's what makes it doable. That's what makes me able to appreciate it and be able to laugh about it.","Writer Bunmi Laditan is the woman behind The Honest Toddler feed on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- Two health care workers went to the emergency room with flu-like symptoms after coming into contact with a patient confirmed to have Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, officials said Tuesday. The Florida patient represents the second confirmed case of MERS brought into the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. MERS is a mysterious virus that can be fatal, and was first found in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012. One health care worker in Orlando began showing symptoms 72 hours after exposure to the MERS patient but did not meet criteria for admission and was sent home, said Dr. Antonio Crespo, an infectious disease specialist at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, where the MERS patient is being treated. The health care worker will be monitored and seems to be improving, Crespo said. The other one, whose symptoms began 24 hours after exposure, was admitted to the same hospital, officials said Tuesday at a press conference. ""We're just waiting for the results from the testing that was done yesterday to decide about discharge,"" Crespo said. At-risk workers at home . The two health care workers are among 20 in the Orlando area who may have been exposed to the MERS patient, and they are being tested for the virus, officials said. They were all notified and told to stay home and not work for 14 days, Crespo said. They also should monitor their temperatures and check for possible symptoms such as a cough, sore throat and fever. Five health team members who may be at risk have been identified at Orlando Regional Medical Center and 15 at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, Crespo said. They were all evaluated for signs and symptoms that would be consistent for MERS. Samples were sent to the state lab for testing, said Dr. Ken Michaels, medical director for occupational health at Orlando Health. ""I'm glad to report that I've spoken to most of these team members today. They all report that they're doing great,"" Michaels said. On the 14th day, everyone involved will be brought back for further testing. Once medically cleared, they can return to work, officials said. Initial testing should be back within the next day or two, Michaels said. MERS: 5 things to know . Two confirmed U.S. cases . The confirmed MERS patient visited Orlando Regional Medical Center on May 5, accompanying another person who was having a medical procedure, officials said. ""I think the risk is negligible to those in the waiting room or the radiology area at (Orlando Regional Medical Center),"" said Dr. Kevin Sherin of the Florida Department of Health in Orange County. The MERS patient was admitted to Dr. P. Phillips Hospital on May 9. ""Before the patient came to the hospital, he was not having a cough,"" Crespo said. ""He was not having respiratory symptoms. So we believe that that makes less risk of transmission to other potential contacts."" Officials from the CDC and the Florida Department of Health are investigating the MERS case. During a White House briefing Tuesday, press secretary Jay Carney said President Barack Obama had been briefed on the MERS situation in the United States and that the CDC is taking the lead. The first U.S. case was reported this month in Indiana. That patient was released from a hospital Friday into home isolation, according to state health officials. The Indiana patient was an American health care provider who had been working in Saudi Arabia and was on a planned visit to Indiana to see his family. The Florida patient is also a health care provider who lives and works in Saudi Arabia, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general with the U.S. Public Health Service and director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. She said that he is not a U.S. citizen and that the Florida case is not linked to the Indiana one. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration will post CDC advisories at more than 20 U.S. airports to alert travelers about the virus. Although there are no recommendations to change travel plans, the signs will advise travelers to the Arabian Peninsula to avoid contact with sick people and wash their hands often. They should contact a doctor if they develop symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath and coughing, the CDC said. ""We think it's really critical to avoid overreacting in the community but also avoid under-reacting in the health care environment,"" Schuchat told CNN. ""The reason for the signage is so that we can promptly identify potential cases so that they can be separated from other people."" Can SARS lessons prevent a MERS virus outbreak? What is MERS? As of Friday, there have been 538 cases of MERS in 17 countries, including 145 deaths, according to the World Health Organization, Schuchat said. The virus is also known as MERS-CoV since it is a coronavirus, the same group of viruses as the common cold. It attacks the respiratory system, according to the CDC. Symptoms can lead to pneumonia or kidney failure. There is no vaccine or special treatment for MERS. Doctors said they believe the Indiana patient's quick diagnosis and care dramatically increased his chances for getting better. The ""risk to the general public remains very low,"" Schuchat said. In some countries, the virus has spread from person to person, but only in close contact, such as a person who was caring for an ill person. ""This virus has not shown the ability to spread easily from person to person in community settings,"" she said. Out of ""an abundance of caution,"" the CDC has been contacting people who were passengers on the same flights as the two patients with confirmed MERS, Schuchat said. No cases of MERS have been diagnosed as a result of transmission on a plane, the CDC's Dr. Marty Cetron said. The 44-year-old Florida patient traveled on May 1 from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to London, then from London to Boston, Boston to Atlanta, and finally Atlanta to Orlando. The man began feeling unwell on the flight from Jeddah, with symptoms including ""fever, chills and a slight cough,"" Schuchat said. Family members of the patient have been tested as well, Crespo said. ""The patient has been doing very well,"" Crespo said. The patient had a low-grade fever of 100.2 on Monday night but has a minimal cough, and he is ""in great spirits."" MERS mystery: Virus found in camels .

"(CNN) -- Britain hosts a sporting event over the next fortnight that manages to combine every conceivable stereotype associated with the nation -- rain, royalty and heroic British failure. Wimbledon follows the Queen's Diamond Jubilee -- when Britons, with Union Jacks in hand, stood in the pouring rain as the monarch cruised past in a barge on the Thames -- and a day after the exit of England's soccer team from a major international tournament -- as so often before on penalties -- after defeat by Italy in Euro 2012. Since its inception in 1877 the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in a small, affluent suburb of south west London that gives the event its name, has presided over a tournament -- the oldest and grandest on the tennis circuit -- that has become more than simply another fixture on the grand slam calender. Royal regulations for Ascot's fashionistas . The quaint images and traditions of The Championship -- of regimented ball boys, pots of strawberries and cream, lines of well-mannered fans politely queuing for their tickets, players bowing or curtsying if the Queen is attendance in the Royal Box -- have become as ubiquitous as the tennis. Overseas players like Novak Djokovic cannot get enough of the tournament's history. ""The great thing about Wimbledon that I really appreciate is the tradition that is respected and protected for more than 130 years,"" defending men's champion Djokovic declared yesterday on his Facebook page. ""We still wear only white clothes during the tournament, and the defending champion always plays at 1pm on Monday!"" And for the millions of people that will watch Wimbledon around the world -- and it is estimated that that the global TV audience could be as high as 500 million -- the tournament also reinforces what many think constitutes Britishness. ""It has a David Niven-ish propriety (in that) it conforms to standards of behavior that were accepted ... at least during Niven's time (in the 1950s,)"" explains Professor Ellis Cashmore, an academic and social commentator whose most recent work looks at whether Britain is losing the civility that it is famous for. ""They still refer to 'Ladies' and the scoreboard [until recently] reads initials rather than Christian (first) names; the players have to wear white, and the match referee, not umpire, wears his club blazer. ""So, there is an old-school sort of Britishness ... And we shouldn't forget the time-honored convention that Brits never win. Well, not since 1977, and not in the foreseeable future."" Brand Britannia . Since that victory for Virginia Wade 35 years ago -- and you have to go back to 1936 and Fred Perry to find a British men's singles champion -- the story of Wimbledon has been one of sporting failure for its hosts. Yet the power of the Wimbledon brand to shape what the rest of the world thinks of Britain remains. ""Wimbledon is a global brand: it's internationally recognized in a way that the U.S. Open and the French yearn for,"" explains Cashmore. ""In terms of reach, Wimbledon runs the (English) Premier League a very close second. The name itself resounds like a thunderclap. There is nowhere on earth where you can just say 'Wimbledon' and people won't know what you're talking about. ""It's like the BBC: an emblem of Britain that commands respect and admiration near and far. ""But emblems are not necessarily accurate reflections of reality. they are representations, images or symbols of an ideal; a perfect place where people wear straw hats, eat fresh strawberries with their champagne and hobnob with the royal family."" For social commentators like Peter York -- author of the famous ""Sloane Ranger Handbook"" -- Wimbledon represents a type of Britishness that doesn't exist any more: one steeped in glorious Empire that is overwhelmingly white, affluent and still centered around London and the south east of England. ""Wimbledon mildly confirms that tennis around the world is quite a polite middle class game played in a very restrained way with a very restrained audience. People don't get into any fervor. That's for other proletarian sports,"" he says. ""It's a middle class sport wherever you go ... It's all nice enough (and) reinforces British imagery but not create it. It's definitely a very southern (British) thing, a very southern suburb. It's a southern, well off, late Victorian suburb with a particular social character."" Cashmore agrees that Wimbledon reflects only a very tiny aspect of British society, and one that still fails to reflect the changing multicultural character of the country that surrounds it. ""(Wimbledon represents) only one of many types of Britishness,"" he says. ""Football, boxing and athletics represent another type of Britishness, one in which the competitors are black, Asian as well as white, and who come from all kinds of class backgrounds. ""If Wimbledon is going to be derided, it's because it seems remote and insulated from this type of Britishness."" The last great British hope? Whether Great Britain itself survives the next few years is another question entirely. This year the hopes of the host nation once again rest on Andy Murray's shoulders. He will also represent Great Britain at this summer's London Olympics. Yet Murray is also Scottish and Scotland will be voting on the issue of independence in the summer of 2014. The country's one viable hope for victory in the foreseeable future might be playing under a different flag in 2015. Such is the confusion over national identity -- a debate centered on the conflict between British identity and that of its constituent English, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish nations, not to mention the influences of cultures from outside the realm -- that Prime Minister David Cameron has spoken about the need to be more muscular in promoting an idea of what Britishness actually is. This year he has plenty of opportunities to do that following the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, now Wimbledon and next month at the Olympics. But perhaps as the poet and author Bonnie Greer recently said: ""I don't know what it means to be British and I think it's a very positive thing. ""Britain is the right sort of template for the 21st century in that it is a multinational state that isn't at war with itself, that isn't tearing itself apart, and is actually showing the world how to function."" In that version of Great Britain, there's plenty of space for an event like Wimbledon. ""Wimbledon still maintains its specialness,"" agrees Cashmore. ""There is no longer a single, unified conception of Britishness that's good for all times. ""Wimbledon embodies one image. It is nobody's idea of all-things-British.""","Wimbledon is the oldest tennis tournament in the world .
It began in 1877; defending champion Novak Djokovic hails its ""tradition""
The tournament is a powerful brand exporting one aspect of ""Britishness""
But is Wimbledon still a relevant reflection of the country today?"
"(CNN) -- After more than a dozen trips to the Middle East and 14 months of unbridled optimism on the prospects for peace in the region and his own ability to negotiate it, John Kerry on Friday finally sounded defeated. While Kerry has made the peace process his priority since taking office, his focus has been challenged by the civil war in Syria, nuclear negotiations with Iran and, now, Russian moves against Ukraine. He acknowledged the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was still a global concern, but that the United States had a full agenda. ""We have an enormous amount on the plate,"" he said, adding what were possibly the toughest comments he has made about the parties' intransigence. ""There are limits to the amount of time and effort that the United States can spend if the parties themselves are unwilling to take constructive steps in order to be able to move forward,"" Kerry said. The past week was particularly frustrating for Kerry. Israel reneged on a scheduled release of Palestinian prisoners and the Palestinians responded by signing on to join 15 international bodies in defiance of their own commitment not to seek international recognition as a state. Kerry blindly stated the obvious when he called both moves ""not helpful."" Since beginning his peace mission, Kerry's lofty goals have become significantly more modest. In July, he announced a bid to reach a peace deal within nine months. But as time rolled by with little progress, Kerry sought to get Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to agree to a framework, which would form the basis for a comprehensive peace treaty. With the deadline set to expire on April 29, Kerry and his aides have struggled to get the parties to extend the talks, even putting the potential release of Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard on the table to secure the Palestinian prisoner release. Kerry said ""neither party has said that they've called it off."" And one Palestinian source close to the negotiations told CNN's Ben Wedeman that Palestinians were still committed to the talks until the April deadline. After that, he said, ""we are free."" Neither of those are ringing endorsements. Even if both sides are willing to mark time for another month, it's clear the peace process is on life support. While Kerry isn't ready to pull the plug entirely, he said the United States would ""evaluate what is possible and what is not possible,"" suggesting Washington may recalibrate its role as broker of the peace process as a result. ""We're not going to sit there indefinitely. This is not an open-ended effort,"" Kerry said Friday in Morocco. ""It's reality check time.""","Kerry had high hopes of deal in announcing talks nine months ago .
He has made more than a dozen trips to the region to facilitate negotiations .
He had been optimistic, but now he sounds resigned with deadline for progress fast approaching .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to describe billions of years of cosmic history. But scientists have used a code to create a model of how the universe as we know it today might have evolved. A new study in the journal Nature describes a simulation of the universe that is unique because of ""how realistically it recreates the galaxies and the universe that we see, which is kind of a first for a simulation like this,"" said Dylan Nelson, study co-author at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Nelson and collaborators released several videos this week showcasing highlights of what their numerical simulation, called Illustris, can do. Running this model ""took approximately 16Â million CPU (central processing unit) hours,"" Michael Boylan-Kolchin, astronomer at the University of Maryland, College Park, wrote in an accompanying article in Nature. ""The end result, however, is a simulated Universe that looks an awful lot like the real one."" This simulation begins 12 million years after the Big Bang, which is still pretty early considering that the universe is about 13.8 billion years old. ""What it allows -- a statistically robust comparison against observations across all of cosmic time -- is a critical aspect in the development of better and more realistic models, which directly translates into more physical insight which we can extract from such simulations,"" Nelson said. A range of galaxy types emerges in this simulation, such as blue spiral and red elliptical galaxies. The content of hydrogen and elements heavier than hydrogen and helium seems consistent with observational data, study authors wrote. ""These observations capture a large variety of galaxy luminosities, sizes, colours, morphologies and evolutionary stages, providing remarkable benchmarks for galaxy formation theories,"" study authors wrote. A total of 41,416 galaxies are represented in the simulation. It includes a population of elliptical galaxies that don't form stars, disk galaxies that do form stars, and irregular galaxies. Our own Milky Way galaxy is a disk galaxy, and simulating how such a galaxy would be formed has been problematic in the past. But the scientists' calculations have overcome this, the study said. The simulation takes into account that there are phenomena in our universe that we have never detected but that have had huge influence on cosmic evolution. Dark matter accounts for about 24% of the universe, while normal matter -- everything that we can see -- is only 4.6%. Dark matter ""dominates the gravitational pull of everything, especially on large scales,"" Nelson said. ""It's the backbone of the cosmic web."" Over the course of the universe's history, galaxies have formed where dark matter was most concentrated. But most of the universe is made of dark energy, responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe. The universe is expanding, but how quickly? Obviously, you can't model the entire universe at once, but this simulation does represent a substantial chunk of it: 350 million light years in each dimension, Nelson said. It allows scientists to zoom in to see the structure of individual galaxies, such as spiral arms. Still, there are shortcomings to the simulation: For instance, the mass of stars in low-mass galaxies gets built up earlier than what has been observed, meaning that populations of stars are shown as two to three times older than in reality. Joel Primack, professor of physics and director of the High-Performance Astro Computing Center in Santa Cruz, California, takes issue with the idea that this new simulation is better than its predecessors. ""Other groups are doing a much better job of understanding what's going on inside galaxies, including my own group,"" said Primack, whose team also works on modeling the cosmos. But the simulation does have strengths on a larger scale -- for instance, in showing how galaxies affect their surrounding environments, and how environments impact galaxies, he said. The code used in the simulation, Arepo, is not publicly available -- another of Primack's criticisms. But Nelson said that a complete description of its methods has been published, and that anyone with expertise who is motivated could use it to develop a similar code.","Scientists have released a new model of how the universe might have evolved .
The simulation begins 12 million years after the Big Bang .
It represents more than 41,000 galaxies .
Dark matter is the 'backbone of the cosmic web'"
"(CNN) -- ""If you'd like beer with your dinner, we have Asahi or Kirin,"" says Reverend Seioh Yamashina. Given that I'm sitting on a floor cushion about to stab my chopsticks into a tray of beautiful shojin ryori (vegan Buddhist cuisine) served at a mountaintop temple at Japan's most sacred site, Koyasan, I reply to the robed monk as any visitor would. ""Asahi, please."" Noting the surprised look on my face as I respond to his offer, Yamashina says that Fudoin Temple has no problem with shukubo (temple stay) guests enjoying a beer with dinner. After all, he isn't the one drinking it. Certain sects of Buddhism in Japan aren't as strict as you might find in places like Thailand or Bhutan, where drinking alcohol near temples is forbidden, he goes on to explain. For another thing, ordained monks can get married here. According to history books, back in 1872 the incoming Meiji government declared that monks should be free to eat meat -- if given to them as an offering -- take wives and have children. The tradition continues today. Seioh's father is Fudoin's temple master, as was his father and grandfather before him. Where Japanese Buddhism took hold . Of Koyasan's 117 temples, Fudoin is one of 52 that allow overnight guests. Why so many shukubo? Located in Japan's Wakayama Prefecture, Koyasan is a must-hit site for spiritual Japanese. It's starting to grow in popularity globally, thanks to its 2004 addition to the UNESCO World Heritage List as one of three sacred sites in Japan's Kii Mountain Range. With a population of about 3,000 people, according to town officials, it's the center of Shingon Buddhism, a Chinese-influenced esoteric sect introduced to Japan in the year 805 by a man named Kobo Daishi, or Kukai, one of Japan's most revered religious figures. Ancient cedar forests share space with historic pagodas, paved roads, restaurants, schools, cafes and souvenir shops. Anything that's built in the town of Koyasan needs to be approved by officials in historic Kongobuji, which also functions as the Shingon Buddhism headquarters for more than 4,000 temples and missions throughout Japan and overseas. A walk in honor of the dead . As far as ancient forests and sacred mountains go, Koyasan is easily up there with the world's best. Every pagoda and gate is stunning, particularly the 20 structures at Danjo Garan, often described as the second most sacred site in Koyasan. Another beautiful site is Banryutei, Japan's largest rock garden. Located in the inner courtyard of Kongobuji temple, it was completed in 1984 to commemorate the 1,150th anniversary of Kobo Daishi's ascent into eternal meditation. But the pinnacle of any journey to Koyasan is incredible Okunoin, the most revered site of them all. After crossing the Ichinohashi (first bridge), I'm ready to head down the two-kilometer cobblestone walkway to the Okunoin mausoleum and its Torodo Hall, filled with more than 10,000 lanterns. The walk is filled with more than 200,000 gravestones, monuments and memorials (no bodies are buried here), all sharing space with Shinto torii gates, side paths and thick forests of massive trees that tower over the trail and filter the morning sun. You could walk back and forth through that forest 100 times and still spot something you didn't notice before. There are monuments to historic figures, war heroes, royalty, business leaders, children and pets. Some of the little human statues wear bibs, others tiny hats. From Nissan to Sharp, many of Japan's largest corporations have paid piles of yen for huge marble monuments to be erected at Okunoin to honor deceased employees. Some are marble statues in the shape of the products the companies produce. At the end of the Okunoin walkway is the mausoleum of Kobo Daishi, the man who started it all. Every morning at 6 a.m. and 10:30 a.m., golden-robed monks prepare a meal for Kobo Daishi as part of a ritual that involves blessing food placed in a covered wooden box. The monks are oblivious to our little row of photographers. As we clamor for a good vantage point, they float by in their elevated wooden shoes, carrying the wooden box up the temple stairs to the mausoleum. It's best to visit Okunoin on weekday mornings to catch this solemn display of devotion, when crowds are light. My guide tells me things get packed on weekends with busloads of Japanese tourists. ""Pretty much everyone in Japan wants to visit Koyasan at least once in their lives,"" he says. Meditation, chants and free Wi-Fi . Back at Fudoin, it's 7 a.m. and master Seiryu Yamashina is hovering over a large book, carrying out his morning ritual in the glittery temple, which guests are invited to watch. Joined by two other chanting monks, he prays for all the spirits enshrined at Fudoin and societal peace. It's a mesmerizing scene -- the steady flow of chants are hypnotizing as curly trails of incense smoke waft into the air, punctuated by the occasional bang of a gong. Visitors are given a printout featuring a portion of the chant, in English and Japanese, should they wish to follow along. Afterward, we're served breakfast, another fabulous and fresh shojin ryori meal (I'd quit meat forever if I had access to this food every day) in the temple's historic Kuri dining room, one of Wakayama Prefecture's most revered cultural assets. Though the temple adheres to ancient traditions, guests have free Wi-Fi available throughout the property, rooms included. This, says the temple master, is part of the secret to Koyasan's survival -- the ability to adapt and change, while still adhering to the core principles of the Buddhist faith. ""It's my duty as the temple master to follow all the old rituals and traditions and pass them along,"" he says. ""But we need to embrace new technology. In the early days, Koyasan was introduced to the masses by pilgrims who traveled through on foot, then spread the word about this sacred site. ""Today, we have much easier ways to share information.

"(CNN) -- Colombians cast ballots in a hotly contested presidential vote on Sunday, but none of the five candidates running received enough support to win the election. In the preliminary tally, Oscar Ivan Zuluaga was in the lead with 29.3% of votes, officials said, while incumbent President Juan Manuel Santos had secured 25.6% of votes. To win a presidential election, Colombian law requires a candidate to obtain more than 50% of votes. That means Zuluaga and Santos will face off in a runoff election on June 15. A key question voters are weighing: Should Colombia's government keep negotiating with leftist guerrillas or force them to surrender? Santos was first elected in 2010 on a platform of continuing an offensive against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, leftist guerrillas that have been at war with the government for decades. But since late 2012, peace talks with the group have become a hallmark of his presidency. On Sunday, Santos said that in the second round, voters will choose ""between the end of the war and a war without end."" ""We are going to choose between those who respect the opposition and the free press, and those who prefer intolerance,"" he said. Zuluaga has called for an end to the peace talks and is against giving any political space to the rebels. On Sunday, he stressed that he also wanted peace for Colombia. ""Peace, yes, but peace that benefits the people,"" he said. ""My pledge is to work for a serious, responsible and lasting peace."" ""The difference regarding the candidates' position in the economy and other issues is minimal, but when it comes to how to handle the guerrilla, it's abysmal,"" pollster Javier Restrepo told CNN last week. ""Santos is advocating for a continuation of the peace talks he started in 2012, while Zuluaga's position is that there should not be a dialogue with an illegal guerrilla until its fighters surrender to government forces and lay down their weapons."" Election observers from the Organization of American States said there was a high level of abstention in Sunday's vote, with around 60% of eligible voters deciding to stay home rather than cast ballots, CNN en EspaÃ±ol reported. As candidates debated the issues, a scandal involving a hacker and a video sent shockwaves through the final days of campaigning last week. The video published by the weekly news magazine ""Semana"" in BogotÃ¡ allegedly shows Zuluaga getting secret military information from a man who was arrested earlier this month and accused of illegal hacking activities. Zuluaga told reporters the five-minute video was ""a vulgar montage"" put together to smear his campaign. CNN's Mariano Castillo and CNN en EspaÃ±ol contributed to this report.","NEW: Santos: Voters will choose ""between the end of the war and a war without end""

"(CNN) -- I write this piece with some trepidation, because people are understandably troubled by the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 and want to know why it happened. They do not want to hear that it ""could have been worse,"" that such events are extremely rare or that the causes of the accident aren't clear. But I will focus below on all of these points, because they are true and worth noting. It is tragic that two teenage girls perished in the Asiana crash. But given the conflagration that left the plane a charred hulk, it is remarkable that 99% of the passengers survived the accident. Moreover, these were the first two deaths on scheduled commercial flights in the United States this year or, for that matter, in the last 4Â½ years. During that period, more 3 billion passengers flew with no fatalities in the United States or on U.S. airlines. Two in 3 billion is a very small number. Did Asiana pilot have enough 777 experience? How small? At that risk per flight, a traveler could on average fly once a day for 4 million years before succumbing to a fatal crash. An American youth at an airport is far more likely to grow up to be president than to perish on today's flight. (That youth is also more likely to win the Nobel Prize in physics.) U.S. flying has become so safe that fear of an air journey is almost as farfetched as fear of a ceiling collapse at the grocery store. That circumstance is a remarkable tribute to the efforts of airlines, aircraft manufacturers, governments, the media and a flying public that holds aviation to the highest standards of safety. Yet we should not tolerate even two deaths if they can plausibly be avoided. For that reason, we need to study carefully what went wrong on Asiana Flight 214 to minimize the risk of recurrence. We should resist the temptation to characterize what happened as pilot error, which can lead to the fatalistic view that ""to err is human"" and that these things are bound to happen. Even if the pilots did err in some way, the germane question is why. It appears Asiana Flight 214's problem was that it was flying so slowly it eventually stalled and collapsed to the ground. Shock and survival: Crash through the eyes of children . But why were the pilots unaware of the slow speed? Were some of the instrument readings faulty? Might some of the readings have been hard to interpret (like the confusing readings about the rate of descent that caused a jet to crash in 1992 into a mountain)? The pilots did get a warning about an impending stall about seven seconds before the plane hit the sea wall. But why was there only a seven-second warning? Could systems be reconfigured so that warnings about potential stalls are issued sooner? To be sure, earlier warnings might yield a proliferation of false alarms, but might that price be worth paying so that true alarms arrive in time to be useful? Had Asiana Flight 214 been warned seven seconds earlier, we might never have heard about it. Under the circumstances, it is heartening that the National Transportation Safety Board will painstakingly study everything that happened on Asiana Flight 214, and will identify indirect as well as direct causes of the crash. That is the best reason to hope that what happened at San Francisco International Airport will never occur again within our lifetimes. And given all the progress to date in aviation safety, that hope is anything but forlorn. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arnold Barnett.","Arnold Barnett: Commercial flight fatalities rare, and most survived Asiana Flight 214 crash .

"(CNN) -- Kenneth Johnson never believed. When his son, Kendrick, was found with his body headfirst in a rolled-up gym mat at Lowndes County High School in south Georgia, authorities offered their take on what happened: The 17-year-old had been reaching for his sneaker when he got caught up in it, then suffocated to death. In other words, it was all a tragic accident. ""When he came up this cockamamie story of how they found Kendrick,"" the late student's father said Friday of the local sheriff, ""... right there, from the beginning, we had no reason to trust them at all. ""Because they didn't show us justice."" The questions surrounding Kendrick Johnson's death . Ten months after burying their son, the Johnson family says that's all they're looking for -- justice. Not to declare his case closed, as the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office did after a Georgia Bureau of Investigation autopsy found that Kendrick died of position asphyxia. The Johnson's skepticism led them not to give up, but to push on with their own investigation. A second autopsy conducted by a private pathologist, at the request of Kendrick's parents, found he died because of ""unexplained, apparent non-accidental blunt force trauma."" There have been more questions since then, including why their son's body and skull were stuffed with newspaper before his burial. The pursuit of getting answers has made the pain of losing a son -- a boy they described as jovial, polite and good-hearted -- a little more bearable. ""Just to know that we're fighting for Kendrick is what gets me up in the morning,"" his mother, Jacquelyn Johnson, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday night. ""We know we've got to fight a little harder every day."" Attorneys call for release of surveillance video . Conflicting determinations of what happened . A loving son and brother, a three-sport athlete who never got in trouble with the law, a jokester who made every day fun, a gentleman with good manners and a sunny disposition. That was Kendrick Johnson, in a nutshell, his parents say. ""Every parent all over the world would want to have a son like Kendrick,"" Kenneth Johnson told CNN's Cooper. ""Kendrick was a great boy."" On January 11, he was in the gymnasium of Lowndes County High in Valdosta. A few still images, taken from surveillance cameras, are perhaps the last of Kendrick Johnson alive. They show him walking across the bare floor with no one else in sight, though it's quite possible that other, unreleased pictures would show Kendrick wasn't alone. The next pictures of the teenager are far more horrifying: His body, clad in jeans and layered orange and white T-shirts, is wedged in the wrestling mat. His face is bloated with pooled blood, some of which poured out of his body and soaked his dreadlocks and spilled onto the floor. There were more streaks of blood on a nearby wall. But it wasn't Kendrick's, investigators say. In fact, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation told CNN on Thursday that DNA tests to try to determine whose blood that was found no match. Lt. Stryde Jones, from the sheriff's office, told CNN in May that the blood looked like it had ""been there for an extended period of time."" A pair of orange-and-black gym shoes are found a few yards from the teen's body. They had a substance that looked like blood, though investigators told CNN that it was not -- which is why the shoes weren't collected for potential evidence. Nor was a hooded sweatshirt a few feet away. ""I don't believe this was an accident,"" said Harold Copus, an Atlanta private investigator who looked at the death scene imagery. ""I think this young man met with foul play."" And Dr. Bill Anderson, the private pathologist hired by Johnson's family who conducted the second autopsy, found that Johnson had a blow to right side of his neck ""consistent with inflicted injury."" ""I've never had a case that I can recall where the prosecution actually was told that this may well be a homicide -- the prosecution being the state, the police and so forth -- and then they didn't bother prosecuting,"" said Anderson, from Forensic Dimensions in Heathrow, Florida. ""It's mystifying."" Yet a number of official reports paint a different picture. A January 25 report by the Valdosta-Lowndes County Regional Crime Laboratory cited ""no signs of blunt force trauma on Johnson's face or body."" And the original autopsy results released by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation May 2 identified ""no significant injuries."" Body stuffed with newspaper . Mother: We'll keep at it 'until we get justice' So what is the truth? The Johnson family says one way to find out is through a coroner's inquest, a process in which a panel -- after reviewing evidence and testimony -- decides on a cause of death. They plan to file a lawsuit as early as next week to force the district attorney to force such an inquest. If this process ends with a ruling Kendrick Johnson's death was a homicide, not an accident, then authorities would logically reopen their investigation. And with that, the Johnsons hope, they'll find out who is responsible. Maybe then they'll see the full surveillance footage from the school gymnasium that winter day, which might show whether anyone else was there with Kendrick Johnson. And maybe they'll find out who stuffed newspaper in place of the teenager's internal organs. GBI spokeswoman Sherry Lang said the organs were placed in Johnson's body before it was sent to a funeral home. The funeral home's owner, Antonio Harrington, wrote to the family that his firm never received the teen's organs, claiming they were ""discarded by the prosecutor."" Jacquelyn Johnson says the family is committed to keeping Kendrick's spirit alive. They held a party this week to mark what would have been his 18th birthday. And Jacquelyn Johnson says she still talks to him, up in heaven, to ""tell him that I love him and I missed him."" Asked why she does, the mother said, ""It just gives me more motivation to keep fighting for him -- until we get justice."" Kendrick Johnson's death was not accidental, family's autopsy finds . CNN's Victor Blackwell contributed to this report.","Kendrick Johnson, 17, was found dead in a rolled-up mat a high school gym .

"(CNN) -- In a city known more for hiking trails than fashion runways, photographer Thomas Lea scours the streets for style. ""It's a fairly remote place, way out in the west,"" he said. ""But people in Boise have great taste."" Lea, 65, relocated to Idaho's capital from San Francisco in 2005. Love for a Boise woman -- which eventually turned to marriage -- lured him from the city he admired for diversity and energy. He'd spend days roaming bustling neighborhoods, snapping photos of San Franciscans in goggles, drag attire and lion headpieces. Now, he lingers around the Capital City Public Market in downtown Boise, aiming his Canon digital SLR camera at pedestrians turned models. ""Boise is slower-paced, more homogenous and less densely populated than San Francisco, and this makes the fashion crowd stand out much more,"" Lea said. ""The fashionistas are fewer in number, but they are as creative and fashion savvy as anywhere in the world."" Thus, Boise Style -- Lea's fashion blog influenced by The Sartorialist and editorial spreads in magazines -- was born. ""Fashion here is fun, above all else,"" he said. ""It's not serious or earth-shaking. It's a way to get your mind off the world's problems and focus on something beautiful."" Below, Lea explains Boise style. CNN: What influences style in your city? Lea: Nestled against the Boise Foothills and along the Boise River is one of the West's great outdoor playgrounds. Opportunities for skiing, camping, hunting, bicycling and river rafting are all close by and very popular. This outdoor culture heavily influences clothing style, and the norm is very casual, even in downtown Boise. CNN: Describe a popular style. Lea: Comfortable and casual. Outdoorsy. CNN: What different fashion statements do you see? Lea: I see creative mixes of color, texture and pattern. Unique accessories (often vintage or thrift store finds) are popular. Eye-catching personal styles look better to me than the fashion magazine trends or the latest from our mainstream department stores. Shopping here is pretty much limited to Macy's, Target, Ann Taylor and other chains. Creative fashionistas go to the thrifts and consignment shops. CNN: What do Boise fashionistas do with thrift store goods? Lea: I see people get creative. They wake up in the morning and put together something fun. It's more about self-expression than following any trend. CNN: What makes you stop to take someone's photo? Lea: I look for something creative in the outfit or combination of items more than just the latest from off-the-rack style. It's about personality, feeling good, self-expression. CNN: Do you have any favorite looks? Lea: I like the mix of tailored with casual -- the latest Ralph Lauren sport coat over worn Levi's. I really enjoy the resurgence of Americana: Woolrich, Pendleton, vintage work boots from Red Wing. And I like shoes, real shoes: brogues, wingtips and saddle shoes, not running shoes or flip-flops. CNN: One of your collections, ""Market People,"" showcases street style in Boise. What can outsiders gather from the photos? Lea: ""Market People"" is a microcosm, slice of life, view of Boise. It is, at least in part, a view of how we look. I intend for my art to be shrewd, revealing, perceptive observations of the everyday. How do people dress in your city?

"(CNN) -- A headless body of a man found in a wooded Michigan park had local police in Michigan wondering how -- and why. Then, as authorities investigated the bizarre killing and waited outside a suspect's home, the suspect tried to outrun the police -- ending with a car crash and the suspect shooting himself. In the trunk of that crashed car was the body of a teenager who was eight months pregnant. In the suspect's home, police found an arsenal -- more than 40 guns, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, dozens of machetes, knives and other weapons. And authorities say it all began with a sex-for-money Craigslist post, written by the victims. The FBI has been enlisted to help the Wyoming, Michigan, police department investigate the murders of pregnant 18-year-old Brooke Slocum and her boyfriend, 25-year-old Charles Oppenneer. It was Oppenneer's decapitated body, found in a park last Wednesday in Wyoming, Michigan, that sent police into action. While investigating Oppenneer's death, police learned that his teenage girlfriend, Slocum, was his last known contact, but she could not be located. A day after Oppenneer's headless body was found, the Wyoming Department of Public Safety named Slocum a missing person, according to a police department news release. Slocum was in her eighth month of pregnancy when she vanished, according to CNN affiliate WOOD. While executing a search warrant on Slocum's computer, police found e-mail exchanges with a local man named Brady Oestrike. The e-mails -- which originated with a Craigslist post written by one of the victims -- detailed plans for the 31-year-old Oestrike to meet the couple at a park -- the park where Oppenneer's body was subsequently found -- and pay them for sex, police said. Last Thursday, while waiting to obtain a search warrant for Oestrike's residence, investigators saw him leave his home in a car, setting off a police chase. The chase ended when Oestrike's car crashed into a cement barrier. Police found him at the driver's seat, dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, according to the police news release. When police searched the vehicle, they found Slocum's body in the trunk. An autopsy determined that she had been strangled. Investigators said they later collected more than 400 pieces of evidence from Oestrike's home, including property belonging to both Oppenneer and Slocum. They found more than 40 firearms, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, knives and other weapons They found restraints indicating that ""Oestrike held the victim, Brooke Slocum, in captivity there for a period of time before he murdered her,"" Wyoming Police Chief James E. Carmody said at a news conference Monday. A friend of the suspect, Andrew Weener, told CNN affiliate WOOD that Oestrike was interested in the medieval era and that it would not be uncommon for him to own weapons. ""The truth is that's what the medieval times were all about, so I can see how people would jump to that conclusion if they're not well-versed in history,"" Weener said. The FBI is involved in the investigation because of ""facts of the case that started to come to light"" and ""some unique characteristics of the case,"" David K. Porter, supervisory special agent of the FBI told CNN. Chief Carmody said that Oestrike often traveled to different states and investigators were sorting through financial and travel records to determine the purpose of his trips -- whether for his job, his church where he was a missionary, or otherwise. ""We want to be able walk away at the end of the day and say that we covered all of the things we need to cover and we're confident that there were no other victims and also no other suspects as well,"" Carmody said. Both Carmody and Wyoming Police Capt. Kim Koster confirmed that Craigslist was the initial point of contact for the couple and Oestrike. Representatives of Craigslist did not immediately respond to CNN's request Tuesday for comment. But as the investigation continues, two families in the Wyoming community some five miles from Grand Rapids are in mourning. ""We are thankful for the thoughts and prayers that we've received and in turn, have the deepest sympathy and sorrow for Brooke's family,"" the family of Oppenneer said in a statement.

"Fukushima, Japan (CNN) -- This is my first time visiting one of the most dangerous places on earth. The devastated Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant is isolated from the rest of Japan by police checkpoints, security fences, and barricades. We ride on a bus with a handful of journalists into the highly contaminated ""red zone"" -- the area closest to the plant. It remains a desolate wasteland three years after the meltdown, when Fukushima residents had just hours to grab their belongings and leave. They still haven't come back and likely won't be able to for a very, very long time. The only people regularly allowed into the red zone these days are workers with face masks and protective gear. We pass them as they labor in heavy clothing, braving the heat along the roadside, filling black bags with contaminated soil. Dead fields, once full of crops, are now filled with endless rows of those black bags. What makes this part of Fukushima such a frightening place is that you can't actually see the danger lurking everywhere. Radioactive water is leaking, soil is contaminated, and workers must brave dangerous conditions as they try to slowly and painstakingly take the power plant apart -- a process expected to take decades. Impact underestimated? The true scope of the contamination is a subject of debate, with a research team from Fukushima University recently releasing a study that claims the plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) grossly underestimated the amount of radioactive poison cesium-137 released into the environment. Exposure can heighten the risk of cancer. The team's report says cesium spewed into the air then fell into the water. TEPCO acknowledges it's impossible to know for sure how much cesium was released, but the company based its estimate on their best information. Contaminated fish is a huge concern, considering seafood is a staple of the Japanese diet. Researchers told me they don't believe the risk extends far beyond Japan and the North Pacific Ocean, even though small traces of radioactive ocean water have been detected as far away as Canada. The amounts detected so far are not high enough to cause any harm to humans. Conditions inside the Fukushima plant, though, are extremely dangerous. I had to wear layers of protective gear and a Geiger counter, to detect radiation. My shoes were wrapped in plastic to prevent spreading any radiation from contaminated floors. The plant has thousands of times more radiation than was in the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Outside, I saw the mangled metal piled up near buildings along the coast that bore the brunt of the 2011 tsunami. It sent a 50-foot wall of water crashing into the power plant. Inside, I watched workers remove a fuel rod in reactor 4. It is slow, grueling work in a reactor that is fully intact. Reactors 1, 2, and 3 melted down and the extensive damage there makes the process even more difficult. It will take decades and billions of dollars to make this place safe again. I saw the control room where workers scribbled notes on the walls after the power went out. The protective gear I was wearing got increasingly hot and uncomfortable as sweat poured down my back and condensation clouded the view through my visor. I can only imagine what it's like for the workers who wear this gear everyday while they work tirelessly to contain this slow-burning disaster. After leaving Fukushima Daiichi, I felt great relief as I was scanned for radiation exposure and none was detected. But as I rode on the bus out of the red zone, I also felt great sadness for the tens of thousands of people who once lived there. I imagined how powerless I would feel if it was my house or business sitting empty and falling into disrepair, not knowing if it would ever be safe to go home again.

"(CNN) -- Women are not powerless. Look at Nigeria. It's impossible not to be outraged by the capture of hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls by a terrorist group, and by the inexcusable delay in pursuing the armed men who took them. For women, in particular, the continuing drama has ignited a particularly powerful response. Women in many countries are vulnerable and victimized, but they are fighting back in unexpected places with the built-up fury of long held frustration. And they are getting results. Women are no longer powerless. Let there be no doubt: The reason the United States is sending help, Nigeria is accepting it and the entire world is paying attention is that the women of Nigeria demanded it. Nigerian women from the town of Chibok in the northeastern Borno state, the mothers, sisters, relatives and friends of the schoolgirls, launched their protests and set off the #BringBackOurGirls campaign that swept away weeks of international apathy. At a rally in Abuja, one woman held up a sign that read ""Can Anyone Hear Me?"" The long-delayed answer was a most emphatic ""Yes,"" which resonated across the oceans and echoed in the Nigerian presidential palace. Sure, the decisions are mostly up to male politicians, but in Washington, all the women members of the Senate, 20 of them, signed a letter to the president of the United States demanding a firm response. They did it without hesitation and without regard to political affiliation. The tragedy of the Nigerian girls was grotesquely highlighted in a video by a laughing Abubakr Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram. He declared ""Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell. I will sell women."" The revolting message encapsulated the distilled essence of women's plight in many corners of the world. And the response shows a phenomenon of both spontaneous and organized pushback from women's groups, from the millions of men who join them, and from the forces that social media can unleash across cyberspace. It is a movement that begins with the grassroots, moves into cyberspace and powers its way into the halls of power. Women have had enough. There is a reason that Malala Yousefzai has become a major international figure, a hero especially to women. It is, of course, about her bravery. Gunmen belonging to the Pakistani Taliban boarded the bus that was bringing the 14-year-old champion of girls' education and her friends from school. They shot her in the face. The Taliban oppose girls' education with that obsessive fervor displayed by the most radical Islamist groups, who want to take all Muslims back to the 7th century. They could not kill her and they could no silence her. Instead, they made her stronger, and they made her voice louder. In Afghanistan, when the Taliban came to power, one of its first acts was to shut down women's schools and ban women from universities. They did it under the guise of enforcing Islamic rules. Religious pretexts are common. But they are nothing more than an excuse. Like the Taliban, Boko Haram finds it particularly offensive that girls should receive an education. Shenkau appears on the latest video holding his AK-47, offering his considered advice. ""Girls should go and get married,"" he said, adding he would give them in marriage ""at the age of 9""...at the age of 12, ""because they are our slaves."" It's no wonder frustration is boiling over. Consider the recent news from Indonesia's Aceh province, where a woman was raped by eight men as punishment for having an affair. Now an official Shariah court has sentenced her to a humiliating public caning. Women are fed up. And it's not all about the work of Muslim extremists. In late 2012, emotions boiled over in India after the horrific gang rape of a student riding a city bus in Mumbai. The woman came to be known as Nirbhaya, which means ""the fearless one,"" in Hindi. Nirbhaya, who had left home to study physiotherapy, had plans to show the Indian people that a woman could realize her dreams. She was planning to give free health care to the poor. Instead, she died at 23, when six men on the bus she took with her boyfriend attacked her with such brutality that she died from internal injuries. Nirbhaya shook India's women. She jolted the country. In massive demonstrations Indian women joined by thousands of men demanded the government take action to stop the epidemic of rape. The world was horrified. The government vowed to act, but there is much left to be done in a country dominated by men on all spheres of society. Women endure the brunt of the worst aspects of repression and exploitation. As many as 30 million people are slaves today. Most of them are sex slaves working in brothels and enduring other forms of captivity. And 98% of the sex slaves are women and girls. Cases like the Nigerian girls, still unaccounted for, and millions sold into bondage are the most urgent, the most dramatic. But they are only a part of the problem. They are so outrageous, so offensive, that they leave no room for moral equivocation. Just a few days ago, the world was barely paying attention to Nigeria's abducted schoolgirls. Today, the whole world is watching, help is on the way. That is what the women of Nigeria have accomplished -- not quite what Boko Haram had in mind.","Frida Ghitis: Women of Nigeria got the world to pay attention to mass kidnapping of girls .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China, the world's largest tobacco consumer, is aiming to ban indoor smoking in public areas by the end of the year. About one in three cigarettes smoked in the world is in China, according to the World Health Organization. And more than half of Chinese men smoke, according to the Global Adult Tobacco Survey in 2010. Although the nation's health ministry issued guidelines in 2011 to ban smoking in places like hotels and restaurants, they haven't been ""strictly enforced,"" according to Xinhua, China's state-run news agency. The China's National Health and Family Commission is now working on a tobacco control law with clear punishments, according to Xinhua. The country's health authorities estimate over a million deaths from tobacco-related diseases every year. The WHO warns that if tobacco use is not decreased in China, these deaths will increase to 3 million by 2050. Last month, Chinese government officials were told not to smoke in public places such as hospitals, public transport or schools to set a good example for the public. The latest moves by the Chinese government on tobacco are ""hopeful,"" said Dr. Judith Mackay, the senior adviser at the World Lung Foundation, who examines tobacco issues in China. About 32 Chinese cities have passed their own rules to restrict public smoking, she added. ""China stands on its own in the magnitude of the problem,"" said Mackay. ""Unless there is change in China, we won't proceed further in reducing the tobacco epidemic in the world."" Tobacco use in China has far-reaching consequences, she said. ""This isn't a health problem. It's a huge economic problem. There's all these things ranging from medical and health care costs, the costs to the families and there's the cost of secondhand smoke.""","China moves to ban public indoor smoking by end of 2014 .

"London (CNN) -- The courtroom claim that Rebekah Brooks, a protege of global media baron Rupert Murdoch's, and Andy Coulson, a former spin doctor for British Prime Minister David Cameron, had a six-year affair has set British media abuzz. The two are accused of charges including conspiring to hack voicemails and conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office. Brooks also faces a charge of perverting the course of justice. Both deny wrongdoing. Their trial at the Old Bailey in London has gripped the British press -- and the prosecution's claim Thursday that the two had a clandestine affair made the front pages of half a dozen national newspapers Friday. Several quoted at length from a letter allegedly written by Brooks as Coulson tried to end their relationship and read out by prosecution lawyer Andrew Edis to the court. Reportedly found on a computer seized from Brooks' home, it said, ""The fact is that you are my very best friend. I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you. ... In fact without our relationship in my life, I am really not sure how I will cope."" The Mirror called it a ""hacking bombshell,"" saying the court was ""told of gushing love letter from ex-News of the World editor."" The Independent headlined its story ""The affair they didn't expose,"" a reference to the tabloid newspapers' history of revealing other people's cheating. It's not clear whether Coulson ever saw the letter, the media reports said. The Guardian cited Edis as saying the jury needed to know about the secret relationship because the two are accused of conspiring together. It revealed how close they were and the level of trust they had, he said. The affair ran from 1998 to 2004, the newspapers cited the prosecution as saying, during some of which time both Brooks and Coulson were married to other people. Brooks and Coulson, both former editors of the now-defunct News of the World, were both formerly close to Cameron. Coulson, who edited the News of the World from 2003 to 2007, went on to become Cameron's director of communications before resigning early in 2011. Brooks, who also edited The Sun, was a friend of the prime minister and his wife. Brooks, formerly chief executive of News of the World's parent company, News International, resigned from that role in the wake of public anger over claims of hacking by the newspaper's employees. Three former journalists who worked at the News of the World have pleaded guilty to phone hacking, British media reported Wednesday, citing the prosecution in the case. The three who pleaded guilty are Neville Thurlbeck, James Weatherup and Greg Miskiw.","Former News of the World editors are on trial in voicemail-hacking scandal .

"(CNN) -- As Superstorm Sandy ravaged New York, Glenda Moore drove frantically across Staten Island in an attempt to get her sons to safety. Instead, Moore found herself and her boys -- Connor, four and Brandon, two -- caught in the full fury of the storm. Buffeted by torrential rains and winds of up to 90 miles per hour, her Ford Explorer plunged into a hole. According to the account she would later give police, Moore carried her sons to a nearby tree, gripping branches along with her boys as she tried to shelter them from the storm surge. She told police they clung together for hours, before Moore managed to make her way to a nearby property, and pleaded to be let inside. But according to her police account, rather than sheltering the desperate strangers, the occupant refused to let them enter. In desperation, Moore told police she then went to the back of the house, and tried to break in using a flower pot, but was unable to do so. As the storm raged on, her sons were swept away by floodwaters. The bodies of the boys were found near each other Thursday, about a quarter of a mile from where Moore last held them. In the end, NY marathon didn't feel right . Relatives said Moore was too distraught to speak with CNN. Meanwhile, public anger has been directed at the homeowner who allegedly failed to help Moore and her children. The man, who told CNN's Gary Tuchman that his name is Alan but did not want his full name used, disputed Moore's account, saying he saw only a man outside. ""He didn't come to the door... he must have been standing at the bottom of the stairs,"" said the man. ""He took a concrete flower pot... and threw [it] through the door."" The man at the door didn't ask to enter the house, he said, but instead asked him to come outside in order to help. ""What could I do to help him?"" he asked. ""I had a pair of shorts on with flip-flops."" The man told CNN he sat up for the rest of the night, with his back against the door in the kitchen. He said he did not know the fate of the children. Told that their bodies had been found, he said the deaths were a tragedy, but implied that the woman was at fault. ""It's unfortunate. She shouldn't have been out though. You know, it's one of those things,"" he said. He said there was nothing he could have done. ""I'm not a rescue worker ... If I would have been outside, I would have been dead."" The man said he had given his account to police. Legal experts consulted by CNN said that no crime would have been committed by a failure to render assistance. CNN's Gary Tuchman contributed to this report.","Two brothers, four and two, died after being swept away by floodwaters during Sandy .

"(CNN) -- The Iraqi Prime Minister's coalition has won the most seats in Parliament, despite the cancellation of ballots from 300 polling stations, election officials said Monday. Votes in those stations were nullified because of attempted tampering and inconsistencies, the nation's Independent High Electoral Commission said. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's State of Law coalition won 92 out of 328 parliamentary seats in last month's election, far more than any other political bloc, according to the commission. His main rivals finished with fewer than 30 seats, putting the Shiite Prime Minister far ahead of his competition but short of a majority. Though the win improves his chances of a third term, his coalition must reach out to other blocs to gain enough support. Al-Maliki faced fierce opposition amid the worst sectarian violence in more than five years. ""As the people of Iraq have now spoken, I call upon all elected representatives to work together for the future of Iraq,"" said Nickolay Mladenov, the top United Nations official in Iraq. Last year was the deadliest in Iraq since 2008, with more than 8,800 people killed, most of them civilians, according to the United Nations. Tensions are fueled by widespread discontent among Sunnis, who say they are marginalized by the Shiite-led government and unfairly targeted by brutal security tactics. Some 277 political entities across Iraq contested for 328 seats of the Iraqi Council of Representatives, the country's parliament. There were 9,032 candidates. ""Today's announcement is a testament to the courage and resilience of the Iraqi people, and another milestone in the democratic development of Iraq,"" the United States Embassy said after the results were announced. ""As the process moves toward government formation, we encourage all political entities to conduct talks in a spirit of cooperation and respect for the will of the voters."" Iraqis voted April 30 in their first nationwide polls since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. forces. ""Given the challenges confronting Iraq, it is essential that a new government and its leaders seek to unite the country through the formation of a new government that is supported by all Iraqi communities and that is prepared to advance tangible and implementable programs,"" said Bernadette Meehan, spokeswoman for the National Security Council.

"(CNN) -- Following last week's Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 disaster, the carrier says it will offer full refunds to travelers who wish to cancel their tickets, while those wanting to postpone their flights can do so without penalty. ""In light of the MH17 incident, Malaysia Airlines will be waiving any change fees for passengers who wish to make changes to their itinerary to any MH destinations,"" said the airline in a statement. This includes non-refundable tickets. The airline says passengers have until Thursday, July 24 to cancel or change their tickets, valid for travel until December 31, 2014. Meanwhile, the airline announced that it's retiring the MH17 flight number out of respect for the 298 people killed on the Boeing 777, believed shot down by a missile in rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine last Thursday. As of July 25, the new flight number for Malaysia Airlines' Amsterdam (AMS) -- Kuala Lumpur (KUL) service will be MH19. Though such practices are common after a fatal airline accident, they're not mandatory. Shortly after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing in March, the carrier renamed the flight MH318. ""There are no changes to the frequency of our services and we will continue to operate daily services between Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur,"" said the airline. Singapore Airlines apologizes for airspace tweet/FB post . Since the MH17 tragedy, all flights operated by Malaysia Airlines that passed through Ukrainian airspace have been rerouted. Other airlines have taken similar precautions. ""The usual flight route was earlier declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organization,"" said Malaysia Airlines. ""International Air Transportation Association has stated that the airspace the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions."" Rival airline Singapore Airlines apologized on Sunday for what many social media users said was an insensitive series of tweets and Facebook postings relating to its own flight path. ""Customers may wish to note that Singapore Airlines flights are not using Ukraine airspace,"" said the post, which appeared on the airline's Facebook page and Twitter account on July 18. Responding to criticism of the post on its Facebook page, the airline responded: ""We are aware that our Facebook and Twitter update on Friday morning may have come across as insensitive to some. ""The post was in response to many requests from our customers who had asked for information about our flight routes for their upcoming flights with us. ""We recognize that the information could have been better communicated and we sincerely apologize if it had offended our customers and anyone else in the online community.""","Malaysia Airlines offers full refunds, waives change fees following MH17 crash .

"London (CNN) -- Chasing stories on soccer star David Beckham for rival papers put a strain on the relationship between former newspaper chief Rebekah Brooks and ex-Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson, a court heard Wednesday. Brooks, Coulson and five others are on trial facing phone hacking charges, including conspiracy to intercept the voice mails of high-profile figures in Britain. All seven deny wrongdoing. Brooks, the former chief executive of Rupert Murdoch's UK newspaper arm, News International, and onetime editor of the News of the World and The Sun newspapers, has denied having a long-running affair with Coulson but said they were close. Continuing her defense testimony Wednesday, Brooks told the court how her personal relationship with Coulson affected their professional relationship when she was editor of The Sun and he was editor of sister paper -- yet fierce rival -- News of the World. Coulson became editor of the News of the World after Brooks. ""It was our own fault complicating the friendship,"" Brooks told London's Old Bailey court, saying they had previously been good at keeping a ""Chinese wall"" between the two newspapers. She said their professional relationship became especially strained in April 2004 when the News of the World broke a story about an alleged affair by Beckham. It had put out a ""spoof"" edition on a Saturday evening, and The Sun would not know about the story until it reached newsstands. Other newspapers such as The Daily Mail and Daily Mirror, however, learned about the story before Brooks, who said: ""I was not best pleased about that situation."" She told the jury she knew Beckham and his wife, Victoria, socially and would occasionally go out to dinner with them to try to encourage the sports star to write for the paper. ""Andy would have known that I had a direct line to the Beckhams,"" she said. When asked if she would have hesitated in stealing the story, she replied, ""No, probably not."" Letter read aloud in court . Allegations that the two defendants had a clandestine affair emerged earlier in the trial when the prosecution read out a letter written by Brooks to Coulson, a former communications director for British Prime Minister David Cameron, as he tried to end their relationship. The prosecution said the affair ran from 1998 to 2004 -- during some of which time both Brooks and Coulson were married to others -- and it revealed the level of trust between the defendants. Testifying in her defense Friday, Brooks said there were periods of physical intimacy at that time, including from 2003 to 2005, when her marriage to actor Ross Kemp was breaking up, and again briefly in 2006. Brooks also told the court Wednesday about how she learned while on vacation in Italy in 2006 that police had raided the News of the World offices and royal editor Clive Goodman had been arrested, accused of intercepting voice mails of members of the royal household. She described initial confusion about the allegations, saying she almost certainly would have called Coulson, who was then editor of the News of the World, to find out what was going on. ""It was a huge news story if nothing else,"" she said. Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire was also arrested on phone hacking charges. Brooks said there was a ""certain amount of grumpiness"" from the Sun team in reaction to the allegations at the News of the World. ""They (the Sun team) felt they were cheating by intercepting voice mails,"" she said. Brooks said police later told her that Mulcaire had hacked her own phone for 18 months. She said she was ""pretty shocked"" about being hacked and ""certainly surprised"" because she had a personal PIN code and thought it would be secure. In a raid on Mulcaire's house, police found notebooks with reference to Kemp, Brooks' former husband. She said she met with police because ""being a journalist by nature,"" she wanted to find out as much as possible about how the investigation into the News of the World was going. They gave her no indication at that stage they were investigating any wrongdoing at the News of the World during her editorship, Brooks said. She told the court she later agreed with senior management at The Sun not to pursue a case against Mulcaire over the hacking of her phone. Mulcaire and Goodman were jailed after pleading guilty to phone hacking in 2007. A job offer and 'a delicate situation' Brooks told the court she believed a line had been drawn under the phone hacking scandal after Goodman and Mulcaire were sentenced. She had lunch with Goodman shortly after his release from prison in April 2007 and offered him a job because he was taking News International to an employment tribunal over his dismissal while he was in prison. She told the court he was alleging that other people at News International knew he was accessing voice mails, that others knew about the practice and were involved in it. Brooks said she had ""a very sound belief that there was no foundation to these allegations."" ""It was a delicate situation. Clive was angry he had been dismissed. He felt he had been unfairly treated by the company,"" she said. Goodman did not take up the job offer. Hacking of missing schoolgirl's voice mails . On Tuesday, Brooks denied ever having approved the practice of phone hacking while editor of the News of the World. She said she was aware of the possibility that some voice mails could be accessed by the late 1990s. But asked by her defense attorney if she was ever asked to sanction the practice while editor of the News of the World, from 2000 to 2003, she said: ""No."" Questioning focused Tuesday on the News of the World's actions in the case of 13-year-old Milly Dowler, a British schoolgirl who went missing and was later found murdered in 2002. The News of the World was closed down in July 2011 amid public outrage over allegations that its employees hacked the young girl's voice mail messages while she was missing. Brooks said the first time she heard the newspaper had accessed Dowler's voice mails was on July 4, 2011, and she was shocked. She was on vacation during the week that the News of the World hacked Dowler's phone, she testified, and it was not brought to her attention. Her then-deputy, Coulson, was editing the paper that week, she said. Last week, Brooks was cleared of one of two charges of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office, at the judge's direction. She still faces two charges of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, one of conspiracy to hack voice mail messages and the remaining charge of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office.

"London (CNN) -- The United States, the European Union and Japan have filed a trade case over China's export restrictions on rare earth minerals that are crucial for the production of many high-tech devices. What are rare earth minerals? Rare earths are 17 minerals with magnetic and conductive properties that are used in most of today's electronic devices, including flat-screen televisions, smart phones, hybrid cars and weapons. The minerals include cerium, neodymium, dysprosium, tungsten and molybdenum. Tungsten, for example, is used in electronics, automotive, aerospace and medical technologies. China produces 91% of the world's tungsten. Molybdenum is a metallic element used for filaments in light bulbs. China produces 36% of the world's molybdenum. They are not actually ""rare,"" and can be found in other countries -- including the U.S. -- but they are difficult to mine safely. About a third of the world's rare earth deposits are in China but the country controls around 97% of production, in part due to its lower labor costs and less stringent environmental regulations. Rare earth minerals' importance and limited supplies have created friction between China and the U.S., among other countries, for years. What is the issue? China's dominance in the industry has led to suggestions it can be used as part of a trade war with the U.S. and Europe. In 2010, a report commissioned by the U.S. Congress found China's dominant position in production could have major implications for the U.S. Department of Defense. In June that year, China tightened export restrictions on the materials by raising export taxes and reducing the amount it can send overseas. It reduced the quota for Chinese-owned companies by 32% but by 54% for companies with foreign investment. In December, it further reduced quotas. It also temporarily halted shipments of rare earths to Japan, prompting a sharp spike in prices of the minerals. What has happened now? The trade case by the U.S, European Union and Japan accuses China of increasing prices outside China while lowering them within the country, creating unfair advantages. The U.S. also accuses China of hoarding the minerals for its own use. The U.S. aims to pressure China to lift export limits. China has defended its actions by saying they are in line with World Trade Organization regulations, and that the restrictions are due to environmental concerns. Why does it matter? Rare earths minerals are hugely important to the technology industry, and the U.S. and the European Union are fierce in their language against China. According to a European Commission statement, restrictions ""violate international trade rules"" and hurt producers of car components and computers, among other industries. The EU said it has raised the issue with China repeatedly over the past years without success. U.S. president Barack Obama said: ""We have got to take control of our energy future and we can't let that energy industry take root in some other country because they were allowed to break the rules."" What will happen next? The European Union, U.S. and Japan are all making requests for consultations with the Chinese, as part of the WTO dispute process. If agreement is not reached within 60 days, the issue can get kicked up to a WTO settlement panel. Whatever the outcome, it could take some time: A similar dispute over restrictions on raw materials was settled this year -- in favor of the EU, U.S. and Mexico -- three years after it was launched.","The U.S., European Union and Japan have filed a trade case over China's export restrictions on rare earth minerals .

"(CNN) -- A California judge ruled this week that several of the state's teacher tenure, dismissal and layoff laws are unconstitutional. The decision sparked a nationwide debate, as the case gets at one of this country's core questions: What's the best way to educate children? On one side of the debate are teachers and unions, which say tenure's job protections provide stability, and creative and academic freedoms. On the other side, some administrators and others argue such protections give bad teachers a free ride at the expense of students -- particularly poor students and students of color. Somewhere in the middle of the debate are politicians and educators who've seized on the judge's ruling as a call to action to fix a broken public teaching system. ""At the end of the day what everyone has common interest in -- the common goal -- is to increase public confidence in public education. We want great public schools and we need great public school teachers,"" Education Secretary Arne Duncan told CNN. ""There's one common enemy and that's academic failure -- and if we continue to fight silly fights everybody loses."" Here's a look at what the California ruling could mean: . ... For teachers . Teachers in the country's most populous state are evaluated for tenure in less than two years -- a law the judge found to be unconstitutional. ""Great teachers absolutely deserve to have their jobs protected ... but it's a ridiculously short period of time,"" said John Deasy, superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District. He suggested evaluating teachers after 3-5 years. ""Allow us to have a period of time to work and support teachers before we make this important decision, and then celebrate that decision,"" Deasy said. For their part, unions aren't necessarily against the idea of delaying tenure decisions, but they have criticized the judge for tossing the good along with the bad. They warn the ruling could have a cooling effect on teachers, nationwide, who want to experiment in the classroom. ""The judge should not have thrown out the rights of every teacher, because good teachers need to be creative. They need to take risks. They need to actually do things where they may stumble and fall,"" said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""But what this decision did is (it) said to teachers all across the country, 'Don't speak up anymore -- don't try new things.'"" ... For students . In his ruling, Los Angeles County Judge Rolf M. Treu cited evidence that, he wrote, ""shocks the conscience."" He discussed experts called in the case who testified about the scope and significance of bad teachers. Between 1-3% of teachers in California are ""grossly ineffective,"" he wrote, which translates into an actual number of teachers of between 2,750-8,250. A single year with a ""grossly ineffective teacher costs students $1.4 million in lifetime earnings per classroom,"" Treu said. The judge also found fault with the price of getting rid of bad teachers, saying the process could take up to 10 years and cost between $50,000-$450,000. Clearly, students win if bad teachers are replaced with great ones. And no one is arguing in favor of protecting poor teachers. ""If a teacher cannot teach, they should be fired, effectively and quickly,"" Weingarten said. But Michelle Rhee -- a former Washington, D.C., schools chancellor -- argues that unions have lost sight of what's most important in the classroom. Rhee is a supporter of Students Matter, the nonprofit that helped nine students file the case in California. ""The union's job is to protect the rights, privileges, and pay of their members. They want their members to be able to keep their jobs regardless, and what this judge is saying is that we have to look out for the interests of children, first and foremost -- that we have to ensure that there's a high quality teacher in front of every child every single day,"" Rhee said. ... For parents . Ben Smith is a father of five in Los Gatos, California. One child is in college; the rest are in public schools. Smith was pleased by the judge's ruling this week and likes that it has sparked a conversation about education. He paid close attention to the ""last in, first out"" policy, another one of the laws Treu found to be unconstitutional. ""No matter how gifted the junior teacher, and no matter how grossly ineffective the senior teacher, the junior gifted one, who all parties agree is creating a positive atmosphere for his/ her students, is separated from them and a senior grossly ineffective one who all parties agree is harming the students entrusted to her/ him is left in place,"" the judge wrote. Smith, who works in the tech community, similarly believes the policy is indefensible. ""We're big believers in a meritocracy,"" he said. ""Having an education system that's counter to that -- where time and place is rewarded versus performance -- is not something that's consistent with the way we look at the world."" The flip side of a meritocracy, however -- Smith said -- is the need for greater compensation for the teachers doing a great job. ""People have to be rewarded for innovation, rewarded for efforts to make the classroom a better environment. We can't just remove (job) security and don't do anything else,"" he said. It was a point that Secretary Duncan also made. ""No teacher ever goes into education to make a million dollars. Teachers are the most altruistic people you're ever going to meet,"" he said. ""We need to recognize and reward the talent that is changing students' lives every single day."" ... And for the rest of the country . In many ways, the California case is unique and cannot be easily replicated in others states. For one, California is an outlier when it comes to teacher tenure. In his decision, Judge Treu wrote that 32 states have a three-year evaluation period, while nine states have a four- or five-year period. California is one of only five states with a period of two years or less, he wrote. The state is also an outlier when it comes to the policy of ""last in, first out."" Twenty states allow for seniority to be considered among other factors, and 19 leave the layoff criteria to district discretion, Treu wrote, stressing that California is just one of 10 states that say seniority can be the sole factor in a layoff decision, or that it must be considered. The judge based his decision on the California Constitution, which could also complicate efforts to take the case to other states. Still, Felix Schein, a spokesman for Students Matters, says that's exactly what the group is looking to do. Conversations are happening in a dozen states with stakeholders interested in pursuing litigation, he said, mentioning New York, Connecticut, Maryland and Minnesota, in particular. ""We're weighing: 1) Do you have these laws at all? 2) What's the constitutional framework? 3) Is there evidence that the laws aren't working?"" Schein said. His group's success in other states will ultimately depend on how the California case holds up under appeal. The judge has ordered a stay of his decision, pending such an appeal. But in California, some educators say they don't want to wait. ""I hope what happens is that we form a coalition of strong labor leaders and our legislators and immediately get to rewriting laws that are just and legal,"" said Deasy, with the Los Angeles Unified School District. ""These laws have been found to be unconstitutional. I think that it's incumbent upon us to work as quickly as possible."" CNN's Jamie Gumbrecht, Athena Jones, Michael Martinez and Christine Romans contributed to this report.","Unions say tenure's job protections provide stability and necessary freedoms .
Other argue such protections give bad teachers a free ride at the expense of students .

"(CNN) -- Just when you think we're becoming civilized and smarter about our knowledge of gender, you get a stupid decision such as the one from the Iowa Supreme Court and you wonder whether sanity will ever reign. I thought we had decided the issue that men's ""uncontrollable lust"" was indeed controllable, and if they didn't control it, they were going to be charged and convicted of sexual harassment, rape, frottage -- well you get the idea. So now the all-male Iowa Supreme Court has said, albeit in a new way, that men are so controlled by their gonads that they can fire an employee at will for being able to incite attraction, sex, love, whatever. No matter that she is just going about her job or being a stellar employee; if she's got a cute butt or a nicely turned nose, her job is history. If you haven't heard, the court stood by an earlier ruling that a Fort Dodge dentist acted legally when he fired his dental assistant -- even while acknowledging she had been an excellent employee for 10 years -- because he and his wife were afraid he would try to start an affair with her and ruin their marriage. The employee had sued for sex discrimination. But the court said firing an employee for being too attractive, despite no inappropriate behavior on her part, is not sex discrimination because gender is not the issue. Feelings are. Don't tell me this has nothing to do with gender. I don't see women firing men because they can't control themselves. Is this because they don't have manly kind of urges? Or is it because they don't have access to the same excuses, such as uncontrollable attraction and desire? Either way, it's a gender issue. And if a woman is denied employment because of her gender, that is a protected legal status. But the Iowa Supreme Court guys didn't see it that way. By the way, Iowa women: Is this enough to motivate you to get some women on your Supreme Court? The guys saw the issue, at least in part, as protecting the institution of marriage rather than an infringement on a woman's right to work. Let's be real honest here: If the only way this man and woman could protect their marriage is to remove an attractive woman from their midst, then I'd say this marriage has a lot more problems than just an attractive dental assistant. What is this dentist's wife going to do -- put blinders on her husband like a race horse? Do employees have to pass an ugliness test? Do they pick the couples in their extended friendship network according to whether the wife is curvaceous? Women have been at risk because of their looks for a long time. There are online sites where women are evaluated like so many heifers on whether they are "" Hot or Not?"" Words such as ""dog"" ""sow"" ""and needing a ""paper bag over her head"" have been thrown at us as a part of male bravado. Beautiful women get cat-calls, sometimes really rude and threatening gestures and unwanted commentary on their looks. Talk about women being between a rock and a hard place. Insulted and not hired if they aren't attractive, fired if they are too attractive. Could someone tell us just exactly how we should look? More important, could we have some continuing education for the courts around the nation so that they realize looks are a gender issue -- and therefore protecting women from being fired because of them is appropriate. If another case like this goes through the judicial system, I hope a very different conclusion will be reached. Otherwise, all kinds of firings may arise that use this excuse to get rid of women employees. Why, this could even spread to the courts -- male judges might ban some women lawyers from presenting cases because, gosh darn it, they are just too lovely. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pepper Schwartz.","Iowa court rules it's not sex discrimination for a man to fire a woman because she's attractive .
Pepper Schwartz thought we're at the point that if a man can't control his lust, it's illegal .
Schwartz: Women are insulted, not hired if unattractive, fired if they are too pretty .
Saving your marriage by firing an employee for her looks is a gender issue, she says ."
"(CNN) -- Sanctions against Iran are illegal and are undermining international law, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in an exclusive, wide-ranging interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria. ""When it comes to sanctions, have they been successful so far? Sanctions first and foremost are illegal,"" he told Zakaria on Wednesday on the sidelines of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""And a Congress which claims to be making laws should not contravene international laws."" ""These sanctions translate into the weakening of the NPT (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons), the weakening of international laws and regulations. No other country can decide for another country."" Rouhani's comments follow the announcement of a bipartisan proposal in the U.S. Congress calling for new U.S. sanctions, with implementation delayed to allow negotiations to continue. A senior U.S. Senate aide told CNN this month that an informal count for the move had surpassed 75 votes -- more than enough for the Senate to override the presidential veto that Barack Obama has pledged would follow any such measure. ""We are not afraid of threats,"" Rouhani said. ""And the language of threats is ineffective when it comes to Iran. The language they need to choose should be a legal one, a respectful tone of voice when addressing the Iranian people. ... It benefits our region and the interests of other countries."" Suspicions about the U.S. The Iranian president suggested mistrust of the United States is deep-rooted, adding that ""with regards to the policies of various American administrations in the past 30 years,"" the Iranian public is ""very worried. ... They don't trust them."" Still, Rouhani said there is ""full readiness"" on the part of Iran ""to take the final step"" on the nuclear issue. Asked about President Obama's recent comment that he thought there was a no more than a 50-50 chance of completing a comprehensive agreement with Iran, rather than just the interim deal that was signed in November, Rouhani said that though the last step would be more difficult than the first, ""the conditions allow us to take the final step."" On Monday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said it was ""pleased"" to note that the implementation of the Joint Plan of Action had begun, including the halting of production of uranium enriched to 20%. It said the moves were ""an important development."" According to the U.S., under the deal, Iran must eliminate its stockpile of uranium that's enriched to higher levels, dismantle some of the infrastructure that makes enrichment possible, and allow a broader and more intrusive set of inspections of its nuclear programs. However, Rouhani insisted that Iran still had a right to peaceful nuclear technology, including enrichment, which he described as ""part and parcel of the inalienable rights of states."" ""It is part a part of our national pride, and nuclear technology has become indigenous,"" he said. ""And recently, we have managed to secure very considerable prowess with regards to the fabrication of centrifuges,"" he added, explaining that ""not under any circumstances"" would Iran destroy any of its existing centrifuges. Minister: U.S. mischaracterized deal . Rouhani's comments on the country's centrifuges came the same day as remarks by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggesting that the Obama administration had mischaracterized Iranian concessions. Speaking to CNN chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto, Zarif said: ""The White House version both underplays the concessions and overplays Iranian commitments."" He also reiterated Rouhani's insistence that Iran will not be dismantling its centrifuges. ""In the context of R&D and peaceful nuclear technology, we will not accept any limitations,"" Rouhani told Zakaria, arguing that Iran's need for medical isotopes necessitated a heavy water reactor. Critics worry that the Arak heavy water reactor could be used to produce plutonium, which has the potential to be used in a nuclear weapon. But Rouhani insisted it would be used for ""nuclear medicine,"" not nuclear weapons. ""We are standing on our own two feet. Iranian scientists have designed this. We have constructed it. It's nearly finished. So when it comes to medical concerns, we cannot accept limitations."" Rouhani also dismissed the possibility that Israel, which has been strongly critical of the agreement with Iran, would attempt a military strike against its nuclear facilities. ""Israel knows very well what the response would be. Israel knows well our regional capability,"" he said. ""When it comes to practice, the Israelis cannot do that. If they do such a crazy thing, our response will make them rue the day."" Iran and Syria . Rouhani was in Davos even as, on the other side of the country, talks continued on how to bring an end to Syria's civil war. Iran was invited to participate Sunday, but the invitation was rescinded after Syria's main opposition National Coalition threatened to boycott the talks. But while agreeing that other countries should come together to try to stop the conflict, Rouhani said elections were the key to resolving the issue. ""The Bashar al-Assad government has been there for some years now. It has been running the county for some years now,"" he said. ""And if the people have some grievances, they need to go through legal channels, engage in free elections, for everyone to find out what the people need."" ""All of us should ... work together to bring about appropriate conditions inside Syria and help with elections. Everyone should respect the vote of the Syrians. Whatever the Syrians say, that should be enough. If outside countries want to decide for Syria, they are wrong. It's impractical. It's illegal.""","""No other country can decide for another country,"" Iranian President says .
He says the Iranian public is ""very worried. ... They don't trust"" the United States .
Still, Rouhani says, Iran is ready ""to take the final step"" on the nuclear issue .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel is potentially just a week away from becoming only the third Formula One driver to win four consecutive world titles, but outside of the German's continued dominance the big talking point of Sunday's Korean Grand Prix was another ugly tire issue. For the second time this year, F1's official supplier Pirelli has been forced to explain a potentially dangerous blowout during a race. Several incidents at June's British Grand Prix forced the Italian company to strengthen its compounds amid threats of a driver strike if safety was not improved, and the issue has come to light again after Sergio Perez had to wrestle for control of his McLaren after the right-front tire fell to bits. ""I'd done 21 laps with that set, when, all of a sudden, the front-right just exploded, destroying the front win,"" said the Mexican, who also suffered blowouts at Silverstone in practice and during the race. ""It was lucky, because there weren't any other cars around me."" Pirelli motorsport director Paul Hembery defended the tires. ""It was a big flat spot that put a huge hole right the way through the tread. There's not a lot we can do about that one,"" said Hembery, whose firm will again be F1's sole supplier next year. ""It was a big lockup and he just burned this huge hole which lost air, and when tires do that, all sorts of things can happen. So we've absolutely no fears going forward."" Red Bull's Mark Webber, however, voiced his disapproval. ""The drivers aren't super important, it is what other people want,"" said the 37-year-old, whose race was ended when his car burst into flames after being hit by the Force India of Adrian Sutil. ""The tyres are wearing a lot and they also explode a bit, but that is for Pirelli to sort out,"" the Australian added. ""Pirelli will also put the puncture of Perez down to a lockup, but the reason the drivers are locking up is because there is no tread left."" Vettel was able to clinch his fourth successive race victory, avoiding the chaos and tense battles going on behind him despite twice being held up when the safety car was brought out after the Perez and Webber incidents. He led from pole position to notch up the 34th win of his career as he closes in on the 41 of Ayrton Senna, who is third on the all-time list. ""This track, it's known that the limit is the front-right (tire). We saw it the previous years, and basically it's good to have the team on the radio warning you -- because obviously you see what's going on, the tire grains immediately and then kind of stabilizes,"" said Vettel, who now has a 77-point lead over Fernando Alonso. ""But when it stops graining basically there's nothing left and that's quite dangerous because it's quite likely to have a big lockup. You have a flat spot, which could end with pitting the stint earlier than you want or having a tire puncture. ""So yeah, they were quite worried, similar to last year. I thought I had it more or less in control but obviously it's good to communicate."" The German will join Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher in the history books if he wins next weekend's Japanese Grand Prix and Alonso is no higher than ninth. The Spaniard finished sixth in Yeongam after tangling with Felipe Massa near the start -- while Alonso lost a place, his Ferrari teammate was left at the back of the field before battling back to claim ninth ahead of Perez. Vettel's main threats ended up being the Lotus duo Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean, who claimed second and third. Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg provided much of the day's entertainment with an impressive drive to take fourth place ahead of Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton, another driver to complain about the tires after losing 16 seconds in the space of just six laps. ""After the second safety car, we lost out in traction to the Sauber,"" said Hamilton, who dropped to fourth overall below Raikkonen. ""It was a nice battle with Fernando at the end, but it's hard to take when it's only for P5 or P6. It was just not a good race for us, but we have the chance to bounce back in Suzuka."" The 2008 world champion's teammate Nico Rosberg was seventh ahead of McLaren's Jenson Button, putting Mercedes a point behind second-placed Ferrari in the constructors' standings -- which Red Bull leads by 118 points. ""Vettel is a very long way off in terms of points, and we cannot expect miracles between now and the end of the championship,"" said Alonso, who had also criticized the tires following Saturday's qualifying. ""Second place in the constructors' championship is probably a more realistic target, but one thing is certain, we are not giving up now and we will give it our best shot right to the very end."" Vettel has won for the last three years in Korea and the previous race on the calendar, Singapore. He now heads to a Suzuka circuit where he has triumphed three of the last four times. ""The car is working ... it's on the edge, to be honest, more so than you would probably think from the outside, but it's obviously nice when you get the results like Singapore or this weekend,"" he said. ""I look forward to Japan because it's one of the nicest tracks of the whole season. It's the best track in the world, with the fans completely crazy in a positive way. ""They're big fans of motorsport, very passionate, so I'm very much looking forward to one of the highlights of the season.""","Pirelli defends its tires after Sergio Perez suffers dangerous blowout in Korea .
