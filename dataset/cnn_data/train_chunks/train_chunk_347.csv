"Baltimore (CNN) -- Onlookers laughed and did nothing to help as a man was beaten, stripped and robbed on the street in Baltimore. The attack, which police say happened on March 18 after St. Patrick's Day celebrations, was captured by at least two cameras. Video of it went viral. ""Not only did they rob him, but they attempted to strip him of his dignity. They tore his clothes off; they mocked him. That behavior just will not be tolerated,"" said Detective Nicole Monroe with the Baltimore police. Police say they have identified one suspect, but have made no arrests. They are not releasing the victim's identity except to say he was a 31-year-old man from Arlington, Virginia. The victim was on the way to his hotel from a downtown Baltimore club when he was attacked, according to a police report. The man had been drinking. He told police he couldn't recall exactly what happened, but the videos fill in the blanks. In them, a man is seen standing, unsteadily, against a row of mailboxes. A crowd starts to gather and women dance suggestively against him. Someone notices his watch and a hand seems to grab something from one of the man's front pockets. He pursues the supposed thief and is punched in the face. The man falls over backward and his head hits the sidewalk so hard it can be heard on the video. ""Smackdown!"" someone yells. His pockets are rifled and his clothes pulled off. Some people can be heard laughing. No one comes to his aid. According to the police report, the man lost his Tag Heuer watch, which he valued at $1,300, his iPhone and car key. CNN showed video of the attack to a number of people in Baltimore to gauge their response. ""That's pretty sad,"" said Finley George of Virginia, who was visiting the city with family. ""I mean he obviously didn't do anything to anybody. They just got up on him and started beating him."" CNN's Dugald McConnell contributed to this report.","The victim reports his watch, iPhone and car key are stolen .

"(CNN) -- Mexican pop singer Kalimba was deported from the United States to Mexico after U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested him for an immigration violation, state media reported. He was arrested in El Paso, Texas, Thursday afternoon, U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Ramiro Cordero said. On Wednesday, a judge in the state of Quintana Roo issued an arrest warrant for the singer, whose full name is Kalimba Kadjhali Marichal Ibar, according to the state-run Notimex news agency. Prosecutors allege that he raped a teen there in December. In an interview with CNN affiliate Televisa earlier this month, Kalimba denied the accusations and said he had not attacked anyone. ""There are many details that are very easy to criticize, judge or imagine,"" he said, but he urged the public to use logic when considering the case, which has received extensive coverage in Mexican media. A Mexican Attorney General's Office spokesman told Notimex on Thursday that the singer would be transported soon to Quintana Roo. Wednesday's arrest warrant was issued a month after a 17-year-old girl was allegedly raped in a hotel there, Notimex reported. In the Televisa interview, Kalimba declined to answer a question about whether he had sexual relations with the teen's consent. ""That I must testify before the prosecution and not on television,"" he said. The teen's uncle has asked a state human rights commission to help protect the family, which he said has been demonized since reporting the rape allegations to authorities, according to Notimex. The 28-year-old singer is a former member of the group OV7.

"(CNN) -- In 1907, Congress banned corporate contributions to federal candidates in the wake of the robber baron-era scandals. In 1947, the ban was formally applied to corporate expenditures and extended to cover labor unions. In 1974, Congress enacted limits on individual contributions to federal candidates and political committees in the wake of the Watergate scandal. In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court in the Citizens United case declared the corporate expenditure ban unconstitutional, holding that independent expenditures could not be constitutionally limited in federal elections, and implicitly that corporations could give unlimited amounts to other groups to spend, as long as the expenditures were made independently from the supported candidate. Subsequently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in the SpeechNow case held that the limits on individual contributions to groups that made independent expenditures were unconstitutional. Thus was born the super PAC. And thus was born the national campaign finance scandals that are unfolding daily in the 2012 elections. Super PACs are federally registered political action committees that raise unlimited contributions from the super rich, corporations, labor unions and other entities and spend these funds to make ""independent"" expenditures in federal elections. They are an unmitigated disaster for the American people. A recent study by Demos and the U.S. Public Interest Group found that, as Politico reported, ""Super PACs raised about $181 million in the last two years -- with roughly half of it coming from fewer than 200 super-rich people."" The study also found that 93% of the itemized contributions raised by super PACs came in contributions of $10,000 or more, with more than half of this money coming from just 37 people who each gave $500,000 or more. Super PACs are a game for millionaires and billionaires. They are a game for corporations and other wealthy interests. Meanwhile, citizens are pushed to the sidelines to watch the corruption of our democracy. In the 2012 presidential election, an even more insidious version of the super PAC was born -- the candidate-specific super PAC. Every significant presidential campaign has had a super PAC -- created and run by close associates of the candidate -- that raises unlimited contributions to spend only to support that presidential candidate. Presidential candidate-specific super PACs are simply vehicles for the presidential candidates and their supporters to circumvent the limits on contributions to candidates enacted to prevent corruption. Most of the super PAC money has been spent on attack ads. We already have seen Sheldon Adelson and his wife give $10 million to the presidential super PAC supporting Newt Gingrich. One couple! $10 million! The claim that these presidential super PACs are operating ""independently"" from the presidential candidates, as is required by law, is absurd and has no credibility. Last week, President Barack Obama reversed course and agreed to send Cabinet members, White House staff and campaign officials to speak at and participate in fundraising events for Priorities USA Action, the allegedly ""independent"" super PAC supporting Obama's re-election. Days later, Mitt Romney's campaign announced that senior Romney campaign aides would do the same and appear and speak at fundraising events for Restore Our Future, Romney's allegedly ""independent"" super PAC. Sound independent? According to the Supreme Court's view, a corporation that spends $30 million to elect a senator will not be able to buy corrupting influence over the senator's positions because the corporation has not ""coordinated"" its expenditures with the senator. Democracy 21 believes these super PACs are indeed engaging in illegally coordinated activities and is requesting the Justice Department to investigate. Super PACs corrupt our political system in two ways. First, super PACs allow a relatively few super-rich individuals and other wealthy interests to have greatly magnified and undue influence over the results of our elections. Second, super PACs allow the super rich and wealthy interests to buy influence over government decisions, in the event the candidate wins. The Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case that unleashed this is built entirely on a fiction: that ""independent"" expenditures by corporations cannot have a corrupting influence on federal officeholders. This is fantasy, not reality. Important steps can and must be taken to deal with candidate-specific super PACs within the boundaries of the destructive Citizens United decision. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, has introduced the DISCLOSE 2012 Act  to close gaping loopholes in the disclosure laws. It requires super PACs immediately to disclose their donors and campaign expenditures, and requires the PACs' top five donors, and the amounts they gave, to be listed on each of their ads. This legislation is essential to inform citizens about who is providing the money to influence their votes. In addition, Democracy 21 is preparing legislation to shut down super PACs that are closely tied to the candidate they are supporting. The legislation would treat these super PACs legally as arms of the candidate's campaign and subject to the contribution limits that apply to the candidate. Five Supreme Court justices have done enormous damage to our country with one of the worst decisions in the history of the court. This will not be allowed to stand. Citizens will rise up to demand and achieve fundamental reforms, as we have before when threatened with the systemic corruption of our government and officeholders. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- Building a home near a moon crater or a lunar sea may sound nice, but moon colonists might have a much better chance of survival if they just lived in a hole. That's the message sent by an international team of scientists who say they've discovered a protected lunar ""lava tube"" -- a deep, giant hole -- that might be well suited for a moon colony or a lunar base. The vertical hole, in the volcanic Marius Hills region on the moon's near side, is 213 feet wide and is estimated to be more than 260 feet deep, according to findings published in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union. More important, the scientists say, the hole is protected from the moon's harsh temperatures and meteorite strikes by a thin sheet of lava. That makes the tube a good candidate for further exploration or possible inhabitation, the article says. ""Lunar lava tubes are a potentially important location for a future lunar base, whether for local exploration and development, or as an outpost to serve exploration beyond the Moon,"" writes the team, led by Junichi Haruyama, a senior researcher with the Japanese space agency JAXA. ""Any intact lava tube could serve as a shelter from the severe environment of the lunar surface, with its meteorite impacts, high-energy UV radiation and energetic particles, and extreme diurnal temperature variations."" Lava tubes have previously been discovered on the moon, but the scientists say the new hole is notable because of its lava shield and because it does not appear to be prone to collapse. Lave tubes exist on Earth and also have been found on Mars. The cylinder-shaped caverns can be carved out by lava flows, volcanic eruptions, seismic activity or ground collapse resulting from meteoroid strikes. The scientists used high-resolution images from a Japanese moon orbiter called SELENE to discover this lunar lava tube. The findings were published November 12, but they grabbed the attention of the public this week. NASA is reportedly working on plans to return to the moon by 2020 and to set up a temporary lunar colony by 2025 as part of the Constellation Program. Funding for the program, however, remains somewhat in question. The American space agency could not be reached for comment.","Scientists find deep hole on moon that could be suitable for colony .

"New York (CNN) -- In this age of bitter partisanship, it is not surprising that congressional approval ratings are at an all-time low. But how did our national legislature get to the point where only 10% of Americans approve of its actions? The answer: Congress no longer represents the will of the people, and it hasn't for a very long time. The House of Representatives has become another U.S. Senate where a rarefied few supposedly represent the needs of the many. And that's the main reason that hyper-partisanship and special interests seem to control the legislative agenda. We have all been disenfranchised. A quick trip back to fifth grade history class reminds us that the House of Representatives was established as the lower house, intended to be ""of the people,"" according to James Madison. It was to ensure that individual citizens had a voice in federal legislation while the Senate was meant to be more deliberative and represent the interest of the states. But population growth has cut the ties between representatives and those they represent. A seat in the House of Representatives has gone from representing 33,000 people to more than 700,000 today. America basically has two upper houses of Congress with less and less representation of the people. The reason is as cynical as you might imagine: Self-interest and power. It is in the interest of individual members of Congress and the two political parties to maintain this status quo. With each member of Congress representing a very large number of people, representatives receive tremendous attention from special interests. It is relatively easy for these groups to buy the support of the 218 members it takes to pass a bill, and congressional seats have increased in value as the economy and government have grown. It's not surprising that running for Congress has become a multimillion-dollar fundraising challenge in many districts around the country. And, it is also not surprising that many members become millionaires once they leave Congress -- if they are the rare ones who weren't rich to begin with. The real resistance to congressional reform is Congress itself. The Democratic and Republican parties enjoy a duopoly: No third party, or even a faction within the parties, can disrupt their stranglehold, especially when redistricting and gerrymandering have created solidly Democratic and Republican seats. The result is that members and even candidates continue to reflect the more partisan positions of the party, regardless of the will of the people. Although roughly 40% of Americans describe themselves as independent, Washington continues to be driven by the right- and left-wing believers who form the base of each of the parties, resulting in acrimony and stalemate. The solution is relatively simple. For the first 140 years of the republic, the House increased in size with the population in varying degrees, going from 65 members originally to 435. A Republican Congress and president enacted the Reapportionment Act of 1929, which arbitrarily capped the number at 435 members. Although the U.S. population has more than doubled since 1929, the individual's voice in the federal government has diminished. Now is the time to re-establish that voice with a Congress that is closer to the level of representation envisioned by the founders. If we use the original ratio (1 member per 33,000), we would have a House with nearly 10,000 members, which seems extreme and more like direct, as opposed to representative, democracy. However, staying at 435 also seems arbitrary and extreme. The founders envisioned population growth and proposed a maximum ratio of 1 per 50,000, which today would produce a Congress of slightly more than 6,000 members. Let's assume they were off by 100%, and we might envision a Congress with 1 member per 100,000 people or 3,000 members. As points of comparison, a constituency in the U.K. House of Commons is roughly 90,000 people, and the Iraqi government that the U.S. helped establish is at 100,000 people per representative. Yes, that's right: today Iraq's legislature is seven times more representative than our federal government. The idea of 3,000 or more members of Congress, constituting a Washington-based power elite, would scare people if we continue to apply the 1780s approach to governing. But our government needs to evolve to reflect the world we live in. What if members of Congress went to Washington quarterly for two week conventions? The rest of the time they could live in their districts, using widely adopted technologies to collaborate and vote online. It is ridiculous that a member must be ""present"" to cast a vote in Congress in 2012. The role of a member of a much larger Congress should be part-time, making it more attractive for people of varying backgrounds to run. Most importantly, in most districts it would no longer require millions of dollars to get elected, so members would be less likely to be corrupted. Many might argue that such a large number would lead to gridlock based on sheer numbers. Really? More unproductive than where we are today? Properly used technology can enable large numbers of people to collaborate effectively, as they do in some leading corporations. For example, Amazon.com operates a disparate group of businesses around the world with very few physical meetings in headquarters. Most Americans are not ideologues. They want government to work efficiently, represent them well, provide some collective services and solve problems. Congressional reform is gathering some momentum. But those in power will cling to the status quo. We need to fight for the right of representation envisioned by the founding fathers.

"Washington (CNN) -- Despite mounting pressure from Democratic colleagues to resign over the sexting scandal that dominated the headlines this week, embattled Rep. Anthony Weiner insists he's staying in office. Among other things, the New York congressman can point to a Marist College poll released Thursday showing that a majority of registered voters in his district -- 56% -- don't believe he should step down. Only 33% believe he should go. Assuming Weiner stays, the question now becomes whether the House ethics panel will heed Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi's call for an investigation of the case. It involves whether Weiner used government resources in sending lewd photos and sexual-tinged messages in his online communications with several women, and his series of lies when news of what he was doing became public. The known facts so far don't suggest any criminal violations by Weiner, said Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor, in an interview Thursday with CNN. All of Weiner's sexting appeared to be with adults, while prosecution usually focuses on people transmitting pornographic materials to children, Turley noted. In addition, Weiner never called for a federal investigation of the case and therefore avoided one of the biggest dangers of prosecution -- lying to federal investigators, Turley said. ""I think that the odds are ... that he won't be criminally charged,"" he said. On the other hand, a congressional investigation by the House Committee on Ethics, formerly known as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, could be a costly and politically charged process lasting for months and perhaps years. Turley noted that the ethics panel has a reputation for being ""toothless,"" and he questioned the wisdom of prosecuting a legislator for a private act, saying it opened the door to future investigations based on lifestyle or other non-legal issues. However, Turley noted that House rules prohibit conduct that discredits the chamber, and that Weiner's most obvious misconduct appeared to be lying publically by initially claiming his Twitter account had been hacked by someone who posted a lewd photo to a 21-year-old college student in Washington state. Weiner later admitted he sent the photo. Pelosi asked for the ethics committee to investigate in order to pressure Weiner to resign, according to Democratic sources. Her letter to the top Republican and Democrat on the House ethics panel noted that Weiner had ""disclosed conduct which he described as inappropriate."" ""An investigation by the Ethics Committee to determine whether the Rules of the House of Representatives have been violated is warranted,"" Pelosi said in the letter. As pressure built for some indication about the Ethics Committee's intentions, the panel's Republican chairman and ranking Democratic member issued a statement this week underscoring their duty to impartiality and confidentiality. The statement made no mention of Weiner. ""If and when an investigation is appropriate in any matter, the Committee will carry out its responsibilities pursuant to our rules and with the utmost integrity and fairness,"" said the statement from Reps. Jo Bonner, R-Alabama, and Linda Sanchez, D-California. ""Pursuant to our rules of confidentiality, we will not have any further comment at this time."" To Stanley Brand, a lawyer who formerly served as House General Counsel and has participated in ethics committee investigations, the request by Pelosi for an investigation made no sense. There was no criminal violation, Brand said, and focusing on Weiner's case will set an undesirable precedent. ""Why these Democrats think it's a good idea to turn internet peccadilloes into ethics violations, I don't understand,"" Brand told CNN. ""The world is using these devices, and they're going to be sinking their own boats when they do it."" The prospect of months of expensive legal wrangling over his private life was supposed to persuade Weiner to step down in order to end the sensational news headlines that Democrats say are distracting from their messaging on Medicare reform and other issues. Now that Weiner appears likely to stay in office, it is unclear whether the ethics panel will decide to launch an investigation. No specific ethics rules deal with social media such as Twitter, which is one of the forms of online communications involved in the Weiner case. While lying to evade detection would be considered inappropriate, it is not a violation likely to bring significant punishment. Norm Ornstein, a political analyst for the American Enterprise Institute, said Pelosi's call for an ethics investigation was necessary for both procedural and political reasons. ""Weiner's actions raise clear questions about whether he used government resources for his shenanigans,"" Ornstein told CNN, and Pelosi's request also sent ""a clear signal of disapproval of the leadership."" ""It stands in stark contrast with the muted response Senate and House Republican leaders had to David Vitter's confessions, and to the allegations against John Ensign,"" Ornstein's e-mail said of cases involving sexual misconduct and other alleged violations by Republican legislators. ""If Weiner stays, it is clear that it will be without much backing in any fashion, public or private, from his Democratic colleagues,"" Ornstein said in the e-mail. Weiner has said he welcomed the investigation, which could go in a number of directions. The committee could find that the congressman, however repugnant his actions, did nothing to violate House rules. Or it could find that he damaged the reputation of the House and recommend a fine and possibly a reprimand. More seriously, Weiner could be censured. The most serious penalty would be expulsion, something rarely recommended. At most, Weiner is likely going to receive a letter admonishing him for his behavior, predicted Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""The best you've got (so far) is that his behavior doesn't reflect credibly on the House. But that's a pretty vague charge, and (the ethics committee doesn't) use that every time a politician lies. Otherwise they'd be pretty busy."" Sloan noted that House rules allow for use of government property such as phones for personal purposes as long as an extra cost is not incurred by taxpayers. Both Democrats and Republicans will feel a degree of ""discomfort"" dealing with Weiner's case, Sloan said. There is a ""real danger to saying sexual misconduct is something the committee's going to investigate,"" she noted, raising the specter of possible sexual improprieties on the part of other members. Theoretically, the ethics committee is supposed to act as a non-partisan judicial body, she added. But it's impossible to completely eliminate political considerations from the committee's deliberations. Weiner's fellow New York Democrat, Rep. Charlie Rangel, was censured by the House last December after being found guilty on 11 counts of violating House rules, including a failure to pay taxes on a vacation home and improperly using his office to raise money for an educational center bearing his name. Democratic support for Rangel, a former chairman of the powerful tax law-writing House Ways and Means Committee, eroded over time due to a steady stream of new allegations of misconduct and, according to some observers, a poor response to investigators. ""If the scandal deepens with additional revelations, the pressure on Weiner to resign will increase,"" said Adam Sheingate, a Johns Hopkins political scientist. CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .","Democratic colleagues want Rep. Anthony Weiner to resign over a sexting scandal .

"(CNN) -- Massachusetts health officials on Tuesday ordered 11 compounding pharmacies to completely or partially shut down, after unannounced inspections were conducted in the wake of a fungal meningitis outbreak. The state's Department of Public Health began inspecting 40 sterile compounding pharmacies after the multistate outbreak last fall was linked to steroid injections distributed by the Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center (NECC). ""Over the course of the unannounced inspections, partial or complete cease and desist orders were issued to 11 pharmacies for a range of violations,"" the health department said Tuesday. Eight of the 11 have submitted corrective plans, officials said. They must implement the corrective measures, including renovations if necessary, and pass re-inspection. Twenty-one other pharmacies were cited for minor deficiencies that have since been corrected or were ""being addressed through corrective measures,"" the department said in a statement. Some 696 illnesses and 45 deaths in 20 states were blamed on the injections as of Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, noting the deaths are from ""all causes among persons who meet the case definition and may not be directly attributed to a fungal infection."" FDA warns patients to be vigilant about drugs from compounding center . The public health department in October permanently revoked NECC's license to operate as well as the licenses of its three principal pharmacists. According to its report, state and federal investigators ""identified serious deficiencies and significant violations of pharmacy law and regulations that clearly placed the public's health at risk."" Federal authorities also launched a criminal investigation into practices at the company. A second compounding pharmacy surrendered its license after inspectors reported ""significant"" issues that could affect sterility, state health officials said. Following the outbreak, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick's administration launched ""a series of aggressive initiatives"" aimed at preventing a recurrence. Those include new regulations requiring sterile compounding pharmacies to report volume and distribution to the state for the first time; the hiring of additional inspectors; and legislation filed earlier this month creating additional regulations and requirements.","The pharmacies must partially or totally stop operations .

"(CNN) -- I own a property in Fort Pierre, South Dakota, called the Bad River Ranch. It is a beautiful place, where we have worked very hard to restore the landscape, reintroduce native wildlife species and raise bison sustainably. But it sits about 15 miles downstream of the point where TransCanada's proposed Keystone XL pipeline would cross the Bad River, and being that close has led me to examine more closely the potential risks and benefits of a project about which I have been highly skeptical from the beginning. After careful scrutiny, I believe it is not in our national interest to pursue it. The purpose of Keystone XL is to bring tar sands crude oil through the United States to Gulf Coast refineries. The route through the United States is actually the oil industry's second choice: Transporting the oil west from Alberta to the Pacific Coast would be shorter and much cheaper, but Canadians concerned about environmental impacts and threats to native people's lands are challenging that route, and with good reason. The existing and potential environmental impacts along the 2,000-mile pipeline route are profound. In Canada, extraction of tar sands crude requires clear-cutting thousands of acres of boreal forests, diverting rivers, strip-mining, and destroying critical habitat for some of the largest populations of woodland caribou left in the world. Thirty percent of North America's songbirds and 40% of its waterfowl rely on the wetlands and waterways of the boreal forest. Tar sands oil production has already created more than 50 square miles of toxic waste ponds so massive they are visible from space. Even more important, tar sands oil extraction produces three times more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil and gas, putting even greater strain on our atmosphere and oceans, which have little absorptive capacity left. Closer to home, the pipeline presents an immediate threat to drinking water for millions and to the livelihood of farmers and ranchers. To transport via pipeline, the thick tar sands crude must be mixed with toxic chemicals and then pumped at extreme temperature and pressure. This sets the stage for more pipeline failures and spills that create a highly toxic mess. The existing Keystone 1 tar sands pipeline has spilled more than 12 times in its first 12 months of operation. In July 2010, a spill of more than 800,000 gallons of toxic tar sands crude from the Enbridge pipeline contaminated more than 30 miles of water and shoreline along the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. This created public health problems, threats to groundwater, widespread fish kills, and destruction of wildlife habitat, contamination that is still being cleaned up at a cost exceeding $700 million. Downstream landowners like me are thinking this is a preview of coming attractions if Keystone XL is built. The potential for pollution of vital groundwater from the Keystone XL pipeline is even more frightening. Depending on the final route of the pipeline, spills would threaten the Ogallala Aquifer, the largest aquifer in the western North American region, upon which millions of people and agricultural businesses depend for drinking water, irrigation and livestock watering. But spills anywhere along the route would threaten crucial drinking water supplies, from local and municipal drinking water wells to the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer in Texas, a critical water supply for drought-stricken East Texas and Houston. Anyone with even a passing familiarity with the water scarcity problems in that region should understand how a sizable pipeline failure could have catastrophic consequences. Meanwhile, the pro-pipeline lobby is pushing the public to accept Keystone XL with fuzzy promises about jobs and security. But TransCanada's jobs claims have been widely discredited, and there is no guarantee the oil transported by the pipeline would remain in the United States for sale. An attempt in Congress to require the oil to be consumed in the United States was rejected just last week, and it has been widely detailed that Gulf Coast refineries plan to export the finished product to Europe and Latin America. How do we become more energy secure under that scenario? Now Congress, by means of an amendment to the highway bill, is pushing to wrest decision-making control over the project from the administration, bypass final environmental review, and force approval of the pipeline before the final route has even been determined. Congress should not be in the business of skirting the rules and ramming through a polluting project like the Keystone XL pipeline. Instead of supporting the transport of dirty tar sands oil, its focus should be on harnessing truly clean, renewable energy sources like solar, wind and biofuels, which will create thousands of long-lasting jobs in the United States, protect our natural resources and provide true energy and water security today and for many years to come.

"(CNN) -- Etta James, whose assertive, earthy voice lit up such hits as ""The Wallflower,"" ""Something's Got a Hold on Me"" and the wedding favorite ""At Last,"" has died, according to her longtime friend and manager, Lupe De Leon. She was 73. She died from complications from leukemia with her husband, Artis Mills, and her sons by her side, De Leon said. She was diagnosed with leukemia in 2010, and also suffered from dementia and hepatitis C. James died at a hospital in Riverside, California. She would have turned 74 Wednesday. "" This is a tremendous loss for the family, her friends and fans around the world,"" De Leon said. ""She was a true original who could sing it all --Â her music defied category. ""I worked with Etta for over 30 years. She was my friend and I will miss her always."" Was ""At Last"" your song for your wedding's first dance? The powerhouse singer, known as ""Miss Peaches,"" lived an eventful life. She first hit the charts as a teenager, taking ""The Wallflower (Roll With Me, Henry)"" -- an ""answer record"" to Hank Ballard's ""Work With Me, Annie"" -- to No. 1 on the R&B charts in 1955. She joined Chess Records in 1960 and had a string of R&B and pop hits, many with lush string arrangements. After a mid-decade fade, she re-emerged in 1967 with a more hard-edged, soulful sound. Throughout her career, James overcame a heroin addiction, opened for the Rolling Stones, won six Grammys and was voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Despite her ups and downs -- including a number of health problems -- she maintained an optimistic attitude. ""Most of the songs I sing, they have that blue feeling to it. They have that sorry feeling. And I don't know what I'm sorry about,"" she told CNN's Denise Quan in 2002. ""I don't!"" Through it all, she was a spitfire beloved by contemporaries and young up-and-comers. ""Etta James is unmanageable, and I'm the closest thing she's ever had to a manager,"" Lupe DeLeon, her manager of 30-plus years, told CNN in admiration. British songstress Adele named James as one of her favorite singers, along with Aretha Franklin. ""If you were to look up the word singer in the dictionary, you'd see their names,"" Adele said in an interview. Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins in Los Angeles to a teen mother and unknown father. (She suspected her father was the pool player Minnesota Fats.) Her birth mother initially took little responsibility and James was raised by a series of people, notably a pair of boardinghouse owners. But she was recognized from a young age for her booming voice, showcased in a South Central Los Angeles church. In 1950, her mother took her to San Francisco, where James formed a group called the Peaches. Singer Johnny Otis, best known for ""Willie and the Hand Jive,"" discovered her and had her sing a song he wrote using Ballard's tune as a model. ""The Wallflower,"" with responses from ""Louie Louie"" songwriter Richard Berry, made James an R&B star. Her signing to Chess introduced her to a broader audience, as the record label's co-owner, Leonard Chess, believed she should do pop hits. Among her recordings were ""Stormy Weather,"" the Lena Horne classic originally from 1933; ""A Sunday Kind of Love,"" which dates from 1946; and most notably, ""At Last,"" a 1941 number that was originally a hit for Glenn Miller. James' version of ""At Last"" starts out with swooning strings and the singer enters with confident gusto, dazzlingly maintaining a mood of joy and romance. Though the song failed to make the Top 40 upon its 1961 release -- though it did hit the R&B Top 10 -- its emotional punch has long made it a favorite at weddings. James' career suffered in the mid-'60s when the British Invasion took over the pop charts and as she fought some personal demons. But she got a boost when she started recording at Rick Hall's FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Her hits included the brassy ""Tell Mama"" and the raw ""I'd Rather Go Blind,"" the latter later notably covered by Rod Stewart. She entered rehab in the 1970s for her drug problem but re-established herself with live performances and an album produced by noted R&B mastermind Jerry Wexler. After another stint in rehab -- this time at the Betty Ford Clinic -- she made a comeback album, ""Seven Year Itch,"" in 1988. James mastered a range of styles -- from R&B and soul to jazz and blues -- but she was always one step behind the popular genre of the day, said Michael Coyle, a Colgate University professor who has written about jazz and R&B and reviews records for Cadence Magazine. ""She never really got her moment in the sun,"" Coyle said. But James soldiered on, and by the end of her life she had made so much meaningful music that she was considered a living legend. ""By the mid-'90s, she's survived so long that people start to look up to her,"" Coyle said. James was portrayed by pop star Beyonce in the 2008 film ""Cadillac Records,"" about Chess. After Beyonce sang ""At Last"" at one of President Barack Obama's 2009 inaugural balls, James lashed out: ""I can't stand Beyonce. She had no business up there singing my song that I've been singing forever."" She later told the New York Daily News she was joking. Earlier this year, news reports revealed that the singer's estate was being contested in a legal struggle between her husband, Artis Mills, and son Donto James. (Donto and her other son, Sametto, both played in her band.) Over the years, James had her share of health problems. In the late 1990s she reportedly weighed more than 400 pounds and required a scooter to get around. In 2003 she had gastric bypass surgery and dropped more than half the weight, according to People magazine. However, until her latest issues, James maintained a steady touring schedule and appeared full of energy even when sitting down -- as she sometimes did on stage, due to bad knees and her weight battles. Even while sitting down, James gave it her all on stage, singing as though possessed, caressing every note like a long-lost love. If that seemed a little much to critics, well, the legendary singer had a show to put on, she told Quan. ""They said that Etta James is still vulgar,"" she said in the 2002 interview. ""I said, 'Oh, how dare 'em say I'm still real vulgar! I'm vulgar because I dance in the chair?' What would they want me to do? Want me to just be still or something like that? ""I gotta do something."" People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived . CNN's Denise Quan and Melissa Gray contributed to this story.","Etta James died from complications from leukemia at 73 .

"(CNN) -- You may inadvertently be getting more than you bargained for when you put paprika in your chicken paprikash. A new Food and Drug Administration report, ""Pathogens and Filth in Spices,"" says that 12% of U.S. spice imports are contaminated with bug parts, rodent hairs and other ingredients more appropriate to a witches' brew than your mother's favorite recipe. The FDA study also found that 7% of spice imports the inspectors examined were contaminated with salmonella. Salmonella are toxic bacteria that can trigger diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. The amount of ""filth"" the FDA found in imported spice was twice that found in other kinds of imported food. The report characterized this as a ""systemic challenge."" The agency conducted the research to figure out what kind of risks the contamination poses to the American public and what the FDA can do to lower any kind of health risks. There is good news, however, regardless of the ick factor. The study did find that only a tiny fraction of the American public has gotten sick from spices. In the 37 years of records examined, it found only 14 outbreaks worldwide associated with spices and seasonings, resulting in fewer than 2,000 human illnesses and 128 hospitalizations. The FDA characterized that as a ""relatively small number of outbreaks"" compared to other foodborne illness. The FDA says the issue may be underreported. Patients often forget to list spices when they describe what they ate before they became sick. People also eat spices in such tiny quantities that there is less exposure to pathogens than with food which is eaten in larger servings. ""We would agree ready-to-eat spices should be clean and meet FDA standards and be pathogen-free,"" said Cheryl Deem, executive director of the American Spice Trade Association. ""We did find it really interesting that the FDA said they were going to use this report to develop a plan to reduce illness, but if you look at the data we don't think that's a significant problem. That's a small number of illnesses."" 22,000 pounds of meat recalled; possible Listeria . The report points out most of the contamination likely comes from what it describes as ""poor storage practices."" Deem said it is not a big surprise the FDA would find some issues with spices that arrive in the United States in raw form. Tests did not distinguish between the ready-to-eat product that has been cleaned overseas or the raw product. Spice can come to the U.S. cleaned and bottled in another country, or in big sacks and containers that then go to a commercial facility, Deem said. At the facility the spice is cleaned in what's called a ""microbial reduction process,"" in which the spice is cleaned several times to get rid of the sticks and stones and those scary-sounding bug parts. Since most spices cannot be grown in the United States, much of the supply comes from countries like India and Mexico -- the two countries that have the highest rate of contamination. Deem said much of the spice that comes into the U.S. comes through a complex supply chain. That's where contamination can enter, she said, starting with the small farmers who gather the crop, dry it and then often store it until they need the cash. It then goes to a collector where it is again stored until there is enough of a supply from local farmers. Only then is it shipped to a bigger facility for treatment. ""It goes through some very small hands before it gets to the first processing stage,"" Deem said. The Spice Board of India is currently working directly with farmers to put additional safety practices in place and to lower the risk of contamination, the FDA said. The agency has provided some food safety training in India, as has the American Spice Trade Association. The FDA says it has increased its inspections of spice facilities and will take further action to strengthen the spice safety net.

"Washington (CNN) -- It's coming next week. Or next month. It'll protect 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation. Or 3 million. Or less. There's still a lot of uncertainty about President Obama's upcoming immigration executive order, since Obama himself has yet to make a final decision on an action to fix the broken system. But while details aren't yet locked down, there are a few things we know for certain: the move is coming before year's end, the fate of millions of immigrants are at stake, and Republicans are fuming. Here's what else you should know about the upcoming immigration order: . What is Obama going to do? The biggest question -- one the White House isn't ready to answer quite yet -- is what changes Obama will bring to the immigration system to make it fairer. He vowed to take action on his own earlier this year, saying Congress had failed to pass any meaningful reforms themselves. Administration officials, however, have laid out the contours of a plan: many parents of American citizens, who are undocumented immigrants themselves, will be allowed to stay and work in the United States legally. An estimate from the Migration Policy Institute puts the number of undocumented parents who might be eligible -- since they've been in the United States for 5 years -- at 3.3 million. Related: The immigration waiting game will end soon . Other potential areas of reform include extending the deportation deferment for immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Obama enacted a rule in 2012 permitting some of those children to avoid deportation, but there were age restrictions. Changing them could bring hundreds of thousands more into the fold. Officials also said the plan could include a stronger focus on deporting criminals who are undocumented immigrants and an expansion of worker visas in areas like technology. Lastly, the plan could include new resources to bolster security on the border. What will that actually do for immigrants? Immigration activists have long called for a fix to the system that would end deportations splitting up families. Thanks to the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, anyone born in the U.S. is automatically a citizen - that includes children whose parents are undocumented immigrants. But this also means many immigrant families find themselves in positions where one or both parents face deportation, while their children are allowed to stay. Permitting those parents in the United States to work legally and avoid deportation would allow families to remain together. President Obama has said keeping families together would be part of the reason he'll acting alone to provide relief from the threat of deportation. How many people would be affected by the move remains to be determined, since the details aren't yet finalized. If Obama announces he'll allow all undocumented parents of U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents, or deferred-deportation-eligible kids, 3.7 million people could be affected, according to the Migration Policy Institute's report. But a stricter policy could bring those numbers down. Mandating parents live in the U.S. for at least 5 years before becoming eligible would bring the number affected to 3.4 million; a 10-year minimum would bring it down further to an estimated 2.6 million people. Will it be enough? Even under the broadest interpretation, Obama is expected to provide relief to 5 million undocumented immigrants. That's fewer than half the 11.7 million currently thought to be in the United States. His action would be far less sweeping than a comprehensive bill passed through Congress. It would also be temporary. The next president could simply undo the orders and re-start deportations. But with Congress unlikely to pass a comprehensive bill, Obama's action may be the best activists can hope for. Immigration rights groups have been waiting a long time for Obama to pull the trigger on his immigration action. First announced this spring, the White House initially said the actions would be in place by the end of the summer. Politics got in the way when Obama pushed the announcement until after this month's midterm elections. Now activists say anticipation is high with the waiting game nearing an end. But their expectations for Obama's final plan aren't exactly sky high. ""Our expectations aren't tempered. But we fear that Obama's may be,"" said Clarissa Martinez, deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza. Lorella Praeli, the advocacy director at immigrants' rights group United We Dream, said she expected the eventual announcement to fall somewhere short of the maximum Obama could do with his executive power. ""I think they will try to couch that as 'these are our political constraints,'"" she said. What will Republicans do if Obama offers relief to many undocumented immigrants? Impeachment? As soon as Obama announced he was taking unilateral action on immigration, Republicans denounced him as overstepping his constitutional bounds. Those cries of overreach don't show signs of quieting as the announcement nears. On the extreme end are calls for impeachment, which were fueled this week when Rep. Joe Barton, a Republican from Texas, said Obama's moves could spark proceedings in the House. Charles Krauthammer, a conservative columnist, said Thursday night the potential actions are ""an impeachable offense."" Related: Immigration action would spur calls for impeachment . It's hard to say exactly how Republicans will react since the action hasn't been announced in any detail. But no matter what Obama does it's certain to spark GOP outrage. House Speaker John Boehner said Obama was playing with matches and ""would get burned"" if he went ahead with executive action. Soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the president would ""poison the well"" in terms of working with Republicans for the final two years of his presidency. The lawsuit against Obama that House Republicans have threatened could be expanded to include the immigration order. And any funding required for the plan could be held up in Congress. All that only seems to empower Democrats, who say the threats demonstrate how resistant the GOP is to changing the broken immigration system. Will it all cause a government shutdown? It all comes down to timing. As Obama prepares to unveil the long-awaited immigration action, lawmakers in the Congressional lame duck are wading through some important business, chiefly passing a measure that would fund the federal government. If the immigration announcement comes before the spending bill is passed, Republicans could hold it up. With funds running out in mid-December, that could trigger another government shutdown. To avoid that, Republicans could pass a short-term spending measure the keeps the government running while they determine their next steps. But even some Democrats don't want to take chances -- Sen. Harry Reid, the outgoing Senate Majority Leader, said he wanted Obama to wait until after the spending bill passes to make the immigration announcement. The White House, meanwhile, hasn't given any hints on when the announcement will come, saying the decision won't be made until Obama returns from his trip to Asia this weekend.

"(Health.com) -- Older women have a slightly increased risk of dying at an earlier age if they take multivitamins or certain other dietary supplements, according to a new study published today in the Archives of Internal Medicine. Of the 15 supplements included in the study, iron was most strongly linked to an increased risk of earlier death. Women who took iron supplements were 10% more likely to die during the 22-year study than women who did not take them, even after the researchers controlled for several other health and demographic factors. Folic acid, vitamin B6, magnesium, zinc, copper, and multivitamins were also associated with an increased risk of earlier death. Calcium was the only supplement associated with a lower risk of death during the study. ""I don't think we really know enough to be prescribing supplements,"" says David Jacobs Jr., Ph.D., the senior author of the study and a professor of public health at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis. Jacobs stresses, however, that people who have been prescribed dietary supplements for a specific vitamin or nutrient deficiency should not stop taking them without consulting their doctor. Health.com: Which vitamins do you need? The study -- which shows only an association, not cause and effect -- has some key shortcomings. The researchers measured supplement intake using questionnaires that relied on the memory of the participants, for instance. In addition, the researchers don't know whether the women were taking supplements for a health problem. The increases in death risk might therefore be due to underlying health conditions rather than the supplements themselves, says Susan Fisher, Ph.D., a professor of community and preventive medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center, in Rochester, N.Y. ""People [often] go to the vitamin store because they feel something isn't right -- their memory is slipping, they don't have as much energy,"" says Fisher, who was not involved in the new study. ""These could be subconscious symptoms of a disease that is eventually going to take their life."" Health.com: Heart trouble? 30 herbal remedies to avoid . The use of dietary supplements has exploded in the United States in recent decades. According to the study, roughly half of all adults reported taking supplements in 2000. The rates were even higher among the 38,772 women in Iowa who participated in the study. Sixty-three percent were taking at least one supplement when the study began, in 1986, but by 2004 that number had jumped to 85%. And more than one-quarter of those women reported taking four or more supplements on a regular basis. The women were 62 years old at the beginning of the study, on average, and none had chronic health conditions (with the exception of diabetes and high blood pressure). Just over 40% of the women had died by the time the study ended in 2008. Women who took calcium -- which is known to reduce the risk of bone fractures associated with aging -- were 9% less likely to die during the study than women who did not take it, but most of the other supplements were associated with an increased risk of death. Some supplements, including beta-carotene, vitamins A and C, and selenium, didn't appear to affect death risk either way. Health.com: 11 foods for healthy bones . However, the increases in death risk (or decrease, in the case of calcium) were extremely small and may not be clinically meaningful, says Mary L. Chavez, a professor of pharmacy practice at the Texas A&M Health Science Center, in Kingsville. Several factors besides supplement use may have shaped the results. Fisher points out, for instance, that the use of hormone therapy to treat the symptoms of menopause was nearly twice as common among supplement users as among nonusers. Some forms of hormone therapy have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and breast cancer. The researchers did take hormone therapy into account in their analysis, along with several other potentially mitigating factors (including age, educational attainment, body mass index, diet, and physical activity). But the wide disparity in hormone use between supplement users and nonusers may indicate that the two groups of women were different in subtle yet important ways, Fisher says. Health.com: Can supplements ease menopause symptoms? ""People choosing to take [hormone] replacement therapy often have underlying different characteristics and lifestyle behaviors, which you can't necessarily balance out with a mathematical model,"" she says. It's not clear that the study results apply to the population of older women as a whole. The study participants were white and tended to live in rural areas, so the findings can't necessarily be generalized to other races and geographic areas. Still, the study is a reminder that supplements may not be as harmless as they seem, Fisher says. ""Taking more of what we think is a good thing may not be so good,"" she says. ""High levels of nutrient supplements may be harmful, or at least not helpful.""

"(CNN) -- If you're thinking of setting up an amazing man cave or showing off a ginormous baby bump next year, think again. A northern Michigan school on Friday released its 37th annual list of words and phrases that it believes should be ""banished"" from the English language, and it suggests that some classic -- and perhaps hackneyed -- should get the ax. Lake Superior State University once again solicited people online to nominate terms they consider tired, overused or simply annoying. Based on those submissions, the arbiters at the school decided to put the following on this year's chopping block: ""amazing,"" ""baby bump,"" ""shared sacrifice,"" ""occupy,"" ""blowback,"" ""man cave,"" ""ginormous"" and ""the new normal."" ""Pet parent,"" ""win the future,"" ""trickeration"" and ""thank you in advance"" also have been unofficially sentenced to linguistic exile for the crimes of excessive and inappropriate usage, according to the university in Sault Sainte Marie on the Canadian border. ""Worn-out words and phrases are the new normal this year, but with some shared sacrifice, we can clean up the language and win the future,"" a school representative said in a written statement. ""With the addition of this year's nominations, the list of words and phrases banished over the years has become ginormous."" ""Amazing"" -- arguably one of the most overused adjectives in the English language -- topped this year's list of submissions, according to the university. ""Banish it for blatant overuse and incorrect use ... to stop my head from exploding,"" begged Paul Crutchfield from Great Britain, according to the press release. ""Anderson Cooper used it three times recently in the opening 45 seconds of his program,"" said Sarah Howley, a resident of Kalamazoo, Michigan, referring to the CNN anchor. ""My teeth grate, my hackles rise, and even my dog is getting annoyed at this senseless overuse. ""I don't even like 'Amazing Grace' anymore,"" she complained. David Hollis from Hubbardsville, New York, insisted that not all men are enamored with the concept of the traditional man cave. ""It is not just overused, it is offensive to we males who do not wish to hunker (another awful word, often misused) down in a room filled with stuffed animal heads, an unnecessarily large flat-screen TV and Hooters memorabilia,"" he said. ""Not every man wants a recliner the size of a 1941 Packard that has a cooler in each arm and a holster for the remote. So please, assign 'man cave' to the lexicographic scrap heap where it so rightly belongs."" Jim Eisenmann from Madison, Wisconsin, had some free advice for politicians hitting the campaign trail in 2012: dump ""win the future"" or you may not win the race. ""On its very face, it's an empty, meaningless phrase,"" he explained. ""It basically says that anyone who opposes anything meant to 'win the future' must want to 'lose the future,' which is highly unlikely."" ""Ginormous"" seemed particularly irritating this time around, with contributors complaining that its usage shows a lack of proper education. ""This combination of gigantic and enormous makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck every time I hear it,"" said Gina Bua of Vancouver, Washington. ""Each utterance reminds me of the high school drop-out that first used this offensive word in my presence."" ""This word is just a made-up combination of two words,"" adds an Andover, Maine, resident named Jason, who refused to offer his last name. ""Either word is sufficient, but the combination just sounds ridiculous."" As for ""baby bump"" -- a term used to describe a pregnant woman's rounded belly -- this ""is a phrase we finally need to give birth to, then send on its way,"" declared Mary Sturgeon from Vancouver, British Columbia. ""I'm tired of a pregnancy being reduced to a celebrity accessory. Or worse, when less-than-six-pack abs are suspected of being one,"" said Afton, a respondent from Portland, Oregon.

"(CNN) -- U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned on Sunday that it ""would be a grave mistake"" if Russian President Vladimir Putin intervened militarily in the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Rice, who spoke on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" was among U.S. leaders saying they want to see a unity coalition government in the country after President Viktor Yanukovych fled Kiev, the capital, and a unanimous vote in Parliament removed him from power. ""The United States is on the side of the Ukrainian people,"" Rice said. The people expressed themselves peacefully, she said, and Yanukovych ""turned on"" the people by using violence against them. Ukraine's president calls efforts to push him from office a 'coup' A former Soviet republic closely allied with Russia, Ukraine is home to many people who speak Russian and identify with Russia. David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, recently returned from Russia and reported from the country for many years. On ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" on Sunday, Remnick said that Putin considers Ukraine and Russia ""linked by blood."" ""If you look through Putin's eyes, specifically, this is his area of interest. It's not the United States and even not Europe,"" Remnick said. ""This is really complicated for us."" Rice said the U.S. wants to see constitutional reform, democratic elections and a unity government, and President Barack Obama stressed that to Putin in a recent conversation. ""Putin was in agreement"" at that time, Rice said. Republican Sen. John McCain appeared on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" with strong words for Putin. A partition of Ukraine would ""not be acceptable,"" McCain said. ""The Ukrainian people will determine their own future. They want to be Western. ... They do not want to be Eastern,"" he said. If he were Putin, he said, he would be nervous about the protest movement happening in Ukraine. Appearing on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said he spoke with former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko on Saturday just after she was released from prison following a unanimous vote in Parliament. Durbin said she assured him that she's ""looking for a peaceful resolution to the problems in Ukraine, to follow the constitution and the law."" Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, said there must be focus on forming a unity government. ""Yanukovych needs to step aside, and I will say this: Now that the Olympics are over, we need to watch the behavior of the Russians,"" she said. Obama ""needs to up his game and send a clear, unequivocal, public message to Putin not to interfere in what is happening in Ukraine,"" Ayotte said, ""to let the Ukrainian people determine their future, to ensure that there is no interference in their sovereignty."" Durbin agreed that more pressure should be placed on Putin. ""We have to combine our efforts with the European Union to help Ukraine move forward in a peaceful democratic way.

"(CNN) -- A Vietnamese man is recovering in the intensive care unit Friday, a day after surgery that completely removed from his right leg a tumor twice his body weight, according to the hospital in Ho Chi Minh City. The growing tumor had rendered the patient, Nguyen Duy Hai, virtually immobile until his surgery. The excised tumor weighed 180 pounds (82 kilos), according to the hospital, a bit less than the 200 pounds (90 kilos) estimated before surgery. Hai, 31, of Da Lat City, has Von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis, said Dr. Jean-Marcel Guillon, chief executive officer of FV Hospital, where the 12-hour procedure was performed. The autosomal dominant hereditary disorder is the same disease that contributed to the extraordinarily large head of Joseph Merrick, whose story was dramatized in the 1980 film, ""The Elephant Man,"" explained Guillon. (Last July, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, its researchers identified the gene variant in Proteus syndrome and plan to test DNA from Merrick's skeleton to determine if Proteus caused his disfigurement.) The tumor, which originated in Hai's spine, ""may return,"" Guillon wrote in e-mails to CNN, ""but we can operate him again, and it won't never reach such a size anymore."" Doctors expect that Hai's cardiac and pulmonary functions will return to normal during the next 10 days. After that, Hai faces rehabilitation, physical therapy and possible help from the hospital's clinical psychologist to deal with issues pertaining to body image, Guillon said. ""This patient lived all his life with this tumor. It was part of him."" Hai also needs to learn how to do things that his body had forgotten, including using the left leg he had never used normally, Guillon added. The tumor was first discovered when Hai was four years old and had grown to its enormous size since then. Hai had undergone a surgery to amputate most of his leg -- and with it the tumor -- in 1997, but in 2001, the tumor grew, and no doctors agreed to operate on him, according to the hospital. Guillon said he did not know why the leg was amputated, as there are no medical records from that time. Furthermore, his family could not afford surgery, and very few surgeons in Vietnam can treat neurofibromas, Guillon said. The latest surgery was considered risky with a 50% success rate for a number of reasons, Guillon explained. ""First, such a giant tumor has developed its own blood system with huge arteries branched out from the normal vascular system. Therefore, one of the main risks was abundant bleeding."" Doctors used a ""cell saver,"" which suctions and filters the patient's blood before re-injecting it into the body, along with extra blood for the surgery. The second and third risks lay in heart function (""How would a heart react when a tumor with twice the weight of a patient is removed?"") and the effects of a long -- more than 13 hours -- anesthesia, Guillon said. Leading the surgical team was Dr. McKay McKinnon, a specialist in plastic and reconstructive surgery from Chicago. McKinnon has been credited with removing a 200-pound tumor from a woman in the U.S. state of Michigan in 2000, as well as a 176-pound (80 kilo) tumor from a Romanian woman in 2004. Aside from McKinnon, no one else on the team had any prior experience with Hai's condition or performed such a surgery before, Guillon said. ""Though the surgical techniques used by Dr. McKinnon are usual and routinely used by our surgeons, the difference lays in his experience: he knows what to expect and what to do at specific crucial moments."" Finally, the team of Vietnamese surgeons and anesthetists had never worked with McKinnon before, and communication issues could turn dangerous in an operating theatre, Guillon said, adding that two of the three Vietnamese surgeons also go by ""Dr. Thai."" Nonetheless, the communication among all in the operating theatre went ""extremely well,"" Guillon said. During the surgery, FV Hospital set up a live video feed for other doctors and hospitals to watch. Video during the surgery showed five people assisting in the disposal of the excised tumor from its own gurney into a yellow container, which was then sealed. A small piece has been sent for examination; the rest will be incinerated as with all biological waste, Guillon said. The cost of the surgery was estimated at $20,000, but the hospital said it will charge 60% of the cost, which will be covered jointly by the Red Cross of Da Lat City and sponsors. The hospital said it is financing all the traveling costs and accommodation for McKinnon, who is performing the surgery free of charge.","NEW: Excised tumor weighed 180 pounds, hospital says .

"(CNN) -- Saying that ""it's time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress,"" Monica Lewinsky is writing for the first time about her affair with Bill Clinton. ""I, myself, deeply regret what happened between me and President Clinton. Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened,"" says the now 40-year-old Lewinsky in the upcoming issue of Vanity Fair. Lewinsky maintains the relationship in the 1990s was one between two consenting adults. ""Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any 'abuse' came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position,"" Lewinsky writes. While a White House intern in 1995, Lewinsky began a sexual relationship with Clinton. The ensuing political scandal and investigation resulted in the Democratic President's impeachment by the Republican-led House. The Senate acquitted him of the charges. Lewinsky has stayed virtually silent about the affair the past decade. She writes in Vanity Fair that ""the buzz in some circles has been that the Clintons must have paid me off; why else would I have refrained from speaking out? I can assure you that nothing could be further from the truth."" But she adds that it's time to stop ""tiptoeing around my past -- and other people's futures. I am determined to have a different ending to my story. I've decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past. (What this will cost me, I will soon find out.)"" Lewinsky was constantly in the media during and shortly after the controversy. She sold a line of handbags in 1999 and the next year she appeared in commercials for diet company Jenny Craig. In 2002, she appeared in an HBO special on the affair, and the next year she hosted a reality dating program. Lewinsky changed course in 2005, moving to Britain to obtain a masters degree in social psychology at the London School of Economics. She's stayed out of the spotlight since. In the Vanity Fair article, Lewinsky responds to reports made public in February that Hillary Clinton, in correspondence with close friend Diane Blair during the 1990s, had characterized Lewinsky as a ""narcissistic loony toon."" Lewinsky writes that her first thought was: ""If that's the worst thing she said, I should be so lucky."" She continued, ""Mrs. Clinton, I read, had supposedly confided to Blair that, in part, she blamed herself for her husband's affair (by being emotionally neglectful) and seemed to forgive him. Although she regarded Bill as having engaged in 'gross inappropriate behavior,' the affair was, nonetheless, 'consensual (was not a power relationship).'"" Blair's personal writings gave insight into the former first lady's views on the Lewinsky scandal, as well as a host of other issues. The papers were donated by Blair's family to the University of Arkansas. Asked about those conversations between Hillary Clinton and Blair, Lewinsky writes: ""Yes, I get it. Hillary Clinton wanted it on record that she was lashing out at her husband's mistress. She may have faulted her husband for being inappropriate, but I find her impulse to blame the Woman-not only me, but herself-troubling."" And she rejects the ""narcissistic loony toon"" label, saying that she refused to cooperate with interrogators offering the then-24 year old immunity from the threat of jail time in return for wearing a wire to monitor staged conversations with two of Clinton's confidantes."" ""Courageous or foolish, maybe,"" Lewinsky writes, ""but narcissistic and loony?""

"(CNN) -- It's no longer enough to have smartphones, smartwatches, smart TVs and smart cars. Now a tech company is bringing artificial intelligence to lingerie. Researchers at Microsoft have developed a prototype of a ""smart bra"" embedded with physiological sensors that seek to monitor a woman's heart activity to track her emotional moods and combat overeating. The sensors can signal the wearer's smartphone, which then flash a warning message to help her step away from the fridge and make better diet decisions. The company says it has no plans to make the bra into a commercial product, however. So -- why a bra, exactly? ""First, we needed a form factor that would be comfortable when worn for long durations,"" said scientists in a research paper published online. ""The bra form factor was ideal because it allowed us to collect (electrocardiogram data) near the heart."" Research has shown that many people reach for calorie-rich foods like doughnuts when they're feeling stressed, bored, discouraged or on edge. There's a reason it's called comfort food. For the research paper, scientists from Microsoft, the University of Rochester and the University of Southampton in the UK interviewed women who said that interventions -- being alerted to their emotional states -- helped them identify triggers for binge eating. Bionic fashion: Wearable tech will turn man into machine by 2015 . The researchers then conducted a study in which four women wore the sensors in their bras for four days to monitor their vital signs. An electrocardiogram (EKG) sensor under the arm measured their heart rate, while an electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor tracked their perspiration. The researchers determined the bra was mostly effective in detecting its wearer's emotional changes. But the sensors needed to be recharged every three to four hours, which limited how long the bra could be worn. And more research would be needed before a smart brassiere -- Microsoft's Secret, anyone? -- ever became a viable product. A Microsoft spokesperson downplayed the bra's significance in an e-mail to CNN. ""The bra sensing system is just one instance of a class of work from a group of Microsoft researchers that is focused on the broader topic of affective computing, or designing devices and services that are sensitive to people's moods and react accordingly,"" the spokesperson said. ""While we will continue our research in affective computing, Microsoft has no plans to develop a bra with sensors."" What about a similar undergarment for men? Researchers didn't rule it out. ""We will continue to explore how to build a robust, real-world system that stands up to everyday challenges with regards to battery life, comfortability, and being suitable for both men and women,"" the researchers said in the paper. Reaction to the bra on Twitter ranged from amusement to annoyance. ""Anyone else offended that Microsoft is devoting its tech research to a bra designed to prevent women from overeating?"" tweeted a Seattle woman whose Twitter handle is @cunningminx. Added Rachel Happe of Boston, ""If nothing else convinces you we need more women in tech, this should. No, I don't want someone hacking my bra...""

"New Delhi (CNN) -- He had a primate in his underpants. That's the explanation airport guards at New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport gave Sunday for detaining a man from the United Arab Emirates who allegedly had the tiny, big-eyed critter hidden in his underwear. The guards were conducting a routine pat-down of the Dubai-bound passenger when they discovered the rare, slender loris, according to Hemendra Singh, a spokesman for the Central Industrial Security Force. The loris is a nocturnal primate that grows to no more than 10 inches (25 centimeters) long, according to the conservation group Edge of Existence. The species, native to Sri Lanka, is listed as endangered under the Wildlife Protection Act of India. Authorities found a second loris abandoned in a trash can. They sent both to wildlife authorities, Singh said. Guards turned over the man and two fellow travelers to customs officials. No charges have been filed.","Man was going through security at New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport .

"(CNN) -- Apple devices, from Macs to iPhones, have always been able to boast of advanced safety from viruses, spam and the like. Now, apparently, not even your phone charger is safe. A team of researchers from Georgia Tech say they've discovered, and can demonstrate, a way to to hack into an iPhone or iPad in less than a minute using a ""malicious charger."" The team plans to demonstrate its findings at the Black Hat computer security conference, which begins July 27 in Las Vegas. In a preview of its presentation, the team acknowledges Apple's ""plethora of defense mechanisms in iOS."" Historically, Mac users have been able to boast of being largely malware free, in part because spammers, scammers and hackers preferred to target the larger number of Windows computers in the world. On its mobile iOS operating system, Apple has created a ""closed garden"" environment in which everything from apps to accessories has to be approved by Apple, as opposed to Google's more wide-open Android system. But by attacking in a nontraditional way, the team of Billy Lau, Yeongjin Jang and Chengyu Song say, those defenses can be bypassed. ""(W)e investigated the extent to which security threats were considered when performing everyday activities such as charging a device,"" they wrote. ""The results were alarming: despite the plethora of defense mechanisms in iOS, we successfully injected arbitrary software into current-generation Apple devices running the latest operating system (OS) software. ""All users are affected, as our approach requires neither a jailbroken device nor user interaction."" The team says they have built a malicious charger named Mactans, which they plan to demonstrate at Black Hat. Latrodectus mactans is the scientific name for the deadly black widow spider. The preview doesn't say whether the charger is a modified version of Apple's standard equipment or entirely new. ""While Mactans was built with limited amount of time and a small budget, we also briefly consider what more motivated, well-funded adversaries could accomplish,"" they wrote. ""Finally, we recommend ways in which users can protect themselves and suggest security features Apple could implement to make the attacks we describe substantially more difficult to pull off."" Apple did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.","Researchers say they can hack Apple mobile devices through the charger .

"London (CNN) -- The full scale of Russian President Vladimir Putin's new imperial ambition was revealed recently when he referred to the southern and eastern territories of Ukraine as Novorossiya (New Russia). This was the name given to the region by Catherine the Great after she captured it from the Ottomans in the late 18th century and began colonizing it with Russian, Ukrainian and German settlers. Along with his assertion that Crimea belongs to Russia because of the blood-price Russian troops paid to conquer it more than two centuries ago, Putin's appropriation of Tsarist terminology establishes a new and troubling benchmark for his irredentist project. It suggests that all the territories that were once part of the Russian Empire are now fair game. This concerns far more than the fate of Ukraine. Pushed to its logical conclusion, it poses a direct challenge to the legitimacy and independence of all post-Soviet states. The practice of manipulating ""frozen conflicts"" and deploying Russian troops as ""peacekeepers"" in order to exert leverage is already well established in Moldova, Georgia and Azerbaijan, and there is an extensive toolbox of other coercive measures Moscow is willing to apply, from trade embargoes to cyber attacks. While the scope of Russian territorial expansion is likely to be limited and the threat of military force mostly held in reserve, the ambition to subordinate the wider region under the aegis of the emerging Eurasian Union is absolutely clear. Welcome to the new Russian Empire. Events in Ukraine have left the West uncertain about how to respond. For all the talk of a new Cold War, there is one important difference with the past that helps to explain why. Whereas Soviet communism defined its ideological purpose in terms of universal goals that posed a threat to the West, Putin emphasizes the exceptional character of Russian civilization and limits his vision to the domination of Eurasia. His challenge is not of the existential variety that once forced Western governments to set aside their differences in the face of a common enemy. It belongs instead to the realm of values where the post-Cold War ideal of a ""Europe whole and free"" clashes with Putin's determination to build an exclusive sphere of influence in the east. It's much harder to mobilize countries in defense of abstract principles rather than their own physical security, but that is what the West must do if it wants to prevent the unraveling of a European order based on democratic values. While some lessons of the Cold War will be relevant, others will not. One idea that deserves qualified approval is containment, once more being talked about as the basis for U.S. policy towards Russia. This was the strategy adopted by the Truman administration at the onset of the Cold War, designed to block Soviet expansionism through a variety of military, economic and diplomatic countermeasures. The pledge Harry Truman gave to ""support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or outside pressures"" is certainly relevant at a time when Russian troops are assembling on Ukraine's borders and their proxies are orchestrating violence inside the country. There is now an arc of countries stretching from the Gulf of Finland to the borders of China with good reason to be concerned about the direction of Russian policy. Many of them have large Russian minorities of their own. The West needs a comprehensive strategy for engaging with all of them. The states at risk fall into three distinct categories. The first is comprised of countries like Poland and the Baltic States that already enjoy the institutional security of belonging to NATO and the EU. The task here is to reinforce deterrence capabilities in order to prevent miscalculations on the part of Russia. The second group, and probably the most significant, consists of vulnerable pro-Western countries, including Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine itself, all of which now have Russian troops directly or indirectly involved in conflicts on their territory. Azerbaijan is particularly important as a strategic partner in helping to diversify Europe's energy supplies. The opening of the southern gas corridor with the addition of the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline will provide substantial quantities of Azeri gas by 2019, thus weakening Russia's grip on the European market. All of these states are linked to Western institutions through the EU's European Neighbourhood Policy and NATO's Partnership for Peace program. These need to be upgraded as a matter of priority, especially since full membership is not an immediate prospect. Objectives should include deeper trade ties, structured political consultations and help in modernizing and strengthening their defensive capabilities. Ultimately, Western countries must be willing to extend explicit security guarantees, preferably within the NATO framework, but outside it if necessary. Engagement with the third group of countries -- authoritarian post-Soviet states including Belarus, Kazakhstan and the other Central Asian republics -- may seem like a waste of time given the support some of them gave Moscow after the seizure of Crimea. But much of this support will have been offered out of fear rather than genuine approval. Just as Cold War containment involved engagement with communist countries, such as China and Yugoslavia, willing to depart from the Moscow line, its modern counterpart should aim to disrupt Putin's coercive alliance building strategy at every opportunity. There is, however, one important sense in which neo-containment should differ from its Cold War predecessor. Although its architect, George Kennan, always hoped that it would be used to modify Soviet behavior, containment in practice became part of a zero-sum struggle in which there could only be one survivor. The aim of containment today should not be to engineer Russia's collapse, but to block the illegitimate exercise of power and encourage Russian leaders to pursue their interests by respecting the sovereign equality of their neighbors. In the long-term, Russia would be stronger not weaker as a result. READ MORE: Who is on Russia's sanctions list? READ MORE: Ukrainian mayor shot in the back .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A Minnesota flight instructor who notified his bosses of student Zacarias Moussaoui's suspicious behavior received a $5 million reward Thursday from the State Department, two government officials told CNN. Zacarias Moussaoui was convicted in 2006 of conspiring to kill Americans on September 11, 2001. Clarence ""Clancy"" Prevost was an instructor at the Pan Am International Flight Academy in Eagan, Minnesota, when Moussaoui was a student there. Moussaoui is the only person charged and convicted in connection with the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. Prevost received the reward from the State Department's Rewards for Justice program in a closed ceremony at the State Department, the officials told CNN. Moussaoui, an admitted al Qaeda operative, was prevented from participating in the 9/11 attacks because he was in jail. He was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole in connection with his role in 9/11. He is held at the federal Supermax facility in Florence, Colorado. Prevost, a retired Northwest Airlines pilot, has never spoken publicly about Moussaoui, but testified during the sentencing phase of Moussaoui's trial. He said that by the second day of teaching Moussaoui, he heard that Moussaoui paid the bulk of his $8,300 tuition for a flight simulator course in hundred-dollar bills. And that made Prevost think the FBI should be notified. He testified that he found Moussaoui to be a ""pretty genial guy"" until a lunchtime conversation turned to the Hajj, a pilgrimage to Mecca made by Muslims. Prevost wanted to know if Moussaoui could explain the Hajj to him and asked, ""Are you Muslim?"" Prevost testified that Moussaoui responded by raising his voice and saying, ""I am nothing!"" Prevost testified that he approached his managers, and recalled telling them, ""We don't know anything about this guy, and we're teaching him how to throw the switches on a 747."" But he said his managers at first told him Moussaoui had paid his money and they didn't care. Prevost testified that he told his bosses, ""We'll care when there's a hijacking and the lawsuits come in."" He testified Moussaoui's stated goal of learning to fly from Heathrow Airport in London to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport was unusual from the beginning, because Moussaoui had 50-odd hours of flight time on a single-engine propeller plane and no pilot's license. Prevost testified he usually had students with more than 600 hours of flight time, and that they are usually professional pilots looking to upgrade their skills and fly bigger jets for a higher salary. But Moussaoui, he testified, ""had no frame of reference whatsoever with a commercial airliner. After 15 minutes I said, 'Let's get lunch.' "" Prevost said he was worried that if Moussaoui completed the three four-hour 747 simulator sessions he had booked, he would know how to operate a real 747. He testified that he let Moussaoui sit in on another student's simulator session, but he never got any of his own sessions. A day after Prevost went to his bosses with his concerns, two Pan Am program managers called the FBI, leading to Moussaoui's arrest on an immigration violation. Moussaoui had stayed in the United States past his allowed 90 days on his French passport. In November, the Air Line Pilots Association, International, presented Prevost with its 2007 Presidential Citation Award for his efforts to alert authorities to Moussaoui, according to an ALPA statement.

"(CNN) -- Let's take a little quiz. Which piece of home technology do you think uses the most electricity? A. Refrigerator . B. Laptop . C. DVR/set-top box . D. HD television . If you answered set-top box (C), you're right. That little box near your TV -- the one that plays and records cable television -- uses more electricity than a modern refrigerator, and it probably sucks down more power than the TV it's attached to, according to a recent report from the Natural Resources Defense Council. Surprised? You should be. In this day and age, we've come to expect that technology will help us save electricity, not waste it. But when it comes to electronics, there are glaring exceptions to the rule that more technology makes our lives more efficient. It seems technology has become simultaneously the hero and villain of the energy-efficiency movement. In the long term, research shows, tech will help us build energy-saving homes and will aid in our quest to get electricity from renewable sources. But, right now, our growing appetite for consumer electronics seems to be creating overlooked electricity waste and is offsetting gains made in other sectors. In recent weeks, environmental groups have made set-top boxes public enemy No. 1. ""This is a huge energy consumer that nobody knows about,"" Noah Horowitz, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said of set-top boxes. ""The secret is out that these products waste $2 billion a year in energy ... when consumers aren't using them. And we really need the industry to move forward and do a better job here."" Why is that the case? There are several problems, Horowitz said, with this piece of technology. Here are a few: . You can't turn most set-top boxes off or put them in ""sleep"" mode. If you hit the power button, all that happens is the clock gets a little dimmer; virtually no energy is actually saved by ""powering down."" Set-top boxes are everywhere; the Natural Resources Defense Council estimates there are 160 million set-top boxes in U.S. homes, about one for every two people in the country. Cable companies usually own the set-top box, so consumers don't have much choice in whether it's energy efficient (The council suggests that consumers call their cable companies and request a more efficient model that has a sleep mode). In aggregate, Americans spend $3 billion per year powering these devices, the group says. New data about how much energy these never-off set-top boxes really use have caused a sort of sea change in the energy efficiency world. Regulators are now, for the first time, considering energy efficiency regulations caps for set-top boxes and wireless routers, according to John Cymbalsky, supervisor of the appliance standards program at the U.S. Department of Energy. It's unclear whether standards will be put in place, he said, but they could be adopted without reducing the devices' performance. The proliferation of consumer technology is also a driver of the concern. This year, the average American home has 24 pieces of consumer electronics, according to a survey from the Consumer Electronics Association. Twenty years ago, a standard home only had 9.7 electronics; in 1980, it was only 2.8 per household. (The survey includes computers, gaming systems, TVs, GPS, DVD players and audio systems in its list of products). Beyond those, It seems everything these days needs to be plugged in. ""Who would have thought 20 years ago that we would need electronic books or toothbrushes or coffee grinders?"" said Owen Comstock, a research analyst at the U.S. Energy Information Administration. ""There's hardly a thing you could point to that isn't already plugged in -- and it certainly has implications for electricity use."" These devices are also getting bigger. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that there are 275 million TVs in use in the United States today -- almost one for every person. Of those, 20 million have screens that are 40 inches or larger, said Katharine Kaplan, EPA team lead for Energy Star product development. All of this adds up to a new reality for home energy use: Electronics are a larger part of our energy diets than ever before. Along with appliances, electronics made up 17% percent of an average household's energy use in 1978; in 2005, that jumped to 31%. Other home energy wasters -- like light bulbs, air conditioners and water heaters -- are subject to regulations that aim to curb energy use without degrading quality, Kaplan said. The same may happen for electronics, she said. In 2009, California became the first state to pass energy efficiency requirements for TVs. The state estimated at the time that consumers would save a total of $1 billion per year in electricity because of the standards. Overall, consumers shouldn't blame technology for energy waste, Kaplan said. If anything, new tech may be what helps get us out of this mess. Take smartphones, she said. Those Swiss army knife gadgets replace GPS devices, mobile phones and, to a certain extent, portable computers. That saves energy. Tech is also being used to make energy systems and individual appliances more efficient. And technology is being used to try to coerce people into using less power voluntarily. One company called OPOWER, for example, uses smart grid technology to tell people how much electricity they use compared with their neighbors, in hopes this will guilt them into using less power. The better technology gets, and the more widely it's adopted, the more energy we save, according to recent projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. If people develop and adopt lots of new technology, our per-person energy use will drop 34% by 2035, estimates show. If we keep using the same old stuff we were using in 2010, per person energy use will drop much less significantly: only about 10%, the report says. So, in the end, maybe tech isn't the villain after all.","A greater percentage of home energy use comes from electronics these days .

"Draper, Utah (CNN) -- Convicted killer Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed early Friday by firing squad, the Utah Department of Corrections said. Gardner, 49, is only the third person in 33 years to die by firing squad in the United States. He was killed at 12:20 a.m. MST (2:20 a.m. ET), a Corrections Department spokesman said. A hood was placed over Gardner's head and a paper target pinned to his chest. He was heavily restrained as a five-person firing squad took aim at the target and shot him, witnesses said. Journalists who witnessed the shooting said it happend quickly. One reporter said she noticed that Gardner moved after he was shot. ""It was over pretty quickly,"" said Cheryl Worsley, a local radio reporter. ""It was cleaner than I expected. It was fast. But he moved. He moved a little bit, and to some degree that bothers me."" Outside the prison in Draper Utah, there was a candlelight vigil attended by members of Gardner's family. ""He did things bad in the past, but now he realizes what he did and he changed the last couple of years,"" said his granddaughter Darian Gardner, breaking into tears. ""I got to know him the last couple of years. It sucks when you have to say goodbye to someone that is like your best friend."" The execution came after Gardner's last-ditch efforts to save himself had failed. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request Thursday to temporarily stay the execution. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert rejected two appeals by Gardner's attorneys to stop the execution, saying he had every chance to present his case. Gardner, 49, was convicted for the shooting death of attorney Michael Burdell during a botched escape attempt from custody in 1985 at a Salt Lake City, Utah, courthouse. Among the claims Gardner raised in his appeals is that he has been a death-row inmate for too long. ""He asserts that executing him now, after nearly 25 years on death-row in Utah, so lacks retributive or deterrent value that it violates the Eighth Amendment,"" Andrew Parnes, Gardner's lawyer, told the high court. A federal judge late Tuesday declined to block the execution, after Gardner claimed the procedures related to a two-day commutation hearing held by the state Board of Pardons and Parole last week violated his civil rights. The parole board Monday declined to commute Gardner's sentence to life in prison, and the Utah Supreme Court on Tuesday also denied his request for a stay. Gardner was the third person to die by rifle fire, all in Utah, since the Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976. He had a long history of escapes and was slipped a gun before he fatally shot Burdell on April 2, 1985. He was at the courthouse for a pre-trial hearing in the 1984 slaying of Melvyn Otterstrom, who was killed at the Salt Lake City bar where he was working to earn extra money. Corrections officials announced Gardner had consumed his last meal Tuesday night at 6:30 p.m., and chose to fast prior to the anticipated execution. His dinner included steak, lobster, 7-Up, apple pie and vanilla ice cream. CNN's Ashley Hayes and Bill Mears contributed to this report.","NEW: Witnesses said the execution was fast .

"(CNN) -- The rescue of 33 trapped men in Chile brings home vividly the hazards of mining. How do we defend this very blue-collar occupation, which claimed the life of my grandfather, some of his friends and almost killed me, when I was actually pinned between a rock and a hard place? Thousands of hard-working folks are killed and injured in mines worldwide each year. This eons-old industry is disparaged by many, but most of the people with close ties to it laud and defend the profession. The truth is this: Mining is hazardous but essential to the lives we want. It's an activity that produces wealth, provides raw materials for a myriad of products,  lifts people out of poverty, develops economies and yes -- kills, maims and disables some of those who work at mining. Miners, from the child coal miners of old who worked to remove ""boney"" from the breakers or carried water to the mining executives of today, should be thanked and appreciated for their contribution to civilization. Let's reconsider labeling mine operators as the exploiters of earth and humans. Let us at least acknowledge their entrepreneurial spirit, courage and  willingness to get into a business that is difficult by any standard. My father was a coal operator. But let's also be fair. Poorly managed mines exist. Some operators still are sympathetic to the doctrines of ""assumption of risk"" or ""implied negligence,"" so often cited in days gone by as a management defense against the liability of accident loss. Those who don't study industrial health and safety or haven't worked in heavy industries such as mining often ask how catastrophes -- such as the April 2010 mine explosion in West Virginia at Massey's Upper Big Branch mine or the roof collapse at the San Jose copper mine in Chile -- can happen. Mining exposes workers to lethal amounts of energy. The energies in underground mines are in states of motion or stored in moving shafts and gears; electricity; the mine roof, rib or sides of the tunnel; hydraulic cylinders; and more. An unexpected release of this energy can equal disaster. These energies must be controlled at all times and in all situations. Unfortunately, our controls are not always up to the task. The Upper Big Branch event apparently involved the methane gas accumulating into the explosive range and an ignition source. Mine roofs collapse for many reasons, such as fault lines in the strata, inadequate bolting or other mechanical controls, inadequate pillar size or improper mining methods. Mines blow up when methane gas accumulations go undetected or inundate a mine quickly before power can be cut or the area can be ventilated. Investigations into these recent mining disasters have not been completed, so the basic or root causes cannot be known yet. To prevent incidents in mining, both large and small, is no easy task. We are fighting a legion of hazards. In underground mines, stored energy in the form of  earth surrounds the worker. Miners work in a confined space that has the potential to collapse on them at any time, despite efforts to maintain the integrity of the roof, ribs and floor of the void in which they work. The challenge to identify and control hazards in this workplace is unequaled. Mine safety begins with commitment. Management must commit to preventing accidents by providing adequate resources for the identification and control of hazards. All mines must integrate safety into everything they do. There is no magic bullet to prevent injuries and loss. But it's essential to have commitment: . -- To prevention, vigilance and excellence in workplace examinations. -- To safe work practices and procedures. -- To controlling the hazards associated with the worker, the equipment, material and the environment. This takes dedication, a conscientious work force and some good fortune. A former supervisor of mine was fond of saying, ""Plan for the exception, and expect it to happen."" Perhaps for mining, this goes double. The miners who perished at Upper Big Branch were killed instantly. There was no opportunity for them to evacuate or take refuge. The miners at the San Jose copper mine might have escaped back in August had all escape routes been maintained properly. Companies must embrace an aggressive culture of safety prevention first and foremost and also  incorporate a program of mine emergency response that is second to none. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Radomsky.","Former coal miner Mark Radomsky had close call with death; grandfather killed in mine .

"(CNN) -- A Utah professor allegedly caught looking at child pornography during an airline flight said Monday at a court hearing that he is innocent, the Suffolk County, Massachusetts, district attorney's office said. A passenger aboard Grant D. Smith's Salt Lake City-to-Boston flight on Saturday spotted him looking at what appeared to be images of young girls, nude or performing sex acts, and alerted the flight crew and a family member, who in turn notified law enforcement, according to a statement from the district attorney's office. When a flight attendant asked Smith to shut down his computer, he began deleting images, prosecutor Erik Bennett said, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Police who met the plane were able to recover 66 images from the computer, said the station, citing authorities. Smith's laptop and cell phone were seized as evidence, and investigators will seek a search warrant to examine their contents thoroughly, according to the statement. ""These weren't photos of a child in the bath that a parent might keep,"" Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said. ""These were explicitly sexual and extremely disturbing."" During Monday's hearing, a judge imposed bail of $75,000 and ordered Smith to return to court on December 27. He pleaded not guilty. If Smith posts bail, the judge ordered, the father of two cannot have any unsupervised contact with children under the age of 16 or use the Internet for anything other than business purposes. He would also be required to allow law enforcement to search his personal and work computers at any time. Smith, 47, is a professor of material science and engineering at the University of Utah. He has been placed on administrative leave pending resolution of the criminal case, the school said. ""Professor Smith deserves a full and fair investigation into this issue,"" the school said in a statement. ""The University of Utah, however, has no tolerance for viewing or possessing of child pornography by any of its employees, regardless of where it occurs."" He will be fired if the allegations are proved to be true, the school said.

"(CNN) -- The Social Security Administration has just announced that beneficiaries will receive a 3.6% cost-of-living adjustment in January. The average retired worker will see a $512 increase in annual benefits -- from $14,232 to $14,744 -- though a portion will be offset by higher Medicare premiums. Social Security recipients have had to wait two years for a cost-of-living adjustment, the first time this has happened since the COLA was introduced in 1975. This is because the COLA was relatively high in 2009 because of a temporary spike in energy prices the previous year, and this was followed by a period of low inflation as the economy languished. With a super committee focused on cutting $1.5 trillion from the federal budget, you may wonder whether we can afford a 3.6% COLA. Some say the increase is overly generous (more on this in a moment). To understand why this is not so, you need to understand how the COLA works. The Social Security COLA is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W. Oddly enough, the CPI-W measures changes in the cost of living for workers, excluding retirees and other Social Security recipients who aren't in the labor force. But this measure doesn't accurately reflect the cost of living for seniors. Seniors have experienced higher inflation because they spend a greater share of their incomes on out-of-pocket medical expenses, and health costs have risen faster than overall inflation in recent decades. An index that specifically tracks the cost of living of seniors has risen roughly 0.2 percentage points faster per year than the CPI-W. Though this may not sound like much, the difference would amount to roughly $1000 more in annual benefits after 20 years if the COLA was tied to the price index for the elderly, as proposed by Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch of Florida. But rather than increasing the Social Security COLA to keep up with escalating health costs, most inside-the-beltway discussions these days revolve around adopting a lower COLA as a way to help close Social Security's modest projected shortfall. The super committee may be considering such a move. This is a terrible idea for two reasons. First, Americans across the political spectrum prefer to restore balance through revenue increases rather than benefit cuts; and second, a COLA cut has the greatest impact on the oldest old, who also tend to be the poorest old. A recent survey commissioned by the Institute for Women's Policy Research and the Rockefeller Foundation found that 61% of women and 54% of men supported increasing Social Security benefits. This isn't surprising when you consider that benefits are modest and replace a shrinking share of preretirement earnings even without additional cuts. Nor is this an anomaly: Polls have consistently found that Americans oppose benefit cuts and are willing to pay higher taxes to strengthen the program. So what's the appeal of a flatter COLA for beltway budget cutters? It's a stealth benefit cut masquerading as a technical fix. The rationale is that the current price index overstates inflation because it doesn't fully account for the ability of consumers to change their buying habits in response to price changes. In other words, if the price of oranges goes up, people will buy more apples and fewer oranges, and this change isn't fully reflected in the CPI-W even though the consumption ""basket"" evolves over time to put more weight on apples and less on oranges. The problem with this argument is that it doesn't look at the growth in costs actual beneficiaries face over time. Not only are seniors harder hit by escalating medical costs than the working-age population, but since they have roughly half the household incomes, they spend a greater share on necessities like rent and utilities. It's quite possible that the CPI-W actually overstates the ability of beneficiaries to substitute apples for oranges, or IPods for orthopedic shoes. If so, then a 3.6% COLA is not enough, not too much. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Monique Morrissey.","Social Security recipients will get a 3.6% cost-of-living-adjustment in 2012 .
Monique Morrissey says it's overdue; others say it's too generous during these hard times .

"Editor's note: Donna Brazile, a Democratic strategist, is a political contributor for CNN. She also is the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee's Voting Rights Institute, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and founder of Brazile & Associates, a Washington-based political consulting firm. Brazile, who was the campaign manager for the Al Gore-Joe Lieberman ticket in 2000, wrote ""Cooking With Grease: Stirring the Pots in American Politics,"" a memoir about her life in politics. Donna Brazile tells those in losing campaigns it will take weeks to readjust and for the world to appear normal. (CNN) -- As someone who knows from experience, I write this open letter to all staff members, volunteers and supporters of candidates who lost last Tuesday. No matter how much it hurts to lose a campaign, know that this, too, shall pass. The campaign is finally over, and you are exhausted and ready to transition to your new life or careers. But before you clean off your desk and throw away everything in the back seat of your car and the apartment you rented during the campaign, take a moment. Shake the hand of someone with whom you worked. E-mail a thank-you note to a person who helped get you through this long political season. In other words, exhale. Campaigns are not for the fainthearted. They are tough -- mentally, physically and spiritually. Once a campaign ends, an emptiness comes over you. You find yourself struggling to figure out how to become human again. Suddenly, you're going to the grocery store, reading the entire newspaper instead of the clips, and, yes, speaking in complete sentences, not sound bites or barked replies. I know what it's like to lose a presidential campaign or two or three. No matter how close the results (Gore-Lieberman) or wide the blowout (Walter Mondale-Geraldine Ferraro and Michael Dukakis-Lloyd Bentsen), you're in a state of emotional disrepair and in need of a home-cooked meal. Acknowledge your success. Think about the nonstop pace that you thrived in but would crush less hardy individuals. You lived for and met multiple deadlines. You essentially lived with the people you work with and, God bless you, you didn't kill them, though you probably picked up a few bad habits and gained more than a few unwanted pounds. Now you're sitting at that desk and trying to figure out what to do with everything you've accumulated throughout the quest to reach the city hall, the statehouse, Capitol Hill or the White House. No matter how hard you try to contain it, you're both angry and sad. Try not to vent and point fingers. It only creates wounds, mostly self-inflicted, and worse, the candidate you believed in and gave your all for doesn't deserve it. Just thinking back to 2000 still gets me upset. Once the Supreme Court ruled and Al Gore made his concession speech, I remember feeling lost and disillusioned. I was empty inside as if someone had used a vacuum cleaner and sucked out every bit of my passion for politics and public service. I had no idea what to do with my life. Nobody seemed interested in hiring me; the taint from losing closed every door on which I knocked. For a while, I was convinced I would never be accepted again as a political operative. I had no life beyond politics and no idea how to spend my days or evenings. I didn't have a dog back then. I have one now. It was hard listening to the opposition announce members of the transition team who had just spent months beating us over the head. Worse, it was hard to go back to a house I had not lived in for almost a year. In fact, I have not unpacked some boxes from my life in Tennessee. It's still too painful. I had no energy to start looking for work. I was obsessed with those chads: hanging, swinging and, my favorite, pregnant. Above all else, I did not want to quit fighting. I was angry over the election and the recount. Soon, I realized the world was going to move on, and I would be stuck in the past. The only people who understood my mood were former colleagues. Grieve. Mourn. Let it out. It's like the death of someone close to you, except there's no funeral to help bring closure, just more election analysis and pundits spewing out what you did wrong. Be gentle on yourself. It will take you weeks to readjust and for the world to appear normal. Let it be a period of self-reflection and trying to answer the unanswerable ""what ifs."" But then let it go. In a world of nonstop campaigning, the next season starts now. Give yourself a gift. Rent videos and catch up on the movies you missed. Don't read the front section of the newspaper -- they are full of the other campaign right now. Pick up a copy of People or US Weekly instead. Turn off cable and switch to the Sci Fi Channel -- snakes and flies are healthier than exit polls and demographic trend lines. Above all, call your family. Get back in touch with friends who don't do politics for a living. Remember why you made the decision to give up your life in the first place. And remember this -- you're one of the lucky few. You were on a team that made the effort. You fought the good fight. And you had a front-row seat to history. So forget wearing the loser label. The next team will snatch you up. Or you'll decide to find some other adventure that fulfills your passion. Either way, know your efforts were never in vain. Congratulations to all the team players, the winners and nonwinners who fought gallantly until the end. Take it from an old-timer who still loves politics: You will rise again to fight the next battle. So go get yourself some much needed rest and arise in a few weeks renewed with the spirit of making a difference by serving a cause greater than oneself. Your country needs you.

"West Milford, New Jersey (CNN) -- For Gary Oppenheimer, 2007 was a year of plenty. His backyard garden produced a bountiful harvest with a surplus of spaghetti squash, melons, pumpkins, tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers for his family. At the end of the season, Oppenheimer had 40 pounds of excess fresh produce -- and nowhere to take it. ""Nobody wanted more,"" he said. ""My wife wouldn't let me bring any more in the house, and I didn't want it wasted."" So Oppenheimer took the produce to a local food pantry at a battered-women's shelter. When he dropped off the food, he was struck by the response he got from the shelter worker. ""[She] thanked me profusely, and as I left she said, 'Now we can have something fresh to eat,' "" Oppenheimer recalled. ""That stuck with me because I remember walking away thinking, 'What? They have canned stuff only all the time?' "" The experience ultimately led Oppenheimer, 57, to create a way for gardeners across the country to easily share their excess produce with hungry families in their communities. In 2008, Oppenheimer became the director of the West Milford Community Garden in West Milford, New Jersey. He learned that toward the end of the summer, plots were often abandoned and good food was sometimes left to rot. He tried to find a list of his town's local food pantries online where the extra produce could be donated. A Google search showed the nearest food pantry was in another town, 25 miles away -- when in fact there were six food pantries in Oppenheimer's town of West Milford. Oppenheimer knew he had stumbled upon a gap in information that could rescue fresh produce from a wasteful end and potentially save lives. ""I realized that if I'm having this problem as a gardener, then other people across the country must be having the exact same problem,"" he said. ""I got up the next morning, and I went on the internet, and I grabbed the domain of AmpleHarvest.org."" He reached out to food pantries across the country through social networking, food banks, master gardeners, faith organizations and other groups to encourage them to sign up for inclusion in his database of food pantries. Oppenheimer enlisted the help of Web designers and in May 2009, AmpleHarvest.org was rolled out nationally. The free online resource enables food pantries to register and be listed in a central nationwide directory, and makes it possible for American gardeners to easily find the local pantries where they can donate extra produce. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes . ""The country is loaded with gardeners who have more food than they can possibly themselves use,"" Oppenheimer said. ""AmpleHarvest.org gives them the ability to easily, quickly get that food to somebody who genuinely, really needs it."" According to the Department of Agriculture, nearly 15 percent of American households have difficulty meeting their food needs. Those who rely on food pantries are often surviving on canned and processed foods. But with 41 million U.S. households growing fruits and vegetables, according to the National Gardening Association, Oppenheimer is helping green-thumbed Americans share healthier options with their neighbors in need. ""Whether it's a hanging tomato plant off your apartment terrace, or a garden ... or whether you run a farm, we all have food that's left behind,"" Oppenheimer said. ""That's the food that ... we can get into the system to help diminish hunger in the country."" Nearly 2,000 food pantries across the United States are now registered on the site. Timothy Lesko recently received fresh produce from a food pantry that had items from AmpleHarvest.org donations. Lesko said the fresh vegetables will help his family eat more healthfully. ""Me and my wife are trying to have my son be as healthy as possible. [At] the grocery store, the food's expensive, and it's hard to buy the healthier foods because we don't always have the money,"" Lesko said. ""It would be nice to see if more people could farm at home and bring whatever extra they have for the pantry."" Although Oppenheimer cannot track the amount of produce that has been donated to food pantries, he said he's received messages from numerous pantries and clients across the country who've been given food as a result of AmpleHarvest.org. He also has heard from growers who continue to donate because the website led them to local pantries. And as the food pantries continue to see results, Oppenheimer hopes his efforts will turn into a lifelong commitment for the gardeners. ""The point is to get it so that people will find it's easy and convenient to get in the car and to drop off that bag of tomatoes or carrots or apples, and then to make it a part of their regular routine, hopefully for the rest of their gardening lives.""

"(Oprah.com) -- Here is my New Year's Rockin' Eve fantasy: A lipstick-red strapless dress (think Ava Gardner in ""One Touch of Venus"") finished with a pair of Brian Atwood heels that make your legs look like the floor is the only thing that's stopping them from going on forever, a crystal flute of Veuve Clicquot, a little ""Auld Lang Syne,"" a lot of colored lights, and the man of your dreams (obviously, in this case, that would be my boyfriend -- not Clive Owen, not Benicio Del Toro, not the green-eyed guy who sold me sunglasses at Barneys -- and shame on you for dragging them into this) takes your face in his cool, confident hands and gives you the kind of kiss that makes the world fall away just as the clock strikes 12. Friends are giddy, caviar is glistening, the old year is ending, and the new year is whatever I say it is. Here is the reality: Ava Gardner put on a housecoat the minute the director yelled ""Cut,"" caviar makes my ankles swell, and New Year's Eve has never once lived up to its billing. I spent 18 years in a tiny studio apartment just a few short blocks from Times Square, and I'm here to tell you I saw things -- ugly, hard-partying, throw-uppy things -- that never made it onto any Dick Clark special. I mean, I like a disco ball and confetti as much as the next girl, but there's something about forced frivolity that feels so, well ...  forced. Then, a few years ago, I took a radical step: I quit. You heard me: I dropped out of New Year's Eve. I mailed my formal letter of resignation to Ryan Seacrest, explaining that the urge to go out and get crazy has been replaced by the urge to stay in and get sane (or a reasonable facsimile thereof). I said, ""So long, sucker,"" and I never looked back. Here's the routine I employed in the early days of my gala-free existence. I'd slip into something a little more comfortable (we're talking Detroit Red Wings jersey and tube socks). I'd cook a lovely meal and eat it at a table set so perfectly it would make Colin Cowie weep. I'd rent anything with Katharine Hepburn -- ""The Philadelphia Story, Bringing Up Baby"" (hey, if Cary Grant happens to show up, so much the better) -- and then -- drumroll, please -- I'd pick my worst set of drawers, my messiest closet, my highest mountain of old papers, and start chipping away at the chaos that had given me grief all year long. I was ruthless in my pursuit of clarity: dog-eared Crate & Barrel catalog from last spring, gone! Thomas Friedman article I meant to copy for everyone I'd ever met, out! The New Yorker with that incredible Art Spiegelman cover, bye-bye, baby -- it was great fun, but it was just one of those things. My friends would wake up with hangovers while I would wake up with a clean closet and at least half a dozen bags of stuff for Goodwill. I felt calm, I felt virtuous, I felt really, really out of it. Then one fine day, Johannes, that boyfriend I mentioned a few paragraphs back, became the father of my daughter, and suddenly the lovely meal I'd always prepare was replaced by a hot dog for Julia, fish sticks for Jonathan (boyfriend's son who doesn't eat meat), and finally, at that inevitable moment when Jules gets cranky and begins pelting Jonathan with his own fish sticks and Jonathan can't be in the vicinity of a nonvegetarian hot dog without making obnoxious gagging sounds, I'd go to plan B: macaroni and cheese for all. The Katharine Hepburn movie gave way to a Polly Pocket video, and the messes that used to drive me nuts stopped getting to me in quite the same way. I finally figured out that life is inherently messy and it takes a lot more than a New Year's Eve purge to bring it under control. So now, whenever December 31 rolls around, I abdicate control. I invite two or three close friends to stop by if they're so inclined; and if they're not, Johannes and I like to devote at least a couple of hours to horrifying the children with our general dorkiness. Last year, just before midnight, we got ourselves and the kids all bundled up and headed to the roof to watch fireworks light up the East River. We were pleasantly surprised to discover that unlike the Fourth of July, we had the roof all to ourselves. It was around 12:03 when one of us remembered that there are no fireworks over the East River on New Year's Eve. I guess sometimes you just don't get fireworks. But every once in a while, you get something even better: We stood there, huddled together at the top of the world in our flannel pajamas, down jackets, mittens, and scarves, our breath coming out in soft puffs that mingled and hung in the night, laughing like idiots --thinking that for better or for worse, these are the good old days. So good, in fact, we may do the exact same thing again this year. By Lisa Kogan from ""O, The Oprah Magazine,"" December 2007. E-mail to a friend .

"London (CNN) -- As the National Transitional Council (NTC) prepares to dissolve itself, and its replacement starts working towards Libya's new constitution and democratic institutions, it is worth reflecting why the United Kingdom and France supported the revolution back in late March. Contrary to what some believe, it was not all about oil; but oil and gas will be central to Libya's recovery. There is no doubt that if the No Fly Zone had not been imposed and the decision to back regime change was not taken, then Colonel Moammar Gadhafi would have carried out his threat to punish Benghazi for its February 17 uprising, at enormous human cost. But even if Prime Minister David Cameron and President Nicolas Sarkozy were motivated by humanitarian concerns -- and encouraged by the feasibility of protecting an enclave that had bravely won freedom for itself -- could they nevertheless be expecting a bounty in return for their support? There has been a lot of disinformation and muddled thinking on this question, starting with the letter purportedly written by the rebels in early April promising to assign France 35% of the country's oil in return for its support. The NTC has denied making such a commitment, but even if it had, would any new and legitimate government of Libya need to honor it? What, indeed, does Libya's oil wealth amount to and how should the new government manage it? The answers to these questions show just how impossible it will be for the rulers of the new Libyan state to hand out portions of its reserves and production to its friends, or for Britain, France and even Italy, which has huge political influence and vast interests in Libya's oil and gas sector, to expect many favors. Libya's past oil production of about 1.6 million barrels per day was sold on contracts arranged by the National Oil Corporation (NOC)'s opaque oil marketing committee. There is a lot which the new management can do to make this process more transparent and open and also to account for revenues more fully. It is in the country's interests to ensure the process is competitive. Any future scramble for new Libyan hydrocarbons reserves will also be competitive. Existing reserves are of course spoken for. All of Libya's production belongs either to subsidiaries of NOC or to approximately half a dozen joint ventures with European, U.S. and Canadian companies. Dozens of other companies including ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Gazprom have exploration rights to large areas of Libya's desert and sea, but so far not many of them have made discoveries. These rights are tied up in contracts most of which give a very good deal to the Libyan side. Initially the NTC said it would honor all these contracts unless there was clear evidence of corruption. It has shifted this position somewhat in response to popular pressure. The interim oil and finance minister Ali Tarhouni recently announce the formation of a committee which will examine every contract. But changes at this level are unlikely. Many of the recent contracts were awarded in highly-competitive open licensing rounds in which the scope for corruption was very limited. The older contracts could be more doubtful, but these are the producing contracts -- the country's life blood. The government may make the bold move of publishing them, but cannot cancel them without huge cost. If anything is up for grabs in the Libya of the future, it could be service contracts to help the state oil company improve production from its existing fields and further exploration rights for gas. In the two months since the Gadhafi regime fell, the NTC has brought oil production back up to 300-400,000 barrels per day. From now every extra 100,000 barrels will be more difficult, costly and time-consuming to bring back. Thousands of workers have to return, and a huge amount of investment is required to recapitalize the oil field camps, many of which have been looted over the past six months. Some wells will also need repair as will the main export terminals in the Gulf of Sirte, which suffered the most damage in the conflict. The gas potential is huge and largely unrealized. Libya already sends gas to Italy by pipeline, but it is a much less significant producer than its neighbor Algeria. It would like to find more gas and take a larger slice of the European market. Shell and BP are amongst those already involved in expensive projects to make this happen. New exploration contracts could be issued: French and British companies could benefit. Italy's Eni is already a predominant player, and has returned to the country more quickly than its competitors. But they are not the only contenders. Some analysts expect that Qatar, holder of the world's third largest gas reserves and a vital supporter of the NTC, may work alongside Libya to market any future gas to Europe, perhaps cooperating on Liquid Natural Gas developments. In any case, the gas has to be found first. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Hamilton .","The UK and French support of the Libyan revolution was not all about oil .
However, there are questions around whether they expect a bounty in return for their support .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge says he successfully countered an effort by senior Bush administration officials to raise the nation's terror alert level in the days before the 2004 presidential vote. Ex-Homeland Security Chief Tom Ridge says he was pushed to raise the terror alert before the 2004 election. ""An election-eve drama was being played out at the highest levels of our government"" after Osama bin Laden released a pre-election message critical of President George W. Bush, writes Ridge in his new book, ""The Test of Our Times."" Attorney General John Ashcroft and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld strongly advocated raising the security threat level to ""orange,"" even though Ridge believed a threatening message ""should not be the sole reason to elevate the threat level."" The former Pennsylvania governor also writes that he saw no reason for the move, which he now calls a bad idea, because additional security precautions had already been taken in advance of the election. ""We certainly didn't believe the tape alone warranted action, and we weren't seeing any additional intelligence that justified it. In fact, we were incredulous,"" Ridge said of the push. ""... I wondered, 'Is this about security or politics?' ""  Watch panelists discuss Ridge's allegations » . The idea that an attack might take place had been discussed, he says. ""But at this point there was nothing to indicate a specific threat and no reason to cause undue public alarm. ... It also seemed possible to me and to others around the table that something could be afoot other than simple concern about the country's safety."" In the end, the threat level was not raised. Frances Townsend, a former Homeland Security adviser to President Bush and now a CNN contributor, denied politics played any role in the request to raise the threat level. ""There was a debate,"" Townsend said Thursday on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""Tom Ridge wasn't the only person in that meeting who suggested that the terror alert shouldn't be raised. At no time was there any discussion of politics at that meeting. And the president was made a recommendation, a consensus recommendation from the council that he accepted, not to raise the terror alert."" According to 2004 exit polls, one in five voters said terrorism was the most important issue to them. Of those, 86 percent voted for Bush, 14 percent for Democratic candidate John Kerry. Ridge said that he had mixed emotions about the incident at the time, and that after it ended, he knew he had to follow through on his plans to leave the government.

"(CNN) -- Candy Torres drove nonstop for 21 hours to see the launch of space shuttle Challenger in June 1983. She had seen shuttle launches before, but this trip from Princeton, New Jersey, to Cape Canaveral, Florida, was different: Sally Ride was about to become the first female U.S. astronaut to leave the Earth's atmosphere. Torres was proud to watch the first female astronaut take flight. She was even more proud at the thought of Ride's achievement inspiring more women to work in the space program. In a field that was almost entirely dominated by men, Torres had been working as a satellite engineer for seven years. Torres shared photos of the launch with CNN iReport as NASA prepared for the final flight in its shuttle program. She recalled the moment of joy these pictures capture: Standing in front of the towering mass of the shuttle Challenger, she smiles as she shoulders the camera she used to record the event. ""Seeing the launch was a confirmation of what I had held on to,"" she said. ""Women could achieve their dreams."" Torres, the 57-year-old daughter of Puerto Rican immigrants, is a self-proclaimed ""technorican,"" a portmanteau for her love of technology and her heritage. It's a moniker she earned through years of work: She studied astrophysics at Rutgers, worked on experimental satellite research at Princeton and developed next-generation software for the shuttle program. She came of age with classic science fiction, like the original ""Star Trek"" television series. Growing up first in the Bronx and then Newark, New Jersey, the steel palisades of the New York City skyline resembled to her some kind of otherworldly spaceship docked in the Hudson, fueling her already-wild imagination. ""I thought about the future a lot as a child, because I recognized that the present and the past weren't very happy places for people,"" she said. ""So, to me, the future was always going to be better. ""And as a Puerto Rican, I really connected with the diversity of the Enterprise's crew, that vision of a utopian, multi-ethnic future."" Weaned on the vision of an enlightened spacefaring society that ""Star Trek"" offered, and inspired by President John F. Kennedy's call to put an American on the moon, Torres dedicated herself at an early age to working in the space program. ""It was easy to aspire to a future like that where people got along regardless of race or religion, just because they were human. Being a lifelong 'Star Trek' fan made me see the space program not just as sci-fi, but as a positive vision of the future, at a time when we desperately needed those positive visions."" But as a teenager, Torres faced a chorus of no's every time she talked with her family and friends about her nascent passion for space exploration. ""No,""Puerto Ricans aren't astrophysicists. ""No,"" women can't be astronauts. ""I always knew that if I wanted to reach my goals, I was going to have to work hard and never quit,"" she said. ""I had to work through a lot of personal things too, because I was so self-conscious. I was a fireball inside, but socially I was very uncomfortable around other people a lot of the time. But when it's something that matters to me, the fireball comes out!"" At the age of 14, she joined the Civil Air Patrol [CAP], and learned to fly a plane before she could drive a car. As one of the handful of female cadets in her troop, she learned marching, drilling and wilderness survival through one of the few such programs in which girls were allowed to participate. Yet her dreams were seemingly cut short by the institutionalized sexism that was all too common in the United States before the women's rights movement entered public consciousness. ""I guess the moment that crystallized it for me was the day we found out that the girl cadets couldn't go on a search-and-rescue mission as part of our classes,"" she said. ""We were supposed to go find a businessman who was lost in the woods, but the girls were not allowed."" These denials only strengthened her resolve, equipping Torres with a purpose and drive to match the skills she had already developed in aviation, math and science. At Rutgers, she enrolled in an aerospace engineering program where she was one of fewer than 10 women in classes with hundreds of men. ""They were definitely not happy about having women in the class,"" she said. ""I didn't have any kind of support system. I didn't get to know any of the other women, and the guys basically ignored me."" After four years studying topics as broad as astrophysics, astronomy and theoretical geology, she graduated in 1976 with an interdisciplinary major in space science. The day after graduating from Rutgers, she was offered a job at Princeton, where she aided in the development of the experimental OAO-3C 'Copernicus' satellite program. She worked in the university's astrophysics department for seven years. There, she frequently collaborated with Dr. Lyman Spitzer, one of the principal architects of the Hubble Telescope. In 1983, only a few weeks after Sally Ride's historic launch, Torres was finally offered her dream job: A post at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. She worked there for two decades as a software engineer and astrophysicist, first on the Space Shuttle program and then as a systems engineer for the International Space Station. Her favorite souvenir from her career at NASA is a life-size cutout of the half-Klingon engineer B'Elanna Torres from ""Star Trek: Voyager."" The cutout's story began when Roxann Dawson, the actor who portrayed the fictional Torres, visited Johnson Space Center in the late 1990s. Though the two never spoke one-on-one, Torres joked that she was ""the real Engineer Torres."" When Dawson later heard about the quip, she sent her the cutout. For Torres, a simple cardboard cutout from ""Star Trek"" embodies both the adventurous spirit of the space program and the personal convictions that carried her through life. ""I will quote my friend Story Musgrave, an astronaut who did some of the Hubble walks, and a former classmate of mine,"" she went on. ""He would show a picture of a child at the beach, holding a seashell. We're all born to be explorers, just like a little child marveling at a seashell. ""I remember being like that, and I like to think I still am. With a lot of people, it gets worked out of you over the years, but I always held on to that childlike willingness to ask 'What if?'""","Candy Torres' love of ""Star Trek"" inspired her to dedicate her life to NASA .

"(CNN) -- Worried that her job might be cut in Texas, IT professional Elisa Sumner took a big step by deciding to work on the other side of the world in Shanghai, China. Sumner's high-tech company in Austin, Texas, was laying off people in her area of the business and hiring aggressively in Asia. The 45-year-old decided to take a job in Shanghai and move with her company, even though she could have eventually found work elsewhere in the United States. Sumner's husband, Joel Sumner, a senior research and development manager, followed her to China with a job that has evolved into something ""bigger"" than his old one. In addition to their careers, Elisa Sumner said the move was a chance at a ""new and interesting"" life experience for both of them, because they had never lived outside the United States together. ""I probably could have found another job in Austin, but it would have taken some time to find a position given my skill set and seniority,"" Sumner said. The couple, married 12 years, arrived in China with just three suitcases each (and a small shipment of items) and left their two adult children behind for their new overseas careers. So far, they're glad they made the move two years ago and say, ""It has been an amazing experience filled with a lot of adventure."" How common is the Sumners' story? Although it is encouraged, a U.S. State Department official said Americans working in China are not required to register their status with the United States, so it's not exactly clear how many expatriates are employed there. The Chinese haven't made it clear, either, how many Americans are working in their country. Scott Kennedy, director of the Research Center for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University, said long-term residence there is still no more than a niche option for the vast majority of Americans, but the total number of Americans is rising, as is their status. Kennedy said there used to be a very small Western expat community in Beijing and Shanghai, but those communities have grown substantially, and smaller communities have emerged in other Chinese coastal and inland cities. It's not just China that has captured the attention of Americans. Gregory Hubbs, editor-in-chief of Transitions Abroad, a clearinghouse for international job advice and opportunities, has seen a significant spike in inquiries from Americans interested in expat employment since the economy began to tank in 2007. ""The year 2010 represented the high-water mark thus far in terms of such inquiries,"" said Hubbs. ""We are receiving many more submissions and inquiries currently from individuals who are or who have been confronting the consequences of the weak economy."" Hubbs said Europe is the most popular destination for work abroad in terms of searches, with Italy, France, Spain, the UK and Germany topping the list. A spokeswoman for the Peace Corps said applications are trending up for her organization as well. ""In 2010, the agency received nearly 13,500 applications for volunteer positions around the world,"" said Kelly McCormack. Teaching jobs are spiking, too, according to Matthew Redman with the Council on International Educational Exchange. He said there are more people participating in teach abroad programs than pre-2008. Work life for the Sumners in China . For the Sumners, assimilating into the culture has not always been easy. But they are glad they've accepted the challenge and they've made new friends and professional contacts along the way. ""When I moved to Shanghai, there were a number of people who didn't know why I had come here and it was hard to break down the walls with some of my colleagues,"" said Elisa Sumner. ""Once my new team realized I was here to help and that I could use my network and knowledge from the U.S. to bolster the Asia-based team, things improved dramatically."" The language barrier has been challenging to navigate, too, she said. ""If the person you are interacting with has good English, then you can develop some sort of relationship or bond with them,"" Joel Sumner said. ""But if we have to resort to our functional Chinese, we're interacting at a very primitive level focused on accomplishing the task at hand."" At work, the Sumners are surrounded by people who speak English, but will rely on interpreters from time to time. ""In my workplace, nearly everyone is Chinese and is a graduate of a Chinese engineering school,"" Joel Sumner said. ""They all learn English starting in elementary school."" Everyone's situation is different, but the Sumners said the overall work conditions for them are similar to what they experienced in America, because they work for U.S.-based tech companies. ""My building is clean and secure in a very large office complex with about 500 other major high-tech companies,"" Joel Sumner said. Although China is communist, the Sumners said it almost seems ""more capitalist than the U.S. at times,"" because state-controlled industries are being privatized. ""The Chinese seem generally more hungry for achievement than the U.S. -- it is a nation of entrepreneurs,"" Joel Sumner said. There are other differences. ""We do worry about who is reading our e-mail or listening to our phone calls, but it is more fleeting than some cold-war thriller movie,"" Joel Sumner said. Elisa Sumner said work-life balance for them in China is different than in the United States. ""You rarely see people working through lunch, on holidays or on the weekends -- things that were common to us at home,"" she said. Money matters . Overseas work and lifestyle experiences greatly differ from person to person and city to city. In China, Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong are expensive places to live, with prices for top-range apartments reaching $10,000 (U.S.) monthly rent or more, according to a variety of published reports. Americans can live relatively cheaply (U.S. $1,000 a month) if they stick to the living standards of the lower- and middle-class ends of the local population. Outside China's big cities, prices for everything drop, often by more than half. The Sumners said they are paid roughly the same as they would make in the United States and live in an above-average 1,500 square foot apartment in Shanghai's Changning District, which is partially supplemented by their employers. (Their 22-year-old son watches over their 2,400 square foot suburban home back in Texas.) The couple has a part-time house cleaner who comes to their Chinese apartment twice a week for 2-3 hours a time and she is paid $75 (U.S.) a month, which they consider a nice luxury. They don't own a car (they drove everywhere in Texas) and take the subway to work or use an electric scooter, which is typical for living in Shanghai. As residents of China, the Sumners pay Chinese and U.S. taxes and ""pay a little more in taxes than we paid in the U.S."" ""Aside from housing, living in China is a lot cheaper for us than the U.S.,"" Joel Sumner said. So how do you find a job overseas? Some companies move their employees overseas for work, like the Sumners. Websites such as Transitions Abroad and Go Abroad offer travel guides and employment listings for people looking to do it on their own. Hubbs offered five tips on making the move overseas: . 1) Be open-minded when pursuing work abroad. ""As a result of the current global economic situation, it often helps to broaden geographic and career pursuit possibilities based on factors including, but not limited to, commercial areas of growth, potential earnings, and the related standard of living,"" said Hubbs. 2) Research your destination in every possible way. Hubbs said, ""Research as much as possible the economic drivers and conditions of the destination country, and then pursue work in either growth areas, or in areas where you can directly apply your developed expertise."" 3) Students and new grads: Consider resumé-building experiences. Examples of such positions include, but are not limited to, internships, au-pair work, leading travel tours, working at youth hostels or on cruise ships. These types of jobs, while they do not pay much, allow for interesting and often life-changing travel along with networking opportunities for future professions, said Hubbs. 4) Assess what you bring to the table. Given the fact that many countries across the globe are under economic pressure, in many instances there are fewer opportunities for those who come from other countries seeking work opportunities. Therefore, it is important to determine how one's skill set would give them a competitive advantage, Hubbs said. 5) Pursue entrepreneurship. Hubbs said the internet continues to provide more ""location-neutral"" work opportunities for those with an entrepreneurial spirit. ""Blogging or building a website to support their travels remotely in relatively inexpensive countries is becoming a viable option for those willing to learn new technologies while networking,"" he said.","An American couple moves to China for work and tells their story to CNN.com.

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States apologized Friday for a 1946-1948 research study in which people in Guatemala were intentionally infected with sexually transmitted diseases. A statement by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius called the action ""reprehensible."" ""We deeply regret that it happened, and we apologize to all the individuals who were affected by such abhorrent research practices,"" the joint statement said. ""The conduct exhibited during the study does not represent the values of the United States, or our commitment to human dignity and great respect for the people of Guatemala."" President Barack Obama called his Guatemalan counterpart Friday ""offering profound apologies and asking pardon for the deeds of the 1940s,"" President Alvaro Colom told CNN en Espanol in a telephone interview from Guatemala City. ""Though it happened 64 years ago, it really is a profound violation of human rights,"" said Colom, who said the report took him by surprise. Clinton called him on Thursday, he said. ""She too offered her apologies,"" he said, adding that she told him she was ashamed the United States had been involved in the matter. Asked whether Guatemala was planning to take legal action, Colom said, ""That's part of the work of the commission."" ""We reject these types of actions, obviously,"" said Guatemala presidential spokesman Ronaldo Robles. ""We know that this took place some time ago, but this is unacceptable and we recognize the apology from Secretary Clinton."" The scientific investigation, called the U.S. Public Health Service Sexually Transmitted Disease Inoculation Study of 1946-1948, aimed at determining the effectiveness of penicillin in treating or preventing syphilis after subjects were exposed to the disease. Gonorrhea and chancres were also studied. Penicillin was a relatively new drug at the time. The tests were carried out on female commercial sex workers, prisoners in the national penitentiary, patients in the national mental hospital and soldiers. According to the study, more than 1,600 people were infected: 696 with syphilis, 772 with gonorrhea and 142 with chancres. The study came to light recently when Wellesley College researcher Susan Reverby found the archived but unpublished notes from the project as she was researching a similar study that was conducted between 1932 and 1972 in Tuskegee, Alabama. That study included nearly 400 poor African-American men with preexisting syphilis whose disease was allowed to progress without treatment. Researchers did not infect the subjects, but they did not tell them they had the disease either. The Tuskegee study was done under the direction of Dr. John C. Cutler, a U.S. Public Health Service medical officer who died in 2003. ""I was doing what historians do,"" said Reverby, a professor of the history of ideas and women and gender issues, who has written a book on the Tuskegee study. She went to the University of Pittsburgh, where Cutler had taught, and searched through an archive of his papers. ""There was nothing on Tuskeegee in the papers, but there was this report of the Guatemala study,"" she told CNN in a telephone interview. ""I started to read, and I almost fell off my chair."" She found that Cutler also led the research in Guatemala. It was carried out there, in part, she said, because prostitution was legal and prisoners were allowed to bring prostitutes in for sex. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the U.S. National Institutes for Health, told reporters that the Guatemala study represented ""a dark chapter in the history of medicine."" The study ""appears to have been funded"" by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, he said, citing four primary ethical violations: 1) study subjects ""were members of one or more vulnerable populations;"" 2) there is no evidence they gave informed consent; 3) they were often deceived about what was being done to them; 4) they were intentionally infected with pathogens that could cause serious illness without their understanding or consent. U.S. officials said Friday that ethical safeguards would prevent such abuses from occurring today. An Institute of Medicine task force will look at what happened in the study, and a group of ethics experts will convene to review the matter and report on how best to ensure such abuses do not recur, Collins said. ""The study is a sad reminder that adequate human subject safeguards did not exist a half-century ago,"" the U.S. statement said. ""Today, the regulations that govern U.S.-funded human medical research prohibit these kinds of appalling violations."" Collins said the published literature contains more than 40 other U.S.-based studies ""where intentional infection was carried out with what we could now consider to be completely inadequate consent in the United States."" Many of those studies were funded by the Public Health Service, he said. But at least some people believed at the time that the experiment was flawed, according to Wellesley's Reverby, who cited this reaction to Cutler's work from his supervisor, PHS physician R.C. Arnold: ""I am a bit, in fact more than a bit, leery of the experiment with insane people,"" Arnold said. ""They can not give consent, do not know what is going on, and if some good organization got wind of the work, they would raise a lot of smoke. I think the soldiers would be best or the prisoners for they can give consent. Maybe I'm too conservative  ... In the report, I see no reason to say where the work was done and the type of volunteer."" ""The vast majority"" of study subjects were adequately treated for their illness, Collins said. One subject died during an epileptic seizure, though it was not clear that the death was related to the study, he added. Cutler's work helped refine testing procedures and suggested a better means of prevention, but ""made little impact on syphilis research,"" Reverby concluded. Clinton and Sebelius said the United States is launching an investigation and also convening a group of international experts to review and report on the most effective methods to make sure all human medical research worldwide meets rigorous ethical standards. ""As we move forward to better understand this appalling event, we reaffirm the importance of our relationship with Guatemala, and our respect for the Guatemalan people, as well as our commitment to the highest standards of ethics in medical research,"" the U.S. statement said. CNN's Arthur Brice, Nick Valencia and Tom Watkins and CNNRadio's Shelby Lin Erdman contributed to this report.","Obama offers ""profound apologies""

"(CNN) -- For 17 years, NASA rovers have laid down tire tracks on Mars. But details the space agency divulged this week about its next Martian exploration vehicle underscored NASA's ultimate goal. Footprints are to follow someday. The last three rovers -- Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity -- confirmed the Red Planet's ability to support life and searched for signs of past life. The Mars rover of the next decade will hone in on ways to sustain future life there, human life. ""The 2020 rover will help answer questions about the Martian environment that astronauts will face and test technologies they need before landing on, exploring and returning from the Red Planet,"" said NASA's William Gerstenmaier who works on human missions. This will include experiments that convert carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere into oxygen ""for human respiration."" Oxygen could also be used on Mars in making rocket fuel that would allow astronauts to refill their tanks. Twin rovers . The 2020 rover is the near spitting image of Curiosity and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced plans to launch the new edition not long after Curiosity landed on Mars in 2012. But the 2020 rover has new and improved features. The Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment, or MOXIE for short, is just one. There are super cameras that will send back 3D panoramic images and spectrometers that will analyze the chemical makeup of minerals with an apparent eye to farming. ""An ability to live off the Martian land would transform future exploration of the planet,"" NASA said in a statement. The 2020 rover will also create a job for a future mission to complete, once the technology emerges to return to Earth from Mars. It will collect soil samples to be sent back for lab analysis at NASA. Mars since 1964 . In the 1960s, the public focus on NASA centered on missions to the moon. Neil Armstrong, who took his ""one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind"" 45 years ago, was the first human to set foot on a celestial body. But by then, the space agency had already sent a satellite to Mars -- the first in 1964. In 1976, the first two landers, Viking 1 and 2, touched down on its surface. The first rover, Pathfinder, began rolling around 20 years later. In 2016, NASA plans to send a new stationary lander, InSight, to Mars to drop a probe into the ground and research the planet's core. It's currently undergoing testing. The future mission to bring back soil samples collected by the Mars 2020 rover is to be robotic. It's not clear when Earthlings can look forward to the next small step for a human that's a giant leap for humankind.","The Mars 2020 rover looks a lot like the Curiosity rover .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York judge has thrown out a lawsuit filed by a group of atheists, ruling that a pair of World Trade Center beams in the shape of a cross can be included in a memorial museum of the 9/11 terror attacks. American Atheists filed the lawsuit in July, arguing that the ""government enshrinement of the cross"" was an impermissible mingling of church and state. The World Trade Center cross, two intersecting steel beams that held up when the twin towers collapsed on September 11, 2001, is seen as iconic to some. In 2011: Cross moved to permanent 9/11 Memorial site . The cross was moved in July from near a church to its new home at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, located at ground zero in Lower Manhattan. Father Brian Jordan, a Franciscan priest who ministered to workers clearing the area after the attacks, led a ceremonial blessing of the cross. Federal Judge Deborah Batts of the Southern District of New York ruled Thursday that display of the beams is permissible because they bear historical importance. Note lets family know 9/11 victim went down fighting . Named defendants included the museum, New Jersey, the city of New York, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. ""The museum is gratified by the decision,"" Mark Alcott, the lawyer for the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, told CNN on Friday. ""The plan has been to display this as one of hundreds and hundreds of artifacts ... because it is part of the history of the recovery efforts after the 911 attacks. ""For some of these people, [the cross] had symbolic significance,"" he continued, referring to first responders. ""They treated it as a religious object and it gave them a great deal of comfort at a difficult time. The 9/11 museum is simply depicting what happened."" David Silverman, president of American Atheists, told CNN, ""We are angry that we have to have this fight."" Silverman said it was clear that the cross was regarded as sacred, noting that it ""was installed in a religious service on consecrated ground by a priest. How anyone could say that is secular is beyond me."" September 11 ""affected all Americans, not just Christians,"" Silverman continued. ""We will not sit and let the 500 atheists who died on 9/11 go unnoticed."" Silverman said his group plans to appeal the decision. ""We are confident that we will eventually win this case and that cross will be removed, or atheists will be allowed to have our own symbol in there,"" he said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has rejected congressional calls for the justices to adhere officially to the same ethics rules binding on other federal judges, including when to recuse in cases involving possible conflicts of interest. ""The Court does not plan to adopt the Code of Conduct for United States Judges through a formal resolution,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a letter released Tuesday to Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont. But Roberts said he and his eight colleagues would -- on their own initiative -- continue to follow the same rules as other judges when it comes to accepting and reporting on outside income, honoraria, and gifts. Unlike other members of the federal judiciary, Supreme Court justices decide for themselves whether a conflict of interest exists, requiring disqualification. Like other judges, they file yearly disclosure reports on their financial investments, travels, and any money earned from such things as writing books, giving speeches or teaching. The binding Code of Conduct of U.S. Judges requires recusal when ""impartiality might reasonably be questioned,"" including having a family member directly involved in the case or if there is a financial interest, such as a justice owning stock in a company being sued. Leahy had asked the nation's highest court to release an internal, informal 1991 resolution clarifying the justices' unofficial intention to follow the code. ""We will make the 1991 resolution adopting the Judicial Conference regulations on gifts and on outside earned income available to the public,"" wrote Roberts. Leahy had no immediate response to the court's decision, but groups supporting greater disclosure said they were disappointed. ""The Supreme Court is the highest court in our land and should be held to the highest ethics standards, not the lowest,"" said Common Cause President Bob Edgar. ""This is yet another disappointing sign from the Roberts Court that it considers itself above the laws and rules the rest of us must abide by."" The judicial code of conduct has recently become a divisive political issue as the justices prepare to hear arguments next month in the high-stakes appeal over the health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama. Political advocacy groups on both sides -- including members of Congress -- have separately called on Justices Elena Kagan and Clarence Thomas to recuse themselves from hearing and deciding the case. Kagan, 51, was the administration's top government lawyer handling appeals to the Supreme Court. Her nomination by Obama in May 2010, and the weeks leading up to it, came at a time when Congress had passed -- and the president signed -- the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The health care reform law would significantly change how Americans receive medical services and has been the subject of six current appeals pending at the high court. Twenty-eight states and dozens of individual plaintiffs have opposed the law. Critics say she was directly involved in the administration's initial legal strategy of the health care law. Congressional Democrats have been among those separately calling on Thomas to pull out, citing his recent lapse in reporting the income of his wife for 13 straight years, as required by federal disclosure laws. Virginia Thomas had worked for, and later founded, her own advocacy group, Liberty Central. Since she has openly opposed the health care bill, many liberals have said her political activities raise questions about Justice Thomas' own judicial independence and impartiality. The court by tradition will not openly discuss when to step aside in a pending case, and that is true with Thomas and Kagan. Roberts in his year-end report in December said he had ""complete confidence"" in his Supreme Court colleagues to fairly decide whether to remove themselves from hot-button cases such as health care reform . ""The Supreme Court does not sit in judgment of one its own members' decision whether to recuse in the course of deciding a case,"" he said of his bench mates, while not directly addressing the Kagan and Thomas recusal demands. ""They are jurists of exceptional integrity and experience whose character and fitness have been examined through a vigorous appointment and confirmation process. I know that they each give careful consideration to any recusal questions that arise."" That letter prompted Leahy and four fellow Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee this month to seek more information from the high court on the ethics issue. Leahy and other lawmakers are also pushing legislation mandating the Supreme Court open its public sessions to cameras. Again, the ultimate unilateral decision on that would be left with justices, a majority of whom have expressed severe reservations about the proposal.","Supreme Court justices will continue to follow same rules as other judges, says Roberts .
He says the court will release an internal, informal 1991 resolution .
It's strictly up to justices to decide whether they should recuse themselves .
Various groups want two justices to recuse themselves from the health care reform case ."

"(CNN) -- A former Rutgers University student convicted of spying on and intimidating his gay roommate says he was not bullying his roommate and he doesn't hate gay people. ""He knew I wasn't trying to intimidate him and scare him because he was gay. I think he understood that,"" Dharun Ravi, told ABC television network news program ""20/20"" in several excerpts released on Thursday. Ravi was found guilty this month of all counts against him -- including invasion of privacy and the more severe charges of bias intimidation -- in a case that thrust cyberbullying and homophobia into the national spotlight. Ravi is scheduled to be sentenced on May 21. Since prosecutors were able to prove that Ravi's actions were born of a gay bias, the possible sentence doubles from up to five years to 10 years behind bars. Despite the conviction, Ravi told ABC that the story that has been told about the incident is wrong. ""I felt like I was being used by everybody. They were taking revenge on me, even though what they think happened isn't what happened,"" Ravi told ABC. His roommate, Tyler Clementi, an 18-year-old freshman, killed himself in September 2010 by jumping off the George Washington Bridge and into the Hudson River after learning that Ravi had secretly spied on his sexual encounter with another man using a webcam and then sharing the footage. Clementi's death stirred debate about bullying, with President Barack Obama releasing a videotaped message condemning it. A few months later, New Jersey legislators enacted stricter laws to protect against bullying in schools. Ravi turned down a plea deal offered by Middlesex County prosecutors that would have allowed him to avoid jail time in exchange for undergoing counseling, doing 600 hours of community service and disposing of any information that could identify the man who appeared in the Web video with Clementi. Prosecutors also offered to help him avoid deportation, though they said they could not guarantee it. Ravi, who had been studying on a visa at the New Jersey university, did not testify on his own behalf.","Dharun Ravi, 20, was found guilty of bias intimidation and invasion of privacy .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Clark James Gable, 22, the only grandson of legendary actor Clark Gable, was playing with a laser when police arrested him, charging him with a felony this week, his manager told CNN Saturday. Gable is accused of pointing the laser inside the cockpit of a Los Angeles police helicopter flying over Hollywood, authorities said. A friend of Gable, whom the manager said was driving the car Gable was in, is facing the same felony charge, police said. ""Boys will be boys, and he was playing with what he thought was a toy and not a felony piece,"" Roxane Davis, Gable's manager, told CNN. ""From what he told me from jail, he had it out the window and he was shining it out the window, and the next thing he knew was that he had a spotlight on him. ""It's terrible. He was crying yesterday from jail,"" she added. He was being held on $250,000 bail. She described the alleged crime ""a huge mistake"" and that Gable, an actor, ""regrets anything about it."" Gable, of Canoga Park, California, admitted to authorities that he was pointing the laser recklessly, Davis said. Gable is charged with laser discharge. ""Obviously it wasn't intentional. Nobody knew it was a felony,"" Davis said. ""They sell those things left and right, and he got it from his mother at a family reunion in Utah over the 4th of July weekend."" CNN left a message Saturday for Gable's attorney. Gable was released from jail Friday in what Davis described as a publicity stunt by a bail bond firm that posted the bail and arranged for TV news cameras to film his release. Gable didn't authorize the stunt and believes his sister, Kayley, 24, a reality show star, arranged the event, but Gable won't challenge how the firm bailed him out of jail, Davis said. The alleged crime occurred about 10 p.m. Thursday when a police helicopter was patrolling Hollywood. A tactical flight officer noticed a bright green laser light illuminating the cockpit, said Lt. Alex Medel of the Hollywood division. The pilot took evasive action, and the officer saw a vehicle as the source of the laser light, Medel said. The helicopter asked a patrol unit to intercept the car. The car's occupant struck the helicopter two more times with the laser, police spokeswoman Norma Eisenman said. Davis said the car belonged to and was being driven by Maximillian Anderson, who is a friend of Gable's. Anderson, 23, of Calabasas, California, was released from jail Friday after his family posted bond, Davis said. Gable's court date has been scheduled for August 26, according to authorities. Gable just completed filming the lead role in a thriller called ""Looking for Clara"" in Italy in June, Davis said. On Thursday, he will return to an eight-week acting school program at the New York Film Academy in Los Angeles, Davis said. Before becoming an actor a year ago, Gable was working at a pet store in Agoura Hills, California, unloading dog food for $9 an hour and working 56 hours a week, Davis said.","The laser discharge offense is a felony .

"(CNN) -- A powerful explosion rocked Aleppo, Syria's most populous city, late Friday, killing a guard at an office of President Bashar al-Assad's ruling Baath Party, opposition groups reported. The cause of the blast was not immediately known. Heavy gunfire was heard in its aftermath, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. Earlier, Syrian authorities foiled a suicide bombing in the city, state media said. The action comes a day after suicide attackers killed dozens in the capital of Damascus, a strike that heightened tensions in a country caught in the grip of a popular uprising. Authorities ""intercepted a stolen booby-trapped minibus"" that an attacker tried to detonate in Aleppo's densely populated neighborhood of al-Shaar, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. A SANA correspondent quoted a source in Aleppo province as saying that ""competent authorities intercepted the terrorist after he hit two policemen, then he blew himself up with an explosive belt, killing himself,"" the news agency said. The source said that authorities searching the minibus found four tanks with ""a big quantity of explosives."" An initial state TV report said the forces killed the bomber before he detonated his vehicle carrying 1,200 kilograms, or 2,645 pounds of explosives. Damascus and Aleppo have been the scene of a flurry of attacks in recent months. Aleppo, a commercial center and long a bastion of support for al-Assad, had been largely spared in Syria's 14 months of bloody uprising. But recent protests and violence there could signal a significant shift. Elsewhere Friday, a number of explosions were reported in cities across the country, including four in Daraa and several in Hama, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition group. At least 20 people, including the Aleppo security guard, were killed across the country, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Syria's foreign ministry underscored the urban violence in identical letters to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and U.N. Security Council President Agshin Mehdiyev, who is the Azerbaijani ambassador to the United Nations. The letters said that Damascus, Aleppo and other Syrian cities ""witnessed several terrorist bombings over the last weeks"" that left dozens of innocent people dead, the state-run news agency reported. The letters said the country is facing ""terrorist"" assaults spearheaded by groups that get arms and money from entities encouraging the actions. The letters said the ""armed terrorist groups"" are violating international envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan and attacked a convoy from the U.N. observer team Wednesday in Daraa province. There were no injuries in that bombing attack. Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, the head of the observer team, was in the convoy. ""Syria will move forward to combat terrorism and defend its people and sovereignty and preserve security and stability in it,"" the letters said. Syria blames ""terrorists"" for the attacks, the term it uses to describe the opposition and rationalize security forces' crackdown. Some analysts said the attacks raise concerns about the presence of jihadist elements in Syria, noting Thursday's Damascus strikes resemble suicide car bombings during the sectarian violence in Iraq in the past decade. But opposition groups have said the regime is responsible for the violence that erupted after it began a crackdown on peaceful protests in March 2011. That fierce clampdown spurred a grassroots uprising against the regime. The United Nations estimates that at least 9,000 people have died in the conflict, while opposition groups put the death toll at more than 11,000. The opposition Syrian National Council said al-Assad's regime staged Thursday's deadly suicide bombings in Damascus ""to spur chaos, disrupt the work of the international observers and divert attention away from other crimes being committed by its forces elsewhere."" ""In orchestrating such acts,"" the council said Friday, ""the regime seeks to prove its claims of the existence of 'armed terrorist gangs' in the country that are hindering its so-called 'efforts of political reform.' "" More than 55 people were killed and 370 were injured in Thursday's two car bombings near a military intelligence center in the Qazzaz neighborhood of Damascus, the nation's capital. It was the deadliest attack since the uprising against the regime began. But the council questioned how the bombers could have made it past security to conduct the bombings. ""The security branch is heavily guarded and surrounded with cement barriers at a distance from the exterior fence. It would be reckless to carry out such an attack, because it would in no way impact the security building. ""One of the cars was loaded with a large amount of explosive materials. How is it possible that these explosives made it past hundreds of security checkpoints surrounding the entrance to the capital?"" With the focus on the attacks and their aftermath, ""the regime carried out arbitrary arrests across the country, most notable in the Damascus suburb of Damir,"" the council said. The latest bombings didn't deter Syrians from taking to the streets in protest across the country Friday, the day opposition groups have been staging nationwide protests. But the attacks cast doubt on the effectiveness of the U.N.-Arab League initiative to impose a truce and a six-point peace plan, forged by Annan, the former U.N. secretary-general. Since the cease-fire went into effect on April 12, the LCC reports more than 1,000 people have died. An unarmed U.N. observer mission has been monitoring the adherence to the cease-fire and peace plan. The mission now has 145 observers and 56 civilian staff deployed in Syria and is carrying out patrols, a U.N. spokesman said Friday. Three hundred observers are expected within weeks. Annan is weighing an invitation to meet with al-Assad in Syria, his spokesman said as the deadly blasts in Damascus drew widespread condemnation. Syria's foreign minister invited him days ago, and the invitation is not tied to Thursday's attacks, a U.N. source said. Russia, meanwhile, condemned Thursday's suicide bombings and accused outside nations of instigating violence. ""Some countries are inciting outside forces to interfere into the Syrian situation, which is unacceptable,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, according to Chinese state media. Lavrov, in Beijing for talks with his Chinese counterpart, did not specify the countries. ""Such acts aim to push the country to a new bloody and extremely dangerous wave of violence,"" he said. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Joe Sterling and Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 20 killed in violence across the country .

"Marmaris, Turkey (CNN) -- For more than a year, experts have been at work in a quiet cove on the Aegean Sea, teaching a pair of male bottlenose dolphins how to catch their own food. Every day, the team releases dozens of live fish into giant sea pen where the dolphins named Tom and Misha live. The two males then race around the pen, diving, darting and somersaulting down to depths of 45 feet in pursuit of their frightened prey. Like a proud father, trainer Jeff Foster watches from the narrow dock that encircles the pen. Not long ago, he said, Tom and Misha had no idea what to do with live fish. ""We had literally thousands of fish in the pen, and they just wouldn't look at them,"" Foster said. ""They had just been so used to being hand-fed in a captive situation that they did not recognize fish as a food source."" When Foster first met the dolphins more than a year ago, he said they would only eat if humans placed dead fish directly in their mouths. If fish was thrown into the pen, it would go untouched and end up rotting at the bottom of the sea pen. Tom and Misha are part of the Back to the Blue project, an expensive, risky and somewhat controversial experiment to reintroduce captive animals into the wild. ""It would be like taking your dog and releasing it into the woods,"" Foster said. ""If you don't prepare your dog for that, it would never happen."" Foster, a Seattle-based expert on marine mammals, had experience with another high-profile release program that ultimately ended in failure. More than 10 years ago, he worked in Iceland as part of a multimillion-dollar effort to prepare the killer whale Keiko from the 1993 movie ""Free Willy"" for release into the wild. Less than a year after his release, Keiko died off Norway. But Foster said he believes Tom and Misha stand a much better chance of survival. ""These animals haven't been in captivity as long as Keiko,"" he said. ""Keiko was held in captivity for more than 20 years. He was held as a solitary animal for many of those years."" The two dolphins, who are both about 12 years old, have been in captivity for five or six years, he said. ""They've probably spent the majority of their life out in the wild,"" Foster said. ""Because we're dealing with two males, you can develop competition feeding with them. ... They're ideal candidates for reintroduction back into the wild."" Tom and Misha first attracted the attention of wildlife conservation activists in 2010. At the time, they were kept at a Turkish resort, where tourists paid to swim with the dolphins in a shallow, filthy swimming pool. ""The pool in Hisaronu, Turkey, where Tom and Misha had spent the summer months of 2010 had such a high bacterial count ... that it was a significant health hazard to the dolphins and for the unsuspecting tourists who paid to swim with them,"" Shirley Galligan, a representative of the Born Free Foundation, wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""The water was filthy with feces and dead fish and a layer of 'sludge' at the bottom."" According to Born Free, a nonprofit conservation group based in the United Kingdom, the dolphins were underweight and listless and would not have survived much longer in the pool, which ""having been hastily constructed, was in danger of collapse from subsidence."" A coalition of environmental groups successfully campaigned to rescue the animals and transport them in the back of a truck to a sea pen in the Aegean. Born Free has taken over the costly and time-consuming program to rehabilitate Tom and Misha. So far, the effort has cost $800,000. Both dolphins are expected to be released within a matter of days. Born Free is keeping the exact time and location of their release secret to protect the animals from curious human visitors, excessive boat traffic and the threat of poachers. Tom and Misha's progress will be monitored with specially designed satellite tracking devices that will be pinned to their dorsal fins. Even the sponsors of the program admit there is no guarantee of success. ""There have only been a handful of reintroduction (programs) with mixed results,"" Galligan wrote. ""Returning any captive wild animal to the wild is never without risk."" One of the only successful cetacean reintroductions on record involved an orphaned female orca named Springer. Foster was a member of the team that helped rehabilitate the emaciated animal and eventually reintroduce her to a pod of related killer whales off Canada's Pacific coast a decade ago. She has reportedly survived and thrived in those waters. Michael Moore, a marine mammal expert at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, predicted major challenges for Tom and Misha in the weeks and months ahead. ""Can they break the bond with humans, and can they create a bond with other (wild) dolphins?"" he asked in a phone interview with CNN. ""The irony is that if these animals do get released into the wild, it's a big, bad world out there, and they will have to learn how not to get entangled in fishing gear."" According to Moore, Tom and Misha's release will have virtually no impact on the world's wild dolphin population, which faces an onslaught from industrial fishing nets, decimated fish stocks and polluted seas. But he and other dolphin experts say successful reintroduction could both increase biodiversity awareness in Turkey and set an important example for the multimillion-dollar captive marine mammal entertainment industry. There has been a rapid increase in the number of dolphinariums and ""swim-with-dolphin"" programs cropping up across Turkey over the last decade. ""Turkey, being a very popular and beautiful holiday destination, is sadly responding to the public demand for that 'dolphin experience' by providing more captive dolphin facilities than anywhere else in Europe,"" Born Free's Galligan wrote. ""Conditions in general are very poor."" Foster said he hopes Turkey will start implementing some regulations for its marine mammal facilities ""because there really aren't standards right now."" One fear is that Tom and Misha, who enjoy being rubbed down and handled by their trainers, could be captured by poachers hoping to sell the valuable animals to dolphin parks. Despite the risks, perhaps one of the great assets shared by the two dolphins is their adaptability. ""They are not lions and tigers,"" said Moore of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. ""They're fundamentally more plastic and more adaptable."" Proof of this adaptability is on display nearly every day in the congested and polluted waters of the Bosphorus Strait, which courses through the center of Istanbul. A vibrant pod of dozens of wild bottlenose dolphins feeds here, dodging the constant traffic of oil tankers, cargo ships, ferryboats, fishing boats and yachts. Occasionally, the animals can be seen leaping and surfing off the bows of enormous tanker ships. Misha and Tom are to be released in much less hazardous waters hundreds of miles from Istanbul. But even their ""coach"" doesn't know how they will fare in the days ahead. ""We just really don't know how they're going to respond,"" Foster said, stroking Tom's glistening hide after the 600-pound animal obediently lept onto a floating dock at his trainers' command. Clearly, freedom will expose these dolphins to stimulation they have not encountered in years, including waterbirds, fish and female dolphins. After a wave from his trainer's hand, Tom slipped back into the water. He issued a high-pitched call before accepting a fish as a reward. Underwater, the vocalizations of both Tom and Misha could be distinctly heard, even by the human ear. Despite years of close interaction between humans and these highly intelligent animals, scientists have not found a way to answer one fundamental question: After years in captivity, do dolphins such as Tom and Misha want to be free?","Trainer Jeff Foster is working to release two dolphins into the wild .

"(CNN) -- The women's lives have taken different paths since the days they were born. Brenda Vazquez is a 29-year-old elementary school teacher in Matamoros, Mexico. Laura Castro lives across the border in Brownsville, Texas. She is a 32-year-old housewife who helps her husband manage several stores. They share one thing in common: Both say they were delivered by midwives in south Texas, but pressured by U.S. Border Patrol agents to deny their U.S. citizenship. Their problems began, according to attorney Jaime Diez, when a group of midwives along the U.S.-Mexico border were found guilty of selling birth certificates to people who were not born in the United States. ""Now all the midwives in the area are suspected of committing fraud,"" said Diez, who said his office regularly sees cases of people delivered by midwives in Texas. Some of them are struggling to get passports because officials question the validity of their birth certificates, he said. Others have been deported and had their identification documents confiscated at the border, he said. Vazquez, who Diez is representing in a federal lawsuit filed last week, said she was intimidated into signing a document swearing she was not a U.S. citizen at a border crossing in Brownsville, Texas, last year. ""He said, 'You'd better cooperate with me, because if you don't, you're going to jail. I had to lie and say that I was not a citizen. ... I was quite scared. I was crying,"" the second-grade teacher said. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said he could not comment about Vazquez's case or other such cases ""due to pending legal action."" Border patrol agents are ""obligated to ensure that documentation presented to establish citizenship is proper and correct and was issued to the person presenting the documents,"" spokesman Bill Brooks said in a statement. A 2012 report from the Texas Office of the Inspector General said a fraud investigation had been ""substantiated"" and Vazquez's birth record had been flagged, noting Vazquez's signed confession and the fact that officials found birth certificates for Vazquez in both the United States and Mexico. The report said the case would not be prosecuted because it was beyond the statute of limitations. Vazquez said her parents obtained the Mexican birth certificate so she could study in Mexico. Vazquez said she has never lived in the United States, but wants to fight to regain her citizenship. ""With crime as it is in Mexico, something might happen, and as a citizen I would go live there,"" she said. Laura Castro said she faced a similar situation with her mother and sister at the same border crossing in 2009. ""My sister got desperate and signed the paper,"" Castro said. A border patrol agent told her that her mother had admitted to buying false identification documents for the family. ""He kept asking me the same thing, and I replied the same thing, that I was a citizen. ... I said I was not going to sign because I did nothing wrong, and they let me go. ... They sent me back to Mexico,"" she said. Nearly a year later, authorities returned Castro her U.S. passport after she filed a lawsuit, she said. But Castro said she remains frustrated. ""We were very humiliated. We were treated like criminals,"" she said. The issue has come up before. In 2008, the ACLU sued the federal government on behalf of nine people, arguing that authorities were unfairly discriminating against passport applicants. ""For countless Latinos who were delivered by midwives in the Southwest ... trying to obtain a passport has become an exercise in futility,"" the ACLU said in a statement at the time. ""Although midwifery has been a common practice for more than a century, particularly in rural and other traditionally underserved communities, the U.S. government has imposed unsurpassable hurdles on midwife-delivered Latinos to prove their citizenship and eligibility for U.S. passports -- even when their citizenship has already been established in the past."" In a 2009 settlement, the State Department agreed to a new set of procedures for such passport applications. But the settlement said the department denied the ACLU's accusations, and noted that ""there has been significant fraud by midwives and other birth attendants certifying births as occurring in the United States when they have not occurred in the United States."" Diez said U.S. authorities need to do more to address the problem. ""If they doubt that a person was born here and they can't criminally charge them, then give them a process in which they can send their documents to be investigated, give them a chance to be before a judge with a lawyer, and in which there could be a process in which they make things right. That's how it should be when we are talking about the citizenship of someone,"" he said.","Suspicion of midwives has caused immigration problems for many, an attorney says .
One woman says she was forced to deny her U.S. citizenship .
Another says her passport was taken and returned a year later after a lawsuit .

"(CNN) -- Country music legend Dolly Parton has decided to withdraw her partnership in a new Nashville theme park. ""Gaylord makes decisions that they feel are good for their company and their stockholders and I have to make decisions based on what is best for me and the Dollywood Company,"" Parton said in a statement issued Friday. The once 50/50 joint venture between Gaylord Entertainment Co. and Dollywood was to develop a 114-acre site for a family entertainment zone across from the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center. The $50 million project was expected to be a water and snow park, with the park's slated opening date for summer of 2014. In a statement, Gaylord's CEO and Chairman Colin Reed stated, ""we are deeply disappointed in today's news that Dollywood will no longer partner with us to build a family attraction. We have enormous admiration for Dolly Parton and her company, and respect their decision ... We will endeavor to find another quality partner so that this important tourism project can become a reality.""

"(CNN) -- Don't ask music super-producer Benny Blanco to whip up a No. 1 song for an artist because it ain't gonna happen. Sure, the man knows how to make hits: His work on Rihanna's ""Diamonds"" and Ke$ha's ""Die Young"" landed both at the top of the Billboard charts. But he's the first to tell you that trying to compose a chart topper is almost always guaranteed to fail. ""When you're like, 'Yo, we gotta write a hit song, we need a hit song right now,"" that never works,"" Blanco told CNN. ""Every time that happens, I never write a hit song. I write a s****y song that sounds like someone trying to make a hit song."" Blanco knows of what he speaks. Two of the songs he helped produce are up for Grammys this year: Maroon 5's ""Payphone,"" nominated for best pop duo or group performance, and Trey Songz's ""Heart Attack,"" which is competing for best R&B song. Blanco said in an era where singles rule (seriously, when was the last time you bought an entire album?) the pressure is on labels, artists and producers more than ever to produce a song that will head straight to the top of the charts. But what does that song look and sound like? Is it an earworm such as Carly Rae Jepsen's ""Call Me Maybe""? An intensely personal tale such as Adele's ""Set Fire to the Rain"" or a breezy ""I can relate to that"" poppy tune such as Taylor Swift's ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together."" The answer is yes. ""Everything needs to be a hook,"" said Blanco, who snagged the Songwriter of the Year Award at the BMI Pop Awards in 2012 along with Ester Dean and Pitbull. ""Everything needs to be catchy because a listener is either going to stay with the song or lose interest in the first five seconds. But people also like those songs they can relate to and say, 'Yeah, I went through that.' "" Chris Mooney, senior director of artist promotions at TuneCore, said artists looking for a No. 1 song have to prepare their fans for a release by using every social media tool available: YouTube videos, tweets, Facebook postings, etc. TuneCore distributes music for artists through partners such as iTunes and Spotify for a nominal fee. The company does not, he said, take a percentage of the revenue of the music distributed, and that business model has attracted such well-known acts as Nine Inch Nails, Ziggy Marley and the Civil Wars to use the service. But if an artist wants to have a true No. 1 smash across the country, he or she will have to resort to some old-fashioned methods, Mooney said. ""You really need radio play, and that's not something everyone can do,"" he said. ""But I still think that's key to having a No. 1 song."" That type of marketing to get airplay can be a pricey proposition. Just ask Sarah Stennett, an A&R executive and manager who works with singers Ellie Goulding and Jessie J. There are plenty of songs that are good tunes, Stennett said, but ""when you've got a record that works, you need a record label that will then work that record."" But for a label to justify the expense of promoting an artist, the singer and song have to gel in a way that will connect with the audience, she said. ""There are certain songs that just encapsulate all you need to know about an artist,"" Stennett said. ""They are like personality records. For instance, 'Get the Party Started' by Pink. It was a hit, but it also told you a great deal about who Pink was as an artist."" Stennett said the machine involved in promotion has to remain enthusiastic about the project. ""Everyone has to be about the message,"" she said. ""It's about spreading the message. Have you heard this song by ...?"" Silvio Pietroluongo, director of charts for Billboard, said the conundrum the music industry faces is that while albums aren't selling nearly as well as before, the music is bigger than ever. ""I think music is more popular and accessible today than it's ever been,"" he said. ""It's a major component of advertising campaigns, sporting events and anything multimedia."" That means the industry now has varying degrees of success, he said, from an artist such as Adele, whom he calls ""lightning in the bottle"" able to sell both singles and albums, to some such as Jepsen, who has sold millions of singles but not as many albums. Pietroluongo said any artist is one hit away from that big break or even a comeback. But today's hit can easily come from performers such as Flo Rida, who, Pietroluongo said, is one of the all-time, top-selling digital download artists despite a lack of recognition as a hitmaker. ""They are catchy tracks,"" Pietroluongo said of the rapper's music. ""I think the challenge with Flo Rida has been to put a face with the hits. I'm not sure if you locked 10 people in a room that half of them would realize that all the songs they love are Flo Rida."" Producer Blanco is also not easily recognizable, though he may increasingly be responsible for some of the most played music out these days. The process of putting it all together is as much fun as work, he said. It often starts with a roomful of friends and lots of food. He likes to write with friends, he said, since as soon as he writes anything he usually shares it with them anyway. And a hit could occur while he's chilling in a hot tub or taking a walk: anything as long as the ideas keep flowing. ""I let the song come to me,"" he said. ""Then that thing comes to you, and you just know what that thing is. Music isn't like a 9-to-5 job. You never know. It's just the most unpredictable thing.""","A hit song could be a catchy earworm or a heartfelt ballad .

"(CNN) -- The complex architecture of the human brain and how its billions of nerve cells communicate has baffled the greatest minds for centuries. But now, new technology is allowing neuroscientists to map the brain's connections in ever-greater detail. The creation of a map, or ""connectome"" as it has been dubbed, is raising hopes that brain disorders like autism and schizophrenia will be better understood in the future, perhaps cured. The Human Connectome Project (HCP), a U.S. government-funded scheme, recently began trials on healthy volunteers with a state-of-the-art diffusion-imaging scanner. Built by German engineering company Siemens, it works by tracking the passage of water molecules through nerve fibers, giving a more accurate picture of the brain's structure and its neuronal pathways, scientists say. ""The diffusion image is a map of the water diffusion which we then convert into a marker for the fiber pathways,"" says Van Wedeen, director of Connectomics at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). ""We then reconstruct it through computer algorithms that explain the water diffusion that we have observed."" More from CNN Labs: The credit-card sized $35 PC . From the outside, the scanner looks like a conventional MRI machine but the power inside enables it to produce images more than 10 times clearer. ""It's the difference between looking at the bonnet (of a car) and looking at the gears and belts inside,"" Wedeen said. The idea, he says, is to dispose the brain to a coordinates system. ""Think of the difference of making maps before longitude and latitude versus making maps after,"" he said. Data from the scanner is still being refined but Wedeen and his colleague Bruce Rosen are excited about its potential. ""Over time, it's clear that in addition to scanning normal volunteers we'd be very interested in scanning patients with disease,"" says Rosen, director of the Martinos Center for Biological Imaging at MGH. ""The tools we are developing, as well as many other scientists around the world mapping these brain circuits, may be fundamental to how we understand and conceptualize diseases and treat them,"" he added. ""Once you understand that it's an abnormality of specific circuits it gives you clues in terms of the pharmacology you want use to use depending on the part of the brain."" Poorly understood diseases like autism, he says, could be the result of an abnormality of brain connections called ""connectopathies."" ""Hopefully, we'll be in a position to see if that's true or not. And if it is, try to understand where it came from and try to fix it,"" Rosen said. Sebastian Seung, a neuroscientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology agrees. ""Researchers have conjectured that the neurons themselves are healthy but maybe they are just wired together in an abnormal way. But we've never had the technology to test that hypothesis until now,"" Seung said. Seung's own work in this area is focused on exploring individual neurons (something the HCP scanner cannot do), painstakingly building up three-dimensional maps of neurons taken from the retina of dead mice. In his new book, ""Connectome: How the Brain's Wiring Makes Us Who We Are,"" Seung argues that our identities are stored in the connections between individual brain cells. ""I believe connectomes are the meeting ground for nature and nurture. The gene controls how the brain wires up, but experiences also modify the connections of the brain,"" he said. ""I'm interested in why we are unique. What is the source of our uniqueness? I believe the differences between people are going to be, in large part, down to the differences in neuro-connectomes."" But the task of mapping human neurons is enormous when compared to the mapping of say, the human genome, he says. ""The complete neural connectome of a human has a billion times more connections than a genome has letters,"" Seung said. And only one organism's connectome -- the one millimeter-long worm C.elegans -- is known in its entirety, says Seung. But its 300 neurons and 7,000 connections took British researchers over a decade to complete during the 1970s and 1980s. Humans have around 100 billion neurons. ""The brain is so complex, so do we have a prayer of figuring it out?"" Seung said. ""I would argue the fundamental limitation has been technological so far. But I would say that once we can observe what's happening in the brain at the appropriate resolution then we have a chance.""","Emerging field of ""Connectomics"" aims to uncover the complex secrets of the brain .

"(CNN) -- Responding to an increase in reports of sexual assault within the military, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Thursday issued a series of initiatives intended to mitigate the problem, including allowing accusers to be reassigned or transferred. A number of high-profile incidents have involved officers in the Air Force and the Army, as well as midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy. Military chiefs oppose removing commanders from sexual assault probes . In a two-page memo, Hagel directs: . -- that the secretaries of the military departments establish by November 1 a victim's advocacy program to give accusers legal advice and representation throughout the justice process; . -- that a proposal be delivered to Hagel by October 15 to amend the manual for courts-martial so victims can make recommendations on what the penalty should be; . -- that the secretaries of the military departments develop policies by January 1 allowing those accused in a sexual assault case to be reassigned or transferred; . -- that policies prohibiting inappropriate relations between trainers and trainees, and recruiters and recruits, be standardized across all services by November 1; . -- that the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness develop by November 1 a policy requiring status reports of allegations and actions be taken to the first general/flag officer within the chain of command, ""without delaying reporting to the relevant military criminal investigation organization""; . -- that secretaries of the military departments mandate by December 1 that judge advocates serve as investigating officers for preliminary hearings on sexual assault charges. -- that the Defense Department's inspector general evaluate closed investigations on a routine basis. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, called the action ""a good thing,"" but predicted it would not solve the problem. ""As we have heard over and over again from the victims, and the top military leadership themselves, there is a lack of trust in the system that has a chilling effect on reporting,"" she said in a written statement. She lambasted the military's record -- 302 prosecutions out of an estimated 26,000 cases -- as insufficient. ""It is time for Congress to seize the opportunity, listen to the victims and create an independent, objective and non-biased military justice system worthy of our brave men and women's service."" Official: Army suspends 55 sex assault counselors, recruiters . Thursday's directive comes nine days after Hagel issued another memo -- required reading by all military officers and enlistees -- in an apparent effort to clarify comments made last spring by President Barack Obama on pursuing military sexual assault convictions. ""Each military justice case must be resolved on its own facts,"" Hagel writes in the one-page memo, which was obtained by CNN's Chris Lawrence and titled ""Integrity of the Military Justice Process."" ""Those who exercise discretionary authority in the military justice process must exercise their independent judgment, consistent with applicable law and regulation,"" it continues. ""There are no expected or required dispositions, outcomes, or sentences in any military justice case, other than what result from the individual facts and merits of a case and the application to the case of the fundamentals of due process of law."" The tone of the memo contrasts with that of Obama's comments at a White House news conference in May, when he addressed the issue of sexual assault in the military. ""When you engage in this kind of behavior, that's not patriotic -- it's a crime,"" Obama told reporters. Those in the military who engage in sexual assault should be ""prosecuted, stripped of their positions, court-martialed, fired, dishonorably discharged. Period. It's not acceptable,"" he continued. Critics described Obama's remarks as unlawful command influence, potentially affecting the right to a fair trial for accused members of the military. Opinion: Soldiers and sex -- can men evolve? CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report .","A victim's advocacy program is among the directives issued by the secretary of defense .

"(CNN) -- They hand out food, issue fines, punish offenders and have their own set of keys. It sounds like a guard's job. But in prisons throughout Honduras, a new report says, it's the inmates who are in charge. ""Internal control of the prisons has been ceded into the hands of the prisoners themselves,"" the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights said in a report released last week, claiming the situation has spread through all 24 of the nation's prisons and is one of the most serious problems the country faces. The Honduran government doesn't deny it. As he ordered troops into one prison after clashes erupted there on Saturday, President Porfirio Lobo called it an ""unacceptable situation"" and acknowledged that a ""reign of crime from within"" plagues the country's prison system. At a meeting on Monday, he said, government security officials will present proposals to end the criminal reign. In the meantime, prisoners are reportedly running facilities throughout the country. And last week's report from the Organization of American States' commission details how they do it. 'The line of death' In a massive prison in the world's murder capital, a painted yellow mark on the ground separates the inmates from the guards. They call the line in the prison in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, ""the line of death,"" according to the human rights report. ""The prison guards know that they must not cross into the yard ... without the authorization of the inmates, while the inmates refuse to leave the external perimeter in police custody,"" the report says. There are two padlocks on the prison gate, the report says. The guards lock the outside, and the inmates lock the inside. The situation is simple, one prison official told investigators. Authorities, the official said, ""have no power to change anything."" In one cell, decorations and wood-paneled walls . Inside one cell in another prison, investigators from the human rights commission said they saw a sight that stood out from the typically squalid conditions: varnished, wood-paneled walls. The inmate had a private toilet, a large bed, a remote-controlled air conditioning unit and his own TV. Why? He was what's known as a ""coordinator"" -- a key figure in the prison hierarchy. According to the report, his responsibilities include: applying disciplinary punishment; setting the prices inmates pay to live in cells; distributing and setting food prices; and resolving conflicts that emerge during daily prison life. ""Above all,"" the report says, ""the 'coordinators' serve as spokesmen or liaisons with the prison authorities, and are really privileged prisoners who exercise a degree of decision-making power within the prisons, often sharing the benefits with the prison authorities."" Prison marketplaces . Inside many of the nation's prisons, inmates buy and sell food, clothes and household items in unregulated marketplaces, the report says. The system has serious consequences, the report argues, including promoting corruption and allowing illicit goods to enter the facility. In San Pedro Sula, for example, the prison yard houses a large bazaar. According to the report, there are ""barbers' shops, cafeterias, bakeries, sales of fruit and food of all kinds, sales of medications and cloth, tailoring workshops, a cobbler's shop, a leather workshop, carpentry, a cabinetmaker's workshop, crafts, manufacture of mirrors, billiard tables, games tables and many soft drink dispensing machines."" A necessary evil? Throughout the human rights investigators' trip to Honduras, officials described self-government in the prisons as a ""necessary evil,"" the report says. ""This system, as was observed, is accepted by the prison authorities as the only viable way of maintaining order and stability between them and the prison populations, and the 'coordinators' are considered collaborators and even allies of the authorities. But authorities have also acknowledged that the widespread prisoner control of facilities has played a major role in contributing to corruption in the prison system. A year after deadly prison fire, questions remain . The human rights report's revelations come more than a year after a deadly prison fire in Honduras cast a global spotlight on prison conditions there. At the time, analysts said prison overcrowding likely contributed to the massive death toll of the February 2012 fire in Comayagua, Honduras, which claimed more than 360 lives. It's a problem groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have condemned. Overcrowding remains rampant, the report says, with outdated facilities housing far more inmates than they were designed to hold. The report lists ""the lack of appropriate, safe physical installations, deplorable health and hygiene conditions, failure to provide adequate food and drinking water and the lack of adequate medical care"" as significant concerns. The report notes that ""grave deficiencies...led to the death of the victims of the fire,"" including overcrowding, fire hazards and no signs for evacuation routes. And 18 months after the blaze, the government still hasn't given a clear explanation of what happened, the report says. ""One of the hypotheses that the commission ask to be studied was the possible presence of criminal hands in the tragedy ... and really we see that there has not been up to now an investigation that has reached results proportionate to the duty of the state to investigate,"" said Rodrigo Escobar Gil, a prisoner rights rapporteur for the commission. In one prison, shots ring out and troops take over . After 15 people were injured and three people were killed during clashes at a National Penitentiary prison in Tamara, Honduras, on Saturday, Honduras' president said he was sending in troops to take over. In a written statement, his office said that the government has taken steps to disarm prisoners and instituted other security measures at prisons nationwide. But they haven't been able to stop the ""criminal reign"" within prisons, the statement. Last week's report lists a series of recommendations for the Honduran government. Among them: reducing overcrowding, improving safety and taking back control from prisoners. Honduran officials have said they accept the human rights commission's report and are pledging to reform the prison system. ""The panorama that the commission has exposed is the absolute truth,"" said Jose Augusto Avila, coordinator of the country's Penitentiary System Transition Commission. ""We cannot deny it."" CNN's Jessica King and Norman Powell and journalist Elvin Sandoval contributed to this report.","A report says Honduran officials have ceded control of prisons to inmates .

"Goree island, Senegal (CNN) -- A short ferry ride away from Dakar, lies the quiet and picturesque Goree Island. Three kilometers off the coast, the Senegalese island is tiny and easily accessible by foot. Without cars or roads, the island preserves a charming ambiance with faded buildings revealing its European colonial history. Beneath its quaint facade, however, the island hides a brutal history. Known as Senegambia at the time and located at the westernmost point in West Africa, Goree Island used to serve as a strategic trading post for the transatlantic slave trade -- African men, women and children were held and traded here before being loaded onto ships to the Americas. Estimates vary, but all of them place the number of Africans who died while in transit in the millions. Eloi Coly has worked on the island for 26 years as a site manager. He is also the chief curator of the ""House of Slaves,"" built by the Dutch in 1776, and is the last slave house remaining on the island and Coly has painstakingly preserved its history. See also: Beach life gives a taste of real Senegal . ""The 900 meter-long island used to host around 28 slave houses. Today most have disappeared and turned into private houses,"" Coly told CNN during a tour of the house. ""This one was chosen by the Senegalese state to keep the memory and remind all the people about the fragility of the liberties. People come from different countries... It's a place of memory and reconciliation."" On the ground floor of the house is the men's quarters where male slaves were housed in a row of cement cells. According to Coly, about 15-20 male slaves were packed in these 2.6 meter by 2.6 meter rooms; seated with their backs against the wall, chained around the neck and arms, they would usually have to wait in the room for about three months. The conditions were so appalling and unsanitary that a major epidemic that ravaged the island in the 18th century started in these rooms, Coly said. After the waiting period, the slaves would then be taken out of the cells for trade. They were then stripped naked and gathered in the courtyard in the middle of the house. The buyers and traders would lean over the balcony overlooking the courtyard and observe the slaves while negotiating prices. ""Each ethnic group used to have a quoted price."" said Coly, ""They were treated exactly as merchandise not as human beings."" See also: Congo's dedicated designer dandies . The selected slaves would then be taken from the courtyard through the corridor to the 'door-of-no-return'. Located at the very back of the house, facing the Atlantic Ocean, the door leads to a wharf made of palm wood, where there would be a ship waiting to take the Africans across the ocean, never to return to their homes. Slaves that had fallen ill or died were also thrown into the ocean from this door, Coly said. According to Coly, all parts of the house were utilized to facilitate the slave trade: small dark rooms underneath the staircases were used as punishment rooms, and the damp little rooms kept young girls and children separately from men for sale or the pleasure of the traders. When asked how he could face the horrors done to his ancestors every day, Coly's answer came rather calmly: 'It is important to keep the memory of the victims, to consider that what happened is a part of the history of human being, not only history of Africans or blacks or whites.'

"(CNN) -- Recently it has seemed that every other tweet or Instagram posted by pop star Rihanna taunts the public with an uncomfortable thought: Singer Chris Brown, the man who beat her so badly in 2009 that was she was almost unrecognizable, may once again be her lover. Rumors the two had reconnected began circulating not long after their infamous altercation, which ultimately resulted in Brown pleading guilty to felony assault. Then earlier this year there was the remix to Rihanna's song ""Birthday Cake,"" in which Brown was the featured guest vocalist offering such coy nuggets as: . ""Girl I wanna --- you right now . Been a long time I've been missing your body"". OK, maybe ""coy"" is the wrong word. In any case, the couple's allusions to their reunion --a Twitter picture showed her embracing a man who appears to be Brown; another showed a man presumed to be Brown face down and shirtless on a bed -- culminated with Brown posting a photo of himself and Rihanna, who appears to be in her underwear. ""What would music today sound like if these kids didn't exist?"" the caption read. Entertainment: Chris Brown ready to start a 'new chapter' Normally I don't like to get too involved in grown folks' private business. But when you use social media to shove your business down the public's throat, it's no longer private. Rihanna doesn't need to be a spokeswoman for victims of domestic violence, nor does she need to live the rest of her life as a victim. But someone needs to send her a copy of ""What's Love Got To Do With It,"" or something, because she's sending a message that everything is fine and that the man who beat her is ""a good man."" Maybe so, but 77% of women her age who report domestic violence have been victimized previously by the same man, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. This fall, some Upstate New York high school students dressed up as Rihanna and Brown and reenacted their fight in a school skit for fun. When one treats serious matters like this so lightly, does one inadvertently gives permission for others to do the same? When the world first saw the images of Rihanna's face after her fight with Brown, many rushed to blanket the songstress with support. The way she is flaunting their relationship now, I don't anticipate the same amount of sympathy for her if another incident occurs. Perhaps that's why she (preemptively?) called her latest CD, ""Unapologetic."" She likely knew she would hear a lot of criticism and I guess she wanted us to know she doesn't need our sympathy. Famed hip-hop author dream hampton recently tweeted that ""Rihanna's a dissertation, waiting to be written."" She's right. Entertainment: Chris Brown renews 'friendship' with Rihanna . At 24 with 12 No. 1 singles and five Grammys, the singer is already an all-time great in terms of chart performance and sales. She's far more complex away from the mic, often seeming to reveal herself in the 140 characters she uses in her tweets... with the exception of one song. Her biggest seller to date, 2010's ""Love the Way You Lie,"" is a duo with Eminem. The song is about a physically abusive, love-hate relationship. As Eminem, who has had his own very public dealings with domestic violence, raps: . ""You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em"" Rihanna hauntingly sings: . ""Just gonna stand there and watch me burn . Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts..."" After that recording, I thought Rihanna had gotten Brown out of her system. I guess love, no matter how poisonous it appears on the outside, is a hard drug to recover from. Since completing a 52-week domestic violence program, Brown has shown about as much control over his temper as Bruce Banner. After his 2011 interview with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America -- in which he said his attacking Rihanna is ""not really a big deal to me now"" -- he reportedly went to his dressing room and trashed the place in anger. Allegedly, he smashed a window that sent glass falling into the street below, before storming out of the building, shirtless, in 40-degree weather. More than once he's lost his temper and turned to Twitter to tell critics to ""--- off,"" or in the case of comedienne Jenny Johnson, wrote he'd defecate on her face. And then there's the bar fight with singer-rapper Drake. Again, this is a year after anger management. Oh, I can hear Brown fans now -- leave him alone. He did his time. Stop hating. Entertainment: Chris Brown's creepy new tattoo 'not Rihanna' Listen. I grew up with domestic violence all around me -- from close family to friends -- and I tend to believe if a guy hits a woman once, she needn't stick around to see if his apologies are sincere. But it's Rihanna's choice, and apparently she's not interested in apologizing for the decisions she's made. And if there's a repeat of 2009, a lot of us won't be interested enough to care. After ""Birthday Cake"" I'm not sure if I would care. Hopefully that incident was a one-time thing and she'll be alright. Hopefully. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Rihanna seems reunited with Chris Brown, who beat her in 2009 .

"(CNN) -- China's President Xi Jinping will have plenty to discuss with his Russian host and counterpart Vladimir Putin when they meet on the sidelines of the G-20 leaders' summit in St. Petersburg this week, as relations between the former foes grow cozier. The hot issue is clearly Syria, where China and Russia strongly oppose any U.S.-led military intervention against President Bashar al-Assad's government in Damascus over its apparent use of chemical weapons. Both urge restraint and call for a political solution -- much to Washington's consternation. Xi, who calls the Sino-Russian relationship the ""best"" among major countries, says they will always be good neighbors who aspire to ""never be enemies."" China is a major buyer of Russian weaponry and the two countries held their biggest joint naval exercise in the Sea of Japan in July this year. Obama-Putin will have chance to talk on 'margins' of G-20 summit . The two countries also enjoy a growing trade relationship, expected to be worth $100 billion by 2015, that is based heavily on China buying Russian energy exports such as oil and gas. As part of this energy trade, both sides see investment opportunities in Arctic and Russian Far East resources development, and in the related advancement of pipeline infrastructure and maritime transport links such as the Northern Sea Route through Arctic waters. Putin has made it clear that he wants to see this energy trade grow even more vigorously, and has given strong backing to the various oil and gas deals struck so far by Russian-state owned energy companies Rosneft and Gazprom with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). The Russian non-state company Novatek also has a deal with CNPC involving development of the vast Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project in northwest Siberia. Snowden factor . In contrast, relations between the United States and Moscow are increasingly frosty over issues such as missile defense, trade, human rights and the status of former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who has taken refuge in Russia after releasing details of U.S. surveillance programs. Opinion: Snowden asylum a blow to U.S.-Russian relations . More recently the crisis in Syria has heightened the rift between Washington and Moscow, with Putin rejecting claims by U.S. intelligence agencies that President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his own citizens. While China is Syria's biggest source of manufactured goods, it is Russia that supplies most of the military equipment used by the Syrian armed forces and has been its most steadfast ally. Putin maintains that the G-20 summit is a good forum to discuss Syria. But earlier this month, Washington decided to cancel a planned Obama-Putin one-on-one meeting in St. Petersburg scheduled for this week. The two leaders last met at the G-8 summit in Ireland in June. Russia Xi's first priority? When Xi officially became China's president in March this year, his first overseas trip was to Russia. During the visit, he described ties between China and Russia as among the most important in the world and said ""it is also the best relationship between major countries."" According to Xi, China and Russia held ""similar or identical positions on key international and regional issues."" For his part, Putin responded that Xi's visit would strengthen the strategic nature of their relationship. But things haven't always been so rosy in the post-war era. An ideological split between the two Communist powers in 1960 saw relations cool to the point where they fought a border war in 1969. Ties were further strained by China's brief invasion of Russian ally Vietnam in 1979 -- though relations have warmed considerably since the breakup of the Soviet Union and formation of the Russian Federation in 1991. Even today, with energy sales to China being such a key contributor to Russia's national budget, there is always the potential for friction. Price has been one stumbling block, while the growing energy ambitions of the former Soviet republics in Central Asia also come into calculations over pipeline routes. Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, for example, are already significant suppliers of Caspian oil and gas to China via pipelines that connect to its far-western Xinjiang province in the west. Russian oil from western Siberia also flows through the Kazakhstan pipeline to China. Significantly, Xi will combine his trip to Russia for the G-20 summit with state visits to Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan later this month. Obama's Asia 'pivot' When it comes to China-U.S. relations, Xi so far has shown an outgoing style in pursuing what he calls the great Chinese dream of national renewal. He and Obama met as presidents for the first time at Sunnyland estate in California in June this year. While the atmosphere was relaxed at their informal get-together, Xi clearly wanted the U.S.-China dynamic to change. ""We need to think creatively and act energetically,"" he said, ""so that working together we can build a new model of a major country relationship."" Xi wants the U.S. to acknowledge China's emergence as a world power, not just in economic terms, but strategically as well. Xi's goal is to convince the U.S. that the days of American strategic primacy in the Asia-Pacific region are coming to an end, and that Obama's military ""pivot to Asia"" looks to some in Beijing as a policy of containment. Obama, who is likely to have a special meeting with Xi on the G-20 sidelines later this week to continue their discussions on North Korea, cyber-security, human rights, climate change and bilateral trade and investment, has already gone some way to accommodating China's ambitions, notwithstanding the Asia ""pivot."" Hosting Xi in California three months ago, Obama said it was inevitable that there were areas of tension between the two countries. ""But what I've learned over the last four years is both the Chinese people and the American people want a strong, cooperative relationship,"" Obama said. This week's G-20 is another opportunity to see how well the two sides can nurture that relationship, particularly when Syria looms as a major point of difference.","China and Russia have signed energy deals, conducted joint naval exercises .

"(CNN) -- Humans have a strange relationship with food. This seems to be a global truth that is perhaps best evidenced by the array of unusual food festivals the world over. We don't merely celebrate food, we wrestle in it, wage war with it, idolize it, and, in Gloucestershire, England, race it down a steep hill. No matter what your favorite food is, chances are somewhere, large gatherings of aficionados have found some outlandish way to commemorate it. Even Spam has found a place of honor. ""Hawaii is one of the biggest consumers of Spam in the world,"" explains Karen Winpenny, an organizer of the annual Waikiki Spam Jam, which last year had 25,000 visitors. Hormel Foods sells more product in Hawaii per person than in any other U.S. state. According to the Spam Jam website, almost seven million cans of the stuff are eaten in Hawaii every year. The festival's dozen or so vendors demonstrate the meat-product's unexpected versatility. ""This year, we had Spam cheesecake and Spam ice cream. In the past, we've had Spam ravioli, Spam kotsu, Spam poki, Spam French fries -- pretty much everything can be made with Spam,"" says Winpenny. Foods represented at festivals can range from the more mundane -- melons, pumpkins, potatoes -- to the downright daring. In West Virginia, locals are keen to celebrate a local delicacy -- road kill. Last week saw the kick off of Clinton, MT's Testy Festy, a celebration of Rocky Mountain Oysters, aka bull testicles. Next month, adventurous eaters can sample scorpions at Bugfest in North Carolina. However, there are times when imbibing our favorite foods is not enough. Sometimes, it seems, making a mess is the only way to do it justice. Several festivals demand participants get dirty. La Tomatina -- where thousands travel to Spain to engage in a bustling tomato fight -- is perhaps the most famous of these, though there are many instances in which festival-goers feel the need to rollick around in grub. On August 23, Barnesville, Minnesota, will celebrate Potato Days, an annual two-day festival dedicated to the humble tuber. No matter how many activities the organizers introduce, however, the most popular remains the mashed potato wrestling competition. ""It's quite a sight to watch people wrestling around in mashed potatoes,"" admits Theresa Olson, the festival's executive director. ""Afterward, they find mashed potato everywhere."" The festival started in 1951 as a source of post-harvest entertainment. Back then, the activities were limited to a potato picking contest for the men, and a peeling competition for the women. Since then, it's matured, and events include a cook-off, a mashed potato sculpting contest and a potato sack fashion show. Read more: The world's messiest festivals . ""It's often voted one of the best festivals in America, partly because it's family friendly, and it's free,"" says Olson. In some instances, culinary celebrations act as a historic link. In Bessieres, France, the townspeople make a giant omelet every Easter to feed the poor, a tradition that supposedly started when Napoleon and his army stopped in the town for the night. Legend has it that The Little Corporal ordered the villagers to gather all their eggs to make an omelet for his army. The celebration has since spread to French-speaking communities across the globe. In Abbeville, Louisiana, the town launched their own version of the tradition (albeit with a Creole twist). ""It's grown to seven cities throughout the world, and we each add a local ingredient,"" says Arlene White, the third Grand Maitre of Abbeville's Giant Omelette Celebration. The town uses 5,000 eggs, and adds Tabasco and crayfish to make it their own. While there are many who would argue that food is art, some regions take this line of thinking to a new level. At the Räbechilbi Turnip Festival in Switzerland, for instance, locals create elaborate floats using 40 tons of hallowed out turnips. In the past, they've created replicas of panthers, windmills, ships, whales -- even Amy Winehouse. Though the tiny town of Richterswil houses a meager 12,000 residents, the festival attracts 20,000 visitors each year. ""We're a small village, so you can imagine how crowded it gets,"" says Michèle Fasler, a spokeswoman for Räbechilbi. Fasler describes the atmosphere as warm and peaceful. Just don't eat the turnips, she warns. ""It's not good for your stomach,"" she says. ""It's like eating too much beans.""","Hawaii is America's largest consumer of Spam. No wonder they host the annual Spam Jam.
In the U.S., there are food festivals dedicated to bugs and fried testicles.
Food wrestling is a theme at several celebrations, including Potato Days.
AT Räbechilbi in Switzerland, turnips are turned into works of art."
"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- With protests raging in the streets of Islamabad, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif met with military leaders Monday to discuss the option of resigning for three months, a government official with direct knowledge told CNN. Discussions also included the creation of a judicial commission to investigate the elections that led to Sharif's party taking power, said the source, who didn't want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject matter. But the website for the Inter Services Public Relations, the military's publicity wing, said reports of the meeting and the possibility of Sharif resigning are ""totally baseless."" Thousands of protesters demanding Sharif's resignation have battled police and soldiers in the street for weeks. Three people have died and 450 have been injured, Pakistani medical authorities have said. Sharif has vowed to remain on the job in spite the violent demonstrations. The protesters accuse him of rigging last year's elections that allowed his party -- the Pakistani Muslim League Nawaz -- to take power. On Monday, the Pakistani military was called in to protect the state-run television station from protesters. The station went off the air for a brief period but returned to broadcasting. The soldiers were called in after protesters pushed past police and penetrated into the Red Zone, the area housing the Prime Minister's official residence and other government buildings. The demonstrators were armed with sticks and shields and threw rocks, while riot police fought back with tear gas. Some protesters carried chains and handcuffs to show they want Sharif taken away in handcuffs. Clashes with police broke out again around 5 p.m. (8 a.m. ET). Police fired tear gas at the demonstrators as they approached residential areas. On Sunday, local news crews, including cameramen from three channels, were attacked by police trying to disperse protesters. Thousands of supporters of cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan have protested. They've been joined by followers of cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri, who has accused Sharif of corruption and campaigned for more to be done for the country's poor. Sharif is on his third stint as Prime Minister in Pakistan. Interventions by the military ended Sharif's term as Prime Minister in 1999 when Pervez Musharraf, the head of the army at the time, overthrew him. In a dramatic fall from grace, Sharif ended up in jail, convicted of hijacking charges for trying to stop a plane with Musharraf from landing. He then went into exile in Saudi Arabia and didn't return to Pakistan until 2007 when he teamed up with the Pakistani People's Party to force Musharraf from office. CNN's Saima Mohsin and journalist Adeel Raja reported from Islamabad; CNN's Ralph Ellis wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Brian Walker also contributed to this report.","Source: Prime Minister meets with military leaders about temporarily stepping down .

"(CNN) -- There are no good or easy solutions for U.S. policy toward Egypt, and short-sighted arguments about military aid miss the broader issues entirely. America is relearning the lesson of the 1950s post-colonial period: Democracy depends on stable and experienced political parties and leaders, a willingness to compromise rather than conspire and to share or give up power until the next election. Nations without that experience might hold elections, but such hollow exercises in democracy too often become little more than preludes to bitter power struggles and existential matters of survival for the factions involved. The Obama administration did what it could in spite of these realities. It's becoming public that top U.S. officials did try to broker a settlement and avoid this. The White House worked with the European Union, the United Nations and key Arab states like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE. It soon found, however, that Egypt's military chief Gen. Abdul Fattah al-Sisi and ousted President Mohamed Morsy were on a collision course, and no real democratic center, no mix of leaders and experience, was at the ready to make democracy work. The Egyptian military has shown in blood that it believes it cannot co-exist with the Muslim Brotherhood. Gen. al-Sisi may or may not emerge as the formal leader of Egypt, but there is no way for him and the Egyptian military to compromise with Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood. The military also has no need to compromise with Egypt's divided liberal factions and political leaders like Mohamed ElBaradei. Egypt's more liberal and secular voices may soon learn they cannot be independent in an era of military rule. As the U.S. learned when it occupied Iraq from 2003 to 2011, it has little leverage to force any side to change its behavior. Opinion: Mend, don't end, U.S. aid to Egypt . The debate over calling the Egyptian power a struggle a ""coup"" has been nothing more than a sideshow. The Egyptian military has more than enough U.S.- supplied weapons -- F-16s and M-1 tanks -- to wait out any cut or suspension in U.S. aid. Egypt also has no meaningful conventional military threat to its existing forces. The Camp David peace accords have secured a cold peace for Egypt as well as Israel. President Obama canceled the American military's participation in next month's Operation Bright Star in Egypt -- but this was inevitable for other reasons. The Egyptian military is fighting a low-level civil war against Arab opponents in the Sinai -- a key location for the exercise -- and Egypt's military could scarcely carry out a massive military exercise and seize control of the country at the same time, any more than the U.S. could deploy troops into the middle of an ongoing power struggle. Losing an annual $1.3 billion in U.S. aid or facing a delay in the delivery of F-16s is far less significant to Egypt's military than controlling the country and ensuring its own survival. Besides, the Egyptian military learned well over a month ago that it had other sources of decisive support. Egyptian protester: Why we are willing to die . As the Muslim Brotherhood largely stood on the sidelines, the military removed Morsy from power on July 3 with the support of many of the same protesters who had originally brought down Mubarak. By July 9, key powers like Saudi Arabia and the UAE determined the threat of the Muslim Brotherhood controlling Egypt, or of Egypt descending into political turmoil, was worth an offer of $8 billion in aid to avoid. At this point, some officials in the U.S. might be momentarily satisfied by formally calling the actions of Egypt's military a ""coup,"" but it would be little more than an exercise in hollow symbolism. It also potentially deprives the U.S. of much of the little leverage it has. The Egyptian military knows the U.S. needs Egypt as much as Egypt needs the U.S. Egypt plays a key role in dealing with threats like Iran, securing Israel and key Arab allies, supporting missions like the Afghan conflict, countering terrorism, and securing the flow of world oil exports and the global economy. What the U.S. must do is to show strategic patience: It must accept the real world character of large-scale revolutions in states with no history of democracy or political base to make it work. The U.S. needs to accept that Egypt is undergoing a power struggle that will take years to play out before real and stable democracy is possible. It needs to send in an experienced ambassador like Robert Ford and reinforce a country team of diplomats and U.S. military. It needs its senior officials and top military officers to do everything possible to persuade the Egyptian military to halt the killing and limit its future repression. More broadly, the U.S. needs to make a lasting commitment to patiently working with every possible ally both inside and outside Egypt to create the kind of political forces, financial incentives, and compromises that can limit future upheavals and violence and lay the groundwork for lasting political change. The U.S. cannot create instant democracy from the outside by constant diplomatic pressure, but it may be able to help, over time, move Egypt toward political reform from within. Refocusing U.S. aid to slowly push Egypt's military toward compromise and restraint, building up Egypt's more secular and liberal forces, and making it clear that the U.S. supports the role of Egypt's moderate Islamists, offers no guarantees, but they are the best real world options available.

"(CNN) -- I'm Kristina Wong, and I'm what many Americans would refer to as ""one of those idiots on reality TV."" Recently, I was featured on a new documentary series that focuses on the lives of Asian Americans: ""I'm Asian American and... ."" I thought the show would be a rare platform to show an Asian American story that had not been told: my life as a performance artist and hip-hop mogul. As an artist, the issues I explore have been deemed too ""scary,"" ""niche"" and ""unprofitable"" for mainstream media. Among these issues: The high rates of depression and suicide in the Asian American community, white privilege, racial stereotypes, poverty tourism, gender and sexism. What drew me to becoming a performance artist was the chance to create my message on my terms. I don't wait for someone to write me a role. I certainly don't wait for someone to cast me in a role. And I'm not holding my breath waiting for a bad-ass wisecracking Chinese American lady character like me to show up on ""Game of Thrones."" Leading Asian American women exist on television, but I can count them on one hand. When you see other Asian women my age on scripted television, they are usually side characters handing over scalpels, playing someone's badly accented mother or are scantily clad. If I'm taking on issues barely addressed among Asian Americans, why would I expect mainstream media to pick up on them, too? Some back story: I grew up in San Francisco. I'm Chinese American, got great grades all through high school and went to UCLA. But I bucked stable career paths in medicine, law and engineering to pursue the most unstable of careers: performance art. My performances don't fit the standard fare of what most people might expect of an Asian American woman. I don't tell reductive jokes about my American-born mother's nonexistent Chinese accent. I don't do martial arts (though I so own several zumba DVDs). I don't tell stories peppered with exotic details of Chinese culture that deliver Confuciusesque wisdom. My work has already killed any possibility of a future in politics: Stand-up comedy dressed as a giant vagina, crashing the Miss Chinatown Pageant dressed as a fake Miss Chinatown and marrying myself (twice!) in public ceremonies. Last year, I recorded a hit rap album in northern Uganda with local rappers. I've also toured five original one-woman theater shows around the world. I'd like to think my approach is bawdy, funny and fearless. I've been told I'm the living antithesis of a stereotypical submissive and quiet Asian woman. So I decided to tackle that taboo on my episode of ""I'm Asian American and ..."" by collecting reparations from ""yellow fever guys"" -- slang for white men who only date Asian women. My dates, all real, described how they prefer dating Asian women because we are ""hairless,"" ""gentle"" and ""love to cook and clean"": basically every objectifying stereotype of a submissive Asian woman. During our dates, I coerce these men to clean my house, pay my exorbitant dinner tabs, and watch me perform a very painfully long performance art piece complete with multiple screaming birthing scenes. It's not about gold digging, it's about finding small moments of justice for a lifetime of being objectified and fetishized as an Asian woman. No, I don't expect to win an award for showing these white men that an Asian woman can be as crude and wisecracking as people of any other race. And I don't expect people to jump up and declare that I've ended racial oppression with a reality television appearance. But my 15 minutes of fame (23 to be exact) felt like a rare moment to provide some cathartic humor for those wanting to see an Asian American woman who would go to the outrageous depths that characters on scripted television show would not. I look forward to a day when I see a sitcom telling the stories of every different Asian ethnicity, LGBT, women, mixed race Asian Americans and the Asian Americans like me whose families have been here for generations. From the trailer, it seems like ABC's new sitcom ""Fresh Off the Boat"" will be a funny subversive take on the Chinese American family experience. It's the first scripted sitcom in 20 years to feature an Asian American family on network television. The last, Margaret Cho's ""All-American Girl,"" was panned by critics. The show's failure didn't stop Margaret from making comedy. If anything, it strengthened her, and she told the story of that show's failure in subsequent media and appearances. But I hope that viewers don't expect one sitcom to tell every Asian American's story, any more than a sitcom with a white family does not tell the story of every white person in this country. ""Asian American"" includes a diverse range people of Asian descent, each with a unique history and culture. Opinion: The surprising racial bias against Asians .

"Phoenix (CNN) -- Edward Laird is one of the faces behind the VA scandal -- a face he says is disfigured because he had to wait so long for treatment. The 76-year-old Navy veteran waited two and a half years to get a biopsy for a spot on his nose. And when the VA finally carried out the procedure that his doctor had ordered, the cancer had spread and most of his nose had to be removed. Laird sought treatment at the Phoenix VA hospital, the facility at the heart of a scandal uncovered by CNN of secret waiting lists and altered records that left veterans untreated, even as some died. The Inspector General of the VA released a scathing report last week on care of veterans at the Phoenix VA hospital, which could be just the beginning of a nationwide federal review of the Veterans Health System. A physician at the Phoenix VA confirmed to CNN that he sent Laird to the VA's dermatology clinic repeatedly to get a biopsy of his nose, but the biopsy was repeatedly delayed. Laird said 70% of his nose was removed to fight the cancer that spread as he waited for care. After complaining about the delay, Laird received a letter from the then-interim director of the Phoenix VA that said, ""I regret that you are dissatisfied with the care. The dermatologist that you saw did not identify any of the signs of a reoccurrence,"" referring to the spread of cancer. Today, Laird uses an ice cream stick to keep his right nostril open. Despite long wait times at the VA, Laird said he remains proud of his military service and the military brothers and sisters he meets when he goes to the Phoenix VA. ""There's always lines at the VA but when you go, there you feel like you're walking along with a bunch of champions,"" Laird said. ""It'll jerk a tear from you sometimes."" The report released last week by the VA's Office of Inspector General found that 28 veterans had ""clinically significant delays"" in care at the Phoenix VA, six of whom died. But the Inspector General report stopped short of blaming the deaths on wait times, stating: . ""While the case reviews in this report document poor quality of care, we are unable to conclusively assert that the absence of timely quality care caused the deaths of these veterans."" Laird's case is not directly described in the report. Investigators did confirm in the report that schedulers at the Phoenix VA manipulated appointment data to hide how long patients were waiting for care. The latest data released by the VA shows more than 630,000 patients throughout the nation continue to wait longer than 30 days for appointments. More than 9,000 veterans are waiting this long for appointments at the Phoenix VA. President Barack Obama pledged last week at the American Legion conference in North Carolina to ""get to the bottom of these problems,"" calling them, ""outrageous and inexcusable.""

"(CNN) -- Can you really go home again? ""Dumb and Dumber To"" is just the latest to trade on our love of nostalgia by revisiting a past hit. ""Dumb & Dumber"" debuted in 1994 and the combination of the Farrelly brothers as directors and stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels was cinema gold. The film went on to become a cult classic. But is it possible to recapture that type of magic 20 years later? After all, these days Daniels is more well known for his dramatic role on HBO's ""The Newsroom"" and neither he nor Carrey are as young as they used to be. So far critics haven't found a lot of evidence that the pair can go home again in terms of replicating what made the first film beloved (and yes we remember the 1995 animated TV show ""Dumb and Dumber: The Series"" and the 2003 movie prequel ""Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd""). ""The charm of the original, to the extent that the original was an enjoyable character farce that led to better things for all participants, is long gone,"" writes Scott Mendelson for Forbes. ""This is not the 'Dumb and Dumber' sequel we needed, but it's the one we deserved for inexplicably clamoring for a second installment in the first place."" Andrew Barker of Variety writes ""Sporadically very funny, mostly very tedious, and sometimes truly vile, this 18-years-too-late sequel nonetheless exhibits a certain puerile purity of purpose, and should accrue healthy profits playing to the nostalgia of the dumb and the dumb at heart."" But good or bad, Hollywood will always return to the well be it with television or movies in the hopes that they can rally those who have held on to their fond memories for years. Here are a few examples. 1. ""Veronica Mars"" Fans loved this former TV show so much that they helped fund a movie just to catch up with the characters. The series about a teenaged private detective ended in 2007 but the ""Veronica Mars"" motion picture landed in theaters in 2014 after a successful Kickstarter campaign. It didn't break any records at the box office, but the faithful didn't seem to care. 2. ""Arrested Development"" Look up ""cult classic"" and ""Arrested Development"" will be right there. The Fox TV show ended in 2006 after three seasons of low ratings despite critical acclaim. Netflix stepped up and made dreams come true in 2013 with a fourth season. Word is there are plans for a season 5. 3. ""Psycho II"" It took 23 years to get a sequel to the wildly popular 1960 horror film ""Psycho."" Original star Anthony Perkins also appeared in the 1983 followup as the now-rehabilitated killer, Norman Bates. In 2013 A&E premiered a prequel series titled ""Bates Motel."" 4. ""Tron: Legacy"" The original ""Tron"" was released in 1982, also known as the early days of CG special effects. Things had gotten much more advanced by the time ""Tron: Legacy"" came out in 2010. Sci-fi geeks were so ready for it and thrilled to see Jeff Bridges reprise his role as software engineer Kevin Flynn, whose son Sam (played by Garrett Hedlund) finds him in a virtual world 20 years later. 5. ""Girl Meets World"" ""Boy Meets World"" practically owned the 1990s. The ABC series followed the exploits of Cory Matthews and his friends and family from 1993 to 2000 and viewers couldn't get enough of the young love between Cory and his crush Topanga Lawrence (played by Ben Savage and Danielle Fishel respectively). Many from the original cast were on board for the new series ""Girl Meets World"" which premiered in June 2014 and found Cory and Topanga now married and the parents of a pre-teen daughter named Riley. 6. ""The Comeback"" No show has been more aptly named than this one. The HBO series about a washed-up TV actress desperate to get back into the game never gained traction and only lasted one season in 2005 despite a devoted fan base. Over the years even more folks discovered the show within a show and there were cries to ""bring back Valerie Cherish"" played by ""Friends"" actress Lisa Kudrow. That happened in November 2014 when the network brought it back years later for a second season. It just goes to show that it's never too late. Now who's ready for the sequel to ""Zoolander?""","""Dumb and Dumber To' is a sequel 20 years after the fact .
The reviews have not been great .
Hollywood loves to revisit old shows and movies ."
"(CNN) -- Facing widespread outrage over the National Rifle Association's response to the Newtown, Connecticut, school massacre, the group's president Thursday tried to clarify, saying that schools should decide for themselves how to protect their children. ""Some will want police officers there. Others of them will want private security guards,"" David Keene said in an exclusive CNN interview. ""There may be some place they want volunteers to do it. We're willing to work with everybody on those questions."" The nation's largest teachers union liked some of Keene's comments, but said the NRA is ignoring crucial points to prevent school shootings. Keene's interview came nearly a week after NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre addressed media -- but did not take questions -- and said that all schools in the United States should immediately have armed officers. That is the only way, LaPierre said, to prevent another massacre like that at Sandy Hook Elementary, which left 20 children and six adults dead. On December 21, LaPierre called for armed officers in ""every single school"" and said that action should be taken before children return to school at the start of the year. ""I call on Congress today to act immediately to appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation and to do it now to make sure that blanket safety is in place when our kids return to school in January,"" he said. LaPierre continued, ""Before Congress reconvenes, before we engage in any lengthy debate over legislation, regulation or anything else, as soon as our kids return to school after the holiday break, we need to have every single school in America immediately deploy a protection program proven to work, and by that I mean armed security."" Read transcript of LaPierre's statement . On Thursday, Keene took questions about LaPierre's statements, which were heavily criticized, even by some NRA members. The NRA boasts 4 million members. ""Whether an individual school wants that kind of protection or doesn't want that kind of protection is really up to the individual school,"" Keene said. ""And when we made that statement, when Wayne LaPierre spoke about a week ago, he suggested that what has to happen, and what should happen, is in every school district, administrators, teachers and parents should sit down and ask what's needed to protect the students in that school."" Keene seemed to be broadening the NRA's position by encouraging wider discussion, said Mo Canady, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers, a nonprofit nonpolitical group that trains armed officers in schools. But Canady is alarmed that the NRA thinks ""armed guards"" in school is a solution. In his nationally televised address on December 21, LaPierre said armed guards should work in school like they do at ""airports, office buildings, power plants, court houses, even sports stadiums."" ""We want some clarification on what he means by armed guard,"" said Canady. ""An officer working in a school has to work with students, be engaged in the school day, develop relationships with students. They must be trained to do that, to be involved."" ""We feel that could create more problems than it solves,"" he said. While talk continued, in Utah teachers were learning how to shoot. The Utah Shooting Sports Council and the Utah-based website opsgear.com are offering a free shooting class this week to teachers. The ""Safe to learn Safe to teach"" class is free and lasts for six hours, just as extensive as a routine conceal-and-carry training course in the state. The course covers how to handle a firearm, how to carry it and maintain it, and provides information about Utah and federal handgun laws. Council chairman Clark Aposhian explained why be believes teachers should learn to fire weapons. ""When we talk about more guns, are more guns the answer? Who do you think they call and why do they call the police when something like this happens?"" he said on CNN Thursday. ""Because they know the police will show up with their guns. The only problem is the police show up a little too late. They have lots of guns and equipment and man power, but just a little too late. ""The first responders at Sandy Hook and in Columbine were the teachers themselves, who put their lives in front of these shooters,"" he said. ""Let's not disarm these folks."" Teachers in Utah have had guns in the classroom for years, he said. ""This is not new for Utah. You just haven't heard about it before,"" Aposhian said. ""Teachers have been carrying firearms in locked drawers for 12 years now. And my opponents will say the dire predictions were going to be that every argument between a teacher and student would result in gunfire. ""That hasn't happened. We haven't had accidental shootings. We haven't had guns left behind. And we also haven't had any [school] gun shootings."" But there are some who oppose the idea. Former special education teacher Cassie Stoneman told CNN affiliate KSL that having a firearm at school makes her nervous. ""I would be terrified that one of my students would find my weapon and bring it out,"" she said. Armed guards, too, are not an absolute solution either, said the National Education Association, an influential teachers' union with 3 million members. To argue otherwise ""denies the tragedy at Columbine,"" NEA President Dennis Van Roekel told CNN, reacting to Keene's interview. ""They had armed guards and it didn't stop the tragedy."" An armed guard watching Colorado's Columbine High School in 1999 was unable to prevent the slayings. The county sheriff's office released an account explaining why. ""At Newtown, the doors were locked,"" Van Roekel added. ""They had a buzzer. They did everything right."" Canady said that the push for armed, trained police officers in American schools goes back to the 1950s. But an effort to put guards in schools was federally funded during the Bill Clinton presidency. School-Based Partnership grants in the 1990s paid police agencies to send officers into schools in order to reduce school-related crimes such as drug dealing or alcohol use on campus. The grant program awarded more than $17 million to 155 agencies in the late 1990s, according to the U.S. Justice Department. The program has not been funded recently. While Van Roekel agreed that it might be wise to return to that, guards in school cannot be the only solution. ""Keene's statement includes good things and neglected points,"" he said. ""The part about how everyone needs to sit down is a good point. What's missing is there are other solutions that should be addressed, including metal health and common sense laws that keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn't have them."" Van Roekel believes there must be a debate over banning large ammunition magazines like the kind Adam Lanza used to mow down his victims at Sandy Hook Elementary. LaPierre, at least, seems hesitant to consider that. He appeared on NBC's Meet the Press a few days after he gave his December 21 statement to reporters. Banning magazines, LaPierre said, is ""not going to make any kid safer.""","NRA President David Keene says there should be discussion first about arming schools .

Mary Landrieu, who is pushing for the bill's passage in an effort to save her seat, said she has the 60 votes the Senate needs to pass the bill later Tuesday. If it does, the Keystone legislation would land on the president's desk, but the White House has hinted that the president is likely to veto the bill.

"(CNN) -- Why only reach back to right a wrong from a half-century ago? Why not correct a travesty that is occurring right now? I direct this question to President Barack Obama, who in March will award the Medal of Honor -- the nation's highest military honor for valor -- to a group of 24 veterans, only three still living, who should have been given the commendation decades ago. The men, who served over three wars, performed as heroes on the battlefield. But for 19 of the 24, the nation failed them. They had been passed over because of discrimination in the ranks. The belated recognition is a wonderful gesture. But there is something more Obama should do. The nation owes a Medal of Honor to Sgt. Rafael Peralta, a 25-year-old Marine from San Diego who died on November 15, 2004, when, according to many accounts, he smothered a grenade in Falluja, Iraq. He came to the United States as an immigrant from Mexico, and joined the Marines on the day he received his green card. Absorbing a grenade blast to save other soldiers is the very definition of valor. It all but guarantees the Medal of Honor. This was true for three other heroes: 22-year-old Marine Cpl. Jason L. Dunham, who died this way on April 22, 2004, in Karabilah, Iraq; 19-year-old Army Pvt. Ross McGinnis, who died in Baghdad on December 4, 2006; and 25-year-old Navy SEAL Michael A. Monsoor, who died in Ramadi, Iraq, on September 29, 2006. In Peralta's case, before the Marine covered the grenade, he had been shot in the head. And that fact fuels a debate. There are those who believe that Peralta should not receive the Medal of Honor, claiming that the gunshot killed him instantly, and so he was already dead when he covered the grenade. That would make the smothering of the explosive an involuntary action that would not constitute heroism. That group includes the last three secretaries of defense. Recently, the Pentagon announced that it will not reopen the nomination for Peralta. According to a news release, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the Defense Department concluded that the evidence did not meet the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard necessary for the Medal of Honor. Nevertheless, many disagree. Those who think that Peralta should get the Medal of Honor acknowledge that the Marine sergeant was shot but, point to assertions by a neurologist, two neurosurgeons and the surgeon for Peralta's battalion that the bullet was traveling at such a low velocity that it did not kill him instantly. They assert that he was able to reach out, scoop up the grenade, and place it under his body. That it was a conscious decision to give up his life to save comrades, and that it does amount to heroism. I've looked at this case for several years and written about it numerous times. I'm in Camp No.2. I believe Peralta deserves the Medal of Honor. This is also the point of view of the entire California congressional delegation, which pushed the Pentagon for years to reopen the nomination. (Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter, himself a Marine combat veteran who presumably knows a thing or two about valor, led the push.) And it's also the view of Texas pathologist Vincent Di Maio, an independent forensic expert who looked at the evidence and reached a different conclusion than the one arrived at by the Pentagon. And, it's the opinion of the Marine Corps, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Central Command. Furthermore, it is also the point of view of the real experts on what happened that day in Falluja: Peralta's comrades in Alpha Company, most of who joined the campaign for the Medal of Honor. They were there. And they don't need some bureaucrat behind a desk in Washington or some political appointee to tell them what happened. They saw it with their own eyes. Initially, all seven said they witnessed Peralta scoop up the grenade and sacrifice himself, and that it's because of that act of valor that they came home to their families, to weddings and children's birthday parties and anniversaries . But the Washington Post last week reported that two former Marines who were with Peralta on the day he died have broken ranks with their colleagues. At least one is recanting his earlier statements. The two former Marines claim that the narrative about what happened that day advanced by the other Marines is not true, and that it was concocted by the rest of the squad to honor Peralta's memory. They insist that the grenade exploded near Peralta but not underneath him. One of the former Marines, 30-year-old Davi Allen, who was close enough to Peralta to be wounded in the blast, spent years advancing the other version, and now he claims the new version is the truth. Was he not telling the truth then, or is he not telling it now? Both Rep. Hunter and the Peralta family have challenged the Washington Post article, which they insist contains inaccuracies and factual omissions. While admitting in a letter to the Post that the eyewitness accounts ""have always differed,"" Hunter accused the newspaper of ignoring ""the full body of evidence"" and inaccurately describing the situation that day in Falluja. Moreover, according to Politico, the allegation that Peralta's fellow Marines concocted an alternate narrative had already been reported in the Marine Corps Times. Yet a colonel assigned to investigate the case found no evidence to back up that claim. It comes down to whom you believe. This much everyone seems to agree on: Those in the Corps used to call Peralta ""a Marine's Marine."" It sounds like it. There is one more member of the Peralta Fan Club, an expected one: The Pentagon. In 2008, as pressure started to mount, Defense Secretary Robert Gates offered the Peralta family a consolation prize: the Navy Cross. The citation read: ""Without hesitation and with complete disregard for his own personal safety, Sgt. Peralta reached out and pulled the grenade to his body. That's right -- the very thing that his supporters have insisted all along. So the Defense Department adopts different narratives depending on the commendation? That makes no sense. The Peralta family turned down the Navy Cross, and held out for the Medal of Honor. It never came. President Obama, you don't have to look back a half-century to find a miscarriage of justice in our armed forces. Here is a perfect example. Now, do the right thing, and give a hero the recognition he deserves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Sgt. Rafael Peralta, who died in Iraq, deserves the Medal of Honor .
He says Peralta, by many accounts, smothered a grenade to save comrades .

"Beijing (CNN) -- In a rare, joint news conference with the global news media inside the heart of Beijing, U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged cooperation on a range of common interests as they concluded an unusually colorful economic summit. Asked about anti-American rhetoric in Chinese state-run media which accused the United States of backing recent democracy protests in Hong Kong, Obama brushed off the criticism as ""part of being a public official."" ""The United States had no involvement in fostering the protests that took place there,"" Obama insisted. Xi appeared to grimace when asked by New York Times reporter Mark Landler about international press access in China and whether he viewed Obama's ""pivot"" to Asia as an authentic component of U.S. foreign policy. In a sign of clear annoyance with the setting, Xi initially did not answer the question and moved to hear instead from a Chinese reporter. In response, Xi appeared at times to read a prepared statement. US, China reach historic climate change deal . ""We don't see eye to eye on every issue. Both sides should respect each other's core interests,"" Xi said, adding the two nations should manage their differences respectfully. Xi, however, went on to take note of international criticism of China's human rights record. ""China has made enormous progress in its human rights. That is a fact,"" Xi said, conceding that his nation's work in that area is not ""mission accomplished."" Before finishing his remarks, Xi responded to Landler's question, accusing The New York Times of causing its own access problems in China. Obama added he had an opportunity to stress to Xi that the Asia ""pivot"" is not an attempt to challenge China's leadership in the region. Xi and Obama fielded only two questions, one from Landler, the other from a reporter representing China's state-controlled news media. Still, the news conference was the culmination of weeks of intense negotiations between high-level White House and Chinese officials who initially balked at the idea. U.S. officials were confident the press event marked one of the only known occasions in which a Chinese leader had taken an unscripted question from an American journalist in China. US-China relations: Can teens succeed where presidents have failed? Following five hours of discussions that included a close circle of Chinese and U.S. officials Tuesday night, the two leaders also announced a new climate agreement that would cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by nearly one-third from 2005 levels by 2025. China would peak its carbon emissions no later than 2030 and increase the use of nonfossil fuels to 20% also by 2030. ""This is an ambitious goal, but it is an achievable goal,"" Obama said about the climate deal. ""China is ready to work with the U.S. to make progress in a number of priority areas,"" Xi added. The Obama administration is confident it can avoid any potential stumbling blocks for the climate agreement next year when Republicans take control of the Senate. ""Congress may try to stop us, but we believe that with control of Congress changing hands we can proceed with the authority we already have,"" a senior administration official said on a conference call with reporters. Obama arrived in Beijing for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit still wounded politically by his party's stinging defeat in last week's congressional midterm elections. But the U.S. President managed to string together a slew of modest trade and diplomatic agreements with Beijing that will loosen visa restrictions for Chinese travelers and cut tariffs on high-tech American products. China maximized its position as APEC summit host, staging an Olympics-caliber dinner spectacular complete with fireworks. Obama drew howls in the Chinese media when he was seen chewing gum as he entered Monday night's festivities. Russian President Vladimir Putin earned a few cringes of his own when he placed a shawl around the shoulders of China's first lady in an apparent act of chivalry. She promptly removed the garment, creating such a stir the incident was removed from China's state-run news outlets. Chinese censors attempted to further block coverage of the story by blacking out a portion of a CNN segment on the incident on the network's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" program. Obama is scheduled to attend a state banquet with his Chinese counterpart before departing for Myanmar for a gathering of leaders at this week's Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit. The president's visit is also designed to check on Myanmar's efforts to expand democratic reforms in the Southeast Asian nation. 24 hours with President Obama in China .","U.S., Chinese presidents conclude summit with joint news conference .

"(CNN) -- On the morning of her suicide on July 17, Zhou Jianrong came into work earlier than usual. No one knew what went through her head in those quiet hours before other workers arrived, but as CCTV footage later revealed, she first took 20 minutes to walk around the empty factory before leaping off the fourth floor window. The 49-year old was found dead shortly before 6 a.m., marking the end of her 12 years at the GCL Footwear factory. Zhou had just been fired the previous night for participating in a strike that was part of a long-running labor dispute. She was one of more than 100 workers sacked for their involvement. The tragedy of her death overshadows the surge of labor activism in China. Of the more than 1,000 recorded strikes and protests that took place from June 2011 to the end of 2013, 40% were amongst factory workers, according to employment watchdog China Labour Bulletin. Unlikely activism . In China, unions are sometimes ridiculed by Internet users as a ""laoban gonghui,"" meaning they are the ""boss' union."" Every factory union belongs to the government-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), a mega-institution with an extensive chain of command. ""The ACFTU is first and foremost aligned to the Communist Party and secondly to the local government. It has never seen itself primarily as a workers' organization,"" says Geoffrey Crothall, a spokesperson for China Labour Bulletin. At GCL Footwear though, the factory union was heavily involved from the very first day of the strike, pushing owners to negotiate with the workers. Most surprisingly, workers directly elected the union vice-chairman, Luo Xiangxun, and according to him, the supervising trade union initially approved of their work. ""In the past, elections of union leaders were controlled by the enterprise; workers can vote but not nominate. Often times, workers don't even know about the elections,"" says labor academic Wang Jiangsong. ""This case is different."" Such developments are fraught with uncertainties. On June 24, Luo was busy organizing workers when the supervising union suddenly pronounced his election illegal, detaining him for seven days. After his release, he has continued to lead workers, demanding their reinstatement. ""The fact that we have seen individual trade union officials leading workers is a sign that the union is beginning to move in the right direction,"" says Crothall. He observes that the level of local union involvement in this case is unusual but not unique. In early March, trade union chairman of Walmart's Chengde store in Hebei Province led workers in a fight for fair compensation when the store closed down. And in May, women from the Japanese-owned Sumida factory in Guangzhou successfully formed a democratically elected union after some deliberation. Policy change . For now, these might just be isolated cases, but changes are also happening on a policy level. The Shenzhen Trade Union Federation announced in 2012 that it would move enterprise trade unions towards direct elections, beginning with 163 factories. On July 2, Xinhua reported that the Guangdong Federation of Trade Unions aims to have all enterprise unions become democratically elected within five years. Labor academic Wang Jiangsong thinks its premature to believe these efforts to democratize the unions will lead to real change, but he still sees it as a step in the right direction. ""Good officials do exist in the government-controlled ACFTU and reform will begin with them,"" says Wang. ""But most importantly, it is the bottom-up activism that puts pressure on the government to make changes."" Wang explains that most workers have a deep-rooted mistrust of unions. When an issue arises, they often skip over them and organize through their hometown networks or social media instead. The government realizes the old way no longer works and is desperate to change the image of the ACFTU, opening enterprise unions for democratic election. Business interest . Activists have called for July 17, the day Zhou died, to be named ""Chinese Laborers' Day of Suffering,"" but her suicide did not dampen the efforts of the factory workers who have filed for arbitration and are awaiting results. Recent developments are worrying some in the business community. A group of Hong Kong manufacturing and business associations have opposed a proposal by the Guangdong government to give workers the right to demand meetings with employers to negotiate for better benefits. One of the signers of the opposition, The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong turned down an interview request, but in an editorial for the China Daily, vice-president Eddy Li called the proposal ""disastrous."" He points out that China's import and export business has weakened in recent years, environmental policy has increased production costs and other labor requirements have already become a heavy burden for employers. Low-end producers . However, data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on July 27 shows that profits on a whole are rising. David Dollar, senior fellow of Thornton China Center at U.S. think tank Brookings Institution, explains that the growth of production is higher in the medium to high-tech sectors, where higher wages have pressured manufacturers to have productivity gain and move up the value chain -- a healthy structural change for the Chinese economy. However, in the low-end manufacturing sector, such as footwear or garment factories, it is very hard to find productivity gains and some of those sectors are starting to move out of China to Vietnam and Bangladesh. A survey of Pearl River Delta manufacturers by Standard Chartered suggests that while manufacturers prefer to move their business inland than to move it abroad, 13% will consider leaving China to save costs, most of which the study believes are low-end producers. Towards a domestic consumption economy . The government might not see this as a negative change -- China no longer wants to be in the market only for its cheap labor. Premier Li Keqiang has long championed a consumption-led economy. ""China has now reached a point where it needs to rely more on consumption. It's the largest exporter in the world, so it's not realistic for it to grow much faster than the world market,"" says Dollar. He believes what's important for China now is reforms that will encourage consumptions. For that to happen, wages have to go up. ""I view it as a positive thing that in recent years, wages have been rising very rapidly."" Who needs who? The one-child policy has slowed down the growth of the labor force, and more young people are going to university rather than factory work. More than a decade ago, hundreds would line up outside a factory looking for work, but many manufacturers today struggle to find enough workers. With this labor shortage, better working conditions might just be a natural next step, as these days, it is the manufacturers who need workers and not the other way around. But with 260 million migrant workers in the country, this progress might take some time -- a progress that Zhou will not see. ""It's obvious to me that Madam Zhou didn't fully understand her rights,"" says He Yuancheng, a legal adviser to former GCL Footwear workers. ""If she was aware of her options and knew about the upcoming actions, she would not have jumped."" He Yuancheng further speculates that Zhou might have been disheartened that the company fired her in a heartbeat despite her 12 years of service. He believes that would explain the 20 minutes she spent quietly circling the empty factory floor before she ended her life. For the remaining GCL Footwear workers though, He Yuancheng is optimistic. ""Even if we don't win this arbitration, the workers will have contributed to the reform of the system.""","Labor unions in China are ridiculed for their impotence and are referred to as ""boss' unions""
Bottom-up activism puts pressure on the government to make changes .
Nearly half of all protests between 2011-2013 were related to factory workers' rights .
China can no longer rely on cheap labor -- so what's next for ""the world's factory""?"
"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan's largest utility said Thursday that more radiation than previously thought was released into the atmosphere in March 2011, in the days after the nuclear disaster that followed an earthquake and tsunami. TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Co.) estimates about 900,000 terabecquerels of radioactive materials were released between March 12 and March 31, according to Japan's Kyodo news agency. This is more than the estimates issued by the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan or the government's nuclear safety agency, the news agency said. The utility said the release of radioactive material after March dropped sharply. Hard lessons for U.S. nuclear safety from Fukushima meltdown . The latest figures from TEPCO come a day after the World Health Organization released a report on radiation doses that said infants living in the communities worst affected by the meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant were exposed to much higher than normal levels of radiation. In one town in the Fukushima area, the estimated thyroid doses to infants are within a dose band of 100 to 200 millisieverts (mSv), the preliminary report said. This level of radiation exposure could be associated with an increased likelihood of developing cancer. However, in the rest of Japan, the estimated thyroid doses are within a dose band of 1 to 10 mSv, the report said. Outside the country, the estimated thyroid doses are less than 0.01 mSv, and are usually far below this very low level, it said. Scientists looked at radiation doses to the thyroid, among other measures, because radioactive iodine-131 tends to accumulate in the thyroid, the most exposed organ in the body. After the Chernobyl accident in 1986, a higher incidence of thyroid cancer was found in people who were children at the time of the accident, previous studies have found. In Japan, people were chiefly exposed externally through radioactive material in the air and deposited on the ground, and internally through inhalation of radioactive particles and their ingestion in foodstuffs and water, the WHO said. Wednesday's report is the first international effort to assess global radiation doses resulting from the nuclear disaster, the WHO said. Its estimates will help the WHO draw up a report into the likely health risks resulting from the radiation exposure. Japan has set a goal for cleaning up all areas where radiation levels are 1 millisievert over normal background, based on an estimate of eight hours a day spent outdoors. Cleanup efforts in the first year focused on areas where annual doses of radiation were between 20 and 50 mSv a year -- 7 to 16 times the typical amount a resident of an industrialized country receives in a year, but below the threshold for an increased risk of cancer. TEPCO was effectively nationalized earlier this month after the government approved a request for a 1 trillion yen ($12.5 billion) injection of capital. The company, which was left reeling by the disaster last year, needs government help to stay solvent as it faces enormous compensation costs. The tsunami that followed the magnitude-9 quake on March 11 last year swamped the Fukushima Daiichi plant, knocking out power to cooling systems and leading to meltdowns in its three operating reactors. The resulting release of radioactivity forced residents of several towns near the plant to flee their homes, and a 20-kilometer (12.5-mile) zone around the plant remains closed to the public. CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this report.","More radioactive material than thought was released in days after disaster, TEPCO says .

"Port Fourchon, Louisiana (CNN)  -- It sounds like a Hollywood movie. An impending disaster -- think the disabled spacecraft in ""Apollo 13"" or the asteroid hurtling toward Earth in ""Armageddon"" -- prompts a daring intervention by engineers to save the day. This time, the threat is oil gushing from a broken well on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico that could destroy livelihoods and irreplaceable coastal wetlands. Equally real is the attempted engineering marvel -- a four-story metal container that will be lowered onto the leaking pipe to try to suck in the flowing oil. Officials of BP, the oil giant that owns the leaking well, said Monday they plan to try the unprecedented effort this week. If successful, they say, the ""pollution containment chamber"" could reduce the underwater gusher by more than 80 percent and provide the first success in industry and government efforts to control the spill that began April 20 with an explosion and fire on an offshore rig. ""Everyone's committed to getting this stopped so we can just focus on a cleanup,"" said Doug Suttles, the BP chief operating officer. KATC: Gulf shrimp season to temporarily close . The challenges are vast and varied, reflecting the scope of the problem. The gushing well is 5,000 feet under water at the bottom of the ocean, where the immense pressure makes it impossible for humans to work. So far, unmanned submarines called ""remote operation vehicles"" have been trying unsuccessfully to fix a defective ""blowout preventer"" -- the failsafe gadget that should have prevented the leak in the first place. Now BP has started drilling a relief well that eventually could allow them to close off the broken well. However, that would take at least two months to work, Suttles said. KNOE: Community rallies around rig families . That leaves the pollution containment chamber, a 100-ton, 40-foot-tall rust brown device that workers were still putting together Monday in the Port Fourchon, Louisiana, workyard, where welders' torches showered sparks as gulls flew overhead. It is the biggest such chamber ever constructed, BP officials say. Their plan is to lower the chamber to the ocean floor where the biggest of three leaks in the well's underwater piping occurs. It would straddle the pipe and lock itself into the seabed, so that the leaking oil goes into the chamber itself. Then the question becomes how to pipe it up to a giant tanker on the surface, 5,000 feet up. It is by far the deepest attempted use ever of such a containment chamber, according to BP officials. ""This has been done in shallow water; it's never been done in deep water before,"" Suttles said. The engineers will rely in part on the laws of physics to their advantage, Suttles said. Because water pressure is greater than oil pressure, it should help push the oil to the surface, he said. If all goes well, the containment chamber could be in place and hopefully pumping up much of the spilling oil by the end of the week, Suttles said. BP workers also are building a smaller containment chamber for another leak in the pipe, he said, and hope to close a third leak with a shutoff valve as soon as Tuesday. So far, an estimated 2.6 million gallons of oil, roughly 60,000 barrels, has spilled into the Gulf of Mexico, forming a slick the size of the state of Delaware. The oil continues to gush at a rate of at least 5,000 barrels a day, authorities estimate, and the growing slick could come ashore at any time to destroy sensitive wetlands that are vital for the huge local fishing industry and other resources.

"Washington (CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in an interview released Wednesday that he was ""a bit arrogant"" when he launched his ultimately failed bid for president in 2011, but that after spending nearly two years ""in preparation"" for another, he feels ""substantially more prepared to run."" Perry told The Washington Post that he may have drawn undue confidence because of his experience as governor of an expansive and economically influential state. During a sit-down at the Republican Governors' Association meeting in Florida, he said that experience made him feel he could ""step into that role of candidate and stand up in front of the American people."" ""I was mistaken,"" Perry admitted. The Republican governor entered the 2012 presidential race to high expectations and great fanfare in late 2011, quickly rising to the top of the polls before plummeting to the bottom after a series of gaffes and missteps derailed his bid. Perhaps the most infamous -- his declaration of ""oops"" when he forgot the final federal agency he'd nix if he became president -- continues to dog him as he contemplates another bid. Perry acknowledged the fact that his 2012 failures will shadow his political future, but he said he believes Americans would give him another chance if he decides to run again. ""It's never going to go away,"" he said of his failed bid. ""It's always there, just as Bill Clinton's 1988 [long-winded Democratic] convention speech is always there. It's always part of your past. I'm a big believer that Americans ... are interested in how do you perform after you've been knocked down."" But he was satisfied with how his 14-year tenure as governor of Texas had turned out, as Texas continues to boast a strong economy, he said. Perry also expressed pride in Texas' transformation from ""an intellectual and cultural backwater to a place that is very much on everyone's radar screen on where would be a good place for us to either relocate or expand."" The governor said that experience would be part of his main pitch as he runs again, something he said Americans won't find in ""another relatively young, inexperienced United States senator or a congressman for that matter."" Perry, if he does run, will likely face a wide array of challengers for the GOP nomination, many of them members of the U.S. House or Senate. And he said he'd perform much better in a second presidential campaign after spending ""the last 22 months in preparation."" ""I'm comfortable I'm substantially more prepared to run for the presidency,"" he said. ""I know the challenges. And so, again, I'm not ready to pull the trigger and say I'm in, but I'm comfortable that the process I've put in place here is a proper, timely and thoughtful process."" ""The decision [about running] may be no, but it will not be a no because I'm not prepared,"" he added. Those preparations have included multiple trips abroad and chats with policy experts, including former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George Shultz. And he's become a more outspoken critic of President Barack Obama on immigration in recent months, framing his own experience governing a border state as a competent alternative to Obama's handling of the nation's immigration problems. On Wednesday, he told the Post that the President's expected executive order delaying deportations of thousands of illegal immigrants is ""unconstitutional"" and ""unlawful."" ""It is bad public policy, and the American people are not for it,"" Perry added, calling on Congress to send various immigration reform measures to Obama's desk to put him on record explaining his opposition to any such reforms. But he framed himself as a pragmatist against the more conservative voices in the GOP calling for the President's impeachment over the executive order. ""No,"" he said, asked about whether impeachment should be on the table for the GOP in the party's response. ""I think the American people want to see government work. ... I don't think the vast majority of people see impeachment as government working. That is a last ditch effort to stick a finger in the eye of the President.""","Gov. Rick Perry of Texas says with 22 months of preparation, he's ready for another bid .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Current TV filed a countersuit Friday against its former star employee Keith Olbermann, a day after the television personality filed his suit against the company. Current TV, co-founded by former Vice President Al Gore and businessman Joel Hyatt, ousted Olbermann last week. The company's 16-page suit, filed in California Superior Court, accuses Olbermann of breach of contract and dismisses as ""fiction"" the charges Olbermann leveled against it Thursday. ""In particular, Current seeks a determination that it is no longer obligated to pay a dime to Mr. Olbermann who, having already been paid handsomely for showing up sporadically and utterly failing to keep his end of the bargain, now seeks to be paid tens of millions more for not working at all,"" says the cross-complaint, which was signed by Laura W. Brill, a lawyer for Current TV. The cross-complaint says that Olbermann leaked the financial terms of his contract; refused to help promote the network; was absent 19 of 41 working days in January and February; and refused to participate in Current's caucus and primary election coverage specials, then changed his mind just before the Iowa Caucuses. Current said it has upheld its end of the bargain, and then some, despite criticism from Olbermann, who was its highest-paid employee. ""For example, he arrogantly and falsely calls 'cheap' the company that has paid him the highest compensation he had ever received in his career, provided him the largest staff of any program he had ever anchored, given him the largest studio and custom-designed set on which he had ever worked, and paid over $50,000 in an eight-month period to eight different limousine companies because none of the previous seven were able to meet his Patrician standards for how to drive him around New York City,"" the cross-complaint says. It asks for Current TV to be relieved of any continuing obligations to Olbermann, asks for unspecified damages ""to be proved at trial"" and seeks reimbursement for legal expenses. A call to Olbermann's manager was not immediately returned. On Thursday, Olbermann had sued Current TV in the same court, claiming breach of contract, unfair dealing and disparagement. Olbermann says he is owed $50 million to $70 million in cash and equity compensation, according to the suit, which seeks a jury trial. The lawsuit also seeks a judgment for other unspecified monetary damages, with interest. ""This action is necessary as Current has repeatedly and willfully breached its written agreement with Olbermann,"" his lawsuit said, ""often continuing to do so after receiving specific notices to cure such breaches. ""In its most recent breach, Current unilaterally, and without cause, terminated its agreement with Olbermann. Current's sudden and public termination of Olbermann was the latest in a series of increasingly erratic and unprofessional actions undertaken by Current's senior management,"" the lawsuit said. Olbermann's suit called Gore, Hyatt and Current management ""no more than dilettantes portraying entertainment industry executives.""

"(CNN) -- Joe Van Veldhuizen was 19 miles into his first Ironman. He had two hours left to complete the race, and only three miles to go in the 26.2-mile marathon. Every muscle in his body ached, and the blisters on his feet were the size of a half-dollar. But Van Veldhuizen was determined to finish. Completing the 2013 Ironman Coeur D'Alene would be the culmination of everything he had worked for. No shortcuts . Van Veldhuizen changed careers -- from farmer to firefighter -- 10 years ago when the dairy industry took a significant downturn. Being a firefighter meant spending a lot of time sitting around and eating while waiting for the alarm to sound. The 6-foot-tall Albany, Oregon, resident slowly began to put on weight. By 2007, Van Veldhuizen tipped the scales at 250 pounds, which translated to a body mass index of 35. (Anything over 30 is considered obese.) He knew he needed to get that number down. He felt he didn't have the aerobic stamina to do his job well. ""The things that kill firefighters are cancer and heart attacks,"" said Van Veldhuizen, now 45. ""A lot of those heart attacks happen because people aren't in as good of shape as they might be able to be."" Firefighter obesity a big problem . Losing weight wasn't an easy thing for him, but he refused to take shortcuts. His mantra: take it slow and steady through incremental lifestyle changes -- by cutting his portions and exercising more, instead of trying fad diets or using supplements advertised on TV. For Van Veldhuizen, eating less was a big challenge. His solution? Record everything he ate on a nutrition tracking-app on his smartphone. That way he would also know how much time he'd have to spend at the gym that day. Researchers retract study supporting diet pills . His first weight loss regimen was modest: 20 minutes of cardio on the elliptical machine. He found the rotational motion was easier on his joints, especially in the knees and ankles. Slowly, he increased the length and intesity of his workout. A year later, he could do an hour on the elliptical nonstop. He did it at the highest resistance and incline setting two to three times a week. That helped him lose his first 15 pounds, and he felt like he was in much better shape. After mastering that machine, he felt his joints could take it so he started running. That was in 2008. 6 common mistakes new runners make . A year later, Van Veldhuizen entered a 5K run, followed soon after by a 10K. Then a friend suggested he try a triathlon. He had been running, but he didn't even own a bike. So he borrowed one and he also started going to the pool once a week. Eventually he was swimming every day. By December of 2012, Van Veldhuizen had lost 40 pounds. He says he couldn't have reached his goals without the help of friends like Josh Gum. Gum encouraged Van Veldhuizen and trained alongside him. Gum was an Ironman veteran; for those uninitiated, an Ironman race consists of a 2.4-mile swim, followed by a 112-mile bicycle race, topped by a 26.2-mile run -- all done in under 17 hours. Gum left impressed by Van Veldhuizen's dedication. ""It was a remarkable experience for me seeing (Van Veldhuizen's) progress,"" Gum says. Van Veldhuizen ran a half-Ironman in Sun River, Oregon, and then signed up for the Ironman in Idaho in 2013. Your guide to running at any level . A true Ironman . ""It took me 10 hours to do the bike and swim and get my clothes changed and those kinds of things. So I had 7 hours to do a marathon,"" Van Veldhuizen says. He felt good, but near the end of the race he encountered a serious bump in the road -- or rather, a bump in his foot. Van Veldhuizen soon realized that what he thought was an irritating pebble in his shoe was actually a big red blister on his heel. But he didn't panic. Instead, he calculated the miles to go and the time left on the clock. With seven miles to run before the finish line and three hours left, he decided to proceed the same way he tackled his weight loss journey -- with caution. ""You don't know what the next step brings,"" says Van Veldhuizen. ""All of a sudden you step a little funny on a pebble or you step into a pothole and now you've got a twisted ankle."" Step after step, Van Veldhuizen moved toward his goal. Sixteen hours after he began, he completed his maiden Ironman. ""My whole goal wasn't to set any records, it was to finish the thing,"" says Van Veldhuizen. His friend Gum had been in the race too. He managed to catch up with Van Veldhuizen midway through the second lap of the one-loop, 56-mile bike course. That helped a lot. ""It's very much about friends and the support that you can glean off of each other. You don't do these things alone, you do them together. The experience itself for me is a once in a lifetime."" Van Veldhuizen believes anyone who puts his or her mind to it can do the same thing he did. All you have to do, he says, is figure out what you want and then put in the work to get there. 7 weight loss myths (sort of) debunked . These days, Van Veldhuizen says he feels better prepared to tackle the life-saving challenges in his job. His Ironman training gave him more energy and makes him better prepared to jump into action during his 24-hour shifts as a firefighter. This winter, he says he and his family plan to run trails near his home in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. He, his wife, and his 13-year-old have already entered some 5Ks together. And yes, next summer he plans to do another Ironman in Canada. Only this time, he has a new goal. This time he wants to complete it and beat his old time. This time he doesn't want to do anything slowly.","Joe Van Veldhuizen felt like his weight was holding him back from his job as a firefighter .

"(CNN) -- America is facing the greatest health care challenges in its history. Unprecedented demand is a certainty. According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Administration on Aging and U.S. Census Bureau statistics, the number of Americans 65 and older has exploded by a full 6 million in the past decade to over 13% of the overall population, while the population of ""oldest old"" -- those 85 and older -- has increased by a factor of 10 from the 1950s to today's 6 million. Older people harbor the most disabling diseases, including heart disease, cancer, stroke and dementia: the diseases that depend most on specialist care and complex technology for diagnosis, management and treatment. Yet the Obama administration has wrongheadedly focused on shifting Americans to government insurance. Of the 8.5 million individuals newly insured under Obamacare at the end of the first half of 2014, more than 6 million were enrolled into Medicaid, based on analysis by Edmund Haislmaier and Drew Gonshorowski of The Heritage Foundation using Centers for Medicaid and Medicare data. After the law's Medicaid expansion and with the population aging into Medicare eligibility, the 107 million under Medicaid or Medicare in 2013 rapidly increases to 135 million just five years later, according to CMS projections. By the end of the decade, a full 140 million Americans will have their health care access directly controlled by the U.S. government, a growth rate far higher than private insurance. The problem is that government insurance does not correspond to access to medical care, nor does it imply good health outcomes. Medicaid is already refused by more than half of doctors across America, according to 2013 data from a 2014 Merritt Hawkins survey. Likewise, more than 20% of primary care doctors already accept no new Medicare patients, five times the percentage who refuse new privately insured patients. In 2012 alone, CMS reported that almost 10,000 doctors opted out of Medicare, tripling from 2009. And, counter to the administration's demonization of private insurers, it is Medicare that consistently ranks at the top of the charts for the highest rates of claim refusals, more than nearly all the comparison private insurers every year, according to the AMA's 2013 National Health Insurer Report Cards. Here is another important reality to consider. Virtually all patients with serious diseases today are managed by specialists and with advanced technology. For seniors, visits to specialists have increased from 37% of visits two decades ago to 55% today. And that's appropriate, because those are the doctors who have necessary training and expertise to use the complex diagnostic tests and devices, state-of-the-art procedures, and novel drugs of modern medicine. Fittingly, Americans unambiguously prioritize the latest medical technology. Surveys by Harris/Wall Street Journal Online demonstrate that 80% of Americans say being able to get the most advanced tests, drugs and medical procedures and equipment is ""very important"" or ""absolutely essential""; 67% say that technologies like digital imaging and advances in health information will improve patient care and/or reduce medical costs, while only 10% think these advances cost more than they are worth. In a Health Affairs study, Americans showed a 50% higher interest in new medical discoveries than citizens of Western European nations. We often hear of the Association of American Medical College projected shortage of primary care doctors, but little attention is paid to the fact that almost two-thirds of the 2025 doctor shortage of 124,000 will be in specialists, not in primary care. Yet this administration has been naively prioritizing generalist care at the expense of specialists. The government's Medicare Payment Advisory Commission already recommended substantial cuts to specialists -- 16.7% over 3 years and then frozen, equivalent to a 50% decrease after the decade, considering inflation. It is counterproductive to restrict the autonomy and cut salaries of those who we need the most, thereby reducing the job's attractiveness to the best and brightest who already have a wide range of career choices. More directly, Obamacare is eliminating access to many of the best specialists and best hospitals for middle-income Americans. To meet the law's requirements, major insurers all across the country are declining to participate in the exchanges, or only offering plans that exclude many of America's best doctors and hospitals. McKinsey reported 68% of Obamacare insurance options only cover narrow or very narrow provider networks, double that of one year ago. For cancer care, the overwhelming majority of America's best hospitals in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network -- including MD Anderson Cancer Center, New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Barnes Hospital in St. Louis and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance -- are not covered in most of their states' exchange plans. The ""narrow network"" strategy is about to hit even more Americans in 2015, as Obamacare exchanges from California to New Hampshire further restrict access to top doctors and hospitals in an attempt to quell insurance premium increases caused by the law itself. The fact is that Obamacare transforms American health care toward an antiquated, generalist system and significantly reduces health care choices that Americans hold dear. While the President and his Democrat allies claim that there has been no alternative offered, more than half a dozen Republican health care proposals increase choices for families and increase access to the best doctors via competition and individual empowerment. Voters who prioritize freedom of choice and quality in health care should look to the Republicans to reset the course of America's health care system to one that holds true to American values while advancing access to specialist care and advanced technology.","Scott Atlas: As America's population ages, millions more qualify for Medicare .

"(CNN) -- Congress is back at work. Republicans and Democrats are gauging how much progress the lame duck session will be able to make in the coming weeks. Americans understandably are rolling their eyes, not expecting much from an institution that has been so dysfunctional over the past few years. Will this be like the productive lame duck session after the last midterm election? In 2010, Congress passed a tax bill, repealed the ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" policy for homosexuals in the military and ratified an arms treaty with Russia. ""We're not doomed to endless gridlock,"" Obama said in praise of Congress then. In the first week of the current lame duck Congress, the House did pass a bill approving construction of the Keystone Pipeline. It's not clear what the Senate will do when it votes Tuesday. And since the measure takes the Keystone decision out of the hands of the Obama administration, the president could decide to veto it. A productive lame duck session? Don't count on it. The same forces that produced a dysfunctional Congress in the past year are fully in place. While there have been times when a lame duck Congress has had a breakthrough, it would take a miracle for this to become one of those moments. Both parties have been dug in for the last year and the political pressure to stand their ground is only going to intensify. Republicans know they will have more leverage to get a better deal with their increased representation starting in January, while Democrats don't want to use their last month with control of the Senate to give away the store. For a brief time, Congress had virtually eliminated the lame duck period. In 1932, Congress passed the 20th Amendment, that switched the start date of Congress from March 4 to January 3, which was ratified by the states the following year. The practice of Congress passing bills after elections had frequently infuriated members of the minority party who believed that their colleagues, some of whom had lost their seats, were making decisions regardless of the democratic will. Most members of Congress assumed that starting the session earlier would do the trick since members would be reluctant to travel long distances just for the few weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas. This was in the era when long-distance travel was not easy. For several decades, the amendment served its function. Other than an emergency situation, such as the onset of the Korean War in 1950, Congress didn't do any business in the period after the election. But that ended later in the century. The advent of cheap airline travel made it easier for legislators to get back and forth quickly. Starting in 1970, and accelerating in 1994, Congress treated the post-election period like a normal time of business. Congress began making some big decisions in the interim period. In 1982, for instance, shortly after Democrats walloped the GOP in the midterm elections, the House voted to award itself a retroactive pay raise. In 1994, after Newt Gingrich and his fellow Republicans had shocked Washington by taking back control of the House and Senate for the first time since 1954, Congress passed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Four years later, House Republicans inflamed partisan tensions by voting to impeach President Bill Clinton. In 2002, following a brutal midterm election when many Democrats were skewered for being ""weak on defense"" after 9/11, Congress created the Department of Homeland Security. We certainly shouldn't expect any big breakthroughs in the coming weeks. But as long as members of Congress are back they should try to make some incremental progress, given that the midterms were as much an act of protest against Washington as an act of protest against President Obama. Most important, the departing Congress should try to resolve the routine business that has been ignored. At the top of the list would be passing omnibus spending legislation, rather than continuing resolutions, so that the government does not face a risk of being shut down. It should confirm some executive and judicial branch appointments. Congress must also make sure that important tax cuts, such as credits for energy efficient homes, don't expire. The second goal should be to start working on loophole-closing tax reform. Cleaning up the inequitable and inefficient components of the tax code is something that both parties have been talking about for a long time. While it is unlikely Congress would finish this work during the lame duck period, starting the process would be a great advance. Tax reform is a way to make the tax burden more equitable and to raise more revenue for the government, by closing loopholes without having to raise rates. There is also considerable support in both parties for overhauling the corporate tax code. The third important decision would be to boost funding for the fight against Ebola. The president proposed that Congress authorize $6.2 billion for the effort in Africa as well as the United States. Given all the attention to this issue before the midterm election this would be a natural topic to address. Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee said that even small measures would help ""build trust"" for the coming year. ""You need to have some small victoriesâ€”or victoriesâ€”to build trust"" But small victories are difficult within the polarized world of Capitol Hill. We shouldn't expect much from Congress. Issues like immigration or climate change will have to be left to the realm of executive power. But sometimes small steps can be the best path toward progress. Let's see what this Congress can do.","Congress is meeting in lame duck session with some big items to tackle .

"(CNN) -- World War I ushered in an era of chemical weapons use that lingers, lethally, into the present day. Indeed, the German chlorine attacks against French, Algerian, British and Canadian troops around Ypres -- site of the war's most relentless fighting -- in April 1915 presaged a world in which weapons of mass destruction became at least a permanent background anxiety and often a source of intense terror. World War I, which began nearly 100 years ago, linked science with mass killing and, despite preventative treaties such as the 1900 Hague Convention, created a lasting precedent. Scientific progress now brought new fears as well as hope. The other combatant nations responded to their maximum extent, with rapidly developed mixtures of retaliation-in-kind and protective technologies and procedures. Perhaps 1 million chemical casualties were inflicted, to little overall military advantage. Although fatalities were eventually kept relatively low, at about 90,000 in total, there was, and remains, deep revulsion at slow, agonizing deaths from tissue damage through blistering of the skin caused by innovations such as mustard gas or drowning through destruction of the lungs. Opinion: How a century-old war affects you . Many survivors were left blind or permanently disabled. Human distress, dread, ""gas fright"" and their long-term psychiatric consequences are impossible to calculate. They may have fatefully helped intensify Hitler's psychopathology as he lay brooding upon the Armistice in a military hospital, temporarily blinded by British mustard gas. Later, in the Geneva Gas Protocol of 1925, the world tried to address its WMD problem through a collective promise of ""no first chemical or bacteriological use,"" backed by uncontrolled arsenals, which it was hoped would deter treaty breach by the hideously plausible and familiar threat of retaliation. That gamble held precariously in World War II but not in hidden, or conveniently overlooked, one-sided campaigns conducted by Spain, Italy, Japan and Egypt in remote theaters such as Morocco, Ethiopia, China and Yemen. Continued secret research created still more efficient nerve gases, blatantly employed by Saddam Hussein's forces in the 1980s against Iranians and Kurds, without international response. However, the international honeymoon period after the Cold War allowed the negotiation of total, monitored and inspected elimination of all chemical weapons stocks and production facilities under the 1998 Chemical Weapons Convention. But World War I and its aftermath have left discouraging precedents. Opinion: The mighty women of World War I . Although banned, in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, from keeping any chemical weapons, Germany secretly maintained formidable capacities. Its specialists went on to set up joint trials and research facilities in the USSR and to pioneer the whole class of nerve agents. Cheating in arms-control treaties, especially with the assistance of third parties, has remained a lasting political anxiety and an intelligence priority ever since. We now also know that during World War I, German agents tried systematically to infect Allied livestock with glanders (a serious bacterial disease, transmissible to humans but mainly affecting horses and mules). This was the insidious, but fortunately not then very successful, birth of covert scientific biological warfare -- which, despite the unverifiable and evidently broken Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1971, now persists as an uneliminable security nightmare. So we are all still partially breathing the yellow-green poison cloud that Nobel laureate Fritz Haber determinedly developed and the generals of the German High Command, locked into the first scientific Total War, reluctantly authorized. (The suicides, apparently through shame and disgust, of both Haber's wife, Clara, and Hermann, one of his sons, seem to add further intimate casualties to his innovation.) Opinion: How World War I gave us 'cooties' Haber's weaponization of chlorine for the second Battle of Ypres heralded a period of destructive technological dynamism in which we still live, when, repeatedly, as Bertolt Brecht observed: . ""Out of the libraries come the killers. Mothers stand despondently waiting, . Hugging their children and searching the sky, . Looking for the latest inventions of the professors."" And today, the news remains bad. Mothers still scan the sky for incoming chemicals. Chlorine is back. After 1,400 people were killed with highly efficient sarin nerve agent in the rebel-held eastern suburbs of Damascus in August, the Syrian government agreed to join the 1998 Chemical Weapons Convention and cooperate in its own chemical disarmament, as an alternative to U.S. punitive strikes. Opinion: The 'bionic men' of World War I . Before completion of that process, reports repeatedly emerged in early 2014 of new attacks using chlorine, which as an industrial chemical used in water purification cannot be removed from the country, although employing it against humans is unquestionably forbidden. Chlorine's lethality, even against unprotected civilians, may be unimpressively low by modern standards, but it reliably continues to terrify. And while German culpability in the gas attacks in Flanders 100 years ago was clear, the United Nations is still unable to agree, or even yet formally investigate, which side has been conducting chemical attacks of any kind in the long Syrian civil war. Chemical warfare was universally criminalized in September under U.N. Security Council Resolution 2118. But finally eliminating or even punishing the homicidal employment of chemicals in organized violence is a diplomatic as much as a legal, technical or military problem. It turns out that some international behavior over chemical killing remains as toxic as in 1915.

"Orlando (CNN) -- On a steamy Florida mid-summer morning, two girls' teams battle in the finals of the the Disney Cup International Youth Soccer Tournament . Competition is fierce between the teams from opposite corners of the United States. The Tracyton Tornados from Washington state and the FC America team from central Florida both earned the right to participate in this semi-final game during the annual competition that draws teams from the United States and other countries. This game and the tournament are an outgrowth of an American trend -- the number of children playing soccer in the United States has grown dramatically, especially among young girls who idolized the U.S. women's soccer teams competing in the World Cup. Just three decades ago, the U.S. Youth Soccer organization counted its membership at 100,000. Today, as municipal parks are filled with millions of young soccer players, the organization counts more than 3 million young players, according to its website. The Disney Cup has taken place for the past 13 years at ESPN's Wide World of Sports complex at Disney World. The complex's numbers reflect a growth of women participating in sports in general. ""Sixty percent of athletes that participate at the Wide World of Sports of approximately 300,000 athletes are women,"" says Mike Millay, business director of the complex. The sports park holds sporting competitions year round for baseball, football, soccer, basketball, along with track and field. Venessa Starcher -- mom, soccer coach and former soccer player -- loves the sport intimately. In fact, she wishes she could still play, but the years can get in the way. ""I've seen women's soccer go from a small sport to a huge sport, I think it's the fastest growing sport because the other ones have been around for a long time,"" said Starcher, whose daughter plays on the FC America team. This soccer mom believes every time the U.S. women's soccer team competes in high-profile competitions like the World Cup, it exposes more girls and young women to the game. ""People start watching not that they're interested in soccer, but they like to see America win,"" says Starcher. But once they watch, the game catches on. The U.S women's soccer team won the 1999 World Cup, grabbing the attention of girls and women throughout the United States . When Title Nine -- the U.S law that banned   discrimination based on sex in education and other activities for schools that received federal funding -- became law in 1972, women's participation in sports exploded. And in 1972, two colleges offered scholarships for women's soccer. Today, dozens of college have programs and offer scholarships, says Starcher. Rich Hickey, coach of the Tracyton Tornados, says, ""I have one daughter and it's pretty cool that she can do all the same things that I could do as a boy -- but I don't think it was there for my sister."" Hickey says the level of women's soccer continues to improve as does the level of coaching. Women typically coached girls' teams in the past but today men or women with more experience are teaching the game. ""If you're practicing right and playing hard and if you believe you're as good as every boy -- or better -- than you should go out there and prove it to me,"" says Coach Hickey to his squad of 12-to-14-year-old girls. ""And they usually do,"" said Hickey whose girls often beat boys' teams in mixed matches. The Disney sports complex director says he continues to see soccer grow at single digits growth, as do other sports. ""You're seeing soccer more because it's played at a younger age; girls stay with that sport longer,"" says Millay. ""Where it's growing internationally, it will fuel the United States' growth,"" he added. Even teenager Tiffani Ferrell with the Tracyton Tornado's has seen soccer for women change. ""There used to be no soccer at all but it's becoming so global and so much fun to watch -- that's it's just going to keep getting bigger and bigger,"" she says. The Orlando FC America team beat Tracyton Tornados 2-1 to move on to the final, only to loose to Ft. Lauderdale's Pine Crest 0-3. Despite his daughter's team's loss, soccer dad Neal Gaulben kept a positive attitude following the game. ""I think you are going to see a boost to soccer to both men and women,"" he predicts. ""I think soccer is going to take off in the U.S. It's about time!""","Three decades ago, the U.S. Youth Soccer organization had 100,000 members .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's opposition to President Obama's executive action on deportations puts him in the uncomfortable position of running counter to policy moves taken by both his father and his brother during their presidencies. It's the latest example of the complications Bush has faced on the immigration issue as he considers a 2016 presidential run. Bush has long drawn criticism from conservatives for his more moderate positions on reform, including his support for a pathway to citizenship for those here illegally. His Friday statement on Obama's executive action to protect nearly 5 million immigrants from deportation was nuanced, taking aim only at the tactic, not the ultimate effect. ""President Obama's ill-advised unilateral action on illegal immigration undermines all efforts to forge a permanent solution to this crisis. Action must come in the form of bipartisan comprehensive reform passed through Congress,"" Bush said. He later tweeted that the move was ""an abuse of power."" But both Presidents George H.W. Bush and his son used similar unilateral action to protect immigrants from the threat of deportation under similar circumstances. In 2001 President George W. Bush extended protections to as many as 150,000 Salvadorans in the United States illegally. And the elder Bush implemented a ""Family Fairness"" policy to allow an estimated 1.5 million close family members of newly legalized immigrants under the sweeping 1986 immigration reform measure to avoid deportation while they applied for legal status. Those moves were used by Democrats to defend the legality of Obama's executive action. And Julie Myers Wood, a former George W. Bush administration official who wrote a memo arguing for prosecutorial discretion on deportations, admitted that there was some hypocrisy from Republicans in opposition to this move. ""I think there's a lot of hypocrisy on both sides,"" she told CNN, ""but certainly prosecutorial discretion has been a longstanding policy."" She said, however, Obama's move was unique because of ""the broadness of the scope and the lack of individualized assessments,"" and because Obama was expanding access to work permits. Wood echoed Jeb Bush's concern over the tactic used to solve the problem, saying that while she ""actually liked the result that we're getting...it's an odd way to do it."" But she also acknowledged the President was running out of options to solve the problem. ""What was the President to do?"" Wood asked. She added: ""This needed to be done. It's a pretty broken system.""","Jeb Bush hammered Obama for unilateral action, but past Bush presidents have done similar .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British twins who had been separated at birth learned they were related only after they had become husband and wife, according to a senior British lawmaker. Former British MP David Alton says twins separated at birth went on to marry each other. Lord Alton of Liverpool told the House of Lords that a court annulled the union as soon as the twins' true relationship became known. ""They were never told that they were twins,"" he said during the December 10 debate on a law covering human fertility and embryology. They had been adopted by separate families and ""met later in life and felt an inevitable attraction, and the judge had to deal with the consequences of the marriage that they entered into and all the issues of their separation,"" he said. No further details about the case were revealed by Lord Alton, and it is not known when the marriage took place or how long they were together before they discovered the truth. Adoption groups said Friday the case proved the need for openness and transparency during the adoption process. Mo O'Reilly, director of child placement for the British Association for Adoption and Fostering, said released a statement saying: ""Thirty or 40 years ago it would have been more likely that twins be separated and brought up without knowledge of each other."" However, she said, greater emphasis in recent years on ensuring adopted siblings stay in touch meant this ""traumatic"" case will remain ""incredibly rare."" Daisy O'Clee, a spokeswoman for the agency, said that of more current concern is the lack of legislation surrounding fertility treatment. Under British law the parents of a donor-conceived child do not have to declare that fact on the child's birth certificate, O'Clee told CNN. This means a child conceived with a donor sperm or egg may never know their true origin. Lawmakers will vote Tuesday on whether to pass a law covering human fertility and embryology that would relax the rules on who can have fertility treatment. O'Clee warned that in its present form the proposal does little to address the rights of donor-conceived children. ""The rights of donor children are being ignored,"" she said.","Twins separated at birth went on to marry each other, a British lawmaker says .

"(CNN) -- As any bike lover can attest, cycling has numerous advantages over driving; it's cheaper, healthier, and when there's traffic, the ride can be considerably quicker. What cars bring to the table is storage space. It's difficult to imagine moving house, schlepping groceries or making deliveries by bicycle, but in a handful of cities, residents and businesses are choosing to do just that. Nine years ago, Rob King launched Outspoken Deliveries, a bicycle courier service in Cambridge, England -- a city often deemed the country's most bike-friendly. ""When we started, there were a few companies in Cambridge doing what we do, but they were still using shoulder bags, and delivering small documents. We found these cargo bikes that operated like a small van, only they were much more flexible and faster,"" he recalls. Today, his fleet includes bikes that can haul up to 250kg (550 pounds). Last year, Outspoken started subcontracting for larger delivery firms, including Parcelforce, TNT and APC. ""Traveling that last mile or two to deliver a package can be a bit of a headache for delivery companies,"" explains King. In the EU, larger companies often have to comply with automobile restrictions (in Cambridge, cars can't load or unload in the city center between 10am and 4pm without incurring a fine) and increased taxes for high-emission vehicles. Delivery by bike avoids those pitfalls. Research undertaken by CycleLogistics, an EU-funded project dedicated to replacing motorized freight transport with bikes, found that bikes and cargo bikes could accommodate 51% of all deliveries in European cities currently being moved by all types of motor vehicles and over 90% of all supermarket shopping trips. According to Austrian Mobility Research, that amounts to a saving of 37 million tons of C02 a year, or a full 1% of Europe's current emissions. ""C02 isn't even the main argument,"" says Dr. Randy Rzewnicki, the project manager for CycleLogistics. ""There are an awful lot of more things that would benefit from moving shipping to bikes; urban air pollution, noise pollution, traffic. Those are big problems in Europe."" Of course, a surge in bike usage does raise the issue of bicycle casualties, though according to Ceri Woolsgrove, the policy officer for road safety and technical issues at The European Cyclists' Federation, reducing the number of delivery trucks could significantly reduce fatalities. ""Traditional lorries are really the most dangerous vehicle we come up against. They account for about 3% of the total vehicle fleet in Europe, but 18% of fatal road accidents. About 22% of cyclists killed in the EU are killed in collisions with good vehicles and public transport,"" he notes. Despite the many benefits to getting cargo bikes on the road, Rzewnicki finds that one of the biggest hurdles his mission faces is a misconception of what is transferable by bike. In point of fact, there are few limitations. King says some of the more unusual things they transport include medical samples and human tissue for local hospitals. ""We've taken heart valves, and eyes, and all sorts,"" he notes. In Copenhagen, a local sperm bank even developed a sperm-shaped bicycle that carries (you guessed it) sperm. To accomplish this, the belly of the bike has been outfitted with a nitrogen-cooled tank set to -320 degrees F to make carting samples around the city a possibility. ""We have about 15 clinics around the city, and we used to find ourselves stuck in traffic a lot of the time. By bike, it's an easy 20 minute ride between them,"" explains Dr. Peter Bower, the CEO of the European Sperm Bank. While Bower notes he's ""taken it to the extreme,"" he points out that in the cycle haven that is Copenhagen, cargo bikes are becoming the norm over cars. ""There are plumbers and carpenters and craftsmen that are starting to use bikes to carry a significant load. People here see the advantage of moving quickly through the city with more than you could carry on a regular bike.","Research suggests that 90% of grocery trips could be made by bicycle .

Though delivery trucks account for 3% EU of traffic, they contribute to 18% of fatal accidents ."
"(CNN) -- A 6.5-magnitude earthquake has struck off the shore of Northern California, leaving thousands of households without power. The quake, which ran about 13.5 miles deep, hit offshore at 4:27 p.m. (7:27 p.m. ET) Saturday, about 33 miles from the coastal city of Eureka, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. About 28,000 customers, most of them in Humboldt County, were left without power Saturday evening, said Jeff Smith, spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. One gas leak in the county was also reported. He said utility crews were patrolling the area to restore power. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries or damage, according to local authorities and the U.S. Coast Guard in Humboldt County. St. Joseph's hospital confirmed one person being treated for a broken hip and several others arriving with bumps and bruises from the earthquake. Nearly a dozen aftershocks followed, the strongest at 4.5 magnitude. Calls from concerned citizens were pouring into police and fire departments. Gary Bird, spokesman for the 28,000-population Eureka, said 25 responders were surveying the scene. See iReports from areas affected by earthquake . ""We've got isolated water line breaks, power lines down, broken windows, unreinforced buildings that had some bricks fall off into the street,"" he said, adding that residents have been asked to stay inside. Chris Durant, a reporter for the Times-Standard of Eureka, said he was working on the second floor of the newspaper's concrete building when he and his colleagues felt the quake. ""We are used to feeling small ones,"" he said, ""but after the first few seconds, we looked at each other and said this is not a small one."" He said small chunks of plaster peppered the floor. Still, he said reports from the area indicate minor damage. ""[There's] not as much as you might think with a 6.5,"" he added, describing much of the damage as broken glass on storefronts and tiles on floors and ceilings popping. ""People are standing outside and talking with their neighbors, and, kind of like letting their nerves calm down,"" he said. iReporter Andrew Parent of Eureka was driving home from work when he saw people running out of their homes and power lines down. He rushed home to find a state of disarray -- dishes everywhere, a bookshelf toppled over. ""The fridge moved. Everything moved,"" said parent, 20. ""I guess it's not really a big deal, but it was kind of scary."" Are you there? Send your iReports . Eureka resident Cole Machado told CNN he was talking on the phone when he felt the ground shake. ""I thought my TV was going to fall over."" He said the power cut out for a few seconds and there were reports of downed phone lines and broken windows in the the nearby town of Ferndale, which is 27 miles away from the quake's epicenter. Ferndale Fire Chief Tom Grinsell said it was ""one of the strongest quakes I remember in quite a while. I assumed it was going to be a lot worse than we're seeing."" He said the quake had a ""strong shaking to it and was rather lengthy."" He said his department has received numerous calls about broken glass, emptied shelves, and stucco and plaster knocked off walls. However, he added that the damage is cosmetic and that no buildings have collapsed. Grinsell said officials have asked residents to stay off the roads because of debris and to conserve water until it's certain there is no damage to the water system. Ferndale resident Jessica Stephens Tucker described the movement from the temblor: ""It rolled and rolled and then it slammed."" There was no tsunami warning issued. A 6.5-magnitude quake is considered a ""strong"" temblor, according to CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras, who noted that about 120 are recorded worldwide each year. Dave Magni, owner of the Ivanhoe Hotel in Ferndale, said, ""We are sitting in a sea of booze"" after the quake. He felt an aftershock while talking with CNN. ""My employees are out in the parking lot right now,"" he added.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Tuesday, for the first time, Google Glass was made available to the general public. As part of the one-day-only offering, anyone in the U.S. could buy the $1,500 face-mounted computers and get a free pair of glass or sunglass frames. Google isn't sharing any sales numbers for the day, so it's difficult to divine how successful its first open-sales event has been. There were no reports of the Google Glass sales site crashing or customers being turned away. Google did say it had sold out of the white, or ""cotton"" color of Glass. As of Tuesday afternoon there were still red, blue, gray and black options available. ""Wow, what a morning! We're happy to see so many new faces (and frames) in the Explorer Program,"" Google posted Tuesday to a Google+ page, announcing the unavailability of the Cotton model. The Explorer Program refers to early testers of the Glass connected eyewear, which is expected to become widely available by the end of the year. Early on Wednesday Google posted an update saying, ""All spots in the Explorer Program have been claimed for now, but if you missed it this time, don't worry. We'll be trying new ways to expand the Explorer program in the future."" A Google spokesperson later said in a statement, ""While you can still access the site, Glass will be marked as sold out. We are leaving the site open so Explorers can still get any accessories they need."" The $1,500 headset was only available online, so there were no lines of buyers outside Google buildings. There also didn't appear to be any organized protests of the sale, despite isolated assaults against Glass wearers in this city amid recent tensions between longtime residents and a recent influx of tech-industry staffers. Limited rollouts are a good way for Google to test the demand for its much hyped wearable product. Previously, the only people who could get Glass were developers or people who applied for the device through Google contests. (The Silicon Valley-based company is no stranger to creating hype for a new product. When it first rolled out Gmail 10 years ago, the service was invite only, making it seem exclusive.) There are practical reasons Google has drawn out the product's launch. Glass is technically still in beta and it has been made significantly more consumer friendly since its launch a year ago. Since then, the hardware has been updated and on-staff designers created a line of sleek glass frames that can hold prescription lenses. A day before opening up the online orders, Google announced the latest round of software updates for Glass, which will roll out later this week. The upgrade is expected to improve the device's battery life and make future software updates easier. There are minor tweaks related to photo sharing, submitting feedback to Google and voice commands. In response to dissatisfaction with the quality of video calls on Glass, Google has removed that feature until it can be improved. Ben Farrell has wanted to buy Glass for a while but didn't pull the trigger until today. The San Francisco-based developer wants to wear the device while walking and running to get back into the habit of working out. He's also interested in developing location-based games for Glass, inspired by augmented reality games like Ingress. ""The annoying bit about designing games like this is having the user constantly looking down at their phone while trying to play the game in the real world,"" said Farrell. On Twitter, many of the people expressing excitement about their orders for Glass, appeared to work in the tech industry. But some were just regular folks who wanted to see the technology's potential firsthand. Samantha Hutchison, a restaurant, hotel, and institutional management student in Texas, wants to find uses for Glass for students and travelers. ""I will be on the spring 2015 voyage of Semester at Sea and I hope to help develop the traveling apps to help capture my semester abroad,"" said Hutchison. (She's #teamshale.) Nate Gilbert, a Glass customer who works for a rival company, thinks that the current price point is way too high. But that wasn't going to stop him from ordering a pair. ""I want to see how legit this is. What can it do,"" said Gilbert. ""It seems like the future, but how close is it?"" There's also no way to tell if enthusiasm for Glass has been subdued by recent attacks on people wearing Glass in public or backlash over privacy concerns. Some fans might have decided to save their money and wait until Google releases the next version of Glass, expected by the end of the year. The next version of Glass will likely sport a reduced price tag.","Google made its head-mounted Glass available to the general public for the first time on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Jay Leno and Cpl. Ethan Laberge don't have much in common. One is best known as a comedian and the former host of ""The Tonight Show,"" while the other is recovering from serious injuries he sustained while serving in Afghanistan. But there is one thing these two share, and that's a love of cars. So to say thank you to Cpl. Laberge for his service, Leno decided to gift the soldier with something that he knew he would enjoy: a brand new Dodge Hellcat. Leno and Laberge met through Leno's USO comedy tour with the ""Today"" show's Al Roker. ""When I travel to entertain the troops, the best part ... is the few minutes I get to spend with each soldier,"" Leno said on ""Today"" Wednesday. ""Behind every handshake, every hello, is a great kid. And I wanted to introduce the world to one of them. We sort of took all these wounded warriors and did a lottery and picked a soldier at random and drew something for him, and hopefully, it expresses what we want to do for all soldiers."" Laberge was on foot patrol in Afghanistan when a suicide bomber detonated himself on the street where Laberge was standing. The soldier has had 10 surgeries to try to repair what was damaged, but he still suffers from constant pain, in addition to memory loss caused by a traumatic brain injury. Leno hoped to take his mind off some of that with the simple gift of a joyride in a 2015 Dodge SRT Hellcat through the open roads of Fort Campbell, Kentucky. ""Sometimes I think when you're a soldier, you get this feeling that you're all alone and the rest of the country doesn't care,"" Leno said. ""So when people take a moment to stop and go, hey you, thank you very much -- I think it does something for them."" Once they were done taking turns behind the wheel -- and after a pit stop for some barbecue -- Leno handed the keys to the Hellcat over to Laberge. ""It's yours,"" Leno told him. ""America loves you. Thank you. Have a lot of fun, don't get any tickets."" To which Laberge quickly responded with a smile, ""I can't promise that."" Leno added on ""Today"" Wednesday that he ""wanted to do something a little bit different"" to show his gratitude to servicemen and women. ""Everybody helps the soldiers with medical issues and all those important things, but sometimes, that can be like getting socks for Christmas,"" he said.

"London (CNN) -- A man was accused Tuesday in a UK court of planning either an indiscriminate ""Mumbai-style"" attack or an attack against a prominent person -- possibly former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Erol Incedal is accused of preparing terrorist acts with the intention of committing terrorism, and of having documents on how to build a bomb. He denies the charges against him. The trial at the Old Bailey Central Criminal Court originally had been planned as a secret trial, but a judge has allowed some reporting of its opening phase. Incedal is accused of possessing documents that refer to bomb making which, according to the prosecution, were found on an SD card hidden between an iPhone and its protective case. Police also found a piece of paper tucked inside a glasses case with an address tied to Blair, the prosecution said. However, prosecutors do not allege that Incedal had settled on a plan to attack the former Prime Minister. His iPhone had been used to carry out Internet searches for ""ISIS"" and ""Sham,"" the court heard, the latter being a reference to Syria. A second defendant, Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar, has pleaded guilty to one count of possessing a document that could be used in a terror attack, also on an SD card hidden between an iPhone and its case. He will be sentenced at a later date. According to the prosecution, both men had three identical documents on their respective SD cards. They included a ""Car Bomb Recognition Guide"" and a ""bomb making"" Word document, parts of which were considered ""viable"" but also incomplete, the court heard. One document found at Incedal's home had a reference to ""Plan,"" which looks like a checklist including ""1 month surveillance,"" ""rent flat nearby,"" ""uniform,"" and ""tools and materials,"" prosecutors said. Incedal and Bouhadjar communicated via email and Skype using code words and aliases to refer to the words ""Kalashnikov"" and ""Mumbai style,"" the prosecution said. They also allegedly talked of obtaining ""straps"" -- slang for guns -- the court heard. More than 160 people were killed in November 2008 when 10 Pakistani gunmen associated with the terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba stormed buildings in Mumbai, India.","NEW: Defendant Erol Incedal had documents on how to build a bomb, prosecution says .

"(CNN) -- If the United States Department of Justice has any real interest in obtaining justice in the tragic shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, Attorney General Eric Holder's announcement of a new civil rights investigation in Ferguson, Missouri, (population 21,000) was a step in the wrong direction. The department's ham-handed effort to improve the political ""optics"" of active federal involvement may, ironically, create the reasonable doubt that will ultimately clear the shooter, Officer Darren Wilson. The Department of Justice is likely to be impeding justice by proceeding prematurely with a federal investigation while local law enforcement authorities struggle with the facts of the complex and controversial case. The DOJ investigations (there now appear to be two that have been officially announced) are highly prejudicial to the local prosecutor's presentation of the case to the grand jury. The non-sequestered grand jurors who return home every night after scrutinizing evidence in the case are almost certain to hear of the existence of the new federal investigation. After all, the investigation was personally announced by the attorney general himself after the President publicly commented on the case. The grand jurors might reasonably wonder why the federal government would open a civil rights investigation at the very same time they are hearing evidence about Ferguson's most famous homicide. Some might reasonably wonder: Is it possible that police Officer Darren Wilson was motivated by race hatred when he shot and killed Michael Brown? Why would the feds be investigating if that were not the case? Although grand jurors are instructed to avoid press coverage of the matters they are investigating, such an instruction is obviously difficult to enforce with the tsunami of demonstrations, press coverage and presidential pronouncements rolling through St. Louis County. The Department of Justice should not add to the potential of improperly influencing a sitting grand jury by stirring up additional pretrial publicity as Holder did last week. Notwithstanding the street conviction of Officer Darren Wilson by the ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot"" demonstrators and their allies in the press who appear to march in politically correct lockstep, a sworn grand jury is still evaluating evidence in the case. The federal government should not be playing to the press and the crowd while this sensitive homicide investigation proceeds. There is plenty of time to commence a federal civil rights investigation and lawsuit when the facts of this case have been sorted out by the citizens who have pledged to evaluate the case in a fair and impartial manner. By all accounts, the grand jury presentation is occurring as grand jury presentations normally do in matters of this kind. I see no evidence that there has been any delay or improprieties in the current local grand jury proceedings that would justify immediate federal intervention. The folly of Holder dispatching FBI agents to re-interview witnesses, many already interviewed by local law enforcement authorities, is apparent to any experienced criminal lawyer. Multiple witness statements (and in this case TV appearances) create a wealth of material for criminal defense attorneys to add to their cross-examination arsenal. Eyewitness testimony is often problematic in the best of cases. When even truthful witnesses make multiple statements about observations of a fast-moving event, there are often inconsistencies. Experienced prosecutors attempt to keep a tight rein on the statements of their key witnesses to avoid inconsistencies being used by defense attorneys to create reasonable doubt. The DOJ has blundered even further by conducting its own independent autopsy. In a case where forensic evidence relating to powder burns, angle of entry of the fatal bullets and other matters is of critical importance, the Department of Justice helps to build reasonable doubt by ensuring three separate autopsy reports will be available for defense attorneys to scrutinize for contradictions and the creation of reasonable doubt. Conflicting accounts of expert medical witnesses can be devastating to a prosecutor's case. It is also highly unusual that the Department of Justice would seek to devote its enormous resources to the investigation of a tiny 50-person police force in charge of a city with a population of less than 21,000. There have been small-town investigations in the past, but they often occur in highly unusual situations, such as the lawsuit brought against Colorado City, Arizona, a municipality alleged to be virtually owned and operated by Warren Jeffs, the leader of the polygamist cult FDLS who is serving a life sentence for sexually abusing children in his congregation. Such investigations are virtually never done while an active, sensitive homicide case is under local grand jury investigation. I would imagine there are far greater problems in places like Chicago, Philadelphia, Camden, New Orleans, Houston, Dallas, Cincinnati, Birmingham, Tallahassee and probably 100 other large American cities that should be commanding the attention of the Department of Justice rather than Ferguson. And if the pattern and practices of small-town Ferguson require the scrutiny of the Department of Justice, surely this can be done after the local authorities finish handling the most important matter facing the town, the Michael Brown shooting. If the evidence supports an indictment, the officer deserves to be indicted and brought to justice. On the other hand, if Wilson was under apparent attack and fired the fatal shots under the authority granted to police officers by Missouri law, he deserves to be cleared. Either way, the decision should be made on the basis of the evidence rather than political meddling by the Department of Justice. While it is encouraging to see the administration finally has a ""strategy"" in place regarding the nation's most highly publicized legal case, it might be better if it was one aimed at accomplishing justice rather than undermining it.","Paul Callan: Justice Department made a mistake with its new investigation of Ferguson police .

"Beijing, China (CNN)  -- When Wu Youjian's teenage son told her on a spring night in 1999 that he was gay, Wu did something rarely heard of in China. ""I told him, there's nothing wrong with liking boys and it's no big deal,"" said the 63-year-old retired magazine editor. Five years later, when her son discussed his sexuality on local television in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, Wu made another groundbreaking decision. She became what state media calls the first Chinese parent to go on television in support of her gay child. Zheng Yuantao, 30, knows how lucky he is to have such a mother. ""Many of my gay friends are afraid of going home during holidays, because their parents would ask about girlfriends and press them to get married,"" he said. ""I grew up in a very open-minded family,"" he added. ""I didn't have too much of a struggle about my sexuality."" Wu now devotes her time and energy to speaking up for gay acceptance by family and society. Her small frame belies her big role in China's gay community, where she is affectionately called ""Mama Wu."" She taught herself to use a computer three years ago and now writes a blog that has clocked more than 2.2 million hits. She also tweets frequently, has launched a hotline and founded the country's first PFLAG - Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays - group in her hometown. ""I just followed my instinct and my love for my son,"" Wu said. For other Chinese parents in her situation, however, instinct usually means a deep sense of shame. Many refuse to face the reality and some sever ties with their gay children. Others scheme to break up their children's relationships. Some may insist on psychiatric treatments, while others may threaten to commit suicide if their children don't change. 'Mama Wu' inspires other Chinese parents of gay children . ""In China, we consider carrying on the family line of paramount importance, but we don't value the happiness of individuals,"" said Li Yinhe, a sociologist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Societal pressure cooker . Suicide is high among Chinese homosexuals, Li said, with some surveys saying as many as 30 percent of gay youth attempt to take their lives. That trend mirrors the United States, where a spate of suicides by gay adolescents in recent months has shaken the nation. Most gay men in China still succumb to social pressure and marry women. It once meant heterosexual marriages, often with children, Li said. Now, gay community activists say a small but growing number of young gay men in big cities are tying the knot with lesbians to both placate families and maintain their lifestyles. Li conducted China's first comprehensive surveys on gay men. She published her findings in a 1992 book, which Wu credited for shaping her views on homosexuality. While society at large has loosened up on homosexuality, Li said, family pressure on gay people remains strong because of deep-rooted Confucian ideas and the government's one-child policy - making Wu's words and actions all the more powerful. ""No one would listen to an outsider, but she is not - she is a mother whose only son is gay,"" Li said. ""Others would wonder, if she can handle it so well, why can't I."" It's not all accolades for Wu, however. Vitriolic attacks often dog her online. On a popular video-sharing site, under a clip paying tribute to her achievements, a recent comment accused her of ""leading our youth to a place filthier than a brothel"" and ""hastening the moral death of our already-sick society."" Wu brushes such verbal assaults aside. Her son, often a target himself along with Wu, understands why. ""It's not about how many people she can change,"" Zheng said. ""The important thing is that she is out there helping real people every day."" Gay venues shut down . Homosexuality is not illegal in China, and in 2001 it was also removed from the country's list of officially recognized mental disorders. But it remains largely a taboo topic on state-run media. Police sometimes shut down gay venues when high profile events are held. Gay rights advocates reported raids on gay clubs, saunas and cruising spots ahead of the Summer Olympics and the annual parliament sessions in Beijing in the past. Officials have also pulled the plug - often at the last minute - on gay-themed events, including the country's first gay pageant last January. Li, the sociologist who also serves as a government adviser, has tried to cement gay rights in Chinese law. She submitted proposals to legalize same-sex marriage in 2003, 2005 and 2006. None have succeeded so far - and she admits her goal probably won't be realized anytime soon. ""Gays are minorities in society,"" she said. ""People just don't think this issue is important enough, compared to national priorities like economic development."" Wu stresses the social and non-political nature of her activities, highlighting official approval and state media reports in her speeches. Her group also joins the effort in HIV/AIDS prevention, a gay-related cause promoted by the government. She has picked up pace in spreading the message of acceptance, giving lectures and hosting seminars across the nation. At a recent PFLAG gathering in Beijing, Wu, sporting a rainbow scarf and speaking in a calm but firm tone, addressed a packed hotel conference room of about 100 people, with her son and his boyfriend in attendance. Her voice cracked, however, when she mentioned how parental intransigence drove a married young gay man, who had sought her help, to take his life. ""We have to give them hope,"" Wu said, quoting iconic gay American politician Harvey Milk. Wu says she constantly reminds other parents about one basic fact. ""It doesn't matter if our children are gay or straight - just like it doesn't matter if they are left-handed or right-handed,"" she said. ""They are always our children."" Thousands of blog posts and phone calls later, Wu has compiled her stories in a new book - titled ""Love Is the Most Beautiful Rainbow"" - and vows to continue her effort. ""I have only one child, but so many call me Mama,"" she said.","'Mama Wu' has earned fame by publicly defending her homosexual son .

"New York (CNN)  -- Some Americans spent Friday night worrying about their next mortgage payment. Many prayed for loved ones serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Others continued to clean up spilled oil in the U.S. Gulf. Paris Hilton, meanwhile, was tooling around the Las Vegas Strip with a male friend in a black Cadillac Escalade, until a traffic cop thought he smelled marijuana and pulled them over. As the incident unfolded, passing cars slowed down and a crowd of about 100 gathered to take photos and witness Hilton make news yet again. Just before a supervised bathroom break at the Wynn Hotel, Hilton asked to get lip balm from her purse. As she opened the purse, an officer noticed a ""small bindle"" in a ""clear baggy"" fall out, according to the police report. Hilton, who was arrested on suspicion of possessing less than a gram of cocaine, said the purse and powdery substance were not hers, the report says. This was not the 29-year-old heiress socialite's first brush with the law. Media outlets, bloggers and Hollywood pundits will surely scrutinize the arrest in great detail and speculate for days to come about whether it will be her last. With all the problems the world faces -- climate change, terrorism, economic malaise and more -- why do we care so much about celebrities such as Hilton getting into trouble? ""In the last four years 28,000 people have been killed in a country that shares our border, and the country that is supposed to be our safest ally in the Middle East has now got 20 million displaced people,'' said Danny Bonaduce, a former child actor in the 1970s sitcom ""The Partridge Family,"" referring to the drug wars in Mexico and recent floods in Pakistan. ""The news is bad. Who wants to know that when we can watch Lindsay Lohan drown in a sea of Vicodin?"" said Bonaduce, host of his own radio talk show on 94.1 WYSP in Philadelphia. From Hilton to Mel Gibson to Britney Spears, Tiger Woods and Martha Stewart to O.J. Simpson, Pee Wee Herman, George Michael, Michael Jackson and Fatty Arbuckle and even going all the way back to Adam and Eve, the appetite for celebrity misbehavior seems insatiable. These days, Americans and cultures around the world never get bored of dishing on celebrity mayhem and may even prefer it to pondering more pressing matters. ""It's just way more fun than facing what is actually happening out there,'' said Bonaduce, 51, who openly speaks about the ''mountains of drugs'' he has done over the years and the times he was caught on the wrong side of the law. People have always been captivated by royalty and celebrities are the new royalty, says Jane Velez-Mitchell, an author and host of ""Issues"" on HLN. But there's a darker side to focusing on misfortunes of the rich and famous and the thrill that comes with it, says Velez-Mitchell, who writes and often speaks about her successful battle with years of alcoholism. ""I think there's a certain perverse satisfaction that everyone experiences when they see somebody who has everything -- money, fame, power, good looks, the world at their feet -- and yet it seems like they're just as miserable as the guy next door or even oneself.'' Mario Lavandeira, better known as Perez Hilton and somewhat famous in his own right as a celebrity blogger, compares the compulsion to follow celebrity mischief to rubbernecking during a car accident. ""It's on a bigger scale and more people can see it, therefore more people are prone to slow down.'' The main point is familiarity, says Robert Thompson, a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University. When strangers gossip they often need a more common bond than friends or family can provide, Thompson says. ""I don't know your Aunt Carol and you don't know my relative who's in trouble so there's no kind of connection there,'' Thompson said. ""We can talk about the latest tape from Mel Gibson. He's all of our relatives. He's all of our crazy Uncle Mel.'' Watching celebrities fall from grace or go wild makes the rest of us feel better about ourselves, says Liz Miele, a New York-based standup comedian. ""It's just that we like feeling better than them. We live these kind of mundane, lame lives or at least that's how we feel most of the time,'' said Miele, 25. ''Then when somebody [famous] curses off their girlfriend or somebody ends up in rehab or somebody gets a DUI all of a sudden we're like, 'well, I didn't mess up my life that much.''' Still, fame carries privilege, and sometimes the ability to get away with more than the average person. The fact that celebrities are much harder to replace in their work than a janitor or computer technician, for example, could be a key reason they may not pay the full price for misbehaving, according to a 2004 Clemson University study by Todd Kendall. But there's no red carpet treatment for Hollywood on its own turf, according to the Los Angeles Police Department, which handles its fair share of famous people flouting the law. ""From a law enforcement perspective, we treat everyone the same,'' says Officer Karen Rayner, a spokesperson for the LAPD. ""When an arrest becomes a media event, the Los Angeles Police Department deploys sufficient resources to ensure the safety of the public and the individual."" While it's clear millions like to kick back by picking up the latest magazines, clicking on countless blogs and watching TV shows rehash celebrity antics, is this form of escapism safe? Yes, but in moderate doses, says Judith Kuriansky, a New York clinical psychologist who teaches at Columbia University Teachers College. ""If you do something that is much more related to your own life rather than comparing yourself to someone else, then that would be the highest rung of healthiness,'' Kuriansky says. ""Going to a museum, learning a new sport, taking up a new hobby, going to a cooking class -- any of those things certainly are healthier than looking at someone else's life, whether it's your neighbor or a celebrity.''","Paris Hilton has been charged with felony drug possession .

"(CNN) -- Steve Jobs, the visionary who led a mobile computer revolution with the creation of wildly popular devices such as the iPhone, was mourned Thursday by admirers and competitors as much of the world awoke to news of his death. Jobs' death was announced Wednesday by Apple, the Silicon Valley company he co-founded with Steve Wozniak. He was 56. ""Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being,"" Apple said in a statement on its website. ""Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor."" iReport: Share your memories of Jobs . The hard-driving executive pioneered the concept of the personal computer and of navigating them by clicking onscreen images with a mouse. In more recent years, he introduced the iPod portable music player, the iPhone and the iPad tablet -- all of which changed how digital content was consumed. Live blog: Reaction around the world . More than one pundit, praising Jobs' ability to transform industries with his inventions, called him a modern-day Leonardo da Vinci. ""Steve Jobs is one of the great innovators in the history of modern capitalism,"" New York Times columnist Joe Nocera said in August. ""His intuition has been phenomenal over the years."" Fortune: 10 ways Jobs changed the world . Others championed his leadership skills.. ""He was a historical figure on the scale of a Thomas Edison or a Henry Ford, and set the mold for many other corporate leaders in many other industries,"" wrote Walter Mossberg, a tech columnist for The Wall Street Journal. ""He did what a CEO should: Hired and inspired great people; managed for the long term, not the quarter of the short-term stock price; made big bets and took big risks."" Jobs' death, while dreaded by Apple's legions of fans, was not unexpected. He had battled cancer for years, took a medical leave from Apple in January and stepped down as chief executive in August because he could ""no longer meet (his) duties and expectations."" The spiritual side of Jobs . Born on February 24, 1955, and then adopted, Jobs grew up in Cupertino, California -- which would become home to Apple's headquarters -- and showed an early interest in electronics. As a teenager, he phoned William Hewlett, president of Hewlett-Packard, to request parts for a school project. He got them, along with an offer of a summer job at HP. Jobs dropped out of Oregon's Reed College after one semester, although he returned to audit a class in calligraphy, which he says influenced Apple's graceful, minimalist aesthetic. He quit one of his first jobs, designing video games for Atari, to backpack across India and take psychedelic drugs. Those experiences, Jobs said later, shaped his creative vision. While at HP, Jobs befriended Steve Wozniak, who impressed him with his skill at assembling electronic components. The two later joined a Silicon Valley computer hobbyists club, and when he was 21, Jobs teamed with Wozniak and two other men to launch Apple Computer Inc. ""It's like there is a big hole left in you,"" Wozniak said on CNN's AC360 after learning of Jobs death. ""And it's very hard to go back and ... reflect on the feelings ... and what it means."" Timeline of career . It's long been Silicon Valley legend: Jobs and Wozniak built their first commercial product, the Apple 1, in Jobs' parents' garage in 1976. Jobs sold his Volkswagen van to help finance the venture. The primitive computer, priced at $666.66, had no keyboard or display, and customers had to assemble it themselves. The following year, Apple unveiled the Apple II computer at the inaugural West Coast Computer Faire. ""Steven Jobs was, and still is, an inspiration to many individuals and companies all over the world. His passing is a loss to innovators        and visionaries everywhere,"" said Jong-seok Park, president of LG Electronics. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer described him as ""one of the founders of our industry and a true visionary."" Opinion: One thing we owe to Steve Jobs . Jobs was among the first computer engineers to recognize the appeal of the mouse and the graphical interface, which let users operate computers by clicking on images instead of writing text. Apple's pioneering Macintosh computer launched in early 1984 with a now-iconic, Orwellian-themed Super Bowl ad. The boxy beige Macintosh sold well, but the demanding Jobs clashed frequently with colleagues, and in 1986, he was ousted from Apple after a power struggle. Then came a 10-year hiatus during which he founded NeXT Computer, whose pricey, cube-shaped computer workstations never caught on with consumers. Jobs had more success when he bought Pixar Animation Studios from George Lucas before the company made it big with ""Toy Story."" In 1996, Apple bought NeXT, returning Jobs to the then-struggling company he had co-founded. Within a year, he was running Apple again -- older and perhaps wiser but no less of a perfectionist. And in 2001, he took the stage to introduce the original iPod, the little white device that transformed portable music and kick-started Apple's furious comeback. Thus began one of the most remarkable second acts in the history of business. Over the next decade, Jobs wowed launch-event audiences, and consumers, with one game-changing hit after another: iTunes (2003), the iPhone (2007), the App Store (2008), and the iPad (2010). Tears and tributes in China . Observers marveled at Jobs' skills as a pitchman, his ability to inspire godlike devotion among Apple ""fanboys"" (and scorn from PC fans) and his ""one more thing"" surprise announcements. Time after time, he sold people on a product they didn't know they needed until he invented it. And all this on an official annual salary of $1. He also built a reputation as a hard-driving, mercurial and sometimes difficult boss who oversaw almost every detail of Apple's products and rejected prototypes that didn't meet his exacting standards. By the late 2000s, his once-renegade tech company, the David to Microsoft's Goliath, was entrenched at the uppermost tier of American business. Opinion: How Jobs saw the future . Apple now operates more than 300 retail stores in 11 countries. The company has sold more than 275 million iPods, 100 million iPhones and 25 million iPads worldwide. Jobs' climb to the top was complete in summer 2011, when Apple listed more cash reserves than the U.S. Treasury and even briefly surpassed Exxon Mobil as the world's most valuable company. But Jobs' health problems sometimes cast a shadow over his company's success. In 2004, he announced to his employees that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer. He lost weight and appeared unusually gaunt at keynote speeches to Apple developers, spurring concerns about his health and fluctuations in the company's stock price. One wire service accidentally published Jobs' obituary. Jobs had a secret liver transplant in 2009 in Tennessee during a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple. He took another medical leave in January this year. Perhaps mindful of his legacy, he cooperated on his first authorized biography, scheduled to be published by Simon & Schuster in November. Jobs is survived by his wife of 20 years, Laurene, and four children, including one from a prior relationship. He always spoke with immense pride about what he and his engineers accomplished at Apple. ""Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do,"" he said while delivering a 2005 commencement address at Stanford University. ""If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.""

"(CNN) -- James ""Whitey"" Bulger lived ""a relatively comfortable lifestyle"" with his girlfriend for the 16 years he was a fugitive, including numerous gambling trips to Las Vegas, according to a government document filed in his case Monday. Bulger, 81, and Catherine Elizabeth Greig, 60, were arrested Wednesday after he was lured out of his Santa Monica, California, apartment by an FBI ruse. The alleged East Coast mobster, who was on the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted list, faces charges in 19 mob-related murders. The U.S. Attorney's office in Boston, where Bulger is being prosecuted, filed a response Monday to his request that the federal government pay for his defense because of his lack of money. Agents found $822,198 in cash -- ""much of it in packages containing $100 bills that were bundled together and hidden inside a wall in the apartment"" -- when they searched his home last week, prosecutors said. Bulger ""waived his Miranda rights"" and told agents who were taking him back to Boston that he had been ""a frequent traveler as a fugitive."" ""Bulger acknowledged visiting Las Vegas on numerous occasions to play the slots and claimed he won more than he lost,"" the filing said. ""Bulger also admitted traveling to San Diego and then crossing over into Tijuana to purchase medicines."" Bulger told FBI agents he traveled back to Boston ""on several occasions while 'armed to the teeth' because he 'had to take care of some unfinished business,' "" the document said. Bulger refused to tell the agents any details of his Boston visits, it said. The government also said Bulger admitted to stashing cash away ""with people he trusted,"" although he would not identify them, it said. Prosecutors suggested that Bulger's brother, William Bulger, ""might also be willing to pay for an attorney to represent his brother."" They asked the court to require him to submit an affidavit before a decision is made. James Bulger cannot be trusted to tell the truth about his finances, the government argued. ""He has every incentive to lie and stick the taxpayers with the bill for his defense,"" prosecutors said. ""Accordingly, the court should not simply rely on Bulger's own claims of indigence but instead should make further inquiry on this matter by requiring sworn affidavits from the defendant's brothers, William and John.""","Bulger admitted to agents that he took trips to Vegas, Boston and Mexico, document says .

"(CNN) -- Everyone knows the beach is the thing in Miami, and specifically South Beach, where all the beautiful people go to see and be seen. But what if you're traveling with children or grandparents or people who don't want to be covered in suntan lotion and little else all day? We asked for your recommendations beyond the beach, where you go when you're not lying on a towel. ""There are so many Miamis to visit when you are here,"" one iReporter said. Here are a few of our iReporters' favorites. The art scene . Miami's vibrant art scene is very much in evidence in Wynwood, where the local arts association has a map to keep track of which artists are in the hood. ""If you are lucky enough to be visiting on the second Saturday of the month, you better make your way over to Wynwood for the local art walk,"" writes iReporter Jennifer Ortiz, a Miami native. ""Live music and DJs spin in various galleries throughout the night, often with free beer and other refreshments. Here you'll witness some of the world's finest urban art; muralists and graffiti artists have been brought in from around the globe to use Wynwood as their canvas."" You can also use the map to tour galleries during the day. For a Cuban feel, Oritz recommends heading to Little Havana's ""Viernes Culturales"" on the last Friday of each month. If you prefer the expert's tour of Little Havana or other parts of Miami, contact HistoryMiami for an organized or private tour. iReport: Share your Santa Fe tips and photos . Have a cafe con leche and more . Miami's dynamic food scene now goes beyond everyday Cuban cuisine to fine and experimental dining with local ingredients. ""Hang with the locals at eclectic places like The Electric Pickle, Bardot or The Stage in the Midtown/Design District,"" writes iReporter Alain Lantigua, who has lived in the Miami area for most of his life. Other iReporters recommend Sugarcane Raw Bar Grill, in the Arts District, and Sra. Martinez, ""Top Chef"" judge Michelle Bernstein's tapas restaurant. Many little Cuban joints will feed you a good cheap lunch, iReporters tell us, and you can get an excellent Cuban coffee after your meal for half the price of a Starbuck's. For affordable classic Cuban food, go to South Miami and ""hit Lario's on a Saturday night for live Cuban music,"" Lantigua writes. It's ""like nothing anywhere else and cheap."" (Be careful not to confuse this location with Lario's on the Beach, which is in South Beach and probably will be mobbed.) For something a little more upscale, check out Havana Harry's in Coral Gables. If you're worried about your lack of knowledge of Cuban cuisine, let Three Guys from Miami teach you what's what. Communing with nature . There are endless opportunities to enjoy Miami outdoors aside from tanning on the beach. You can take a boat tour of celebrities' island homes in Miami or stroll the grounds at Vizcaya Museum and Gardens. Animal lovers can snorkel in John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park in nearby Key Largo or head to Zoo Miami. Eliza Dash of Parkland, Florida, visits Miami almost every week for the restaurants and beaches, but that's not what stands out for her. She was fascinated by what she found on her visit to Butterfly World in Coconut Creek, about 45 minutes north. ""More than 70 species of butterflies, humming bird and lorikeet aviaries and a very peaceful garden takes the cake!"" she writes on iReport.com. ""It may be said that this is one man's hobby gone wild, but I say what a way to connect (with) nature!"" Don't dis South Beach . Although some locals may sneer at the tourists visiting Miami's most famous beach, the crowds who choose South Beach are clearly enjoying a meal, dancing the night away and staying at the trendy hotels. The South Beach experience is a must, whether you get a drink at Mango's or the Perry (known as the Gansevoort until this year). ""Get a blackberry mojito at Sushi Samba on Lincoln Road or a generous pour of scotch at Segafredo and people watch,"" Lantigua writes. ""If you want to hit a club, the place to go is LIV. Guarantee your entrance by purchasing tickets in advance."" Jeffrey Moellering of Clearwater, Florida, appreciates the Clevelander's outdoor space, which ""features a large deck area with a pool, live music and the best people watching panorama right in the heart of the district. The adjacent hotel is also a quite adequate and reasonably priced place to stay."" South Beach culture . For a break from the beach scene, head to the New World Symphony's new campus, designed by Frank Gehry in close collaboration with symphony artistic director Michael Tilson Thomas. Miami native Melissa Lopez, who now lives in nearby Kendall, says the symphony offers many free outside movies and concerts. ""Bring a blanket!"" she writes. Miami Beach's art deco architecture is worth a visit. ""I enjoy walking, dining and shopping on Lincoln Road as well as walking and dining on Ocean Drive along the Art Deco hotels,"" writes iReporter Robert Ondrovic, of Pound Ridge, New York. If you'd like a guide on your walking tour, join the Miami Design Preservation League's daily art deco tour.

"(Rolling Stone) -- The following is an excerpt of an article from the November 11, 2010 issue of ""Rolling Stone."" This issue is available Friday, October 29th on newsstands and online via Rolling Stone's premium subscription plan. In July, shortly after his Legally Prohibited From Being Funny on Television Tour wrapped up, Conan O'Brien began visiting the set of his new talk show, at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. For various reasons, the show had not been staffed yet, nor had the set been built, so on those days, O'Brien would occasionally pause en route to his office and stand alone in a giant, empty warehouse. As career meta­phors go, one could do worse: At least the warehouse wasn't on fire, or dripping blood from the ceiling, or filled, floor to rafters, with an existentially crushing number of identical wooden crates, like the warehouse at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Video: Behind the scenes at Conan's death-defying RS cover shoot . O'Brien had lost his dream job as host of ""The Tonight Show"" in January, at a speed (seven months!) almost as humiliating as the circumstances of his departure (ousted for Jay Leno, which is the comedy-world equivalent of being left at the altar for a cast member of ""Jersey Shore""). ""My wife says those first couple of months, the thing I said most often was, 'Wait a minute, what just happened?'"" O'Brien recalls. 'Conan' premieres November 8 on TBS . ""Those weeks after the tour, where not much was going on, Conan was miserable,"" confirms his wife, Liza Powel, a blunt and dryly funny former advertising executive with whom O'Brien has two children. ""That was when he was the most depressed."" Powel says she had ""all sorts of grand designs"" about keeping her idled spouse busy: He would be responsible for camp drop-offs, he would cook dinner at least one night a week. None of which ended up happening. O'Brien did go for long bicycle rides, and read lots of history books. At a parents' night at their son Beckett's preschool, there was a stack of volunteer sign-up sheets, and O'Brien, who still had too much time on his hands, became overly ambitious and started signing up for everything: ""Oh, I'd love to come talk to the kids about natural history!"" Listen to two tracks from Conan O'Brien's live album recorded with Jack White . ""He was in the house all the time,"" Powel recalls. ""I said, 'This can't last -- it'll drive us crazy!' Literally every 10 minutes, he'd poke his head in the room and say, 'I don't wanna bother you, but do you know where the Band-Aids are?' 'I don't wanna bother you, but do you know how to use the phone?' He was so sweet about it, and I felt like such a jerk. But seriously, I almost rented an office for him."" The morning after O'Brien's final ­""Tonight Show"" -- his second-highest- rated episode ever, quadrupling his average nightly viewership -- he and Powel drove up to a resort in Montecito. ""I felt like I'd just been in a car accident,"" O'Brien says. ""Like a crazy mix of elation, anger, sorrow. Confusion was a big one."" That night, when they entered the dining room and the other guests stood up and applauded, O'Brien says, ""It almost made me cry."" Photos: From ""Seinfeld"" to ""Mad Men,"" see TV stars on the cover of ""Rolling Stone"" An overachieving golden boy since high school (where he was class valedictorian), on through college (Harvard, where he was twice voted president of ""The Harvard Lampoon,"" something that had only happened once before in the history of the venerable humor magazine) and his early career (staff gigs at ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""The Simpsons"", the twin Holy Grails of the comedy world for the aspiring writer), O'Brien had been plucked from obscurity to host a major-network talk show -- at a time when people still watched network television -- when he was a preposterously young-looking 30 years old. Losing ""The ­Tonight Show"" was the first time he had ever failed so publicly, and in such epic fashion. His longtime sidekick, Andy Richter, has said, ""It was traumatic for Conan."" ""I hated to see him in such a state of tension and unhappiness,"" Powel says. ""It was very painful for him to let go of this hallowed ground that he'd finally got a chance to stand on."" But, she goes on, ""There were so many factors at work, such a confluence of change that had to do with so much more than him. The truth is, ""The Tonight Show"" was the definition of cultural relevancy for decades. And all of a sudden, it's not. That's not Conan's fault. It's not anybody's fault. It just happened. And it's no longer a show he should be pinning his life's hopes on hosting."" What does Conan have that you don't? Read O'Brien's 1996 ""Rolling Stone"" cover story . Indeed, the spontaneous pro-Conan Internet campaign generated by fans in January -- complete with Shepard ­Fairey-style iconography and its very own slogan, ""I'm With Coco"" -- was driven largely by young people for whom the venerable institution of ""The Tonight Show"" meant little or nothing. For some, the show might have even made O'Brien less cool by association. The ""Tonight Show"" had been unhip for a very, very long time, not just for the past 17 years it has been hosted by Jay Leno, but for (let's be honest) pretty much all of the Eighties -- really, the last time it was hip, Johnny Carson and his guests were still chain-smoking on the air -- and so watching O'Brien move behind the desk of desks felt less like an ascension and more like a loss, a co-opting of our guy. Consequently, when O'Brien was undone by NBC's fecklessness and Leno's treachery, it only affirmed what we knew all along: He'd thrown his lot in with the wrong crowd. Overnight, O'Brien not only regained the underdog status he'd held for much of his career, but actually found himself in a wholly new position: rebranded as an indie icon. In the months that followed, he grew a beard, played Bonnaroo and cut an improvised spoken-word single and a rock covers album for Jack White's label. (""Conan's was the only late-night show I ever wanted to play,"" White says. ""Letterman is so cold to people, and Leno is for senior citizens. I played a live guitar solo on Conan's desk once.

"Washington (CNN) -- Parts of Arizona's sweeping immigration law received a surprising amount of support from a short-handed Supreme Court Wednesday. States throughout the country considering their own tough immigration laws are closely following the proceedings over what has become a thorny issue. Fed up with illegal immigrants crossing from Mexico -- and what they say is the federal government's inability to stop it -- legislators in Arizona passed a tough immigration law. The federal government sued, saying that Arizona overreached. ""If, in fact, somebody who does not belong in this country is in Arizona, Arizona has no power?"" asked Justice Antonin Scalia. ""What does sovereignty mean if it does not include the ability to defend your borders?"" Even liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor told the federal governments' lawyer that key parts of his arguments were ""not selling very well."" Federal courts had blocked four elements of the state's Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, known as SB 1070. While intense oral arguments took place among the justices, outside there were competing demonstrations on the courthouse plaza, with the law's opponents saying it promotes discrimination and racial profiling. Backers say illegal immigration has created public safety and economic crises. At issue is whether states have any authority to step in to enforce immigration matters or whether that is the exclusive role of the federal government. In dry legal terms, this constitutional question is known as pre-emption. Other states watch for outcome . Paul Clement, lawyer for Arizona, told the high court the federal government has long failed to control the problem, and that states have discretion to assist in enforcing immigration laws. But the Obama administration's solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, strongly countered that assertion, saying immigration matters are under the federal government's exclusive authority and state ""interference"" would only make matters worse. Several other states followed Arizona's lead by passing laws meant to deter illegal immigrants. Similar laws are under challenge in lower courts in Georgia, Alabama, Utah, Indiana and South Carolina. Arizona's appeal is the first to reach the Supreme Court. Arizona is the nation's most heavily traveled corridor for illegal immigration and smuggling. Opinion: What if justices let states make immigration policy? Justice Elena Kagan did not hear this case. Before taking the bench last year, she had been involved in the administration's initial legal opposition to the law as solicitor general. A 4-4 high court split would be likely to keep the Arizona law in legal limbo, preventing the four provisions of the law from going into effect but not settling the larger constitutional questions. It would also shift the election-year fight over the issue to other states with current or pending crackdown laws. The four Arizona provisions on hold are: . -- A requirement that local police officers check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws if ""reasonable suspicion"" exists that the person is in the United States illegally. -- A provision authorizing police to arrest immigrants without warrant where ""probable cause"" exists that they committed any public offense making them removable from the country. -- A section making it a state crime for ""unauthorized immigrants"" to fail to carry registration papers and other government identification. -- A ban on those not authorized for employment in the United States to apply, solicit or perform work. That would include immigrants standing in a parking lot who ""gesture or nod"" their willingness to be employed. Although the specific question before the high court relates to the law's enforcement, the justices could use the appeal to address the broader constitutional questions. Mexican migration slows, but debate isn't over . During the 70-minute arguments, Clement faced relatively little tough questioning from left-leaning members of the bench. ""There will be a significant number of people who will be detained at the stop, or in prison, for a significantly longer period of time"" if the state law is allowed to be enforced, warned Justice Stephen Breyer. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the provision on carrying registration is especially problematic. ""Congress enacted a complete registration scheme which the states cannot complement or impose even auxiliary regulations,"" she said. ""We want the registration scheme to be wholly federal."" But the consistently tough questions were aimed at Verrilli from conservative members of the high court. Even before the solicitor general began speaking midway through the argument, Chief Justice John Roberts framed the debate away from what has become a major complaint about the law: that it would target mostly Hispanic people for scrutiny and detention. ""I'd like to clear up at the outset what it's not about,"" Roberts said. ""No part of your argument has to do with racial or ethnic profiling, does it?"" Verrilli readily agreed. Later the chief justice raised more serious concerns. When enforcing other law, ""the person is already stopped for some other reason. He's stopped for going 60 in a 20 (mph zone). He's stopped for drunk driving. So that decision to stop the individual has nothing to do with immigration law at all. All that has to do with immigration law is whether or not they can ask the federal government to find out if this person is illegal or not, and then leave it up to you,"" Roberts said to Verrilli. ""It seems to me that the federal government just doesn't want to know who is here illegally or not."" Justice Anthony Kennedy echoed the thought, suggesting the federal government is not doing enough on illegal immigration, which might give states discretion to intervene. Suppose, he offered, ""the state of Arizona has a massive emergency with social disruption, economic disruption, residents leaving the state because of a flood of immigrants. Let's just assume those two things. Does that give the state of Arizona any powers or authority or legitimate concerns that any other state wouldn't have?"" Kennedy was echoing what the state had long been arguing, and he later suggested there is such authority. Verrilli argued the law would hurt Washington's ability to carry out diplomatic relations with other nations, noting, ""We have very significant issues on the border with Mexico."" ""Well, can't you avoid that particular foreign relations problem by simply deporting these people?"" Scalia asked. ""Free them from the jails and send them back to the countries that are objecting. What's the problem with that? ""We have to enforce our laws in a manner that will please Mexico. Is that what you're saying?"" The Justice Department said Arizona's population of 2 million Latinos includes an estimated 400,000 there illegally, and 60% to 70% of deportations or ""removals"" involve Mexican nationals. A tale of opposing views in Arizona . The court hearing over the illegal immigration law comes at an interesting time. The Pew Hispanic Center this week released a report that found that Mexican immigration to the United States has come to a standstill. The economic downturn in the United States and better conditions in Mexico, along with deportations and other enforcement, has led many to return to Mexico. However, the debate continues as more than 10 million unauthorized immigrants -- from Mexico and other countries -- continue to live in the United States. Even if immigration has slowed to lows not seen in decades, proponents of tough immigration laws want to beef up enforcement ahead of any future pressures. After the arguments, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer expressed hope the state would prevail at the high court. ""We likely will not know the court's decision for weeks,"" she said. ""But I am filled with optimism-- the kind that comes with knowing that Arizona's cause is just and its course is true."" The administration, backed by a variety of immigrant and civil rights groups, says allowing such discretionary state authority would hurt relations between the United States and other countries, disrupt existing cooperative efforts and unfairly target legal immigrants. The legislation has a variety of supporters and detractors. Republican lawmakers, outspoken Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio and various state governments were among those filing briefs supporting the law. The Mexican government, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Immigration Lawyers Association and the city of Tucson, Arizona, were among those supporting the Justice Department's side. The outcome of the Arizona appeal could set important precedent on similar laws pending across the country. The case is Arizona v. U.S. (11-182) and is to be the last argued before the high court this term. A ruling could come in late June, just before the justices recess for the summer.","Roberts says it seems the federal government doesn't want to know immigration status .

"(CNN) -- I am the granddaughter of an elementary school cook and a woman who cleaned other people's homes. Both my grandmothers worked hard and didn't earn much money, but they encouraged their children to get an education. Although starting from limited economic circumstances, my parents both earned a college education and were able to attain a middle-class lifestyle to raise me and my siblings. I, their daughter, went on to receive a Ph.D. Unfortunately, this type of upward mobility is much less likely for the children of maids and school cooks today. A decent job and a decent life should be a possibility for anyone who makes an effort. As a nation, this was more likely in our past than in the present. A college education should be affordable to anyone who is willing to do the work, but that is no longer our reality. As the likelihood of a college degree and economic security becomes less attainable for a significant portion of the population, the future of the United States will be in jeopardy. Late last month, Congress passed a bill that will keep student-loan interest rates from doubling, just days before the deadline. It's an important step in keeping college affordable, but student-loan interest rates are only one piece in a complex puzzle that shapes how income level and educational opportunity are linked -- and the effects begin years before a student might apply for loans. Even children with proven academic ability fall behind if they grow up in families that are poor. By the age of 3, one study showed, poor children already have half the vocabulary of higher-income children. Another study showed that children in high-risk social and economic environments can start in the top 25% academically at the age of 4 but fall to the bottom by the time they are in high school. In a similar example, only 29% of the highest-achieving eighth-graders complete college if they come from low-income families. In contrast, 30% of the lowest-achieving eighth-graders and 74% of the highest-achieving eighth-graders complete college if they come from high-income families. Until we get to a point where ability and effort predictably lead to greater educational attainment and improved outcomes, many kids will stop trying because the obstacles become too daunting. As a social work researcher, I've shown that race greatly influences economic standing, with children of color being the most likely to be poor and have no assets. Children start out very similarly up until about 2. Then economic circumstances start to influence outcomes, and children begin to diverge in achievement before they even enter school. These disparities continue even once formal education begins. My research also shows that children with limited economic resources are more likely to live in disadvantaged neighborhoods and face toxic stress that can lead to permanent lowered brain functioning, further limiting educational achievement. Even middle-class families are now concerned that their children will not be able to succeed. Until we provide a pathway of success for all children, regardless of economic standing, it will be hard to sustain a strong and vibrant society and economy. There are proven tools to increase opportunity for children if we have the political will to implement them, things such as universal high-quality preschool and child savings accounts that provide resources to reach long-term goals. Some might think that a child's educational future is the responsibility of that child's parents alone. Others believe that enough government money already goes to help poor people. Only 32% of entitlement benefits and 2.8% of tax expenditure benefits go to the lowest-income earners. And many programs, such as rental assistance and child care, don't reach everyone who is eligible. But regardless of what you think about the current mix of government programs, educational outcomes are too tightly linked to parents' economic status. Many children start out school eager to learn and wanting to achieve. But as it seems that no one cares about their efforts and their basic needs are not being met with each passing grade, they start to become less engaged in school and search for other ways to survive. This is tragic and unacceptable. Others predict that charter schools will reduce achievement gaps. While charter and independent schools do well for some low-income children, their record is still mixed. Consequently, it is nearly impossible to find a low-income area where all schools perform well, whether charter, public or private. Unless we want a ""Waiting for Superman"" society of lotteries and waiting lists for parents seeking a decent education for their child, the ultimate goal is to ensure all schools, no matter how they are organized, provide a quality education. My parents, even as poor black children, could pursue their dreams growing up in the 1960s, when opportunity was expanding for all. Times have changed. As we better understand the way economic circumstances dictate life options, perhaps we will get outraged and demand a nation that helps develop potential rather than allow it to go to waste.

"(CNN) -- At dinner tables throughout the United States, there are tough conversations about the exploding cost of college, the rough job market, the pain of debt. For parents and students, it adds up to the same question: Is college worth it? But American University economics Professor Robert Lerman is asking something different: If college isn't worth it, what else is out there? Lerman, an Urban Institute fellow, has studied youth unemployment for decades, and thinks the United States ought to try an updated version of an old technique for education and employment: apprenticeships. They're not the same as an after-school fast food job or a summer internship at dad's office, he said. Apprenticeships require skill development in a workplace over a number of years. The education, which might be supplemented by classroom training, leads to a credential -- maybe a title, certification or diploma -- that proves mastery of a skill. During that time, apprentices are paid, and employers are getting another worker. ""In many countries, apprenticeship training and mastery is thought of as a big advantage in innovation -- you have people seeing things, but have skills to understand them, make adjustments and achieve high quality,"" Lerman said. It's been a long time since apprenticeship dominated in the United States. Despite the Obama administration's focus on community colleges, which often house workplace-learning programs, apprenticeship programs draw few government resources, and reach relatively few fields, mostly construction and manufacturing. In a paper published last year, Lerman said about 468,000 people were in 27,000 apprenticeship programs registered with the U.S. Department of Labor in 2008. That was about .3% of the workforce at the time. Up to 1 million more were in unregistered programs, the report said. But in Switzerland, Austria and Germany,  50% to 70% of young people are trained through apprentice programs, according to ""Training Tomorrow's Workforce."" Lerman suggests the United States follow the example of countries that developed apprenticeships in fields including health care, information technology, finance, advanced manufacturing and maritime occupations. But that means getting through to politicians, educators, students and parents first. A Pew Research Center study published in May said 94% of parents who responded expected their kids to go to college. The Pew study ""Is College Worth It?"" pointed out that the median gap in yearly earnings between those with only a high school diploma and those who have a college degree is nearly $20,000,  according Census Bureau data from 2010. But students doing poorly in high school aren't likely to thrive in a college classroom, Lerman said, at least not right away. More options that don't require a traditional college education might help lead people to higher-paying jobs, he said. ""The fact is that no matter how quickly we move on expanding apprenticeship, college and academics are still going to have a big draw, and that's fine,"" he said. ""But I think what we want to see is that diversification of routes to rewarding careers."" Former auto worker: 'Bypassing' college a mistake . Here's what Lerman had to say about changing the way we think about paths for students after high school. CNN: What is apprenticeship, and how is it different than an after-school job or a summer internship? Lerman: It is far more in-depth than any internship and far more structured than a standard job. It involves in-depth learning on the job, as well as related instruction in classroom work. The employer has obligation to train the individual; employers are getting production out of the apprentice. The apprentice is also being paid, and usually, almost always, there is an upward trajectory of pay over a two- to four-year period. Alain Ducasse's Weapon Against Poverty: Cooking Classes . CNN: How did apprenticeships play a larger role in our past in the United States, and why did it fade away? Lerman: I don't think we ever had the scale of apprenticeship training that existed in other countries. We have become so academic-based in our thinking that we don't take seriously the workplace learning component and occupational component. The whole field of vocational education is a very contested one. Some people see vocational education as something to divert people away from higher goals of education. We went through a period when school-based vocational education, people argued, was used to discourage minority groups from going to college. CNN: How could we implement programs that would avoid tracking certain classes, races or ethnicities into non-college programs? Lerman: I'm personally not worried. If you look at the college graduation rate of African American males, it's well under 20%. Let's say we can double that, which is not easy to do -- the other people (who don't graduate) should not be doomed to bad careers, nor should people be pushed only one way. Sameness is not equality. I see entering apprenticeship as entirely voluntarily. You can have career-focused education and training that provides education at very high levels with outlets for people to move back into a purely academic programs if they so choose. Some of the very good programs, it's harder to get into an apprenticeship than to get into elite colleges. We need more good options. (With paid apprenticeships,) there's incentive. That reward would come much faster than trying to stay in school for 16, 18 years and then maybe getting a good job. I am a professor of economics and I do not discourage people from taking higher education courses, but there are so many opportunities to do that over time. I met, for example, in Germany, a sales person in a steel mill. Before he went to college, he went through a three-year apprenticeship at the steel mill in sales management. When we went to college, college was a lot easier. He had all that background. He was probably more mature then. He could recognize which things were going to be helpful to him. Study: For grads of color, it's prison or unemployment . CNN: Is part of the issue the word apprentice? It's tied to certain professions -- manufacturing, construction -- even if it describes work-based learning in fields like medicine and teaching. Lerman: It doesn't have as good a connotation as in other countries. The current administration is using ""career pathways."" The problem is that ""career pathways"" is a vague term. It isn't clear you're doing something in a serious and concerted way. An apprentice who completes a program, they have genuine expertise. That gives people a sense that, 'If I mastered this field, I can continue learning. I can learn other things as well.' To me, one of the great advantages is the sense of confidence it can give. Ideally, we should try to make more and more fields have that high quality of productivity, but also a sense of pride. People in the welding field should have that same sense. Laser welding, the design of welding, all of that can be very complicated, technical, advanced, productive and rewarding. Maybe we should have a contest. What name would capture the full notion, and perhaps be considered snazzier than apprenticeship? Community colleges step in to fill 'skills gap' CNN: Is there an opening for apprenticeship programs now that hasn't existed in the recent past? Lerman: College costs are rising dramatically, not only for individual families, but for governments. We're seeing increasing concern that many people are not doing well at high school levels. There is starting to be an openness to these kinds of initiatives, but you cannot understate the purely academic bias that is existing in policymakers and a strong education lobby. A public initiative has to recognize it's a very different model than supporting slots in community college or training program. What apprenticeship investments require is marketing and technical assistance to get employers to adopt apprenticeship programs. That's where government investment needs to be. I'm not trying to knock college, especially for the broader learning you can get if you devote yourself to it ... but we have to create a wider range of options for people.","As college costs rise and job hunts get tougher, some question: Why go to college?

"(CNN) -- As Chance Bothe, then 21, was driving home from college last year into the southeast Texas city of Ganado, he was focused more on texting a friend than he was on the road. ""I need to stop before I have a wreck and kill myself"" was the message he sent shortly before his truck tumbled down a 20-foot ravine, his father said. Bobby Bothe, 57, got a call at Dow Chemical, where he works, and thus began what turned into a months-long, multimillion-dollar recuperation for his son. At the hospital, he ran into a friend's daughter, a nurse. ""I told her, 'I don't know what to do,' and she said, 'You pray.' "" He did. His son had suffered a compound broken leg, broken ankles, broken ribs, a punctured lung, a broken sternum, a broken neck, a broken nose, crushed eye sockets, a crushed forehead and a fractured skull, Bothe said. ""They told us he wouldn't make it, they said he'd be blind, he'd never walk again."" After more than three weeks in a coma, Chance Bothe regained consciousness but initially recognized neither of his parents, Bothe said. Bothe knows that many parents of young drivers are not so lucky. That was underscored by three crashes in three days this week in which 15 teenagers were killed. In Illinois, four Chicago-area teenagers died Tuesday morning when their car plunged into a creek. They were students at Wilmington High School, the school superintendent said. In Ohio on Sunday, a sport utility vehicle veered off a two-lane road into a pond, killing six of eight teenage occupants. The vehicle was meant to carry five people. In Texas, an SUV carrying five teenagers collided with a gas tanker Sunday. All five young people were killed, and the tanker driver was seriously injured. The teen driver failed to stop at a stop sign, authorities said. For survivors, recovery can be long. With such severe injuries, Chance Bothe was hospitalized for seven months. Now, the 22-year-old man has plastic eye sockets, metal rods in his legs and a rebuilt nose. ""He's a little bit slower than he was"" but is working on a ranch, attending online classes from home and planning to take his message of survival to high schools around the state, Bobby Bothe said. It's a message the father supports. ""I don't want no parent to ever go through this,"" he said. ""You gotta know, my son is everything to me."" 6 teens killed, 2 injured when overcrowded SUV flips into pond . Teen tragedy: 5 die in fiery collision with tanker truck in Texas . Though traffic fatalities have seen a historic drop in recent decades, young drivers remain at highest risk. Motor-vehicle crashes are the top cause of death for people ages 15 to 20, according to 2007 figures from the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2010, crashes killed about 2,700 people ages 16 to 19 -- more than seven per day -- and resulted in nearly 282,000 others being treated for injuries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And drivers ages 16 to 19 are three times more likely than older drivers to be involved in a fatal crash, the agency says. The weekend crashes in Ohio and Texas fit even higher-risk profiles: . -- Both SUVs were packed with other teenagers, which in itself is a risk factor. The more teenage passengers, the more likely a crash will occur. -- None of the six teens who died in the Ohio wreck was wearing a seat belt. In 2011, 54% of high school students said they always wore seat belts, the lowest rate of any age group, according to the CDC. -- Failure to focus on the task at hand also may have played a role with the 19-year-old driver in Ohio. ""The lady driving was playing around when she was driving,"" said Asher C. Lewis, one of the two survivors of the crash, according to his account in the traffic crash report. ""She was swaying and speeding. I think she was driving on purpose like that but I'm not sure why. It felt like she was driving like 80 mph."" Teen drivers are more likely than their older counterparts to speed, the CDC says. -- The Texas driver's age -- 16 -- put him and his passengers at heightened risk. Accidents are more likely to occur during the first few months after a teenager has received a driver's license. -- The Texas driver was male: In 2010, the death rate for male drivers and passengers ages 16 to 19 was nearly twice that of females. -- Both wrecks occurred on the weekend: More than half (55%) of teen deaths from motor-vehicle crashes occur on Friday, Saturday or Sunday, the CDC says. Texas holds a dubious distinction related to crashes. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, young drivers were involved in 187 fatal crashes in 2010 in the Lone Star State; the next highest number was 113, in Florida. Ohio had 71. Still, the trend for younger drivers -- as with drivers overall -- is toward safety. The 1,963 drivers ages 15 to 20 who died in motor-vehicle crashes in 2010 represented a 46% drop from the 3,617 who died in 2001, according to NHTSA. There are proven ways to limit the carnage, according to the CDC. It cites graduated driver licensing systems in which teens' abilities to drive are expanded over time from the initial stages, when driving is restricted to low-risk conditions. Some parents are equipping their vehicles with tracking technology, which they can use to monitor their children's driving habits in real time. ""Parents are very nervous,"" Ken Muth, a spokesman for American Family Insurance, said in a telephone interview. ""Our agents hear it every day. Putting a 16-year-old behind the wheel on their own is a very frightening thing for a parent."" The company offers parents the option of installing a webcam on the rear-view mirror of the car used by new drivers. The camera records what happens inside and outside the vehicle but saves the recording only when it senses a sudden movement such as hard braking or a sharp turn, Muth said. The video is provided to the parents on a secure website, the equivalent of a driving report card for their kids, he said. ""They can sit and review what happened in that incident and use it as a learning tool,"" said Muth. He noted that the service is free for a year, and the insurance company is not privy to the information collected. Muth credited the program for reducing risky driving behavior and said teens tend to embrace the technology after using it. ""They develop trust with their parents, become better drivers and get more driving privileges."" Chris Mullen, director of technology research at State Farm, noted that the insurer set up a website last fall to aid beginning drivers and their parents. One of its programs -- Road Aware -- helps drivers learn to recognize and anticipate road hazards in front of a video screen rather than on the road. ""This is not a skill that's automatic,"" Mullen said in a telephone interview. ""It has to be learned."" Forty-three percent of teen driver crashes are due to a failure to recognize hazards, she said. In another example of help from technology, a teenager can activate an app on his or her cellular phone and then put it in their vehicle's cupholder, where it will score the driver's abilities based on acceleration, cornering and braking, she said. ""It gives you feedback on the drive you just took and allows you to score it,"" she said. Chance Bothe's near-fatal texting is common, according to CDC statistics. In 2009, distracted driving was linked to more than 5,400 deaths and about 448,000 injuries. Cell phone use was cited as the major distraction in nearly 1,000 of the deaths and 24,000 injuries. Nine percent of U.S. drivers said they texted or e-mailed ""regularly or fairly often"" while driving. Not all of those messages may be worth sending. ""It was just a curve coming into town,"" Bobby Bothe said. ""And he never curved. Just kept going straight. If the creek would have had water in it, he would have drowned. ""Three of my buddies seen it happen; they went to him and they drug him out of the truck and the truck was on fire and it blew up as soon as they got him out,"" he said.","""I need to stop before I have a wreck,"" Texas man, 21, texted shortly before a serious wreck .

"(CNN) -- The head of a survivors' group Saturday dismissed an apology issued five decades later by the German manufacturer of a drug that caused thousands of babies to be born with disabilities. Pharmaceutical firm Gruenenthal apologized Friday for the first time over its drug, thalidomide, which caused babies to be born with shorter arms and legs after their mothers took it during pregnancy in the 1950s and 1960s. It was sold to women to counter morning sickness, according to the Thalidomide Trust, a UK body set up in the 1970s to help those affected. While some children whose mothers took the drug were born with one or more affected limbs, others suffered heart problems, damaged hearing or eyesight, and in some cases, brain damage. The drug was pulled from sale in late 1961 after doctors linked it to birth defects. Freddie Astbury, the president of campaign group Thalidomide UK, who was born in 1959 without arms or legs, said it was too little, too late. ""It's taken a long time for them to apologize. There are a lot of people damaged by thalidomide struggling with health problems in the UK and around the world,"" he said in a statement on the group's website. Britain apologizes to thalidomide victims . ""So we welcome the apology, but how far do they want to go? ""It's no good apologizing if they won't open discussions on compensation. They've got to seriously consider financial compensation for these people."" Gruenenthal's chief executive, Harald Stock, made the apology Friday as he inaugurated a memorial to those affected in Stolberg, Germany, where the company is based. He expressed the company's ""sincere regrets about the consequences of thalidomide and our deep sympathy for all those affected, their mothers and their families."" Gruenenthal's nearly 50-year delay in reaching out ""person to person"" to those affected was a result of its ""silent shock"" over their fate, he said. ""Instead, we have been silent and we are very sorry for that,"" Stock said in a translated copy of the speech on the company's website. Many people have only recently started to receive compensation for the drug's effects. More than 10,000 children worldwide are thought to have been affected by thalidomide. Between 5,000 and 6,000 sufferers are still alive, about 400 of them in Britain, according to Thalidomide UK. An additional 7,500 died in early childhood, it says. Stock said the need for Gruenenthal to make a public apology had become apparent in recent talks with those affected, especially since 2007. The company also pledged 50 million euros in 2009 to help more of those people affected in Germany and elsewhere, he said. ""We see both the physical hardship and the emotional stress that the affected, their families and particularly their mothers, had to suffer because of thalidomide and still have to endure day by day,"" he said. ""We wish that the thalidomide tragedy had never happened."" Personal account: A life shaped by bad medicine . But Stock also pointed to how regulatory and testing organizations had changed since the 1950s. ""The thalidomide tragedy took place 50 years ago in a world completely different from today,"" he said. ""The international scientific community, the pharmaceutical industry and governments, legislators and administrations have had to learn a lot from it."" Gruenenthal had ""acted in accordance with the state of scientific knowledge and all industry standards for testing new drugs"" that were current in that period, he said, and regretted that the drug's potential to cause fetal malformations had not been detected. The drug was available over the counter in Germany from 1957, under the name Contergan, leading to more cases there than anywhere else, according to the Thalidomide Trust website. In Britain, where it was sold as Distaval, it was a prescription-only medication. The drug was released only for clinical trials in the United States, the Trust says, because of concerns following reports of certain side effects from Europe. Compounds that included thalidomide also appeared in a range of other medications, including some for asthma and migraine, the Trust says. It is still used to treat a handful of conditions including leprosy and multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cell. Thalidomide UK urges strict controls to avoid the drug impacting unborn children. The UK government allocated funds in 2010 to help those affected by thalidomide.

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Dumisani Rebombo is no ordinary advocate for women's rights in South Africa. He is a rapist. He is a rapist who sought out his victim two decades after his brutal act to ask for forgiveness. He is all this in a nation where sexual assault has become so common that a woman in South Africa is more likely to be raped than learn to read. Sexual assaults rarely shock anyone anymore, though a video of a brutal gang rape of a mentally disabled teenager went viral on the Internet last month. That touched a nerve. As the young suspects face their day in court, Rebombo spoke with CNN to tell his own story -- an extraordinary tale of violence, redemption and determination to change things in his homeland. Rebombo was 15 when he raped. The boys in his village of Blinkwater taunted him because he didn't herd cattle and instead went home to help his sisters. He didn't have a girlfriend. ""Sissy,"" the village boys jeered, and challenged him to prove his manhood. The way to do that was by having sex. Forced sex. Rebombo had refused until that day, when he gave in to peer pressure. He recounts what happened in a quiet, steady tone. Two of his friends picked out a girl. They said she thought she was smarter than the boys; she didn't date anyone. Rebombo and his friends would set her straight. ""I was afraid because I'd never had sex before,"" Rebombo says. At 5 o'clock in the evening, he met his friends, drank beer, smoked marijuana. Then it started. The first boy raped her; then the second. She was screaming. It was Rebombo's turn. After it was over, he felt terrible, wracked with guilt and scared that his parents would find out. He says he never gave a thought about how the victim was feeling. ""It's because when the environment accepts that behavior as a norm, you don't pay to much attention to it,"" he says. The South African police say there were 66,196 cases of rape in 2010-2011. But many believe that number is much higher because many rapes go unreported. The girl Rebombo raped never reported what happened and Rebombo was never charged. She never even spoke about it with anyone. She was too scared of the consequences, Rebombo says. A Medical Research Council study found that 28 percent of men in South Africa reported having perpetrated rape; three-quarters of first-time rapists are like Rebombo -- under the age of 20. ""This violence, there is violence elsewhere in the world, but you don't see the staggering numbers of rapes that are seen here in South Africa,"" Rebombo says. He is glad, he adds, that South Africans are finally talking about it. Asking for forgiveness . Rebombo eventually left his village in Limpopo Province and joined first a religious organization and later an aid agency. He learned about respecting others but strangely, he says, he rarely thought about the girl he raped. Years passed and Rebombo started working at a gender equality organization, where he spoke with rape victims about the different emotional stages they went through. That's when he thought about his victim. She did not even have an opportunity to seek counseling. Rebombo began feeling the need to make amends for his actions. He spoke to a pastor about going to see her. The pastor told him there was no need, that he was young and boys will be boys. Rebombo went back anyway. He was too nervous to go to her house. She was married now. What would her husband think? How would he react? So he arranged to meet her in the village clinic. Rapist and victim sat down together. ""I'm sorry,"" he told her. Tears welled in her eyes. Rebombo did not know what to do. He simply stood before her. ""My life has never been the same,"" she told him. She told him she had been raped twice more. Sometimes, she said, when her husband touches her, she cringes, even though she is happy with him. She suffers nightmares. She felt her life was dysfunctional because of Rebombo's actions. He asked for forgiveness. She told him she thought he meant well. She would try to get the bitterness out of her heart. ""I felt guilt,"" he says. ""I was embarrassed but also angry at myself that I went on with my life when she was living in misery."" 'A huge monster' A woman is raped every 26 seconds in South Africa, according to People Opposing Women Abuse, a nonprofit group for the eradication of gender violence. Rape is part of a greater environment of crime -- police reported nearly 16,000 murders last year. The high rates of sexual violence have been explained in many ways. Some say it is a legacy of apartheid and the country's strong culture of violence. ""There's a long history of violence,"" women's rights activist Lisa Vetten tells CNN. ""There's a long history of responding to conflict in a violent manner, of trying to solve problems through using violence. ""We also have, I think, a long history of patriarchy, of not recognizing women's rights fully, of not recognizing them necessarily as being full human beings in full -- and having all the rights of men necessarily do,"" Vetten says. Some activists say apartheid is just a convenient excuse. Jackie Branfield, a rape victim turned activist, asks how anyone can blame history for the acts of the seven youths suspected in the videotaped gang rape. ""You can't blame apartheid here,"" she says on CNN. ""You can't even blame the government. You can't blame anybody but our society for this type of violence. ""It's just that they are doing it because they can,"" she says, blaming what she called inefficient, understaffed and under-resourced police departments, courts and hospitals. A Doctors Without Borders report says some have blamed an ""inadequate criminal justice system, which often fails to convict, and therefore deter, perpetrators."" It also mentioned alcohol and drug abuse and said lack of adequate housing and electricity make victims more vulnerable. Rebombo, now married and settled in Mpupalanga, near the city of Durban, works for Sonke Gender Justice Network as the national manager of a ""One Man Can,"" a project to promote healthy relationships between men and women. As such, he is out to change the national mind-set so that men will no longer think it cool to disrespect women. Violent acts must stop, he says. So must the silence of men who witness such acts. ""It's a huge monster we need to deal with,"" he says. He lives every day with that monster -- and the words of his victim. ""Please teach your son not to do what you did to me."" She did not know that Rebombo has a son, who is now 28. He tells his son as well as his two daughters many things about ending gender-based violence. Respect everyone. Stick to one partner. Drink responsibly. His list is long. CNN's Nkepile Mabuse reported from Johannesburg and Moni Basu from Atlanta.","Gender equity activist Dumisani Rebombo raped a girl when he was 15 .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- As a juvenile corrections officer in Southern California, Teresa Goines found it rewarding to work with troubled youth and help them turn their lives around. The hardest part usually came after their release. ""They'd be super excited, ready to start a new life,"" she said. ""They'd be put in the exact same environment, though, so they'd reoffend, and they'd come back."" Sometimes, Goines said, they would call and say they wanted to come back. ""That would break my heart,"" she said. ""I'd be all tough during the day and drive home at night and cry."" Goines felt that by sending these young men home without enough support to keep them on the right track, the system was essentially setting them up to fail. Finding a well-paying job can be a tough proposition when you have a criminal record, Goines said. She wanted to provide an alternative to gangs, knowing that such groups often give troubled youth a way to make money while providing a sense of family and social support. Eventually, she came up with the idea for the Old Skool Cafe, a 1940s-style restaurant run entirely by young people from difficult circumstances. The bistro is in one of San Francisco's roughest neighborhoods, but inside, the atmosphere is warm and inviting. Customers come from all over the city to enjoy the food and entertainment and to support Goines' mission, which provides jobs, career training and a built-in support system to at least 25 at-risk people each year. Goines estimates that 75% of those who've worked at the restaurant have been incarcerated or in trouble with the law. Jonathan Zavala was first incarcerated at 14, and he floated in and out of California's juvenile justice system for years. With his criminal record, he didn't see many options for himself. ""I thought, 'No one is going to hire me; what else can I do?' "" said Zavala, now 19. A year ago, his probation officer told him about the restaurant. Now, three nights a week, Zavala works as a server and has become a valued member of the Old Skool team. Young people like Zavala fill all of the positions in the restaurant. With the help of a couple of adult mentors, they stock the kitchen, prepare the food, serve the meals and manage the staff. They also play a large part in creating their menu of ""international soul food,"" which now contains several of their family recipes. Goines, a Christian, also offers to share her religious faith with any program participant who is interested, but she says that her program is completely inclusive and welcomes everyone, regardless of their beliefs. The restaurant's theme is inspired by Harlem in the late 1920s through the '40s, and the staff is decked out in red-and-black uniforms from the time period. Goines loves the music and spirit of that era and knew it would be a cool, unique vibe that would help attract customers, but she also had another motive. ""From the Harlem Renaissance to ... jazz and swing, so much of that was started by African-Americans,"" she said. ""So many of our youth are of minority descent, I feel like that connection to that era is really important."" Zavala says he likes his uniform and red fedora. ""People, when they come in, they say, 'You look good!' "" he said. ""They're not used to seeing kids who've been in trouble look like that. They see us in a different way."" Giving young people a chance to be seen differently -- and to see themselves differently -- is what the program is all about. It's open to at-risk youth ages 16 to 22, many of whom are referred by social workers or probation officers. The applicants must submit letters of recommendation and a personal essay and go through two rounds of interviews with the program's youth leaders. Once accepted, they begin a four-month training course. During weekly sessions, employees teach the trainees the basics of every position in the restaurant. Then the new recruits test their skills by shadowing veteran staffers during their shift. ""Some days, you'll be the house manager. Other days, you'll bus tables or be the head chef,"" Goines said. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . Trainees, like Old Skool staff members, attend workshops on financial literacy, rÃ©sumÃ© writing and interview skills. They also meet regularly with a life coach who helps them set goals and connects them with resources for housing or medical care. Participants who haven't graduated from high school must be pursuing a diploma or working on a GED. The program is very strict: More than one unexcused absence from work is enough to be dismissed. Trainees receive periodic stipends, and if they complete the training, they can apply for a job. Employees earn minimum wage -- $10.55 an hour in San Francisco -- and tips are shared by the entire staff. They are also encouraged to take on more responsibility and help supervise the newer members. Ultimately, the youth leaders decide whom to hire and fire. ""The whole structure of this organization is meant for the youth to keep rising up in leadership and management,"" Goines said. ""I'm a big believer in ownership. ... The more decision-making opportunities they have, the more life-changing it is."" Tammy Vaitai, 22, was withdrawn and quiet as a result of the domestic violence she witnessed while she was growing up. She has been involved with Goines' program for five years, and today she's the youth manager of the restaurant, handling the scheduling, training and service in the ""front of the house."" She also performs spoken-word poetry at the restaurant and recently started singing with the band. ""Now, I own my own car, I have a full-time job, and I'm currently applying to be a homeowner,"" she said. ""I'm so stoked about my future."" She credits Goines with helping make it all possible. ""(Goines) pushes you past your comfort zone and past whatever limits you give yourself, "" she said. ""She's great at encouraging us to just dream big. She obviously did it herself. This (restaurant) was a big dream when it started off ... and she made it happen. "" For Zavala, the program has been the break he needed to stay on the right path. ""I've been staying out of trouble,"" he said. ""Now, I have a support system. ... I feel like we're all like family trying to help each other."" He's hoping that Old Skool's scholarship fund will help him attend technical school, where he wants to create and patent his own inventions. Stories like this are what motivate Goines. She wants to establish other Old Skool Cafes across the country, and she hopes that some of the young people she's working with now will help her. ""I think there's something about a light going on when you realize your potential,"" she said. ""The core of it is giving them hope. ... Once that light goes on, whatever they do, they're on their way to fly."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- We can think of few things crazier than strapping a parachute to one's body and jumping off a bridge for a quick free fall. The 450 BASE jumpers heading to West Virginia for this weekend's 35th annual Bridge Day might disagree. On Saturday they're planning to jump off the 876-foot-tall New River Gorge Bridge, one of the world's longest steel single-span arch bridges, to prove it. It's the only day all year that BASE jumpers -- whose acronym stands for these fixed points: building, antenna, span and earth -- can legally jump off the bridge. The jumpers carry parachutes designed to deploy quickly, softening their landings. The bridge festival, billed as the largest extreme sports event in the world, is expected to attract nearly 100,000 people to Fayetteville. About 450 BASE jumpers leaped off the bridge 903 times at last year's festival, and about 80,000 spectators packed the bridge and surrounding area to watch them. For the second year, a smaller group of jumpers got to use a human catapult system in 2013 to get flung off the bridge. Rappellers get the best views of the proceedings. They like to tackle the bridge challenge, slithering on ropes attached to the bridge from the catwalk underneath the to the gorge bottom, watching the parachutists go by. Vendors surrounding the bridge will offer snacks, crafts and other ways to less strenuously celebrate the jumpers.","BASE jumpers head to West Virginia to jump off New River Gorge Bridge .

"(CNN) -- In the immediate aftermath of the Oregon school shooting, Chelsea Cooper turned to social media to express concern for her brother. ""Praying for everyone at Reynolds!"" she posted on Facebook. ""My little brother is still there & I'm freakin out! I hate being states away :-( So stressful!."" Her brother, Jared Padgett, 15, was a freshman at Reynolds High School in Troutdale. Cooper's fears about her brother were realized, but likely not in the way she imagined. Padgett was the shooter who killed another student and apparently took his own life, police said. Police found the teen's body in a restroom, law enforcement officials said. His victim, Emilio Hoffman, 14, was also a freshman. He was shot and killed in a locker room. The motive behind the shooting is under investigation. On social media he claimed to be a fan of heavy metal and weapons, but those who knew Padgett describe him in terms that don't appear to fit the profile of killer. During seventh and eighth grades, Padgett took part in track and field at Reynolds Middle School. He was also a member of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps. A former teacher and coach there called him ""a leader."" ""He was a hard worker and wanted to please everyone,"" the teacher said through tears. ""He was just a good kid."" The teacher said Padgett idolized his older brother who was serving in the military. Padgett's Facebook page reveals few clues, but does show that he was a fan of weapons and heavy metal music. His ""likes"" that he shared with his Facebook friends included knife and gun manufacturers, as well as makers of body armor. According to his profile, he was a fan of first-person shooter video games, and deathcore, metalcore and Christian metal bands. Before Padgett's fate was known, his sister's friends tried to offer words of comfort on Facebook. ""I am praying for him to be okay,"" one friend posted. ""They keep saying the shooter is dead but I wanna know who it is!!! I'm so stressed right now,"" Cooper responded. They joked that Jared needed to get a cell phone after the incident was over so they could get in touch with him easier.

"(CNN) -- The long-anticipated Apple smartwatch became a reality this week when the tech giant unveiled its entry into the growing wearable-tech field. The Apple Watch, which comes in three styles and two sizes with multiple options for colors and wristbands, was expected to energize a market that's been slow to catch on as smartwatches from competitors such as Samsung, Sony, LG and Pebble rolled out over the past two years. More than just a tiny smartphone, the Apple Watch, which hits the market early next year, packs a ton of watch-specific features. It has a ""crown"" knob to control scrolling and zoom without having to touch the screen, silent pulse notifications, a slate of health and fitness apps and compatibility with Apple's new Apple Pay app, which lets users scan and pay card-free at participating stores. But there are also questions. The company is still mum on many of the device's specifications, including memory, screen resolution and -- most crucially -- battery life. The exact differences between the low-, middle- and high-end watches are also still blurry. The watch must be tethered to an iPhone -- some observers had hoped for a standalone device -- and its $350 price tag is more than many were expecting. So did the company do enough to make Apple Watch a breakthrough device that will shake up the gadget market the way its iPod, iPhone and iPad did? Many analysts said they think so. ""The Apple Watch defines the category in ways that other competitors will now have to work furiously to catch up to,"" said James McQuivey, a tech analyst at Forrester Research. ""In classic Apple style, the company has introduced a new interface -- the digital crown along with a tap and touch capable surface -- that will make Apple's watch experience significantly easier to use than anybody else's."" While many competitors have released a single smartwatch, sometimes in designs that have been panned for being bulky and unfashionable, Apple's trademark attention to design could make a difference, said Carolina Milanesi, chief researcher at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. That's true, she said, even if the features Apple showcased won't come close to making a smartphone unnecessary. ""I do think smartwatches are still a nice-to-have versus a must-have -- more a convenience than a necessity, which is why appealing more from a style perspective might win more users in the short term,"" she said. Whether that pushes competitors in the same direction remains to be seen. ""Longer term I think we need to wait and see,"" Milanesi said. ""I am not sure we are totally clear as to what the true role of these wearable devices really is, especially as the Internet of Things materializes."" Forrester Research's J.P. Gownder said he's convinced that Apple Watch will push smartwatches into the mainstream in a way that devices running Google's Android Wear haven't managed. ""Apple will legitimize and create the mass-market wearables category,"" he said. McQuivey said he doesn't expect the Apple Watch to catch on with consumers as quickly as the iPad, which first introduced most people to the concept of a tablet computer. He noted how Apple CEO Tim Cook repeatedly referred to the device as a ""personal"" device and said that could be the key to wide appeal. From design to health monitoring to the Apple Pay feature, the watch could become a seamless piece of people's day-to-day lives, not a mere novelty, he said. ""As a longtime Pebble watch wearer, I can attest to the number of ways a watch, because of its glanceability and its one-touch efficiency, helps you get things done more quickly than before, causing you to do them even more,"" he said. But what about the people who just don't wear watches, or those who have found, in a smartphone, a suitable replacement? Milanesi said there's a chance that even those consumers will come on board. After all, who thought they wanted a tablet computer before Apple showcased the iPad? ""There are users that never wore a watch who happily spent money on a fitness band, so I do not see why not,"" Milanesi said. ""Is it for everyone? No, of course not. But there is a market out there, especially of Apple users who see the benefits of having multiple Apple devices working together.""

"Washington (CNN) -- When thousands of children fled violence and poverty in Iraq, Syria and Darfur and surged toward the borders of other nations, it was seen as a humanitarian crisis and they were considered refugees. But a huge influx of young migrants from Central America, many telling U.N. workers they are trying to escape drug cartels, gang violence, murder and rape as they stream across the southern border, have so far not been conveyed the same status. The contrast in what politicians on both sides of the aisle and others have characterized as a humanitarian crisis has introduced new complexity to America's toxic debate on immigration. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is pushing for the United States, Mexico, and Central American countries to treat many of the children as ""refugees,"" which could prompt more from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to seek asylum. However, the White House has said most won't qualify as refugees to stay in the country. ""We don't want to send people back into harm's way ... but the more they expand access to asylum, the more people will feel they have a case,"" said Adam Isacson, a senior associate for regional security for Washington Office on Latin America, a nonprofit humanitarian organization. Different approaches . President Barack Obama wants $3.7 billion from Congress to help address the problem. The emergency money would go to detention facilities for housing children while they await hearings and for legal aid to help sift through a backlog of immigration cases. There is no appetite for Obama's plan among Republicans in Congress. One of them, Arizona Sen. John McCain, said it would perpetuate the crisis. Others said it's too expensive and it would be cheaper to simply fly the kids home. A bipartisan measure by Republican Sen. John Cornyn and Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, both of Texas, aims to quickly send most young migrants home by changing a 2008 law that now requires all unaccompanied minors who aren't from Mexico or Canada to receive a hearing before deportation. The plan, which may have wider support, troubles some lawmakers, especially those in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who worry that children who could possibly qualify for asylum won't have time to properly plead their cases. ""You can't in 72 hours go ahead and make the case that your father got murdered in front of you. You can't make the case that the gang said 'Join us or die,' if you don't have the time to produce documents, affidavits, certificates and what not. And so it is unacceptable to me to basically have a deal that undermines all those rights,"" said Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Republican. A word loaded with political implications . There is important nuance and distinction in calling the surge a ""humanitarian crisis"" while steering clear of deeming the migrants ""refugees,"" international policy and humanitarian aid experts say. The difference determines who gets asylum and who goes back. What's the difference between immigrant and refugee? It's a difference the United Nations is pressing Washington to reconsider. ""We recognize the enormous challenges facing the U.S. and other countries as a result of this large movement of people,"" Shelly Pitterman, the U.N. refugees commission regional representative in the United States, said in a statement advocating broader refugee status. ""We're witnessing a complex situation in which children are leaving home for a variety of reasons, including poverty, the desire to join family, and the growing influence of trafficking networks. Within this movement, there are also children who are fleeing situations of violence at the hands of transnational organized criminal groups and powerful local gangs,"" Pitterman said. Susan Martin, an international migration professor at Georgetown University and the author of several books on humanitarian crises, said U.S. law is ambiguous as to whether the children in this case ""meet the definition of a refugee."" Humanitarian crisis ... in America? They would have to prove they fear persecution on the basis of their race, religion, nationality, political perspectives or membership in a particular social group, Martin said. Violent threats, the type many have apparently told U.N. workers they face from drug cartels and gangs at home, aren't always enough to qualify for asylum, immigration legal scholars and humanitarian aid workers said. Humanitarian aid groups argue the level of violence by organized crime syndicates in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala is so high that the children are basically fleeing warfare. However, some anti-immigration groups have argued that by helping the minors, the U.S. government is actually aiding cartels profiting from smuggling. The Obama administration has said it is approaching the situation as a humanitarian crisis and there is no need, beyond a monitoring role, for the United Nations to get involved. The Department of Homeland Security will conduct interviews with the kids and their legal representatives to determine who might be deemed ""refugees."" Unintended consequences: 2008 anti-trafficking law contributes to border crisis . ""Obviously, we're -- we have a far different circumstance than, say, Syria,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters earlier this month the situation was ""far different"" than similar migrant outflows in Syria and other conflict zones. Typically, she said, the United Nations refugee agency ""conducts these interviews in countries where the host government is not capable or willing to conduct these interviews. And obviously, the United States -- that's a process that we undergo ourselves."" The witch's brew: Desperation, hope and children on the border . But the problem is a hydra and will be difficult for federal officials to stem the tide, Ruben Navarrette, a CNN contributor, wrote recently. Most won't be allowed to stay . White House spokesman Josh Earnest has said the children who have been detained ""will go through the immigration court process"" and it's unlikely that most who do so ""will qualify"" for asylum to stay in the country. ""In the view of this White House, an immigration judge should make the determination about whether someone qualified for refugee status,"" Earnest told reporters on Wednesday. There's the matter of perception, Martin said, adding that terms such as ""refugee"" engender sympathy in a way ""immigrant"" might not. For some people, the image of ""kids being queue-jumpers"" raises hackles, she added. ""As to why Americans are more favorably inclined to aid those who are in need of protection elsewhere than those in their back yard, I think that ambivalence about immigration begins to override the humanitarian instinct when people are seeking to enter the country,"" Martin said. Those feelings are reflected in the emotionally-charged protests that have sprung up in such places as Murrieta, California, and Oracle, Arizona, and polls. One released this week by the Pew Research Center found that 53% of American surveyed supports expediting the legal process for the Central American immigrant children even if it results in kids who could have received asylum being deported. A Washington Post-ABC News poll also released this week showed 58% of Americans surveyed disapprove of Obama's handling of the situation. Texas governor lashes out at Obama over immigration crisis . Still, some political analysts and humanitarian groups have been stunned by the level of political vitriol and lack of broader public outcry. ""There's no big outcry,"" demanding these kids stay in the United States, Isacson said, adding that this is surprising since this is ""the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere."" CNN senior political analyst David Gergen likened the calls for mass deportation to a boat of Jewish refugees who sought safety in America as World War II loomed. They too, Gergen said, faced political backlash in an anti-immigration climate and were sent back to Europe where one-third of them were killed by Nazis. ""Seventy-five years later, we are faced with a new group of desperate people hovering in our midst -- this time children from Central America escaping escalating levels of violence few of us can fathom,"" Gergen wrote in an op-ed for CNN.com. ""While certainly no Nazi Germany, the growing humanitarian crisis in their home countries is glaring as rising murder rates for youths are a driving force behind the mass exodus. How will we respond this time?"" Gergen asked. 7 questions: Immigration next steps?","There is an important political distinction in calling the surge of migrant children ""refugees""

"(CNN) -- Historically in the United States, communities of color and the police have maintained strained relationships. The death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, has stirred up dormant, yet strong emotions. Brown was tragically killed by a police officer in August. His case has yet to be resolved. Residents in Ferguson plan to march starting Friday in a ""Weekend of Resistance"" to demand the resignation of the local prosecutor. When we pull the lens out and take a larger look at the issue we are faced with similar situations across the country, as in the case of John Crawford in Beavercreek, Ohio, or the case of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. When conflict between police and communities of color occurs, the issues of racism, profiling and bias simmer to the surface. These moments create pause for many Americans. Familiar questions come up: ""Why did the police shoot? What made them make the decision?"" Each of these regrettable encounters has to be evaluated case by case based on specific circumstances, even if there may be substantial historical and cultural undercurrents of racial issues that run through them. We cannot draw blind conclusions; we have to seek the truths. We have to seek answers that will provide both communities of color and police agencies with a better understanding of the problems and tools to fix them -- together. A collaborative effort could result in building better communication, and more importantly, trust. This week, I was invited to a community meeting in DeKalb County, Georgia, that was attended by about 100 people from diverse social and economic backgrounds. The event came about as a reaction to the vivid images in the media surrounding the conflict between the African-American communities and police. A 9-year-old asked me: ""Why do police shoot people?"" As I looked down into his face, it was clear that he was afraid. The fear in his eyes seemed to ask if he would somehow be deliberately harmed by police. A 16-year-old African-American asked what she should do if she is pulled over by the police at night. Then a woman asked: ""If I were stopped by the police and asked to step out of the car, should I?"" These are the types of questions that are often asked by people of color. The ongoing reports of incidents in the news have only increased their anxieties. But police have a hard job to do. They are here to protect and serve the communities they work and live in. They are trained to follow policies and procedures while working in potentially dangerous situations. Police officers do the very best they can in circumstances that are often unpredictable. In enforcing community laws, police officers are given a great deal of responsibility, latitude and discretion. It is essential that we support and respect police officers and the daily challenges they face. Their decisions and actions are constantly being evaluated and at times second-guessed. This creates an environment of suspicion and mistrust, which in turn creates a distance between the police force and those they serve. It is unfortunate that there are communities where citizens feel they can no longer trust their local police officers and other law enforcement agents. How we can remedy this situation? What do you do or say to ease the fear of a 16-year-old who is concerned about driving home at night and being pulled over by a police officer? As a first step, we need to start a discussion in communities. We need to listen to people's concerns and work together to forge a better understanding of each other. We must have trained professional police officers who will stand for us, be with us, and protect us. When we see police or hear police we should know that they are coming to help us or someone else. In order for our society to function optimally and effectively, we have to do away with the negative emotions. I strongly encourage that police and community members meet to dispel and reduce the anxiety and fear that is on both sides. Police officers are human, too. Across the country, there are police departments that are doing a fantastic job and there are others that are beyond challenged. But we all have to do our part to establish, maintain and nurture strong and collaborative relationships. We have to find a way to meet in the middle where both the community and police can trust each other; otherwise there will be anarchy. As the national president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, I understand the importance of equality and human rights. We have to be fair and impartial to everyone and know that we all have a shared responsibility in maintaining a safe community. Trust is something we have to work toward in this country.","Residents in Ferguson, Missouri, plan to march about the case of Michael Brown .

"During CNN's ""Going Green: Green Light for Business"" coverage, we've asked businesses to tell us how they balance the imperative for profit with environmental concerns. First up is the co-founder of Hong Kong-based DIAZ Fine Jewelry, Salina Khan Fuchigami, whose business packages cubic zirconia diamonds in an environmental wrapping. Growing up surrounded by generations of jewelry wearing tradition, I was drawn to the brilliance and transparency of diamonds from an early age. Later, it was the fact that diamonds are a unique resource, evoking beauty and eternal love that lead me to found DIAZ Fine Jewelry. Salina Khan Fuchigami co-founded DIAZ Fine Jewelry with her husband Takashi. However, as I began to learn beyond the basics and beauty of diamonds, I began to discover the many environmental and ethical issues related to them. And the once simple wish to create a line of exquisite diamond jewelry grew into a mission -- to create an ecologically and ethically correct jewelry brand. I was one of many who were understandably concerned to learn that jewelry they had as a symbol of love may have come at a terrible human and environmental cost. Although the social and ethical issues associated with conflict diamonds were the impetus at the core of the DIAZ philosophy, the serious environmental impacts of the diamond industry could not be ignored. There's an undeniable link between the degradation of our global environment and consumer culture. The trouble is that these days, things are so nicely packaged, presented and displayed that we hardly ever question how the raw materials used to produce the goods are extracted and processed. We rarely think of how it all affects the environment and humankind. It's impossible to assess exactly how much devastation one single diamond could have caused before it was cut, polished, set and sold at a high-end retailer. It's hard to imagine what a diamond mine looks like by looking at the ""stunning sparklers"" that are neatly displayed in shop windows. Somewhere along the way it became irrelevant to question the true cost of the stones. Diamond mining practices are not without huge ecological impacts. Whether extracted from a large-scale diamond mine using modern, clinical mining methods, or through small-scale artisanal alluvial diamond digging, the diamond industry faces environmental challenges just as with any mineral extraction. Land disturbance, which involves the shifting of large quantities of soil from the earth, is interlinked with issues of waste and water pollution as well as huge impacts on biodiversity. Through my company, I knew I could offer an alternative to mined-diamond jewelry of equal beauty and quality -- using lab-created jewels and meticulous craftsmanship -- jewelry that evoked beauty and eternal love, and that was truly transparent. As with any environmental or ethical issue, education, knowledge and action are the keys to ending unnecessary harm. So, as the business grew, we made sure each of our customers received an info-leaflet with every purchase. We began donating proceeds from our sales to grassroots organizations that ran mine-reclamation projects promoting organic farming and biodiversity in mining towns in Sierra Leone, a country devastated by civil war that was fueled by diamonds and now has a landscape scarred by indiscriminate alluvial diamond mining. We began monitoring the working conditions at our workshop, and looking for more sustainable methods of packaging and delivering our jewelry. We found that our customers were happy to be a part of a solution and not the problem. The economic downturn, combined with an increasing awareness of the ecological and ethical facts surrounding diamonds, has meant an increase in customers who appreciate affordable luxury without any attached guilt. There's no doubt that the choices we make and the actions we take today affect the fate of our planet and in turn our well being. With shifting consumer behavior and a changing economic and environmental climate, the time has come where being environmentally conscious is an imperative for all individuals and businesses alike.","CNN has asked businesses to explain their concept of ""Going Green""

"(CNN) -- The creators of the Swiss Army Knife are expanding into more ""can't leave home without it"" products. This time, the company behind the much-loved pen-knife is turning its design skills to socks. Victorinox is expanding into new areas as it seeks to combat the pressures of Switzerland's strong currency. Alongside socks, time pieces and fragrances are on offer. While the products may seem diverse, there are commonalities, Victorinox chief executive Carl Elsener told CNN's Richard Quest. ""They are a companion for our customers, and they all are inspired by the values, and the heritage, of this little red knife. And these values are high quality, functionality, innovation and iconic design,"" he said. Elsener said the strength of Switzerland's currency, the franc, had eaten into margins, forcing the company to be ""more innovative than our competitors in the rest of the world."" Last year Switzerland's central bank pegged the franc to the euro in attempt to stabilize the currency. The Swiss National Bank's move meant the franc would not drop below 1.20 to the euro. Elsener said this tactic extinguished the fear among Swiss companies that the franc would go to parity with the euro. He said ""This was a big relief for most Swiss companies who depend on exportation."" The Victorinox dynasty was founded in 1884 by Karl Elsener Sn. and the company -- famed for its cross in a shield emblem -- has been handed down through generations. Elsener said corporate sustainability rather than quarterly results were of paramount importance to the group. He said: ""Our family has always really considered the company not just our own, but as something that has been entrusted to us. ""The goal of the foundation is to try to keep Victorinox, in the long term, financially independent, and to make sure that during an inheritance the company is not financially weakened,"" he added.

"Washington (CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner said Friday that Congress ""will not stand idle as the President undermines the rule of law, "" but gave no specifics on how congressional Republicans would respond to the president's executive action on immigration. Boehner told reporters that by moving ahead with unilateral action, the president chose to ""deliberately sabotage any chance of enacting bipartisan reform that he claims to seek."" In a less than five minute press conference on Capitol Hill, the Speaker said he told the President on Thursday ""he's damaging the presidency itself."" Pressed if congressional Republicans would try to block the president's executive actions by moving legislation to strip funding from federal agencies, Boehner sidestepped the question and instead said he was reviewing various actions with his members. ""The House will in fact act,"" the Speaker promised. Due to deep divisions inside the House GOP conference there is no consensus yet on how to try to block the president's plan to allow as many as 5 million immigrants temporary status. Many conservatives want to attach a provision to a must pass spending bill to strip funding for federal agencies to carry out the president's plan. But the chairman of the spending panel argues that is impossible because the customs agency is self-funded through fees and doesn't need congressional appropriations. And many Republicans on Capitol Hill worry another fight on a spending bill will lead to another government shutdown. Others are pushing to sue the president, or vote on censuring him. The clock is ticking for Boehner - government agencies run out of money on December 11th.","Boehner responded to Obama's immigration executive action .

"London (CNN) -- Manchester United, the world's most famous soccer team, fired manager David Moyes on Tuesday, less than a year after hiring him to replace football legend Sir Alex Ferguson. Here's a look some key numbers for the club under Moyes: . Seventh place: Manchester United is on track for its lowest finish in Premier League history. With four games to play, the team cannot finish higher than fifth in the table. This will be the first time it has finished outside the top three since the Premier League began in 1992. 57 points: With 34 Premier League games under his belt, Moyes has won 17, drawn 6 and lost 11. Soccer commentators have been pointing out for months that Moyes is actually doing slightly better than Ferguson did in his first season as manager, starting in 1986, but Ferguson was taking over a 20th-place club on the way up. Moyes took over the team that won the Premier League last year. 1.64: Average number of goals the team has scored per game this year, down from 2.27 last year. 31,300,500 pounds: Manchester United will not qualify for Europe's top soccer competition, the Champions League, next season. That'll cost the team more than 31 million pounds ($52.6 million), since it will lose the broadcast revenue it gets from being in the Champions League. Two: The number of times Manchester United hasn't been in the Champions League, including next season. Ten months: The length of Moyes' tenure as manager. Ferguson led the club for 27 years, but to be fair, in today's Premier League, 10 months is a much more common tenure than 27 years. Six years: The length of Moyes' contract when he was hired last July. The Daily Telegraph reported he'll probably get a one-year payoff, not the full five years' salary, because he failed to meet performance targets. Under U.S. stock market rules, the club will eventually have to reveal Moyes' terms. $19.18: Manchester United's highest share price on the New York Stock Exchange in May last year. That's the highest it's been in the past year, and it plunged in the wake of the announcement of Moyes as manager. It hit its lowest point, $14.26, in February as the team suffered one defeat after another, but recovered to $17.72 by the time Moyes was fired. 1996: The last time a defending Premier League champion finished as low as Manchester United now ranks. (Trivia buffs: It was Blackburn Rovers, who won the league in 1995 and finished seventh in 1996.) CNN's Ursin Caderas, Chris Eldergill, Mark Thompson, Irene Chapple and Sarah Chiplin contributed to this report.","David Moyes has been fired less than a year after taking the job of team manager .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government on Wednesday refused to stop force-feeding prisoners at the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, during Ramadan. In court papers rejecting a petition by detainees, the United States said the feedings provide ""essential nutrition and medical care"" and do not interfere with the detainees' religious fasting during Ramadan, the holy month that begins on the evening of July 8. The tube-feedings will take place in the early morning and late evening to help detainees comply with Ramadan restrictions, said Navy Capt. Robert Durand, spokesman for the detention facility. Shaker Aamer, Ahmed Belbacha, Nabil Hadjarab and Abu Wa'el Dhiab filed a lawsuit Sunday arguing that the feedings violate the Ramadan daily fast from dawn to sunset. U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler had set a deadline of noon Wednesday for the government to respond. Lt. Col Todd Breasseale, a Pentagon spokesman, said the military has changed force-feeding times at Guantanamo during Ramadan for years, but doing so ""is an accommodation, not a right."" Of the 166 prisoners at Guantanamo, 106 are on hunger strike, Breasseale said. In its court filing, the U.S. Justice Department also denied claims that it was giving the drug Reglan to the detainees.

"(CNN) -- Feted by Sean Penn and applauded by Quentin Tarantino at Cannes, Filipino filmmaker Brilliante Mendoza appears to finally live up to his name. Facing the press in Cannes, Brillante Mendoza went on to pick up the best director prize. Despite only directing for four years, Mendoza won the award for best director at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year for ""Kinatay"", beating off competition from filmmaking royalty including Tarantino himself. After picking up the award, Tarantino wrote to Mendoza congratulating him on his award and saying his film was ""bold, daring and... the whole point of making movies in the first place."" Making movies is something that the 49-year-old from San Fernando in the Philippines is relatively new to. He spent 20 years as a production designer before directing his first film in 2005, but since then he hasn't looked back and in just over four years has made another seven films. His style of social realism has attracted as much critical acclaim as it has baffled and alienated audiences. But if an artist's anathema is indifference, Mendoza has more than succeeded in avoiding that curse. Featuring explicit sex, his films have been faced with heavy censorship in his native Philippines, and while Penn and the other judges at Cannes loved his film ""Serbis,"" it proved to be one of the most divisive; ""Variety"" magazine called it exploitative and veteran film critic Robert Ebert said it was the worst film at the festival. ""I believe that my films will find their audience, probably not now but maybe in the future... I'm doing my job, by presenting some stories that normally a mainstream director or mainstream filmmaker won't tackle, won't show,"" he told CNN. ""Serbis"" was only the third ever film from the Philippines to be shown in Cannes, and while elevating Mendoza to a new level of attention, the man himself hopes it will give the whole country a higher profile. ""Because now they will look at Filipino films in a different way, unlike before they only see... films from the Philippines like melodrama, about prostitution, about poverty,"" he said. Citing European neo-realist filmmakers like Francois Truffaut as inspirational figures, Mendoza has crafted his own style of Filipino realism on the screen. He shoots without additional lighting and often only gives actors an outline of the scene they will be filming, letting them improvise around their characters. ""I don't want to limit them, I just want to give them the freedom. I don't even show my actors the script. I mean I just tell them you know the lines they're going to say in that day. So they don't know exactly what will happen,"" he told CNN. Using raw filming techniques, Mendoza hopes to expose the naked truth of life in the Philippines, but he's also aware that when directing, he reveals much about himself. ""As a filmmaker you can't help giving something about yourself in your film. A friend of mine told me 'You should take it easy in exposing yourself because you expose yourself too much in your film.' ""And I said, 'I can't help it.' I mean, I want to be honest with my films, that's why I'm showing how I feel, my emotions, what I'm going through. So that's why I would say, you can't help to have a huge responsibility as a filmmaker,"" he said.","Mendoza won the Best Director award at this year's Cannes film festival .

"(CNN) -- If the ""Old Lady"" of Italian football needs a sharp reminder of where she wants to be, Wednesday's European Champions League clash should provide it. Any trip to the Bernabeu to face Real Madrid -- the nine-time champion of Europe -- is one to savor, even for a club of Juventus' stature. It will also reinforce president Andrea Agnelli's resolution that his rejuvenated side still has a long road to travel before its regeneration is complete. The Turin team's name in Latin means ""age of youth"" -- and this journey, for a club formed 115 years ago, is indeed still maturing. When Agnelli took charge in 2010, becoming the fourth member of his family to take the role, the Italian giant was still piecing itself together from the ""Calciopoli"" match-fixing scandal which saw it stripped of two Serie A titles and demoted to the second division in 2006. The 37-year-old has overseen a transformation of Juve's fortunes on and off the pitch, the club having moved to a new stadium at the start of a season in which it would claim its first title in nine years. Yet despite increasing revenue by 32.8% in the past financial year, the ""Bianconeri"" still made a loss of €15.9 million ($21.9 million). Real Madrid, on the other hand, posted revenue of €520.9 million ($715.8 million) -- 36.9% of which was profit. ""Stadium and sponsorship, those are the two elements that we have to grow, to reach a point to become independent from Champions League revenues,"" Agnelli told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""Then, once you get them, that is the extra fat you can work on. ""At the moment, and this is the thing that worries me the most, we are still dependent on that (Champions League income) to make the numbers meet."" Juventus made more money than any other club in last season's competition -- €65.3 million ($89.7 million) -- over €10 million more than eventual winner Bayern Munich. That figure owed largely to a domestic television deal that improved once fellow Italian club Udinese failed to negotiate its way through the playoff stages. The windfall underlines how vital a revenue stream it is for the club, and the precarious nature of an existence which relies on the luxurious flow of money from competing at Europe's top table. That fact is even more evident after last weekend's results. Despite leading 2-0 at Fiorentina on Sunday, Juve eventually fell to a 4-2 defeat, a result that leaves it five points behind leader AS Roma and vulnerable to attack from the likes of old rivals AC Milan and Inter -- both circling below. If Juve doesn't manage to make it a hat-trick of a successive Serie A titles, it must at least cling onto third spot to qualify for the Champions League playoffs. Should the club then make the lucrative group stages, that revenue will tide it over until the end of next season, when several key financial shackles will be lifted. ""This year and the following we are going to struggle, but in 2015-16, that is when a number of important contracts expire and others can kick in,"" Agnelli explained. ""That should put us in a position to become independent from European sports competition revenue. That will be very important for the club. ""It means the year you might fail on sports results, it doesn't compromise the work in (other) years. ""The only alternative you have if that is the case is to sell an asset you have grown internally, and we don't want to do that because we want to be competitive."" A vital component of Juve's future is its new stadium. Its former Stadio delle Alpi home, built for the 1990 World Cup in Italy, was cavernous and crumbling. Stifling in terms of facilities and atmosphere, it had become a 69,000-capacity relic. The Juventus Stadium may be significantly smaller, with an all-seater capacity of 41,000, but it is regularly full and provides a far more intimate experience for spectators. Whereas the stands at the Stadio delle Alpi were an average of 70 meters away from the pitch, fans at its replacement are just seven meters from the action. And though the move has increased revenue, Agnelli claims Juve is being held back by a clutch of old stadiums that proliferate Serie A. ""Our stadium has been very important but I think we've filled the gap with the European competition,"" Agnelli added. ""At the moment it's very important from an environmental point of view because it really does give a different rush to the team. But we struggle in terms of pricing because all our competitors are in old stadiums. ""The perfect benchmark for our stadium is Stamford Bridge -- 41,000 people both of them -- but Chelsea generate more than double we do in terms of pricing."" According to Agnelli, Juventus Stadium is not only vital to renewing his club's future, but can also act as a lightning rod for Italian football. Whereas once it was the most desired place to play domestic football in Europe, now it has fallen behind England, Germany and Spain, with Portugal and France gaining ground all the time. ""There are a lot of resources which can be gained from the stadium but we also suffer from the same show, which is being put up at our competitors' stadiums. They are obsolete and they price them completely differently,"" Agnelli explained. ""You can debate that Juventus vs. AC Milan is the same as AC Milan vs. Juventus in terms of the show on the pitch but the theater is completely different -- they price it one way, we price it another. ""That kind of becomes unacceptable for the spectator. Once all the others get new stadiums -- if and when -- that means you can raise the whole level of the show. ""That for us is paramount because us alone, we are just a white flag, as interesting as we might be.""","Juventus is clawing its way back to break even point after low point of 2006 .

"(CNN) -- Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"" has more nominations, and among the nine contenders for best picture, only ""The Tree of Life"" has made less money at the box office, but ever since the New York Film Critics Circle named a black and white French silent film the best picture of the year back in November, ""The Artist"" has been the unlikely frontrunner in the Academy Awards race. And there it has remained, picking up the lion's share of the top prizes across the awards season, from the various trade guilds and industry groups to the Golden Globes and the Baftas. There has been a similar conformity even in those categories -- like best actress -- which ""The Artist"" won't win. ""The Help"" star Viola Davis is the red-hot favorite in that race, which would extend Meryl Streep's losing streak to an unlucky 13 nominations since her 1983 win for ""Sophie's Choice."" All of which could make Sunday's ceremony the most predictable -- and anti-climactic -- Academy Awards in recent memory. And that's saying something! Here's the breakdown of the major categories, who we think will win, who should win, and our selections for the most undeserved omissions from the list, the nominees that Oscar overlooked this year. The Nominees . SW = Should Win . WW = Will Win . Best Picture . ""The Artist"" WW . ""The Descendants"" ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" ""The Help"" ""Hugo"" SW . ""Midnight in Paris"" ""Moneyball"" ""The Tree of Life"" ""War Horse"" Overlooked: The industry didn't know what to make of ""Margaret,"" Kenneth Lonergan's film was overshadowed by its long and troubled backstory -- so it chose to ignore it. But this ragged, emotionally gripping drama was an unsung American masterpiece, a more probing study of grief and youth than ""Extremely Loud,"" ""The Descendants"" or even ""The Tree of Life"". Actress in a Leading Role . Glenn Close (""Albert Nobbs"") Viola Davis (""The Help"") WW . Rooney Mara (""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"") SW . Meryl Street (""The Iron Lady"") Michelle Williams (""My Week with Marilyn"") Overlooked: Charlize Theron won the Oscar for playing serial killer Aileen Wuornos in ""Monster,"" but her performance in ""Young Adult"" is even more courageous and more nuanced. She dared to play a deeply damaged and highly dislikeable individual, and despite everything made us care. And spare a thought for Kirsten Dunst, whose chances were probably scuppered by her ""Melancholia"" director Lars von Trier's foolish remarks in Cannes. Actor in a Leading Role . Demian Bechir (""A Better Life"") SW . George Clooney (""The Descendants"") Jean Dujardin (""The Artist"") WW . Gary Oldman (""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"") Brad Pitt (""Moneyball"") Overlooked: Pitt and Clooney both gave career-best performances this year, but so did Woody Harrelson, whose bigoted, self-loathing, alcoholic cop in ""Rampart"" didn't get the promotion he deserved. iReporters share their views on the Oscars . Actress in a Supporting Role . Berenice Bejo (""The Artist"") Jessica Chastain (""The Help"") Melissa McCarthy (""Bridesmaids"") SW . Janet McTeer (""Albert Nobbs"") Octavia Spencer (""The Help"") WW . Overlooked: Not overlooked entirely, but Jessica Chastain could easily have been nominated twice, or even three times, in this category, such was the quality of her work as the innocent wife of the deranged Michael Shannon in ""Take Shelter"" and her angelic mother in Terrence Malick's ""The Tree of Life."" Actor in a Supporting Role . Kenneth Branagh (""My Week With Marilyn"") Jonah Hill (""Moneyball"") Nick Nolte (""Warrior"") Christopher Plummer (""Beginners"") WW, SW . Max von Sydow (""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"") Overlooked: Patton Oswald (""Young Adult"") and Albert Brooks (""Drive"") had every right to expect nominations this year, and frankly their Screen Actors Guild colleagues got it wrong. Directing . Woody Allen (""Midnight in Paris"") Michel Hazanavicius (""The Artist"") WW . Terrence Malick (""The Tree of Life"") Alexander Payne (""The Descendants"") Martin Scorsese (""Hugo"") SW .

"(CNN) -- An official national day of mourning in South Africa on Thursday, called by President Jacob Zuma to memorialize the lives of dozens of miners mowed down in a police fusillade one week ago, turned into an opportunity by his critics to call for his ouster. While government leaders urged restraint, and religious figures prayed for redemption, the embattled president's opponents exploited an opening created by the tragedy to portray his government -- and trade unions allied with Zuma -- as pawns of foreign, white owners. These attacks, lodged in several cases by former allies, threatened to reset the terms of labor organizing, radicalize the tone of political debate, and heighten the chances that the president will be ousted by his own political party at the African National Congress' (ANC) national conference next December. What began as a localized labor dispute, in other words, morphed in the wake of memorial services for the dead, into a volatile, ongoing national crisis. The catastrophe at Marikana placed a harsh spotlight both upon what has changed in South African life since the ANC was voted into power 18 years ago -- in the unprecedented response of the head of state to the crisis -- and also what has remained painfully unchanged. Generations of relatively low-paid black men are still forced to migrate long distances from home in order to take up the most difficult and dangerous kinds of jobs. Miners are still drawn into mining towns where a kind of frontier spirit prevails. Injuries are common and unforgiving, and the salaries earned by a single worker often support up to 20 family members who are unemployed, according to the federation of trade unions. Increasingly, the working poor have begun turning against traditional unions, like the National Union of Mineworkers, which is allied with the national federation, COSATU, in turn part of the ANC coalition. Little wonder, under these circumstances, that Zuma's studied and measured approach to the crisis has inspired so little confidence among the strikers themselves. The strength of anti-ANC agitation in Marikana will keep labor and party leaders up at night because they know their history: Back in the 1980s, massive strikes by miners helped fuel a mass insurrection that led to the end of apartheid. After the mine shootings, the cause of widespread shock and dismay was readily apparent, and the raw feelings were steadily reinforced around the clock by video taken from the scene. The stunning images of the shootings, captured from different angles by various outlets, kept public outrage alive. The video showed the final minutes of a standoff between police and strikers, which ended in the fusillade that ended the lives of 34 protestors and seriously wounded 78 others. What's behind the Marikana massacre? They were protesters at Lonmin's Marikana platinum mine, located 60 miles (about 100 km) northwest of Johannesburg, and the shooting constituted the worst mass killing by police since apartheid ended. In the days after the tragedy, police spokesmen insisted that officers were forced by a charging mass of strikers to fire in order to defend themselves. It was difficult to view the footage without wondering why police had launched teargas at strikers on the hilltop where they had assembled, forcing them to scatter in a funnel in the direction of officers gathered below the hill when their weapons were loaded with live ammunition and set for automatic fire. The impact of the footage, played in regular loops on local television broadcasts, made it difficult for Zuma to assert his authority. He quickly returned from a trip in neighboring Mozambique to visit Marikana twice in a matter of days, dispatched nine of his ministers to assist survivors and their families with burials among other actions and swiftly appointed a Judicial Commission of Inquiry to thoroughly examine the causes and lessons of the tragedy. ""We are in control of the situation,"" he said. Even as the president made pains to express a sense of grief and dismay, and call for calm, however, his opponents sharpened their attacks on him as a leader out of touch with workers and the poor, the key constituency in his rise to power five years ago. At worship services near the site of the police shootings on Thursday, the ceremony began with a plea from Archbishop Thabo Makgoba for no one to use the tragedy for narrow political interests. By the end of the service, Cabinet ministers had been forced to flee the venue, while speakers called on the president to resign. Julius Malema, former leader of the ANC's youth wing and a former Zuma ally, took the podium to pin responsibility for the catastrophe on the president. ""This massacre was committed under his supervision,"" Malema insisted. He slammed the ANC, from which he was expelled earlier in the year, and pressed the case for nationalization of South Africa's mines. The stakes in the unfolding national debate about who was responsible for the tragedy, and who should pay the price, could not be higher, not just for the president's political survival but for South Africa's economic health and stability as well. Platinum is the new gold in a country where mining provides 20 percent of GDP. Though South Africa has the world's largest reserves of this precious and rare metal, which is used in everything from catalytic converters and electrodes to jewelry, it is found in deep shafts that are difficult, dangerous and costly to operate. Against this backdrop, government officials sought to reassure workers that they would maintain their party's historic ""bias towards the poor,"" while not scaring off international investors wary of an industry prone to wildcat strikes. The strikers at Lonmin Marikana mine were rock drill operators who had broken away from the National Union of Mineworkers in favor of a more militant independent union, and wildcats strikes across the industry are increasingly common. A spokesman for the Chamber of Mines was at pains to point out that 95% of mines in the country were operating normally yesterday. In the recent past, national leaders paid a price for crossing labor. In 2008, the ANC instructed President Thabo Mbeki to resign his office, largely as a result of organizing on behalf of Zuma, who was backed by the labor federation as a ""son of the soil"" who promised to close the gap between the government and its people. If party leaders conclude, in the wake of the Marikana mass killing, that only a change at the top can convince ANC's core constituencies that the party of liberation -- now the party of government -- still represents the interests of workers and the poor, Zuma will be shown the door. That is the way the wheel turns in a country where the advent of political liberation has not yet produced greater equality or material freedom. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"(CNN) -- In many ways, Maha Haddioui is the archetypal young professional women's golfer, desperate to make a breakthrough on one of the major tours in Europe or the United States. Educated at an American university, the 22-year-old speaks four languages. Her Facebook page lists has hundreds of friends from all over the world. A stylist on the course, she sports an elegant line in clothing -- more often than not wearing a polo shirt and pink skirt. But, unlike her peers, Haddioui is a trailblazer in a region of the world that has seen turmoil and political upheaval over the past year, and where women's freedoms are often severely restricted. Hailing from Morocco, she's the first Arab woman to compete in a professional golf tournament. Her lifetime ambition is to follow in the footsteps of the North African nation's legendary middle-distance track and field athletes and win Olympic gold. Golf will return to the four-yearly sporting showpiece in Brazil in 2016 after an absence of more than a century. ""I have always watched the Olympics with my father and it is the biggest sports event worldwide,"" Haddioui told CNN. ""We have had some great Moroccan athletes like Hicham El Guerrouj that have made the country proud, and my dream is to follow in their footsteps."" Fortunately for Haddioui, she was brought up by a liberal family who did not insist on traditional dress code for their young daughter. Able to practice on local courses near their home in Agadir, she quickly showed an aptitude for golf and received support from the country's ministry of sport. She has spent four years on the collegiate golf circuit in the United States, studying at Lynn University in Florida and earning the accolade of top-ranked NCAA Division II women's golfer during that time. When she graduated, the repercussions of the Arab Spring began to be felt in the wider region, and in Morocco there were also demands for democratic change. The bulk of the country has been ruled by a monarchist dynasty since the 17th century, with King Mohammed VI holding power since 1999. With regimes in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya swept away, Morocco's 48-year-old ruler promised reforms. In November's election he was obliged to choose the prime minister from the largest party, rather than by his own personal choice. He had, in 2004, introduced measures which addressed women's rights. ""I am a big supporter for freedom and peaceful change,"" Haddioui said. ""We had a couple of peaceful protests in Morocco which have led to major changes in the constitution of the country, but we have enjoyed our freedoms in Morocco for decades."" Haddioui is proud of her country and wants to represent it with distinction. ""My aim is to be the first Moroccan and Arab golfer to make it into the European Tour,"" she said. ""I hope that there will be a lot more women that will follow in my footsteps."" Success has already come with gold in women's golf at last year's Arab Games in Qatar in a team which included her younger sister Nezha. Last season, her first as a professional, Haddioui finished 25th in the Lalla Meryem Cup held in her hometown, and made the halfway cut at another Ladies' European Tour (LET) event in Germany. But it is a big step from collegiate golf to the cut-throat professional world, and this year she will again rely on invites to main tour events. A disastrous second-round 84 at the LET qualifying school in La Manga in Spain wrecked her chances of winning a card with full playing rights. ""I don't know what happened there, it was a tough week,"" she admitted. But Haddioui is undeterred and will be looking to her home tournament in March on the Golf de l'Ocean course in Agadir to make a big impression. With a men's European Tour event, the Hassan II Trophy, and the Lalla Meryem Cup held in the same week at the end of next month, plus a host of regional tournaments, Morocco is promoting itself as a golf destination par excellence. Outside investment, mainly from the Middle East, has brought several new courses and developments -- as Haddioui says, ""taking advantage of our fantastic weather and the opportunity to share a very rich culture."" Haddioui aside, Moroccan players either male or female have yet to make a much of an impression among the professional elite, but all that could be changing. ""Golf is becoming more affordable for locals thanks to the work of the Royal Golf Federation,"" she said. With more youngsters playing, the talent is starting to emerge. Ahmad Marjan, 18, has earned an invite to this week's Dubai Desert Classic, where he will rub shoulders with some of the best players in the world. Haddioui will target December's Dubai Ladies' Masters on the LET as she tries to earn enough money to get an automatic card for 2013. Though proud of her roots and background, it was her spell in the United States that decided on her career path. ""Getting an education in the U.S. is definitely the best choice I have made in my life,"" she said. ""It allowed me to play golf and pursue my education at the same time. It has prepared me for my current life as a professional golfer where I have to travel on my own.""","Maha Haddioui is first Arab woman to play golf in a major professional event .

"Washington (CNN) -- A man charged with drunk driving won his case at the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday, after the justices concluded police should have first obtained a warrant before conducting a blood test against his will, shortly after arrest. At issue was a balancing test between timely gathering of accurate evidence and privacy interests. The high court struck down Missouri's guidelines giving police broad discretion to forego getting a judge's prior approval before executing a search. ""We hold that in drunk-driving investigations, the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does not constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify conducting a blood test without a warrant,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Law enforcement wants flexibility to conduct such ""searches""-- saying alcohol dissipates over time and that delays getting a magistrate to sign off on a blood sample can mean justice denied. But civil rights advocates say these kinds of ""invasive"" medical procedures are unnecessary and unconstitutional, absent any extraordinary circumstances negating the warrant requirement. The ruling did not provide a bright line rule for either side. But it affirmed the existing standard that the ""totality of the circumstances"" must be considered by police, and was not properly applied in this case. The court did not offer law enforcement specifics on how much time can elapse before police would reasonably be able to forego warrants and order blood tests. Half the states prohibit warrantless blood draws by police in ""run-of-the-mill"" DUI cases. The appeal involves Tyler McNeely, 25, who was stopped in the middle of the night two years ago near Cape Girardeau, Missouri, for speeding. He failed four field sobriety tests administered by highway patrolman Mark Winder. McNeely then refused a portable Breathalyzer test on the scene, and was placed under arrest. The corporal then transported the suspect to a local hospital when McNeely said he would not consent to a breath test at jail. A blood test was ordered unilaterally by the officer, again over the man's objections, performed by a trained phlebotomist. The motorist's blood-alcohol content was 0.154 percent, nearly twice the state's legal limit. Court records show the time lapse between the initial stop and the blood test was about 30 minutes. State courts subsequently divided over whether the test could be admitted as evidence, prompting the Supreme Court appeal. The Fourth Amendment protects ""the right of the people to be secure in their person ... against unreasonable searches and seizure,"" and that ""no warrants shall issue, except under probable cause."" The high court's guiding standard has long been ""reasonableness"" and the justices here again said the warrant requirement can be suspended under exigent circumstances, such as the risk of endangering lives or destruction of evidence. But the court has also said state intrusions into one's own body generally require prior review and approval by a judge. The Obama administration is backing Missouri, saying there is a strong federal interest in deterring drunk driving. The court's nuanced opinion was not a total defeat for law enforcement. Indeed, the per se threat of a needle-- with or without a warrant-- may be enough of an incentive for suspected drunks to agree to less invasive breath tests. Both sides concede that dynamic already exists in many cases. But Chief Justice John Roberts issued a separate ""concurrence"" to the ruling, lamenting the lack of the court's specificity. ""A police officer reading this court's opinion would have no idea, no idea, what the Fourth Amendment requires of him, once he decides to obtain a blood sample from a drunk driving suspect who has refused a breathalyzer test,"" he said. The decision will likely mean police may be required to adopt more extensive guidelines on its testing policies, narrowing the emergency exceptions to the warrant requirement. The practical effect may be to force officers to streamline and speed up the warrant process, so that drunk drivers are tested before it is too late to preserve the evidence. Sotomayor acknowledged that in her opinion. ""Technological developments that enable police officers to secure warrants more quickly, and do so without undermining the neutral magistrate judge's essential role as a check on police discretion, are relevant to an assessment of exigency,"" she said. More than 10,000 people were killed in alcohol-related motor vehicle incidents in 2010. That is one death every 51 minutes. Another 500,000 people on average are injured annually in booze-fueled crashes.","Case involved rights of suspect in Missouri drunk driving case .

"(CNN) -- A Virginia sheriff's deputy has been fired for liking his boss's political opponent -- on Facebook. Now Daniel Ray Carter Jr. is fighting back in court, arguing that a ""like"" should be protected by his First Amendment right to free speech. It's a case that could settle a significant question at a time when hundreds of millions of people express themselves on Facebook, sometimes merging their personal, professional and political lives in the process. According to court documents, the case began when Sheriff B.J. Roberts of Hampton, Virginia, fired Carter and five other employees for supporting his rival in a 2009 election. Carter's offense? Clicking the omnipresent Facebook thumbs-up to follow the page ""Jim Adams For Hampton Sheriff."" Roberts, of course, won re-election, leading to the firings. Free-speech advocates argue that the ""like"" should have been clearly protected by Carter's right to freedom of expression. But a U.S. District Court judge in Virginia ruled differently saying, in effect, that free-speech protections don't kick in when someone doesn't actually say something. ""Liking a Facebook page is insufficient speech to merit constitutional protection,"" Judge Judge Raymond A. Jackson wrote in his May ruling, because it doesn't ""involve actual statements."" Carter is appealing that ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals. The appeal was filed last week, and the sheriff's lawyers are expected to respond by next month. Carter's advocates argue the judge's definition of free speech doesn't match existing law. ""The judge is wrong in the sense that the Facebook button actually says the word 'like,' so there are actually words being used,"" said Aden Fine, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which has filed a brief supporting Carter's appeal. ""And there's a thumbs-up symbol, which most people understand means they, literally, like something."" Facebook itself also has weighed in with a brief to the court, saying that a ""like"" for a political candidate is ""the 21st-century equivalent of a front-yard campaign sign."" ""A campaign endorsement in particular need not be elaborate or lengthy to constitute political speech,"" the site's lawyers wrote. ""Carter need not have published a detailed analysis of the competing candidates' platforms for his speech to warrant First Amendment protection. His endorsement of his preferred candidate is enough."" With the London Olympics in full swing, the ACLU's Fine compared it to another wordless moment -- the two American sprinters who defiantly raised gloved fists in a ""black power"" salute on the medals stand during the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. ""They didn't say any words,"" he said, ""but they clearly sent a message."" Bruce Barry is a professor of Management and Sociology at Vanderbilt University and author of 2007's ""Speechless: The Erosion of Free Expression in the American Workplace."" He calls the argument used in the lower court ruling ""ridiculous"" and ""on its face absurd."" Barry believes if the appeals court upholds that judgment, it could make it much easier for employers to clamp down on their workers' speech on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter as well as on personal blogs and other sites. ""If, as a lot of people expect, the appeals court overrules this and says this is obviously protected speech, then it may be that this case doesn't really establish a great amount of new law,"" he said. ""That's the outcome a lot of people might expect. ""But if it goes the other way, then it really does change things, at least in the legal realm. That would have, potentially, a significant effect."" Barry notes that the Virginia case is the latest in a string of legal disputes that have arisen between employers and employees based on the increasingly popular use of social media. Last year, gadget-review site PhoneDog sued Noah Kravitz, a former employee, for taking with him a Twitter account he built while at the company to promote his work for other sites. And, last year, the National Labor Relations board weighed in on behalf of an ambulance driver who had been fired because of a negative Facebook post about the company for which he drove. The board said the company's policy, which prohibited negative comments by its employees on the Internet, was too broad. In February, the two sides settled the case. ""I think that employers are often too concerned about his stuff and about their employees,"" Barry said. ""(Social media) has just become so common, so ubiquitous."" It's not clear how long it will take Carter's case to move through the court system. After the sheriff's lawyers respond, Carter's attorneys will get one more chance. Then, the court could take several months to hear further arguments and, ultimately, issue a ruling.","Virginia deputy says he was fired for liking sheriff's opponent on Facebook .

"PUEBLO, Colorado (CNN) -- Orphan Train rider Stanley Cornell's oldest memory is of his mother's death in 1925. Stanley Cornell, right, and his younger brother, Victor, were adopted from an ""Orphan Train."" ""My first feeling was standing by my mom's bedside when she was dying. She died of tuberculosis,"" recalls Cornell. ""I remember her crying, holding my hand, saying to 'be good to Daddy.' "" ""That was the last I saw of her. I was probably four,"" Cornell says of his mother, Lottie Cornell, who passed away in Elmira, New York. His father, Floyd Cornell, was still suffering the effects of nerve gas and shell shock after serving as a soldier in combat during WWI. That made it difficult for him to keep steady work or care for his two boys. ""Daddy Floyd,"" as Stanley Cornell calls his birth father, eventually contacted the Children's Aid Society. The society workers showed up in a big car with candy and whisked away Stanley and his brother, Victor, who was 16 months younger.  See the Cornell family album » . Stanley Cornell remembers his father was crying and hanging on to a post. The little boy had a feeling he would not see his father again. The two youngsters were taken to an orphanage, the Children's Aid Society of New York, founded by social reformer Charles Loring Brace . ""It was kind of rough in the orphans' home,"" Cornell remembers, adding that the older children preyed on the younger kids -- even though officials tried to keep them separated by chicken wire fences. He says he remembers being beaten with whips like those used on horses. New York City in 1926 was teeming with tens of thousands of homeless and orphaned children. These so-called ""street urchins"" resorted to begging, stealing or forming gangs to commit violence to survive. Some children worked in factories and slept in doorways or flophouses. The Orphan Train movement took Stanley Cornell and his brother out of the city during the last part of a mass relocation movement for children called ""placing out.""Watch Cornell share ups and downs of his family story . Brace's agency took destitute children, in small groups, by train to small towns and farms across the country, with many traveling to the West and Midwest. From 1854 to 1929, more than 200,000 children were placed with families across 47 states. It was the beginning of documented foster care in America. ""It's an exodus, I guess. They called it Orphan Train riders that rode the trains looking for mom and dad like my brother and I."" ""We'd pull into a train station, stand outside the coaches dressed in our best clothes. People would inspect us like cattle farmers. And if they didn't choose you, you'd get back on the train and do it all over again at the next stop."" Cornell and his brother were ""placed out"" twice with their aunts in Pennsylvania and Coffeyville, Kansas. But their placements didn't last and they were returned to the Children's Aid Society. ""Then they made up another train. Sent us out West. A hundred-fifty kids on a train to Wellington, Texas,"" Cornell recalls. ""That's where Dad happened to be in town that day."" Each time an Orphan Train was sent out, adoption ads were placed in local papers before the arrival of the children. J.L. Deger, a 45-year-old farmer, knew he wanted a boy even though he already had two daughters ages 10 and 13. ""He'd just bought a Model T. Mr. Deger looked those boys over. We were the last boys holding hands in a blizzard, December 10, 1926,"" Cornell remembers. He says that day he and his brother stood in a hotel lobby. ""He asked us if we wanted to move out to farm with chickens, pigs and a room all to your own. He only wanted to take one of us, decided to take both of us."" Life on the farm was hard work. ""I did have to work and I expected it, because they fed me, clothed me, loved me. We had a good home. I'm very grateful. Always have been, always will be."" Taking care of a family wasn't always easy. ""In 1931, the Dust Bowl days started. The wind never quit. Sixty, 70 miles an hour, all that dust. It was a mess. Sometimes, Dad wouldn't raise a crop in two years."" A good crop came in 1940. With his profit in hand, ""first thing Dad did was he took that money and said, 'we're going to repay the banker for trusting us,' "" Cornell says. When World War II began, Cornell joined the U.S. Army Signal Corps. He shipped out to Africa and landed near Casablanca, Morocco, where he laid telephone and teletype lines. Later he served in Egypt and northern Sicily. While in Italy, he witnessed Mount Vesuvius erupting. It was on a telephone line-laying mission between Naples and Rome that Cornell suffered his first of three wounds. ""Our jeep was hit by a bomb. I thought I was in the middle of the ocean. It was the middle of January and I was in a sea of mud."" With their jeep destroyed and Cornell bleeding from a head wound, his driver asked a French soldier to use his vehicle to transport them. The Frenchman refused to drive Cornell the five miles to the medical unit. ""So, the driver pulled out his pistol, put the gun to the French soldier's head and yelled, 'tout suite!' or 'move it!' "" Cornell recalls. Once he was treated, Cornell remembers the doctor saying, ""You've got 30 stitches in your scalp. An eighth of an inch deeper and you'd be dead."" Cornell always refused to accept his commendations for a Purple Heart even though he'd been wounded three times, twice severely enough to be hospitalized for weeks. He felt the medals were handed out too often to troops who suffered the equivalent of a scratch. His younger brother served during the war in the Air Force at a base in Nebraska, where he ran a film projector at the officers' club. As WWII was drawing to a close, Stanley Cornell headed up the teletype section at Allied headquarters in Reims, France. ""I saw [Gen. Dwight] Eisenhower every day,"" he recalls. On May 7, 1945, the Nazis surrendered. ""I sent the first teletype message from Eisenhower saying the war was over with Germany,"" Cornell says. In 1946, the 25-year-old Stanley Cornell met with his 53-year-old birth father, Daddy Floyd. It was the last time they would see each other. Cornell eventually got married and he and his wife, Earleen, adopted two boys, Dana and Dennis, when each was just four weeks old. ""I knew what it was like to grow up without parents,"" Cornell says. ""We were married seven years and couldn't have kids, so I asked my wife, 'how about adoption?' She'd heard my story before and said, 'OK.' "" After they adopted their two boys, Earleen gave birth to a girl, Denyse. Dana Cornell understands what his father and uncle went through. ""I don't think [Uncle] Vic and Stan could have been better parents. I can relate, you know, because Dad adopted Dennis and me. He has taught me an awful lot over the years,"" Dana Cornell says. Dana Cornell says his adoptive parents have always said that if the boys wanted to find their birth parents, they would help. But he decided not to because of how he feels about the couple who adopted him. ""They are my parents and that's the way it's gonna be."" Stanley and Earleen Cornell have been married 61 years. She is a minister at a church in Pueblo, Colorado, and is the cook at her son's restaurant, Dana's Lil' Kitchen. Stanley Cornell believes he is one of only 15 surviving Orphan Train children. His brother, Victor Cornell, a retired movie theater chain owner, is also alive and living in Moscow, Idaho.","Stanley Cornell is one of a few ""Orphan Train"" riders who are still living .

"(CNN) -- A tense standoff between China and the Philippines that has been under way since April 10, when the Philippines Navy accused Chinese boats of fishing illegally off the Scarborough Shoal, appeared to ease somewhat Friday. In Manila, Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman Raul Hernandez said that Philippine diplomats ""are endeavoring to undertake a new diplomatic initiative, which we hope will help defuse the situation."" China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters that China had noted the remarks as well as the action taken by the Philippine Foreign Ministry and noticed the resumption of diplomatic contact between the Philippine Foreign Ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Manila. The diplomatic chafing that preceded those statements centered on the Scarborough Shoal, some 130 miles (200 kilometers) from the Philippine island of Luzon. A Chinese military newspaper had warned that the country's armed forces would not allow anyone to challenge China's sovereignty over the tiny island outcrop in the South China Sea. Philippine navy sailors attempted to arrest the crew but were blocked by Chinese surveillance vessels deployed in the area. Both countries claim the shoal, which China calls Huangyan Island. Analysts believe the area is rich in mineral resources, natural gas and oil. South China Sea: Asia's most dangerous waters . ""We want to say that anyone's attempt to take away China's sovereignty over Huangyan Island will not be allowed by the Chinese government, people and armed forces,"" said a report in the PLA Daily, the official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army of China, said Xinhua, the state-run news agency. ""Don't attempt to take away half an inch of China's territory,"" it warned. This week, an editorial in China's state-run Global Times said the international community should not to be ""completely surprised"" if the standoff escalates into a military clash. ""Peace will be a luxury if tensions continue to rise,"" it added. The menacing tone appeared to echo the tone in comments from China's Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying following a meeting Monday with Alex Chua, Charge D'affaires of the Philippine Embassy in Beijing. Fu said China was not optimistic about the situation, and that China was prepared to respond to any escalation, Xinhua said in a statement. Fu added that Chinese vessels would remain on alert around Huangyan because of continuing provocation by the Philippine side, and that Chinese fishermen would be provided with ""a positive environment to operate in their traditional fishing area."" Meanwhile, Chinese officials on Thursday accused Manila of inciting its people to take to the streets to demonstrate against China. Planned protests prompted Beijing to advise its citizens there to remain indoors, and Chinese travel agencies suspended tours to the Philippines, state media reported. ""The Philippines has been repeatedly making strong-worded remarks over the Huangyan Island,"" said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Hong Lei. ""China hopes the Philippines will not take any actions to magnify the dispute in a way that may affect the relationship between the two countries. ""China remains unchanged in insisting on diplomatic dialogue to solve the Huangyan Island dispute. We urge the Philippine side to make a positive response, and move back on the right track."" Beijing and Manila were adamant their territorial arguments were justified. ""They both have claims,"" said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, the North East Asia project director and China adviser for the International Crisis Group. ""China goes back centuries, but the Philippines also says it has maps from the 18th century showing it belongs them."" The Philippine government, which says the islands are inside its 200-nautical mile exclusion zone, wants to resolve the dispute through international negotiation, Kleine-Ahlbrandt told CNN. But she said China rejects this as it has a long-standing distrust of Western-dominated mediators. ""There are a dozen ships in a standoff there right now,"" she said. ""Both sides are really using this for all it is worth, whipping up nationalistic sentiment -- what is needed is something to de-escalate the situation.""","NEW: Manila says diplomats ""are endeavoring to undertake a new diplomatic initiative""

"(CNN) -- Check your ground beef before you grill out this Memorial Day weekend. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service says stores in nine states may have received beef contaminated with E. coli O157:H7. The service announced this week that 1.8 million pounds of ground beef products were being recalled because they could be contaminated. The federal agency has since named retailers that may have received the tainted products. Some are as follows: . • Gordon Food Service Marketplace stores in Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin . • Giorgio's Italian Delicatessen in Stuart, Florida . • M Sixty Six General Store in Orleans, Michigan . • Buchtel Food Mart in Buchtel, Ohio . What government tests found in your meat . A representative for the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the meat is being removed from store shelves. But consumers should return or throw out meat that has the code EST.2574B and a production date between March 31 and April 18, 2014. The ground beef is sold under a variety of labels, according to the USDA, but comes from Wolverine Packing Co. in Detroit. ""While none of the Wolverine Packing product has tested positive for the pathogen implicated in this outbreak, the company felt it was prudent to take this voluntary recall action in response to the illnesses and initial outbreak investigation findings,"" Chuck Sanger, a spokesman for Wolverine Packing, said in a statement. Eleven people across four states are suspected to have been sickened by the product, according to the USDA. Ten of those people were sickened after eating at restaurants that received contaminated meat. But federal officials say regulations prohibit them from naming those restaurants. ""People who were exposed were already exposed, so it doesn't help the public to tell them now that a certain restaurant was associated with these illnesses,"" said David Goldman, assistant administrator for the Office of Public Health Science at the USDA. ""Our job really is to identify product that may still be available."" According to what officials received from the company, he said, the meat went to many states. ""The number changes. Yesterday, it was on the order of nearly 40 states, but we don't -- that number changes. That's part of the process too, is to identify where the food -- the meat in this case -- was actually distributed,"" Goldman said. A list of stores released Wednesday is not final, a Food Safety and Inspection Service representative said. More establishments will be added as the USDA continues its investigation. The recall was categorized by the Food Safety and Inspection Service as ""Class I"": a health hazard situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death. E. coli is a large group of bacteria that live in the intestines of people and animals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Certain strains cause gastrointestinal illness in humans, with symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. An estimated 265,000 infections occur in the United States each year, the CDC says. People usually get sick three to four days after ingesting the bacteria and recover on their own. Young children, pregnant women, the elderly and people who have weakened immune systems (like cancer or HIV patients) are at greater risk for severe illness and death. The best way to avoid getting sick is by washing hands frequently when preparing food and avoiding cross-contamination by washing cutting boards, counters and utensils with hot, soapy water. Properly washing hands after using the bathroom and after coming into contact with animals or being in their environments -- anywhere there may be traces of feces -- also helps. Cooking meats thoroughly to at least 160°F or 70˚C kills the bacteria and prevents infection as well. Using a meat thermometer will most accurately help you determine that the food is thoroughly cooked. Eatocracy: Don't get sick from your picnic . Food Safety and Inspection Service officials said in a news release that the agency is continuing to work with state and federal public health partners on the investigation and provide updated information as it becomes available.

"(CNN) -- One of No Child Left Behind's controversial initiatives -- support for single-sex public schools and classes -- has come under heavy fire from critics. A common objection is that the programs are based on gender stereotypes: Boys need discipline and should be free to run around the classroom; girls require gentle care and can be trusted to sit still. Is single-sex public education outdated and backward in this day and age? Sociologist Michael Kimmel wrote in a CNN.com opinion column that single-sex classrooms in otherwise coeducational schools ""segregate boys and girls."" It's a powerful statement. Segregation usually calls to mind racial segregation. In public schools today, black students remain considerably more segregated from white students compared with other racial and ethnic groups. But does separating students along the gender line, as Kimmel claims, do more harm than good? Separation is not always a form of segregation. Some single-sex schools can do more good than harm. For educators who are looking for a way to address the needs of black boys -- who lag behind their peers on a range of academic and social measures, according to research -- single-sex education is an important tool. Instead of abandoning the option, educators and policymakers should learn from the promising work of some of the schools that serve young black men. An all-male public school can celebrate many different ways of being a young man, freeing students from a straitjacket notion of masculinity. Take Urban Charter, a school that I researched for a year. (Urban Charter is a pseudonym. Federal guidelines require that its real name be kept confidential. This is a common practice for school-based research involving minors.) It's an all-boys high school in a large urban school district on the East Coast. It opened several years ago. Nearly all the boys there are African-American, and a large majority of their families are working-class or poor. Opponents warn that single-sex schools reinforce gender stereotypes. It's a valid concern. Yet the teachers at Urban Charter actively fought stereotypes, not simply of boys but of black boys. The school staff was well aware of common stereotypes of their young men -- as, say, rappers and basketball players -- and so the school culture nurtured individual interests and passions. At weekly assemblies, the accomplishments of the mock trial team were celebrated alongside those of the basketball team. There was a thriving comic book and anime club, and nearly the entire school turned out for theater productions. Critics also worry that all-boys schools promote a machismo culture and could alienate boys who are gay. Yet a schoolwide commitment to helping young men become gentlemen meant frequent lessons about respecting women and girls. The unique gender composition did not itself make all the difference. The school administration knew this from the start. As the school's founder said, ""you can make it all boys; you can separate the boys. That does nothing. Separation gives you an opportunity to work the boys. You've got to shun the whole boot camp mentality, disciplinary school mentality."" That opportunity was creating a pro-academic climate with small class sizes and a longer school day. A large budget and buy-in from parents and teachers also helped tremendously. Urban Charter's accomplishments can't be denied. Since 2011, the school has a near-perfect graduation rate, and over 80% of the students have gone on to college. Nearly all the boys I interviewed said they didn't want to be anywhere else (and most had been unhappy when they enrolled). They frequently cited the number of caring teachers. Research has shown that single-sex schools serving at-risk youth are likely successful for reasons other than simply separating kids by gender. Yet too often, opponents mischaracterize the claims made by those who support the schools. Certainly, there are many differences among boys and among girls. But parents should have the option to choose between single-sex programs and coeducational options. (The programs must be completely voluntary, in keeping with 2006 Department of Education guidelines.) To be sure, proponents haven't always helped their own cause. Some have mistakenly used biological sex differences to justify educating boys and girls separately. But Urban Charter, for example, didn't tout those differences at all. The school instead cited very real, troubling and enduring differences in academic outcomes (performance in school, graduation rates) and social outcomes (exposure to drugs and violence, the likelihood of being incarcerated) between black boys and their peers. Let's stop saying that single-sex public education is a form of segregation; it can empowering. And African-American boys are among those who could benefit the most.

"Washington (CNN) -- After winning her 13th term to the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday, the last thing Rep. Rosa DeLauro expected from a whirlwind week was an armed break-in at her Capitol Hill home. The 71-year-old Democrat, who represents Connecticut's 3rd Congressional District, was not home at the time of the incident early Friday evening. However her husband, political strategist Stan Greenberg, arrived while the burglar was inside. According to an email sent to the community, police said Greenberg saw the burglar holding a large knife when he stepped into the bedroom. Police were alerted about the break-in by the time Greenberg entered the home and were at the scene moments later. Sara Lonardo, DeLauro's communications director, confirmed the break-in and said that police arrested the burglar at the scene. ""[Rep. DeLauro and her husband] thank the Metropolitan Police Department and Capitol Police for their response and are grateful no one was harmed,"" Lonardo said in a statement on Monday. According to police reports obtained by ABC 7 News, police identified the man as John Chaplin, 55, from Southeast D.C. He reportedly stole a Mickey Mouse pin, costume hat, necklace, laptop, and digital picture frame. It is unknown whether Chaplin targeted DeLauro's Capitol Hill home or if he acted randomly.","Rep.

"Maroua, Cameroon (CNN) -- Cameroon authorities have found six more bodies in flood waters, bringing the number killed to as high as 40 in the wake of tropical downpours and the breaching of a dam in the west African country. The inundation in the Far North Region has affected more than 26,000, officials said Thursday, and in neighboring Nigeria at least 15 deaths are blamed on waters rushing into the country from Cameroon's compromised Lagdo Dam on the Benoue River. Cameroon's Communication Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary has described the flooding as ""a calamity"" and called for urgent action to save lives and property. Local officials are calling it the worst flood disaster in over 60 years. Water has submerged swaths of the North Region downstream, wiping out homes, farms and livestock, and Cameroon's government has dispatched a military contingency to assist and evacuate victims. Aid agencies Plan International Cameroon and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) fear infectious diseases - in particular cholera and malaria - could spread with the water, as is often the case. About 3,000 people have been hospitalized, and tents have been erected to house victims. In 2010, flooding in northern Cameroon triggered an outbreak of cholera that claimed nearly 6,000 lives, according to official estimates. Thousands of children are suffering from respiratory problems brought on by the flooding, and malaria infections among pregnant women are running high, according to Dr Alain Njiki of the UNFPA, which normally offers reproductive health services in Cameroon but has had to double as a medical aid agency since the flooding began. Food supplies are running low, boosting worries about malnutrition, and tent shelters are inadequate for the tens of thousands of displaced flood victims, said Demian Toh from the Red Cross. Cameroon's president Paul Biya and a delegation of ministers Thursday offered supplies and vaccination kits in UN camps for internally displaced persons. A flood victim in one camp who preferred anonymity said the government assistance is too small and sidelining thousands of families.","More bodies discovered floating in Cameroon flood waters .

"Washington (CNN) -- American athletes are being warned not to wear their Olympic uniforms outside of the upcoming Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, where they will be under the watchful eye of U.S. security officials who will attend events with them, State Department officials said Friday. The news about the security steps being taken to safeguard the U.S. Olympic team follow revelations this week that Russian authorities were searching for a wanted terror suspect in and around the vicinity of the upcoming Games. It was just one of what a senior State Department official has described as an ""uptick in threat reporting"" in the lead-up the Olympics, scheduled for February 7-23. ""Our expectation is that we will see more in the coming weeks,"" the official, speaking on background, told reporters during a briefing on Olympic security measures. Among the steps being taken is a warning to athletes, coaches and officials not wear their red-white-and-blue Olympic uniforms when away from competition. ""If you are an American Olympic athlete, you don't want to advertise that far outside the Olympic venues,"" another senior State Department official, speaking on background, told reporters during a briefing. The officials confirmed the advice was provided by the security coordinator of the U.S. Olympic team, a story that was first reported Friday by The Wall Street Journal. Additionally, the security for individual athletes will be very tight. State Department security personnel will be accompanying athletes to every single event, every single venue. ""....It is to make sure we have eyes on the teams and eyes on the events,"" another senior State Department official said. The officials did not say how many U.S. security officials would be on the ground with the U.S. Olympic team in Sochi, but the number is likely to be considerable given there are more than 230 athletes and 270 coaches and other U.S. officials. That doesn't take into account the roughly 10,000 U.S. citizens, according to State Department estimates, who are expected to attend the Games as spectators. Even as the State Department officials said there was ""no specific Sochi Olympic evacuation plan that we are ready to just pull off,"" Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel appeared to indicate there was a plan of some sort. ""We've had conversations with the Russian government on protection of our citizens,"" Hagel told reporters. ""... If we need to extract our citizens, we will have appropriate arrangements with the Russians to do that."" Russia has not asked the United States for ""any specific assistance or technology,"" Hagel said. The United States is moving two warships into the Black Sea, Hagel said. ""We want to help. But right now there has been no request from the Russian government for any particular assistance."" Barbara Starr reported from Washington; Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta.","State Department security officials will accompany U.S. athletes to events .

"(CNN) -- Between games, practices, travel and promotional appearances, you'd think that the NBA's multimillionaire stars would be too busy. But most NBA players say they find time to play video games every day. In fact, the NBA claims that 85 percent of its players are gamers. ""I would say I play about three or four hours every night,"" says Orlando Magic Center Dwight Howard. ""I'm a night owl, so after games I'm up till about 4 or 5 a.m. playing video games."" ""That's all I do,"" says Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant. ""If I'm not on the court, I got the controller in my hand."" ""With the schedule we have this year, I don't get to play as much as I want to,"" says LeBron James of the Miami Heat. ""But whenever I get some down time I play some Xbox."" As the NBA playoffs get under way, half the league's players are done for the season, giving them more free hours to fire up their video game consoles. The other half will have extra time off between playoff games, thanks to the league's stretched-out postseason schedule. ""I play a little bit, but I played more during the summer,"" says Rajon Rondo of the Boston Celtics. ""This season is so crammed, it's tough."" The league's rising young stars aren't immune from the thrills of gaming, either. Ricky Rubio (Minnesota Timberwolves), Kyrie Irving (Cleveland Cavaliers) and John Wall (Washington Wizards), made a pit stop while in Orlando for the 2012 NBA All-Star Game to check out the new ""NBA Live 13"" game at Electronic Arts' Tiburon studio -- the developer behind sports franchises like ""Madden NFL 12,"" ""NCAA Football 12"" and the new ""Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf 13."" NBA fans will have a choice of simulation games next season when ""NBA Live 13"" tips off against ""NBA 2K13."" It's been a few years now that gamers, and NBA players, have had no choice in pro-hoops games (outside of the arcade game, EA Sports NBA Jam). ""I'm excited they brought 'NBA Live' back,"" says Durant. ""I haven't talked to anybody yet (about the cover). I'm sure I'll get a call here in a few hours or a few days or so. I haven't heard about it, this is my first time. I'm excited."" Durant was the cover athlete for ""NBA Elite 11,"" a rebranding of EA Sports' basketball franchise that was canceled because of horrible community reaction to the glitchy gameplay. But he's still up for being on the cover of the new game. ""I'm a '2K' person now,"" says Andre Iguodala of the Philadelphia 76ers. ""I might give 'NBA Live 13' a try, but '2K' has taken over the basketball scene."" Although a knee injury to New York Knicks sensation Jeremy Lin knocked him out for the season, he's still playable in ""NBA 2K12"" -- and his gameplay has improved thanks to not one, but two player rating upgrades by developer Visual Concepts. ""I actually don't know the exact numbers, but I know for a while I was in the 50s, I believe,"" Lin says. ""I think ESPN had me as the 467th best player out of 500 or something like that coming into the season."" Now that Lin has earned a 75 in the game, up from 56 when he was a bench player, he's not focusing on how high his player rating can go. ""I'm not really too worried about that,"" he says. ""I don't have a set number or goal, but it's cool to be able to hear about progressing. That's the important thing, is that me and my team continue to improve. As long as we're headed up, I think we're good to go."" New York Knicks star Carmelo Anthony is happy for his teammate's player rating upgrade. ""It's getting up there,"" he says. ""It should be in the 90s. If I have a chance to play '2K12,' he's definitely in my starting lineup."" But not everyone is crazy about their NBA 2K12 player ratings. And yes, they do check out their in-game attributes. ""I like some of the ratings, but I feel like some of them could be increased a little bit,"" says Utah Jazz forward Gordon Hayward. ""Defensively, I think they've got my grade a little low. I think they had one of my teammates, Al Jefferson, a better perimeter defender than me. I was like, 'Come on now, that can't happen.' With time, they'll probably increase them, so I'm not too worried about it."" Utah Jazz teammate Jeremy Evans, winner of the NBA All-Star Slam Dunk Contest, would also like to see his player ratings in NBA '2K12' improved. ""When I play '2K12,' and sometimes I play as myself, I get mad,"" he says. ""It's like, 'I would have dunked that in the NBA.' It's a great game, but sometimes they don't actually make you like you want to be made."" Evans grew up on sports games like ""Double Dribble"" and ""NBA Live"" on the Nintendo 64 and now plays ""FIFA 12"" and the ""Call of Duty"" series. When it comes to video games, some NBA players will try anything. ""I played everything...football games, basketball games, baseball games, Donkey Kong, and all of that,"" says Los Angeles Clippers star Blake Griffin. ""Actually, probably my favorite game to play is 'Tiger Woods Golf.' It's always been fun. I've played it for a long time.""

"(CNN) -- Justin Ross Harris was indicted last week on eight counts in the hot-car death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper. Harris could face the death penalty if prosecutors decide to seek it and he's convicted of the most serious charge. However, the felony murder charge predicated on second-degree child neglect -- which was the original charge at the probable cause hearing months ago -- still poses the biggest threat to Harris' freedom. That, and, of course, the sexting charges, which will likely be the easiest to prove. But make no mistake: That felony murder charge will be how the prosecution can convict Harris of his son's murder, even if the killing was unintentional, and, in Georgia, if the underlying felony was unintentional. Each of the eight counts plays a key strategic role in maximizing the state's chances of a conviction against Harris. Following is a breakdown of these carefully calculated charges. The brilliance of the strategy is in the details. Murder in Georgia: Most states divide murder into degrees. Georgia does not. In Georgia, there's only one degree of murder, but with very different kinds of killings qualifying as murder. In this case, two types of murder are alleged: 1) an intentional killing called ""malice"" murder, and 2) ""felony murder,"" an enigmatic unintentional killing, that is still classified as murder because it is the result of an enumerated felony. Even more complicated, in this case, two different subcategories of felony murder are alleged using child neglect crimes as the predicate felony. Any of these convictions carries a minimum life sentence, but only malice murder is eligible for the death penalty. Count 1 -- malice murder: This is the murder with which we are all familiar. It's the kind committed in the Rue Morgue, or by Professor Plum with the candlestick in the billiard room; or any of the ""Murders She Wrote."" Film, literature and even our board games reflect our cultural assumptions about murder -- that it's an evil crime reserved for the most wicked intent. In Georgia, that's called malice murder, which is defined as a killing with ""malice aforethought,"" or intent to kill. There are two kinds of malice: express and implied. Express malice is that deliberate, manifested intention to end another's life. The reality is, however, that direct evidence of deliberate intent is a rarity. Defendants don't always volunteer: ""I shot the sheriff."" It's quite the opposite. Nearly all defendants steadfastly maintain their innocence; they're more likely to deny shooting the deputy. That's why the law allows for malice to also be implied from the circumstances, as long as the defendant's behavior demonstrates an ""abandoned and malignant heart."" Whether express or implied, to convict here the prosecution has a heavy burden to prove this mental element. That's why felony murder is a much more appealing and devastating weapon in the charging arsenal. Counts 2 and 3 -- felony murder (which are predicated on counts 4 and 5, respectively): Felony murder is more of a legal fiction than it is traditional ""murder."" It is an unintentional killing, but one that happens during the commission of another crime. The rationale is that if you commit an inherently dangerous felony, you accept the high possibility that a person will die during the act. An example would be that if you were robbing a bank and one of your co-conspirators went crazy and shot a teller and a cop? Well, you'd be charged with felony murder, even though you didn't pull the trigger. You committed a felony, and a death resulted. So, to prove felony murder, the prosecution need not prove intent to kill. It only need prove: 1) commission of the underlying felony and 2) a resulting death. Count 2 is felony murder based upon count 4: intentional child neglect. So, if the defendant acted intending to cause his child cruel and excessive physical pain, and death resulted, he has committed felony ""murder"" under count 2. Still the most problematic for this defendant, however, is count 3, which is the original charge from the preliminary/probable cause hearing. This is felony murder predicated on another felony, count 5, second degree child cruelty. But, instead of having to prove the defendant intentionally caused excessive physical pain (first degree), the prosecution here need only prove that he caused pain with criminal negligence (second degree), even if it was unintentional. The traditional felonies eligible for felony murder were intentional crimes: burglary, arson, rape, robbery and kidnapping. To allow felony murder for an accident seems inconsistent, but Georgia courts hold that this crime of criminal negligence can be the predicate crime for felony murder. That's right: In Georgia, you can be convicted of murder -- society's most heinous crime -- for your unintentional negligence. Count 6 -- criminal attempt: As a society, we punish not only completed crimes but also attempts to commit crimes. It makes sense: suppose a bank robber trips and breaks his leg on his way into the bank with his Glock and his President Nixon mask. He is then arrested without even entering the bank to rob it. We all agree that he cannot escape punishment simply because he's unsuccessful at robbing banks. At the same time, if the would-be robber simply fills up his gas on the way to buy a Glock and a Nixon mask, so he can rob a bank in the future, has he ""attempted"" a robbery yet? Where's the line? To the courts, as long as whatever the defendant does is a ""substantial step,"" then he's guilty of attempt. Here, the attempt is connected not to the death of his child but rather to the alleged sexual exploitation of another minor -- the target of the text messaging. Counts 7 and 8 -- dissemination of harmful material to minors: To many, these charges seem like they are tacked on, but they are anything but. In fact, they are devastating to the defendant tactically. Here's why: . Harris is now additionally charged with knowingly disseminating and furnishing to a minor female sexually explicit printed matter and photographs -- or, as the detective testified at the preliminary hearing: sexting. The Cobb County detective testified that while Cooper was in the car, Harris sent a photo of his erect penis to an underage girl and was sexting with several women. At that hearing, the defendant had a strong argument that the sexting was improper character evidence (generally not admissible to prove criminality), and more, that evidence that Harris was a creep was not admissible on the neglect or murder charges. But watch what happens now that he's been indicted on these charges: evidence supporting the sexting charges is now relevant. That evidence will at a minimum cause a jury to dislike Harris. At worst, it will be viewed as motive to be rid of his child. Second, of all the charges, these are arguably the easiest to prove, thanks to technology. Did phone 1 send something to phone 2? Was that something considered ""harmful material""? Was a recipient a minor? Most of those elements can be established with phone records and a birth certificate. As for the ""harmful material,"" so far, if the allegations are true, it sounds like it could fit. Ultimately, this is hardly a scatter-shot indictment. Each charge plays a vital role, but the most potentially damaging is still the same charge from the preliminary hearing: the felony murder based upon the second-degree criminal neglect. After all, whether you condemn this defendant or sympathize with him, there is a preliminary consensus that at minimum he did something tragically and massively careless. And under modern law, that is apparently what we call ""murder.""","Justin Harris was charged in eight-count indictment in hot car death case .

"(CNN) -- In the coming years, lifting the ban on women in combat, announced Thursday by Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, might prove particularly challenging in the most iconic of military occupations -- the infantry, among the most physically demanding and tradition-bound branches of the Marines and the Army. Determining the best path forward to integrate women into this elite group will require hard-nosed honesty, careful management and compelling leadership. For the 65 years that women have enjoyed a permanent place in the United States military, they have been subject to restrictions. One rationale is the notion embedded in our culture that women should be shielded from great physical risks. Another is a recognition of the physical superiority of the average male over the average female. A third is the fear that unit cohesion, critical to military performance, would suffer with the introduction of women. These three concerns apply to varying degrees in the infantry. But the last 11 years of war have clearly demonstrated that warfare is no longer waged in a linear fashion, and that the concept of ""front line"" no longer applies. Opinion: A more equal military? Bring back draft . Historically, logistics operations were conducted ""in the rear,"" where risks were comparatively low. This has changed: In 2006 in Iraq, for example, one in every five truck convoys was attacked. Although infantry clearly remains one of the most dangerous military occupations, the proliferation of homemade bombs and other low-cost, lethal weaponry and tactics have heightened the risk of almost every occupation. War is more uniformly dangerous. That said, physical differences between the sexes remains a thorny issue. Determining gender-neutral physical standards for an integrated infantry will be one of the most difficult tasks ahead. Infantry soldiers and Marines are the primary forces for operations on foot. They not only travel long distances, but also frequently carry loads in excess of 50 pounds. Both the short- and long-term health effects of such demands can be significant. Single mom fought alongside combat troops in Afghanistan . The Defense Department has consistently pursued solutions to lighten the load, from exoskeletons to unmanned vehicles that would serve as ""pack mules,"" to the elusive quest for higher power, lower weight batteries. The success of these efforts will benefit both men and women. But until that happens, research into the effects these physical demands have on women is necessary before determining the degree to which they can, and should, be part of the full range of infantry. Whether men serving in the infantry will accept women as peers is another open question. Those who oppose women in the infantry argue that they would change group dynamics, disrupt bonding and ultimately harm unit cohesion. In the past, these fears have been brought up regarding the participation of minorities and homosexuals, too. But data show these negative predictions don't come true. Instead, successful integration has happened with strong leadership, and, critically, a process that is broadly perceived to be fair. Opinion: Women in combat a dangerous experiment . Even if the arguments underpinning the ban on women in combat have weakened, is there sufficient justification for change? The Joint Chiefs apparently believe so, as they have unanimously recommended the ban be lifted. Each of the services already has been taking steps along these lines. This is in part driven by the evolution of the battlefield. When today's senior leaders were serving time in Iraq and Afghanistan, they realized that the restrictions on women sometimes also restricted their missions. They implemented work-arounds and sought exceptions to policy. But they came home with firsthand experience of the mismatch between modern warfare and the policies limiting women's role. Women are in combat, and senior military leaders believe that future success demands they must remain available to be so, in even greater numbers. From the institutional viewpoint, there are also concerns that the traditional limitations fail to make the best use of women in the service. Combat experience weighs heavily in promotion decisions, and restrictions have precluded women from gaining experiences equal to those of male counterparts. Women are also excluded from many of the occupations disproportionately represented in senior leadership, and that automatically limits the number of women who can advance to the highest levels. At the same time, the pool of Americans eligible for military service is shrinking, and competition for high-quality recruits is intensifying. So it's imperative that the military fully leverage the talent of the men and women it has and that it seeks to attract. By the numbers: Women in the U.S. military . The arguments in favor of lifting the ban on women in combat outweigh those against it. Despite Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's announcement on Thursday, the military services maintain the prerogative to preclude women from serving in certain positions or occupations. Infantry, or at least some specialties within that branch, could well be a case in which restrictions are warranted. But military leaders have time to evaluate this proposition, and to set the conditions to make any change stick. The path ahead may not be smooth, but it is necessary. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maren Leed.","Maren Leed: Ban on women in combat has hurt operations, women's promotion .

"(CNN) -- Filmmaker and activist Jose Antonio Vargas and 10 others asked the U.S. government on Wednesday to halt deportation proceedings against undocumented immigrants like themselves who have strong and productive ties to the United States. In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, they requested that he defer such punitive action and then ask President Barack Obama to consider ""administrative relief"" to those ""who are integral members of our evolving American community."" Vargas and the others said in their letter that they represent just a few of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. ""Often, we're treated as abstractions, nameless and faceless, subjects of debate rather than individuals with families, hopes, fears, and dreams,"" they wrote. ""Over the past decades, we have been working, worshiping in churches, going to school, and contributing to the communities we call home. We love, fight for, and pledge allegiance to an America whose flag does not recognize us,"" they added. In a statement, Johnson's office did not mention the letter, but said he has ""been taking a hard look"" at ""tough issues"" around shortcomings in immigration policy and working to submit recommendations to Obama within ""the confines of existing law."" Customs and Border Patrol agents detained Vargas, also an award-winning journalist, last month in McAllen, Texas, after learning of his immigration status. Immigration question: How far can the President go on executive actions? He was there to call attention to the plight of tens of thousands of migrant youth from Central America, many of them unaccompanied, who have streamed across the southern border this year. The surge has strained border services and reignited the debate over immigration reform in Washington, a cause that Vargas promotes. A decision by Johnson to grant the request would delay any deportation proceedings with the hope that Obama would then use his executive authority to expand deportation protections or that Congress would agree to an overhaul of immigration law. Obama used his executive authority in 2012 to grant work authorization for two years or more for those who came to the United States as children. Vargas missed the age eligibility by only months. With Congress divided, Obama to go his own way on immigration . Vargas became an immigration reform advocate in 2011 when he revealed he was undocumented in a column for The New York Times Magazine. He came to the United States from the Philippines when he was 12 after his family paid for forged documents and a smuggler to bring him to the states. Vargas lived with his grandparents and later became a journalist. He is the creator of 'Documented,' a film chronicling his life as an undocumented immigrant that aired on CNN.","Filmmaker and activist Jose Antonio Vargas and others write to DHS secretary .

"(CNN) -- Two young news anchors for Russia's RT television network -- both Americans -- have blasted Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine, and their editor-in-chief claims the announcements, and the ""mainstream media's"" reaction to them, are part of a media war. ""We've got a genuine war going on,"" Margarita Simonyan, RT's editor-in-chief, wrote on RT's website. ""No, thank God, it's not in Crimea. It's a media war."" Sitting behind the RT anchor desk on Wednesday, Washington-based Liz Wahl told the audience she ""could not be part of a network funded by the Russian government that whitewashes the actions of (President Vladimir) Putin,"" adding ""I'm proud to be an American and believe in disseminating the truth, and that is why after this newscast I am resigning."" The day before, Abby Martin announced on air, ""I can't say enough how strongly I am against any state intervention in a sovereign nation's affairs ... what Russia did is wrong."" Martin, however, did not resign and criticized ""mainstream media"" for ignoring her previous criticism of U.S. military action in other countries. RT called Wahl's action a ""self-promotional stunt"" and, commenting on Martin's move, said RT staff members are free to express their views. The public criticism of Putin's actions on Ukraine is an embarrassment for RT, but Simonyan is rallying her journalists for a war, which, she believes, is directed by the American government with its foot soldiers being the American media. ""The storm of articles posted about RT over the last couple of days -- literally tons of printed copy -- looks as if it were written to dictation,"" she wrote. ""Hardly any respectable media outlet refrained from lambasting and lynching RT journalists in articles or reports."" Simonyan works for RT, she said, because, ""It's my country. There is no other choice for me."" Depicting itself as an ""alternative"" voice is part of RT's marketing strategy. Organized in 2005 as an international TV news channel funded by the Russian government, its original name was ""Russia Today"" and its early mission was to inform the world about events and life in Russia. That strategy, an RT editor told me bluntly a year ago, ""was a mistake, really,"" because few people around the world are that interested in Russia. The network soon lost its Russian image, re-branding itself as ""RT,"" its English-language broadcasts featuring young Americans, and concentrating largely on American news. RT now has 2,500 employees, including editorial, technical and support staff, and five stations: RT International, RT America (English language), RT Arabic, RT Spanish and RT Documentary. This spring RT is launching its own video agency in Berlin to compete with Reuters and APTN. In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday, Wahl said that, in its reports on the Ukraine crisis, ""RT is not about the truth. It's about promoting a Putinist agenda, and I can tell you firsthand, it's also about bashing America."" The editorial policy is set by its senior Russian editors. ""Middle-management,"" she said, ""is American, and their role is to make sure we're in line."" A senior staff member at RT insists the staff decides RT's editorial policy, not the Russian government, and compares RT with the BBC, France 24, Deutsche Welle, and other state-funded news outlets. Russia, that staff member says, must constantly fight the Cold War image of the ""evil Empire,"" and that could take years to overcome. Dmitri Trenin, an expert from the Carnegie Moscow Center who served in the Soviet and Russian military for more than 20 years, says RT's approach differs significantly from news broadcasting in the Soviet Union. ""The Soviet system of propaganda talked about Russia. They had Russian announcers, by and large, and they tried to project Soviet ideas, Soviet ideology, Soviet experience."" ""This time there's nothing to project, they don't care about it. What they do care about is introducing themselves in the Western media world and challenging the established truths and half-truths of the Western media, of the Western World. It's not about Russia."" Meanwhile, in an ironic bit of timing, the ""Russia Today"" name is back again. In a bombshell announcement in late December, President Putin issued a decree creating an international broadcasting entity to carry Russia's views to the world, to be called ""Russia Today."" He also liquidated two Soviet-era media outlets, RIA Novosti news agency and Russia Today international radio. Details of the new agency's structure and mission are expected any day. For the past 20 years, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has been struggling to project its ideas to the world. The Sochi Olympics and its opening ceremony were a major step in Putin's revamping of Russia's image. Now, with the new ""Russia Today,"" he will have both the message -- and the medium -- to present it. His actions in Ukraine, however, are likely, at a minimum, to overshadow the birth of that new agency and, more likely, tarnish it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jill Dougherty.","One RT anchor quits and another criticizes Moscow's intervention in Ukraine .

"(CNN) -- The arraignment of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others charged as terrorists in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, over the weekend was widely described by the media as a ""circus."" While the antics of these al Qaeda terrorists were certainly colorful, I would like to take a moment to focus on the performance of an entirely different group, the journalists who covered the proceedings. While most reporters have been careful to write that those who were arraigned are ""alleged"" to have committed terrorism (an allegation Mohammed has previously gleefully accepted), they are less careful when discussing the treatment these top terrorists received at the hands of the CIA. Mohammed, four others charged in 9/11 attacks . As I detail in my new book: ""Hard Measures, How Aggressive CIA Actions After 9/11 Saved American Lives,"" there are many myths surrounding the detention of a relatively small number of top terrorists at CIA-run ""black sites"" from 2002 until they were sent to Guantanamo Bay in 2006. The biggest myth is that the detainees were ""tortured."" Some of the stories coming out of Gitmo this past weekend simply state that as a fact. There is no ""allegedly"" attached to the allegation in these stories. About 30 out of the 100 or so detainees that the CIA held were subjected to some harsh treatment. But the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice assured us in writing that the treatment was specifically not torture. Many of the techniques were essentially bluffs -- designed to get the attention of a detainee and perhaps scare him -- but to cause no physical harm. Some of the stories this weekend talked of ""years"" of abusive treatment these detainees endured. In fact, the enhanced interrogation techniques (EITs) that CIA used were applied at most for only 30 days. On average, it was much less. Abu Zubaydah, the first detainee subjected to EITs, received them for less than three weeks. Mohammed's period of harsh -- but legal and necessary -- treatment was even less. The public impression, aided and abetted by the media, is that the practice of waterboarding was rampant. In fact, only three detainees: Mohammed, Zubaydah and one other were ever waterboarded, the last one more than nine years ago. Many of the stories this weekend repeated the assertion that Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times. But 183 is a count of the number of pours of water from a plastic water bottle. Mohammed told the International Committee of the Red Cross in 2007 that he had been waterboarded five times. If his story has now changed, it is only to match the media narrative. Some will say it doesn't matter how many times Mohammed was waterboarded -- the practice is brutal and must never be used. What goes unacknowledged is that in addition to the three terrorists, the United States has waterboarded tens of thousands of U.S. military personnel. If the practice is torture for the al Qaeda operative who masterminded the killing of three thousand Americans, why weren't there court-martials in the cases of those thousands of servicemen similarly treated as part of their training? There is no doubt that the detainees will try to use the legal proceedings as a soapbox to spout their contempt for America -- a contempt already indelibly displayed by such acts as ordering passenger jets to fly into iconic buildings or, in the case of Mohammed, personally beheading Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. In my book, I detail the critical information we obtained from al Qaeda terrorists after they became compliant following a short period of enhanced interrogation. I have no doubt that that interrogation was legal, necessary and saved lives. It is good that these terrorists are now facing justice, but in the reporting of the case, it would be helpful if the media didn't help them with their propaganda mission by unquestioningly repeating false information about their detention. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jose A. Rodriguez Jr.","Former CIA official Jose Rodriguez: It's a myth that detainees were tortured .

"(CNN) -- Have you heard the news? Because Antarctic ice sheets are melting, the sea level is likely to rise ""unstoppably"" by at least 10 feet, dooming many coastal towns and displacing millions of people. And it's all going to happenâ€”within several centuries. Well. Who. Cares. This is news you can snooze. So go ahead and hit that snooze button. Could we plan for what will happen centuries from now if we wanted to? Should we plan for what will happen? Will there even be people centuries from now? If there are, do we owe them anything? The next 200, 500 years, are not for us to worry about. The future isn't what it once was, but their business isn't our business. Unimaginable technology has always come to the rescue and always will. Like, we will invent giant, cost-effective floats for New York City and all the other cities and towns on the world's coasts, or something. The announcements about the collapsing ice sheets came from two teams of scientists with different approaches, focused on different parts of the Antarctic. ""A large sector of the West Antarctic ice sheet has gone into irreversible retreat,"" according to Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who led one of the teams. ""It has passed the point of no return."" His team measured shrinkages of 10 to 35 kilometers in several retreating glaciers since the early 1990s. Those glaciers are also thinning. Warming air is intensifying the winds that sweep round the Antarctic, but it's not warming air that is melting the glaciers there. Those winds are drawing warm waters to the surface. The warm waters are eroding the ice. Causes? Seems to be mainly the warming caused by the greenhouse effects of increasing carbon dioxide from burning gas, oil, and coal. But the ozone hole, also human-caused but having nothing to do with greenhouse gases or fossil fuels, might also be intensifying the winds. So far, sea level rise worldwide has been caused mainly by the heat-caused expansion of seawater, much more than melting ice. But melting land ice will have a big effect on sea level rise. Ian Joughin, leader of the other research team, said that nothing can stop the collapse of the ice sheet, adding, ""There's no stabilization mechanism."" But, again, it will be slow. Centuries. John H. Mercer of the Ohio State University was first to predict this way back in 1978. He died without seeing the Antarctic glaciers break up. And so will we all. So, back to bed. People 200 years from now? Not our problemo. The only wrinkle in that thought is that centuries ago, about 225 years ago to be more precise, some people wrote a Constitution and Bill of Rights that affect our lives every day and that we refer to daily to guide us legally and morally. Those people could have said, ""Screw it, let's make money."" I think about my debt to them for wanting to be better than that. I often wish we wanted to be as good. Closer to home, closer to now, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that in this century, sea levels could rise as much as 3 feet. And that is our problem. Some of us will be alive then. Many of us will have children who will live to this century's finish line. Between then and now, there will likely be more devastating Sandy-like hurricanes as winds intensified by warmer waters devastate shores. While reading about the Antarctic ice melt, I noticed three side articles, and clicked. One talked about flooding-related displacement already affecting people in low-lying areas around the world, from the natives of Kiribati to the people of Florida. Another speaks of misery caused in Bangladesh by rising seas, where 18 million people will be displaced in the next 40 years by rising seawater or having their well-water and farms ruined by salt. The third article talked about our dysfunctional Congress's new defeat of yet another energy bill. Voice of America says, ""A bill with strong bipartisan support to make the United States more energy efficient has been blocked in the Senate."" Efficiency is bad; we need wastefulness. Thank you, senators. Either we have a moral responsibility to others or we don't. It doesn't matter whether they live around the block or in the next state or in the future. Morally there's not much difference between a person flooded out by Superstorm Sandy and a person flooded out 200 years from now by our collective, willful inaction. But some days, I'm not even sure how willful it is. When I was in high school in the 1970s, I learned that we were too dependent on other countries for energy, and that oil and coal are non-renewable and polluting, and that we needed to begin a shift to harnessing clean renewable energy sources. The shift to petroleum-based economy had taken a century. The shift to clean renewables would be my generation's most important task. A lot has happened but, bottom line, there's been very little progress. Technology advanced, but it hasn't been embraced. It's been outmaneuvered by denial and inertia backed by entrenched big-energy lobbying and campaign money. Globally, we're not exactly coming together to stabilize climate and institutionalize clean energy. I think we could do what's needed. But collectively we simply aren't. Sometimes I don't see humanity as being capable of fixing the problems we're creating. We'd have to agree to fix them. Before that, we'd have to care. We're not doing enough of any of those things. Too often, we're in denial. And we feel fine. Our main solution is that snooze button. So, let's not worry about the people of Bangladesh, Kiribati, New York and Miami, or the 23rd century. Pleasant dreams.","Scientists say Antarctic's ice land melting 'appears unstoppable'

"(CNN) -- Since I first became aware of the maddening case of 36-year-old Sergio Garcia, who seeks admission to the California Bar, I've tried to convince myself this accomplished young man -- a law school graduate who passed the bar exam -- should be able to practice law despite the inconvenient fact that he is an undocumented immigrant. Yet, I can't. My heart goes out to Garcia. But my head won't go along. This week, the California Supreme Court held a hearing to decide whether Garcia is eligible for a law license in California in a case that is certain to impact the fate of other undocumented immigrants in pursuit of legal careers. Garcia is opposed by the Obama administration's Justice Department, which cites a 1996 law that prohibits states from providing undocumented immigrants with public benefits, including professional licenses. He is supported by California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who argues the issuance of law licenses isn't a federal matter but up to states to decide. A decision from the court is expected in the next 90 days. Garcia came to the United States from Mexico with his family when he was a toddler. He returned to Mexico with his mother when he was 9 and came back to the U.S. when he was 17. He applied for citizenship. That was back in 1994, and he is still waiting to hear from Uncle Sam. He told AP that he isn't worried about being deported because his case is well-known and he had notified immigration officials that he is in the U.S. awaiting a decision on his citizenship. While he waits, he has been working hard toward his goal of becoming a lawyer. He paid for his studies at Cal Northern School of Law in Chico, California, by working at a grocery store. Yet, in the immigration debate, we must separate the individual from the idea. The individual -- Garcia -- looks like a keeper. The idea -- that one who has lived most of his life outside the law can practice law -- is problematic. This young man wants to put his hand on a Bible and pledge the following: ""I solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of an attorney and counselor at law to the best of my knowledge and ability."" That oath comes from the California Bar Association, which states: ""It is the duty of an attorney to ... support the laws of the United States and of this state ... maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers ... (and) never to seek to mislead the judge or any judicial officer by an artifice or false statement of fact or law."" How is Garcia supposed to uphold ""the laws of the United States"" when he is, by his mere presence in this country, in violation of federal law? How does he pledge to show respect for ""the courts of justice"" when, for most of his life, he has lived here in defiance of the rule of law? And how can he claim that he won't ""mislead"" a judge or judicial officer when living in the United States illegally requires deception on a daily basis? If Garcia had more respect for the profession that he is seeking to join, he might have second thoughts about whether he is eligible to join it. Yet, he seems to feel entitled to a law license and everything that comes with it. I've had contact with Garcia in the past, and I'm worried that he's lived in the United States for so long that he's picked up some bad habits from his fellow Americans. Several months ago, Garcia posted on Facebook: ""I have a career lined up with the potential of offering employment to U.S. Citizens, no criminal record anywhere and have been in limbo for the last 19 years. Where the hell is my American Dream? Lol"" I responded: ""Not to pick a fight, Sergio. But your question is very much part of the problem. 'Where's mine? Where's my American Dream? Gimme, gimme.' You're an American after all. I'll tell the kid at Starbucks, the one with the sense of entitlement, to scoot over and make room."" I continued: ""If America gives you the chance to live the Dream, don't you think it's fair for her to ask for something in return? She decided that she wanted your RESPECT, and that this could be demonstrated by you respecting her laws -- the same laws you say you want to spend your life serving and defending in a courtroom. Don't you see the irony there?"" Garcia responded: ""Let me get done with lunch so I can address your entitlement issues."" He never got back to me. In his public comments, I haven't seen evidence that Garcia has considered for one minute the possibility that this case is about issues larger than himself, his plans, his dreams. I don't think he has. And if the court decides in his favor, he never will. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Should an illegal immigrant be able to practice law?
Navarrette: In the case of Sergio Garcia, my heart says yes but my head won't go along .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- The United Nations' cultural organization recognized mariachi music Sunday in a move that Mexican authorities hope will help preserve the well-known tradition. The songs -- often played on festive occasions by groups of guitar, violin and trumpet performers wearing traditional clothes or wide-brimmed hats -- are sung throughout Mexico, and have become a key part of regional identity, officials said. ""The community and the family hand down musically their knowledge, history and the pleasure of singing to the nature surrounding them. They consider it their own,"" Mexican officials said in their application to the United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture (UNESCO), which added mariachi music to the organization's list of intangible cultural patrimony Sunday. Putting mariachi on the list could increase awareness of the music, UNESCO said in a statement Sunday. ""Learning by ear is the main means of transmission of traditional Mariachi, and the skill is usually passed down from fathers to sons and through performance at festive, religious and civil events,"" the statement said. Mexico's application notes that the music ""has crossed borders and become a symbol of Mexico."" ""Immigrants, descendants of Mexicans living abroad, as well as Latin Americans, have made the modern mariachi a symbol of community identity, because it is a bond linking them to their roots in spite of the distance,"" the application says. Jorge Aquino, director of the Mexican Music School in Mexico City, told CNNMexico.com last year that the music has evolved over time, and also drawn greater international attention. ""Now including in foreign countries like the United States, Japan and Colombia, there are mariachi schools, mariachi classes, mariachi degrees,"" he said. Many of Mexico's monuments have already been honored by the United Nations' cultural organization. Last year UNESCO added traditional Mexican food to its intangible cultural patrimony list. In 2008, the organization recognized Mexico's traditional Day of the Dead celebration. This year UNESCO also added 13 other items to its list, including Chinese shadow puppetry, a ritual of transplanting rice in Hiroshima, Japan, and ""poetic dueling"" in Cyprus.

"(CNN) -- Canadian explorer Adam Shoalts knew he was heading into uncharted territory when he set out on a solo expedition to explore northeastern Canada's remote Again River. What the 27-year-old from Fenwick, Ontario, didn't expect was to find himself hurtling over a 20-foot waterfall that had never been documented -- and then go on to discover six more waterfalls after fixing his canoe. The nearly 100-kilometer long Again River is a tributary of Quebec's Harricanaw River, part of Canada's Hudson Bay Lowlands. It's one of the largest roadless areas on earth outside Antarctica, says Shoalts, containing rivers so remote that even today there are a few that have escaped accurate mapping -- including the Again. ""The expedition was five years in the making,"" he says. ""Extensive research went into it, looking through explorers' records, Geological Survey notes, speaking directly with aboriginal elders."" But his research didn't offer any hints as to the dangers that lay ahead. Even Google Earth's low-resolution satellite imagery, all that's available for this remote part of Canada, is deficient for detecting waterfalls. ""The plan was to explore the river, record information about flora and fauna, rapids and the geography in general,"" he says. ""I knew there would be lots of whitewater rapids, but no one knew that waterfalls existed on the river."" 'Yikes, this is going to be bad!' With the support of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, Shoalts conducted two reconnaissance expeditions to the area (one in 2008 and another in 2009), exploring the wilderness around the Again River. But he wasn't able to canoe the Again, as just getting to the river's isolated headwaters is a challenge that involves a few days of bushwhacking and creek-hopping. ""In August 2012, I went back, this time alone, determined to canoe the river no matter what,"" he says. ""The seven waterfalls were so unexpected and special."" The first waterfall Shoalts found -- before it was too late to go around it -- was 20-feet high. Of the six he went on to discover, the highest was 40-feet high. ""My first thought when I realized I was being swept over a waterfall was, 'Wow! What an amazing discovery! The Geographical Society will be thrilled!"" he recalls. ""The second thought was, 'Yikes! This is going to be bad!' I realized I couldn't escape from the current so I just braced myself for the drop."" Shoalts says he was sucked underwater beneath the fall ""for longer than was comfortable."" He resurfaced, out of breath, and spotted his canoe upside down in an eddy near the riverbank. ""I swam to shore, recovered most of my gear -- except my hat, fishing rod and some moccasins -- and then set about repairing my canoe. ""Once I got my breath, that is. It took about an hour and a half to get the canoe back in shape and ready to continue downriver."" Return to the scene of discovery . This week, Shoalts is heading back to the Again River to continue his work for the Royal Canadian Geographical Society (RCGS). He'll retrace his route and photograph, measure and document the precise location of each waterfall so that they can be added to topographical maps, pending verification from Spot satellite imagery. ""This expedition is geographical exploration in the truest sense: Shoalts's work will change the map of Canada -- a rarity in 21st century exploration,"" says the RCGS. Technology is helping explorers make discoveries in an era when significant finds are incredibly rare. Most recently, in June of this year, archaeologists announced they'd found a huge medieval city buried beneath impenetrable jungle on a remote mountain in Siem Reap, Cambodia. It wouldn't have been discovered but for the help of a remote sensing laser instrument. Though Shoalts says gadgets are useful in the field, it's important not to rely on them completely. ""Modern electronic gear and other gadgetry is no substitute for traditional skills and knowledge,"" he says. ""In the beginning, I never used a GPS, only map and compass, sun and stars. Now I have a GPS, but I don't rely on it. ""A satellite phone allows me to communicate from the wilderness, but it doesn't work in the forest or in the rain, so it has limitations and I try not to rely on it. ""I use a modified theodolite, designed by my engineer father, to measure waterfall heights."" He also relies on aerial photographs and satellite imagery when planning expeditions, ""but ultimately, they are no substitute for old-fashioned 'boots-on-the-ground' exploration."" For those with their own Magellan dreams, it's not too late to get into the game, says Shoalts. ""The age of exploration will never be truly over -- the oceans, caves, Antarctica, so much of northern Canada -- it will take a long time to explore,"" he says. ""New species are still discovered, and then there will always be archeology, paleontology, science -- imagination is the only limit really.""","Explorer Adam Shoalts, 27, finds seven uncharted waterfalls on remote Canadian river .

"Washington (CNN) -- Louisiana won't know which candidate will represent the state in the next Congress until December. Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy will face off in a December runoff, CNN projects. The two candidates also faced off against another Republican, tea party-backed Col. Rob Maness (ret.) in Louisiana's ""jungle primary"" system. The system gave candidates from both parties a chance to slug it out together instead of settling on a nominee in the summer like most states. But one candidate has to hit 50% of the vote to avoid a December runoff. The polls have favored a runoff for weeks now, with the No. 3 candidate Maness pulling enough votes from the right to keep Cassidy neck-and-neck with Landrieu and below the 50% threshold. Landrieu's rough fight for re-election came amid sagging approval for President Barack Obama in the state, where only 40% of Louisiana voters approved of Obama according to a CNN/ORC poll. The three-term incumbent even tied Obama's unpopularity in the state to racism in the South last week. ""I'll be very, very honest with you. The South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans,"" Landrieu told NBC News' Chuck Todd, while also citing Obama's moratorium on off-shore drilling and energy issues as the ""number one"" issue for why Louisianans do not like the president. ""It's been a difficult time for the president to present himself in a very positive light as a leader."" And while Cassidy hammered Landrieu over those comments, he faced heat over racially-tinged remarks in September when he said Harry Reid ""runs the Senate like a plantation."" Like many other Democrats with tough reelection challenges, Landrieu has kept Obama at arm's length and has sought to deflect Republican attacks tying her to the President. Landrieu has also faced attacks from her Republican opponents over her reputation as one of the Senate's most frequent flyers -- billing the federal government more than $47,000 in flights in 2013 alone. And in September, Landrieu's campaign reimbursed the federal government more than $33,000 in flights that should have been billed to her Senate office.

"Sabi Sand Game Reserve, South Africa (CNN) -- Tourism and wildlife officials want the slaughter to stop. Private security armies and the South African military have cracked down. Still, rhinos are being killed in South Africa alone at a rate exceeding one a day, a rate that has already made one species of rhino extinct and threatens the two others. Tourism chiefs and wildlife protection groups say both black and white rhinos face extinction because of poaching to meet demand from Asia where powdered rhino horn is used as a medicine, and the Middle East, where the horn is valued for decoration. Exact prices are hard to gauge but some say a kilogram of rhino horn is more valuable than gold, though that is disputed by others looking into the murky black market. In 2011, more than 340 rhinos have been killed so far in South Africa -- more than for the whole of 2010 which was itself a record year, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Africa's western black rhino is now officially extinct, according to a review of animals and plants published last week in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. Now, some involved in the South African wildlife tourism industry are talking about extreme measures to curb the poaching. One idea suggested by a park owner, but not acted on, is to insert a poisoned rhino horn into the illegal trade -- so that end consumers would fall ill. Another suggestion is to make some trade in rhino horn legal because unlike elephant ivory it is possible to take a rhino's horn without killing the animal -- although the poachers rarely leave their animal victims alive. Andrew Parker, head of the Sabi Sand Game Reserve, believes the illegal trade might have spiked as an unintended consequence of tough regulations on legal hunting. In South Africa's Kruger National Park, the military is deployed along the Mozambique border to stop the poachers. While successful in terms of reducing the rhino kills in that area, it has also led to poachers targeting privately-owned game parks instead where security for the animal is a big expense that not all of them can afford. The bigger private parks have their own armed security and electrified fences; Parker says the Sabi Sand Game Reserve is looking at using drones or radar, but for smaller parks the costs of protecting rhinos is becoming exorbitant. Dr. Brett Gardner, a veterinarian at Johannesburg Zoo, said: ""We have to get rid of the trade in Asia. We're wasting time and funds doing it here. We're possibly slowing down the extinction of the rhino. But you're not going to stop it. ""In South Africa where we have good protection of our rhinos, good reporting of when they are shot, we are losing approximately one every 21 hours."" In Asia the trade in rhino horn is believed to be dominated by organized gangs from places like Vietnam, say South African wildlife officials. Rhino horn is culturally believed to have an array of medicinal qualities. Some Internet ads even claim it can be used as a cancer treatment. Back in South Africa, people like Parker and groups like WWF want stiff sentences for poachers and the people who employ them. Almost everyone involved in the fight against poaching says they can understand why a poor, unemployed man desperate to feed his family would be tempted into the illegal business. Reserves such as Sabi Sands are trying to educate their poorer neighbors that rhinos can attract tourism dollars over the long-term but horn poaching can only be lucrative until the last rhino is killed. These poor poachers often sneak onto the private game parks to secure the prized horns, . But wildlife officials like Ken Maggs, head of poaching unit in Kruger, are very worried about the emergence of other hunters, apparently with money behind them, who hire helicopters and gun down rhinos with high-powered rifles. Andrew Parker says these poachers need to face the full force of the law and long jail sentences before it is too late for the rhinos.","One rhino is killed in South Africa every 21 hours threatening the the future of the species .

"(CNN) -- Jimmy Ruffin, silky-voiced singer of the Motown classic ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted,"" died Monday in Las Vegas. He was 78. The Mississippi-born Ruffin had a performing career that spanned 50 years, from the '60s heyday of Motown Records to the digital music era. He was an older brother of David Ruffin, a lead singer of the Temptations, who died in 1991. His death was confirmed by his children, Philicia Ruffin and Jimmy Lee Ruffin Jr., in a statement Wednesday. The family did not offer a cause of death. ""Jimmy Ruffin was a phenomenal singer,"" said Motown founder Berry Gordy in a statement issued by the Universal Music Group, which now owns the famous Detroit-born label. Gordy described ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted"" as ""one of the greatest songs put out by Motown and also one of my personal favorites."" Share your tributes to Jimmy Ruffin . ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted,"" about a lonely guy reeling from a lost love, was intended for the Spinners until Ruffin talked its writers into letting him record it on his own. Its tone of mournful yearning struck a chord, and the song became a top 10 hit in the United States and in the United Kingdom in 1966. It begins: ""As I walk this land of broken dreams, I have visions of many things/But happiness is just an illusion/Filled with sadness and confusion/What becomes of the brokenhearted/Who have love that's now departed/I know I've got to find/Some kind of peace of mind/Maybe."" Ruffin had a handful of lesser hits in the late '60s, including ""I've Passed This Way Before"" and ""Gonna Give Her All the Love I've Got."" He later left the Motown label, had several hits in England, and scored a comeback in 1980 with the disco-inflected ""Hold on to My Love,"" produced by Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees. ""He (Ruffin) was a wonderful human being, quiet and unassuming, who touched many lives with his music, not just here in the States, but overseas, as well,"" Gordy added. ""Jimmy Ruffin will always be a part of the Motown legacy, and I extend my sincere condolences to his family, friends and fans."" Ruffin's family described themselves as ""extremely upset"" over his death. ""He will truly be missed,"" Philicia Ruffin said. ""We will treasure the many fond and wonderful memories we all have of him. We appreciate all of the love and prayers from our family, friends, his colleagues and his adoring fans.""

"(CNN) -- Southwest Airlines announced Saturday that it is grounding 81 planes for inspection following an incident in which one of its flights was forced to make an emergency landing after a 3-foot hole tore open in the fuselage of the plane. Investigators are trying to determine the cause of the ""depressurization event"" and have ""decided to keep a subset of its Boeing 737 fleet out of the flying schedule to begin an aggressive inspection effort in cooperation with Boeing engineers,"" according to a company statement. ""The safety of our Customers and Employees is our primary concern, and we are grateful there were no serious injuries,"" said Mike Van de Ven, Southwest's executive vice president and chief operating officer. The plane managed to land safely at a military base in Yuma, Arizona on Friday, where authorities ""discovered a hole in the top of the aircraft,"" the company said earlier. Meanwhile, passengers who were aboard the crippled the Boeing 737 said they had feared for their lives. ""We were in shock,"" passenger Debbie Downey told CNN Saturday. ""We were in row 16 and my husband and I could see blue sky ... the wiring, the cabling. It actually was terrifying."" She said. ""a lot of people were crying and holding hands"" but had trouble hearing due to the noise of air rushing through the plane's opening. ""It was very, very scary."" ""I heard a loud popping sound about three or four minutes before it blew open on us,"" passenger Greg Hansen said. ""(Then) a big explosion happened. A big noise, and from there, you felt some of the air being sucked out. It happened right behind me, in the row behind me and it covers about two-and-a-half rows,"" he said from seat 11C. Hansen, 41, a regional sales manager for a biotech company, was flying home to Sacramento, California, from a business trip. Some people panicked and screamed as the blue sky and sun began to shine through the cabin in mid-flight, he said. ""Most people were just white knuckles holding onto the arm rests. The pilots did a great job and were under control to get us to a manageable level,"" he said. But just behind him, Hansen said he could see the jagged edge of the aircraft where the rivets used to be. ""You can see the insulation and wiring. The interior ceiling panel was bouncing up and down with the air,"" he said. ""It was surreal, when you're riding in a modern aircraft. You're used to being enclosed and not having the window rolled down,"" he said. Hansen described the hole as being about 3 or 4 feet long and about a foot wide. Passenger Brenda Reese told CNN affiliates KCRA and KOVR she began to fear for her life. ""I was texting my sister to make certain that she told my kids that I loved them,"" Reese said. Southwest Flight 812 made an emergency landing at Yuma Marine Corps Air Station/International Airport at 5:07 p.m. (7:07 p.m. ET.) The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the captain made a rapid, controlled descent from 36,000 feet to about 11,000 feet after the cabin lost pressure. ""We do not know the cause of the decompression,"" said Ian Gregor of the FAA. Hansen said the incident took place about 35 minutes into the flight. He says that it took about 45 seconds or a minute before the oxygen masks came down after the hole blew open. ""The crew was pretty calm about it. They walked around and checked on everyone,"" he said. ""But it wasn't like the movies where papers get sucked out of the hole, but you could feel it and hear the noise."" Hansen said that most of the passengers were complaining of a pain in their eardrums from a rapid descent. Southwest Airlines said only one injury was reported. ""There are no reported customer injuries,"" according to a statement released by the airline. ""One of the flight attendants, however, received a minor injury upon descent."" Hansen said one male flight attendant appeared to fall and was bleeding from a facial injury. Yuma International Airport spokeswoman Gen Grosse said passengers were tended to and given refreshments because the temperature on the tarmac was close to 100 degrees. Hansen said passengers deplaned and boarded another Southwest Airlines plane for Sacramento. He said the airline offered passengers accommodations in Yuma, but did not know if any passengers chose to stay. The second flight landed in Sacramento on Friday night. In a written statement, Boeing spokeswoman Julie O'Donnell declined to comment on possible causes of the incident. ""Boeing is dedicated to the safety of its airplanes and the people who fly on them,"" O'Donnell said. ""We are providing technical assistance to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board as it investigates the incident. In accordance with international convention, we cannot speculate on either the cause or whether this incident is similar to or different from anything in the past; any questions about the investigation must be directed to the NTSB."" The NTSB said an investigative team was scheduled to arriveSaturday in Yuma. CNN's John Branch, Rich Phillips, Deborah Doft and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","NEW: Southwest Airlines announced that it is grounding 81 planes .

"(CNN) -- Charlotte Dujardin's dressage dominance was recognized Wednesday evening in her native Britain as ""The Girl with the Dancing Horse"" was named the Sunday Times & Sky Sports Sportswoman of the Year. Dujardin, who earned her nickname back home after her heroics at London 2012, enjoyed a 2014 to remember as the Olympic and European champion became a world champion to consolidate her place at the summit of the sport. The 29-year-old -- riding Dutch gelding Valegro -- claimed two individual gold medals in the special and freestyle events, as well as a team silver, at the World Equestrian Games in Normandy earlier this year, while she also became the first ever Briton to win the World Cup dressage title in Lyon in April. The achievements of Dujardin -- she is the first rider in history to hold all the major titles in dressage -- are all the more remarkable given that she only began competing on the tour three years ago. ""If someone had asked me 'do you think that's possible?' I would have been like 'absolutely not,'"" Dujardin told CNN in September after achieving the ""grand slam."" ""For it to have been possible and that I've actually done it is very surreal and something that I always have to think 'Oh my God!' I've won all of it. There's no more I can do."" Dujardin first became a European champion back in 2011, winning team gold in Rotterdam, before following that up two years later in Herning with two individual gold medals in the special and freestyle events. Sandwiched in between those triumphs came her team and individual Olympic gold medals in London -- the moment when she really first caught the British public's imagination. ""I remember going into the local supermarket and I got spotted by a guy going 'Oh my God you're the girl with the dancing horse!' He goes, 'I know nothing about horses but I watched you on the telly,'"" Dujardin recalls. ""If you say you do dressage and the dancing horses... nine times out of 10 people recognize our sport now."" None of the fame and success would have been possible without Valegro, though, according to Dujardin, who has been with her every step of the way. ""He's not just a horse to me, he truly is my best friend. One day I want him to pull my car when I get married,"" Dujardin says. ""That's what I want do with him. He'll be strong enough to do that."" Dujardin saw off strong competition in winning the accolade, with Winter Olympic skeleton gold medalist Lizzy Yarnold taking second place and athlete Jo Pavey, who won European gold in the 10,000 meters at the age of 40, coming third. Gymnast Claudia Fragapane won the young sportswoman award following her four golds at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.","Charlotte Dujardin wins Sportswoman of the Year award after successful 2014 .

"Poznan, Poland (CNN) -- At the top of a flight of stairs with no elevator in sight, registered nurse Katarzyna Kaseja leans over the rickety metal bars of a crib. Her 4-year-old patient, a ventilator tube fastened to his throat, reaches out to take her hand. ""It's hard to work as a nurse in Poland,"" said Kaseja, 25. Since she began her career at the Specialized Hospital for Mother and Child in the western Poland city of Poznan, little funding and outdated machinery have only been part of the problem. ""There are not enough nurses, and you have to do everything,"" she said. ""And there is little money and low prestige."" Meager salaries and demanding hours for nurses, however, are not purely a Polish problem. Throughout Europe, the nursing profession is rapidly losing its appeal. An aging workforce and dwindling student enrollment in nursing schools are precipitating a looming nursing crisis. Add to that an economic recession and more seniors requiring long-term care, and Europe may be facing a shortage of 1 million health professionals by 2020, according to a European Union Joint Action on Health Workforce Planning estimate. ""People are leaving the profession because they can't stand the difficult work anymore,"" said Paul De Raeve, secretary general of the European Federation of Nurses Associations, which represents the interests of nurses in 27 European countries. ""The young generation thinks you must be a fool to go into nursing."" It's actually bad all over: America, too, may have 1.2 million job openings for nurses, due to job growth and replacements, by 2020, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, De Raeve believes the United States can serve as an example for Europe, as President Barack Obama's administration has committed to improving working conditions. When the Affordable Care Act takes full effect in 2014, nursing may soon become a more attractive career option in the United States. As part of the ACA, in addition to loan forgiveness programs, nurses will receive increased financial support for pursuing training programs and obtaining advanced certification. Your health care is covered, but who's going to treat you? But in Europe, a clear-cut solution to the nursing crisis may prove to be elusive, as governments and international organizations have very different approaches to dealing with the problem. In countries such as the United Kingdom, which expects a nursing shortage within the next five years, the focus is on disease prevention and public health to reduce the overall number of patients. According to Peter Sharp, chief executive at the United Kingdom's Centre for Workforce Intelligence, an organization providing research and advice on workforce planning, recruiters should encourage nurses who left the job market due to family commitments to return to the workforce. Another plan is to train experienced nurses to take on greater responsibilities. ""A doctor costs more than four times a nurse,"" Sharp said. ""If you don't spend as much on doctors, you can spend more on nursing."" In other countries, such as Germany, the shortage is particularly acute, and the immigration of health care workers from poorer economies even outside of Europe is becoming part of the solution. ""We expect a tremendous nursing shortage of about 500,000 people by 2030,"" said Professor Stefan Goerres, managing director of the Institute for Public Health and Health Care Research at the University of Bremen. ""Even if the profession were more attractive, there just aren't enough young people due to declining birth rates."" In an attempt to alleviate the shortage, the Arbeitgeberverband Pflege, a health employer's union in Berlin, has come up with an idea -- enlisting nurses from China. In cooperation with the German Federal Employment Agency, an experimental project has recruited an initial 150 nurses from China to work in hospitals and nursing homes beginning in early 2014. This month, at the Shandong International Nurse Training Center in Weihai, China, the nurses selected for the program are beginning their eight-month training in German life, culture, and language. ""The nurses learn international standards for caring, washing the elderly, and physical therapy,"" said Kevin Ji, marketing executive of the government-sanctioned nursing center. The training center, which opened in 2001, has more than 400 students a year and has sent its graduates to countries such as Singapore, South Korea and Saudi Arabia. As part of the curriculum, the nurses destined for Germany have begun absorbing the tenets of German culture to ensure a smooth transition into Western society. ""Recently, we had a lecture on garbage and recycling,"" Ji said. ""It's very complicated in Germany."" To create a more unified response to the nursing crisis on a European level, the Joint Action on Health Workforce Planning, funded in part by the European Commission, recently launched a project to foster international cooperation. Beginning this month, its agenda will also focus on the increasing mobility of nurses throughout Europe and its potential social and economic impact. As the member states of the Joint Action begin to meet, some have expressed concern that the migration of nurses within Europe may have unintended consequences. ""Hungary and Poland are worried that their workforce is being poached by richer countries,"" said Sharp, who attended the first Joint Action session in Brussels in April. While weaker economies fear losing their best and brightest workers, wealthier countries worry about a potential influx of job seekers in a time when Europe is still in the throes of a recession. This scenario could become a reality in January 2014, when the Eastern European countries of Romania and Bulgaria gain unrestricted access to the EU. The migration of nurses is further exacerbated by a significant wage disparity within Europe. While a nurse in the U.K. can expect a salary of about $2,800 a month, according to National Health Service estimates, a nurse in Romania can earn less than $200. Back in Poland, about 500 nurses have requested official certificates to seek employment abroad over the past decade, said Teresa Kruczkowska, head of the self-governing Regional Parliament of Nurses in Poznan. In an area of only 3.5 million inhabitants, this would be enough to staff two large hospitals. Kaseja, the nurse at the children's intensive care unit in Poznan, said she loves working with children. But would she consider moving to a better-paying country? She hesitates. In the small ward -- its walls painted a cheerful green -- her young patients lay motionless beneath the bulky, dated ventilator machines. ""Maybe,"" she says.","Low salaries, little prestige and meager funding contribute to European nursing shortage .
The looming crisis is comparable to that in the United States .
But officials say the Obama administration is targeting the problem .
In Europe, no clear-cut solution appears forthcoming ."
"(CNN) -- Formula One's main protagonists are saving their best until last thanks to a controversial new rule change at Sunday's season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The 2014 drivers' championship will be decided at the desert denouement when Mercedes title rivals Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg roll out for a double or nothing gamble. Hamilton leads Rosberg in the standings by a healthy 17-point margin, but a new rule awarding double points at the season finale has raised the stakes. The top-10 finishers at the twilight race will get two points for the price of one with the race winner earning 50 points. The rule change means it is mathematically much easier for Rosberg -- son of 1982 world champion Keke Rosberg -- to snatch the title from championship leader Hamilton. Should Rosberg win the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Hamilton, who won the world championship with McLaren in 2008, must finish second to stop his German teammate winning his first world title. If the race win was worth 25 points -- as it has been at the preceding 18 races this season -- Hamilton could finish as low as sixth and still claim a second world championship. The double points rule was the brainchild of the F1's commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone and was introduced by the sport's governing body the FIA. The new ruling dangled the carrot of keeping the championship alive until the very last race, and so it has proved. But the novelty of double points has had a lukewarm reception, even from the man who has the most to gain from the rule change. ""I find it artificial and I don't like it in general,"" Rosberg told the media after his victory at the last race in Brazil. ""Of course, now with the way it is, it's great for me. We'll see how it goes this year. We need to keep on reviewing it."" Describing the double points as ""artificial"" puts Rosberg in tune with the general feeling among F1's inner circle of drivers, teams and the traveling media pack. The concept of a single race being arbitrarily twice as valuable as the other 18 on the calendar has been hard to digest among the sport's diehard racers. But hard-racing Hamilton -- who describes his attacking style behind the wheel as ""driving like I stole it"" -- is adopting a cool and calm approach to the high stakes race in Abu Dhabi. ""It's something you can't be thinking about,"" said Hamilton, who has won 10 races in 2014 compared to Rosberg's five victories so far. ""It's not something I'm willing to accept. I'm just going to keep pushing as hard as I can and to win as many points as I can. ""I can't be thinking, 'what happens, if this happens in the future?' If we lived our life like that maybe you won't achieve what you set out to achieve."" The Mercedes hybrid turbo car has been the dominant force this season and the team sealed its first-ever team title with three races still to go. An 11th one-two finish in Brazil saw the Silver Arrows also break the previous record for the most one-two finishes in a single season set by fierce McLaren rivals Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost in 1988. But the drivers' championship, which has swung between Hamilton and Rosberg throughout the season, is still poised precariously ahead of the Abu Dhabi finale. ""Both are worthy champions,"" Mercedes motorsport director Toto Wolff said of his dueling drivers on the team's official website. ""Of course, there will be bitter disappointment for one of them and great joy for the other. It is now down to us to ensure that this fascinating year concludes in the right way by giving Lewis and Nico a platform to settle the title purely on the track. May the best man win!"" There are whispers the Mercedes bosses are privately worried a reliability problem could decide which of their men wins the title. Wolff told the BBC if Hamilton broke down during the race it would be ""a nightmare."" Hamilton retired with an engine problem in Australia, a brake failure in Canada and because of damage to his car after Rosberg collided with his teammate in Belgium. In turn, Rosberg failed to finish the British Grand Prix with a gearbox failure and electronics problems stopped him early in Singapore. A reliability issue for Hamilton could also be a major public relations headache for Mercedes, especially in the competitive arena of F1 where the finger of suspicion is always ready to point. It could also have ramifications on the driver market. Hamilton's Mercedes contract runs out at the end of 2015 and he is due to discuss new terms after the season while Rosberg signed an improved multi-year contract in the summer. Ferrari and McLaren are yet to confirm their 2015 driver lineups while on Wednesday Romain Grosjean became the latest driver to secure his seat for next season with Lotus. For now, the Mercedes duelists go into the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix weekend knowing the title is in their hands. Hamilton won the twilight race for McLaren in 2011 and has taken pole at the glittering Yas Marina circuit twice but was beaten in qualifying and the race by his Mercedes teammate Rosberg last season. ""I go into this race with no fear and with every belief that this can be my title,"" said Rosberg. ""Win or lose, double points or no double points, I feel proud of what I have achieved this year."" On the opposite side of the Mercedes garage, Hamilton is also counting on fortune's favor in Abu Dhabi. ""I'm hoping that bad luck won't play a part this time around and I know the team has been working flat out to make sure it doesn't,"" he said. ""I'm feeling relaxed, I'm feeling confident and I'm ready to win."" F1's twilight finale in Abu Dhabi is poised to be a sensational showstopper but when the sun goes down on the 2014 season only one man be will riding into the sunset as the new world champion.

"Budapest, Hungary (CNN) -- Hungarian President Pal Schmitt resigned Monday, days after vowing he would not quit over allegations that he plagiarized parts of his doctoral dissertation. Protesters had called last week for him to step down over the accusation. ""In this situation, when my personal issue splits my beloved country instead of uniting it, I feel it is my duty to end my service, and to resign,"" he told parliament Monday. Schmitt insisted Monday that his conscience was clear, repeating an assertion he made in an interview aired Friday on public access television station M1. He said Monday that he was prepared to go to court to prove that he was right. ""I have written my thesis with my best knowledge I had at the time, and I never intended to plagiarize. However, I will accept the decision of the (University) Senate that has withdrawn my doctorate. But this has got nothing to do with me being a president,"" he said Friday. Schmitt, a former Olympic fencing champion, wrote his dissertation in 1992 for the University of Physical Education, which is now part of Semmelweis University in Budapest. In January 2012, the Hungarian HVG weekly reported that a large part of Schmitt's dissertation was copied. A university investigation also found that large parts of it were plagiarized. A committee said last week that more than 200 pages of the 215-page document showed ""partial similarity"" to other works or were direct translations. The university stripped the president of his doctorate Thursday. ""Since the former candidate's doctoral dissertation is based on lengthy literal translations, it does not meet the professional and ethical criteria of the 'dissertation prepared using scientific methods' requirement for obtaining a university doctorate,"" the university's investigators said in a report. Prime Minister Viktor Orban said it was up to the president to decide what to do. ""Nobody except him can decide,"" Orban said in a radio interview Friday. Schmitt was elected by the parliament for a five-year term in 2010. Germany's defense minister resigned last year in a similar scandal. Karl-Theodor Freiherr zu Guttenberg quit all political posts in March 2011, adding that he was ""taking the step that I would expect others to take.""

"(CNN) -- Michelle was prepared for chemotherapy. She was prepared to lose her hair and deal with extreme nausea and be hospitalized for months at a time. She was even prepared to die -- knowing, with her aggressive form of leukemia, that death was a very real possibility. But when death didn't come, Michelle was officially labeled a cancer survivor. And she wasn't at all prepared for what came next. Treatment forced the mother of two through menopause, leaving her hormones reeling. Stress and self-doubt created problems with her husband of 24 years. She also suffered from vaginal stenosis, a narrowing of the vaginal passage so severe that intercourse was impossible. As her primary care physician explained, she was basically a BAV: born again virgin. ""I was 49 when I was diagnosed, 50 when I received my (bone marrow) transplant,"" said Michelle, who asked not to be identified by her full name due to the personal details she's revealing. ""I wasn't ready to give up on a very important part of my well-being -- that being my sexuality."" There are 13.7 million cancer survivors living in the United States; the American Cancer Society estimates there will be 18 million by 2022. Survivors face many long-term effects of treatment, from secondary cancers to cardiovascular problems to cognitive defects. But the debilitating effects on a patient's sexuality are often ignored, said Sharon Bober, director of the sexual health program at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Bober's program is one of a handful of sexuality-focused survivorship programs that have popped up at cancer centers around the country. Bober was inspired to start the program when she realized many of her patients -- adult survivors of pediatric cancers -- were struggling with sexual issues and had no idea where to go for help. Radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy and surgery all have the capacity to affect sexual function significantly, Bober said. In one study, young breast cancer survivors reported skin sensitivity, vaginal dryness, genital pain, premature menopause, fertility issues and extreme fatigue. Their scores on a sexual health test were also lower than the general population's, indicating problems with sexual desire, arousal, attaining orgasm and relationship satisfaction. These symptoms are common for cancer patients, Bober said. Men face many of the same issues in addition to erectile dysfunction. The side effects don't stop when treatment stops. Bober and her colleagues recently completed a study of 200 young adult cancer survivors; a significant number of them talked about long-term sexual problems years after their therapies were complete. Imagine dealing with all the normal teenage development changes on top of dealing with cancer. Many pediatric cancer survivors feel uncomfortable even dating, Bober said. Adult cancer survivors can also be apprehensive about the bedroom: Hormonal changes from chemotherapy and radiation often lower a patient's sex drive. And many face self-confidence issues post-treatment. Right next to the wigs and prosthetics in Dana-Farber's patient store are vibrators and lubricants, which Bober said helps normalize the ""personal products"" she advocates using. Bober works with a team of doctors to provide whatever services her patients need, whether it's couples therapy or education on vaginal health after early menopause. Bober's program helped Michelle understand what had happened to her sexuality -- both physically and mentally. ""She not only provided us with the emotional tools to overcome the changes we experienced, she also encouraged me to use 'tools' to help my body get its groove back,"" Michelle said. ""I will often joke that I never expected vibrators to be prescribed. But they were absolutely necessary."" Behind closed doors . Most of Bober's patients are simply grateful to learn that there's nothing wrong with them or their relationships. Although studies have shown sexuality plays an important role in happiness and quality of life, it's not something doctors discuss often, Bober said. ""We live in a culture that does not support or facilitate honest and frank conversations about sex anyway,"" she said. ""Lots of people assume that because no one says anything about it, this is just the price that they have to pay."" No one knows about America's behind-closed-doors policy on sex better than Patty Brisben, co-author of ""Sexy Ever After: Intimacy Post-Cancer,"" and founder of Pure Romance, the world's largest in-home party company specializing in bedroom accessories. As an advocate for sexual health awareness, Brisben often does group presentations. Usually she conducts a 20-minute question-and-answer session at the end of her talk. Several years ago, a group of young cancer survivors held her captive with questions for more than two hours. ""Women that are 19 and 20 years old, who never had that first sexual experience -- doctors telling them (to buy) bedroom toys to stimulate so atrophy wouldn't set in,"" Brisben remembers. They asked, ""Patty, what does that mean?"" That was the start of Pure Romance's Sensuality, Sexuality, Survival program. Consultants from the company meet with cancer survivors to talk about combating dryness with lubricants and using other toys to enhance sexual pleasure. ""It has a lot to do with education,"" Brisben said. ""It's so important to provide a safe platform where women can ask questions."" Brisben teaches her employees not to sugarcoat anything. It's a long journey, she said, and each cancer survivor needs to learn to stand up for herself; sexuality can't be a dirty word. ""You truly have to be your own disciple,"" she said. ""Women will demand when it comes to our children or our significant others, but we don't demand for our bodies."" A return to intimacy . Michelle's husband was a ""trouper"" through her cancer treatment, she said, but the couple had difficulty reconnecting in the bedroom. With her symptoms, her husband had trouble keeping an erection out of fear of hurting her. She remembers thinking, ""He must be so traumatized. ... He only sees me now as a frail being and not as the woman I used to be."" Cancer can test any relationship, said CNN's sex expert Ian Kerner. It's not uncommon for cancer patients to become depressed and question their life path, he said, which a partner can find hard to relate to. ""Ultimately, of course, when you're in the midst of a battle of cancer, you really are focused on survival,"" he said. ""But as you resume your life, you want to resume all aspects of your life.

"(CNN) -- For the millions of us who sit at desks all day, Carissa Moore's description of her workplace might sound a little cruel. ""The water is my office and yeah, I get to spend almost every day in the ocean, and that's tremendous,"" Moore told CNN's Human to Hero series. A place that conjures up an image of air-conditioned confinement to most means nothing but fresh air and freedom to the Hawaiian surfer. ""I just love riding a wave. I love getting up early in the morning and driving down to the beach and paddling out and every time I go out, I'm looking for that perfect wave,"" she explains. ""When you're out there and you find that one that you want to go for, it's just like everything else in the world disappears. ""It's just you and the ocean and just spontaneity and an expression of yourself. There's not really any thinking involved, it's just doing."" Admittedly, it may not be the most original statement ever uttered by a surfer, but Moore's career so far has been anything but derivative. Carving up the field . The 22-year-old has taken the surfing world by storm in recent years, winning the women's world championship twice in the last four seasons. Her first world crown was not only a personal triumph but a significant landmark for the sport as she clinched the title at the age of 18 to become the youngest-ever female world champion. ""My first world title in 2011 was a dream come true. I mean, I dreamed of it my entire life and so for it to finally pay off was the best thing ever,"" she says. ""I never really thought of myself being the youngest person. I still don't. I really don't look back and think, 'Oh! that was such an accomplishment!' I think it was more just like, 'Yeah, I won a world title and that really meant something.' In a way it was nothing more than surfing aficionados had expected given her incredible progression as a junior. Moore was born in Honolulu, on Hawaii's third biggest island, Oahu -- home to some of the world's most hallowed surf. ""Not only are the people so sweet, amazing and welcoming -- there's so much ""aloha"" -- but the waves are perfect for growing up as a surfer,"" she says. Oahu's 110 miles of coastline is dotted with spectacular surfing spots from the vertiginous waves of Waimea Bay on the north shore to Waikiki Beach. It was here, in the more benign waters in the south of the island, that Moore's father introduced her to the sport. ""My dad actually was a very serious water man. He swam, he paddleboard raced, he did all sorts of things in the water,"" she says. ""He was the first one who introduced me to surfing and pushed me into my first wave when I was about four or five years old at Waikiki Beach. It wasn't too serious in the beginning -- it was just us enjoying the ocean together."" Making waves . By the time she was 10, Moore was an experienced competitor and already dreaming big. ""I remember telling my dad: 'Hey, you know, I think I want to be the best that I can be in this sport. I want to see how far I can go,'"" she recalls. In 2004, aged 11, Moore won the first of a record 11 national titles in events organized by the National Scholastic Surfing Association, the premier amateur circuit in the U.S. It was form that she carried into the professional ranks in 2010 when she finished third in her first full season on the Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP) women's world championship tour, earning her the Rookie of the Year award. A year later she made history, winning the women's world tour before a second title followed in 2013 as she won half of the season's eight events. Success isn't just down to what you do on the board, you also need to pick your waves with care. ""It definitely takes years of being in the water. Sometimes when you're sitting out in the ocean, you may not see a wave coming in, you just feel it and you move in the right direction and seconds later, there's the wave. ""A good wave is one that has a nice wall (that) will allow for multiple turns and has a nice steepness to it. It's tricky to describe."" Moore's surfing style has led to comparisons with her male counterparts and on occasions she has been granted entry to men's events. In 2011, she was the first woman to be offered a wild card entry to the men's Triple Crown of Surfing in Hawaii.","Hawaiian-born surfer Carissa Moore is a double world champion .
Twenty-two-year-old became sports youngest female world champion in 2011 .

"(CNN) -- In Texas, 33-year-old Marlise Munoz's body is being maintained with technology after being reportedly declared dead based on neurologic criteria, meaning her brain can no longer keep her body alive and functioning. Her husband said she wouldn't want to be kept alive by medical technology. But state law requires that her body be sustained because she is 19 weeks pregnant. The issues surrounding Munoz's case are not isolated. In California, 13-year-old Jahi McMath's body is also being maintained with technology. Her family wants to continue keeping her alive even though her doctors consider her legally dead. There are families all over the world who have faced similar wrenching decisions. For the medical community and families affected in these cases, thorny ethical issues remain unanswered. Conventional wisdom says that the patient has the right to make a decision, but when he or she is unable to, the legal surrogate decides. With Munoz, there are two lives at stake: hers and that of her unborn child. Some believe that the life of the mother is directly linked to the life of the infant. They are viewed as an inextricable unit; they live and die together. For others, the mother and fetus are viewed as separate beings with independent interests. As a nurse and clinical ethicist, I have witnessed firsthand the anguish of family members who must make a choice about continuing pregnancies under such uncertain circumstances, or the aggressiveness of treatment for their extremely premature infants. Generally, under conditions where there is great uncertainty about outcome for either the mother or the infant, we defer to the family to make an informed decision. Do Munoz's preferences become nullified because she is pregnant? Should Mr. Munoz's request that his wife be allowed to die in a way that is consistent with her wishes be disregarded? What is the ethical justification of mandating continued treatment that is contrary to the patient's and surrogate's wishes? Does the fetus become a ward of the state and the woman's body merely a biologic incubator for the fetus? Who then is responsible for the ongoing costs and care of the woman's body and the fetus should it be sustained to the point of viability (24 weeks)? Keep in mind that there are significant unknowns. How would the lack of oxygen or other treatments impact the developing fetus? Even if the fetus could be sustained to the point of viability, complications resulting from dependence on technology, severe disabilities or premature death are quite possible. Another ethical aspect of this tragic case is the impact on Munoz's medical personnel, who are providing treatments that are not desired by the patient or her surrogate, and who are perceived to sustain death rather than life. Clearly, the first priority of doctors, nurses and other clinicians is the well-being of their patients. Their mandate is: First, do no harm. They want to help patients and avoid or remove their suffering. Whose interests are they obliged to promote when they have a patient like Munoz? But medical personnel are not merely mindless robots who implement the decisions of others. They, too, have moral stakes in the process and outcomes of their care. In order for them to do their work with competence, respect and compassion, they must preserve their own sense of integrity. When doctors and nurses begin to view their actions as causing physical, emotional or spiritual harms to their patients, it causes them moral distress. They begin to wonder: How can I see myself as a good doctor or nurse when I am participating in actions that I perceive as wrong or ethically unjustified? The result is that clinicians can burn out. They become cynical, detached or numb. There are no easy answers. Cases like Marlise Munoz are always heartbreaking. There are many things that technology in medicine cannot cure or repair. We cannot know whether attempting to sustain her biologic function to support her pregnancy will yield a healthy infant. Using technology is always a double-edged sword; the very technology that creates hope can also create suffering. It is time to pause to examine again our ""technology default."" We must engage with our communities about the boundaries of using technology, and what the appropriate interventions are when a person's life is sustained with technology. Some would argue that the Texas law rightly protects the interests of the developing fetus and restricts the family's choices. Is the state a better guardian for the fetus than his or her biological parents? We should always have a reverence for life and the ending of life. If there is uncertainty about the degree of brain damage a person has suffered, then it is ethical to use medical technology to keep him or her alive until a better determination can been made. However, as in the case of Marlise Munoz, we must consider whether keeping her alive by invoking a state law honors her and her memory. We need to find ways to make decisions that are respectful, fair and promote integrity. We also need to accept the limits of what medicine can and cannot do. The time has come for a new paradigm for ethical practice in health care. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cynda Rushton.","The husband of a pregnant brain dead woman asks she be taken off of life support .
Cynda Rushton: But Texas law says she must be kept alive because of her unborn fetus .
She asks: Is it ethical to keep her body alive against the wishes of her family?
Rushton: Technology can be a double-edged sword, it can create hope or suffering ."

"Miami (CNN) -- Relaxing on his couch, Thomas Jones quickly scans the channel guide on the TV, his English bulldog resting at his feet, before landing on a football game. Weekends were much different for Jones a few years ago. ""My job on Sundays is to find a place inside of me, to be furious, to be angry, to be violent,"" he said. ""I better be ready to go out there and knock somebody's head off."" As a running back in the NFL, Jones did whatever it took to prove himself because he always knew his job was up for grabs. And his hard work paid off. Jones, now 34, was a standout at the University of Virginia, and he went on to play 12 seasons in the NFL and earn a coveted spot in the league's elite 10,000 Rushing Yards Club. Despite his love for the gridiron, the coal miner's son knows there's a dark side to the sport. ""In the NFL, yeah, we're making a lot of money. But the reality is, you're taking a chance on your life as well,"" he said. ""People love to see someone get knocked out. But no one's there when they have a concussion."" A tale of two former NFL players and their brains . It's something that weighs on Jones, who retired from the NFL in 2011 after playing 12 seasons for five different teams. Still nimble, Jones doesn't experience chronic headaches or have memory trouble. He even considers himself less irritable nowadays than when he was playing. Although his daily life isn't riddled with pain resulting from repeated pummeling, he is concerned about the long-term effects of the sport on his brain. That concern grew after talking to doctors and players haunted by gnarly hits for a six-part documentary series, ""The NFL: The Gift Or The Curse,"" which he is producing. NFL, Harvard planning $100 million player study . He felt his worries were founded when he learned that star NFL linebacker Junior Seau -- who took his own life last May -- suffered from a neurodegenerative brain disease that can develop from concussions known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE. At that point, Jones said he decided to donate his own brain to the Sports Legacy Institute -- which studies the link between sports and brain trauma -- for research upon his death. Jones said he hopes that research will help bring more understanding of the brain disease so future football players are informed when they decide to take the field. ""CTE didn't just pop up. It's been around,"" he said. ""But unfortunately it took a couple of big-name guys to take their own lives to bring attention to it."" Seven months after Seau's death, another NFL player's life came to a violent end, stunning the sports world once again and raising concerns about the mental health of football players. On December 1, Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher fatally shot his girlfriend in the same home as their 3-month-old daughter before heading to team's practice facility, thanking his coaches, and turning his gun on himself. Yet, in the wake of Belcher's murder-suicide, the nationwide discussion turned away from mental health and toward guns. NBC sportscaster Bob Costas fueled the firestorm with his comments just one day after the incident. Referencing a piece written by Fox Sports' Jason Whitlock, Costas said, ""'Handguns do not enhance our safety, they exacerbate our flaws, tempt us to escalate arguments and bait us into embracing confrontation rather than avoiding it.' ""'If Jovan Belcher didn't possess a gun, he and Kasandra Perkins would both be alive today.'"" Weeks later, the gun debate would grow even louder after the Newtown, Connecticut, school massacre. Jones -- who played with Belcher and owns a handgun -- said there's a much bigger picture to consider. ""I loved Jovan like a brother, but he did something terrible, horrible, and we can't take that back,"" Jones said. ""But to segue into (saying there is) a gun culture in the NFL ... makes me sick to my stomach."" Jones started playing football at age 7 in Big Stone Gap, Virginia. The oldest of seven kids, he describes his childhood as a simple country life. He said his family was so big they had to make two trips to church on Sundays -- half the family at a time. And, sometimes the family went without basic necessities, including heat. Jones stepped into a different world as a professional athlete after graduating from the University of Virginia, he said, a world that has brought good fortune but one that also leaves him contemplating the future. Since retiring from the Chiefs last season, Jones turned his attention to letting people know that life after football also has risks. He's hopeful that the NFL will create new ways to make the sport safer, but, he said, ""Football is football, it's a gladiator sport. Unfortunately, that's part of the game."" Jones said he is creating his documentary series to give viewers an insider look at NFL players' lives without the helmet. In one scene, former NFL defensive end Adewale Ogunleye laments about his memory loss. ""I know my memory's screwed up at times, I know I be forgetting things,"" Ogunleye says. ""I kind of laugh it off now, but ... I hope these concussions don't come back to haunt us in the end."" Through this documentary, Jones hopes he can shed light on the human side of professional football. ""Even though we can do superhuman things, it seems, on the football field, it doesn't make us superhuman off the field,"" he said. Seau had brain disease caused by hits to head .

"(CNN) -- Kevin Pippen left his father's nursing home knowing he had to make a change. His father wasn't obese or dying of lung cancer. But seeing his quality of life made Pippen want to delay death as long as possible. ""It was just a wake-up call,"" the 57-year-old from Georgetown, Kentucky, says, ""knowing if I kept smoking and eating the way I was, and not exercising, I was probably going to be where he is a lot quicker than I should be."" A couple of weeks later, in July 2011, Pippen bought nicotine patches, started exercising and never looked back. ""I was miserable when I was large, but I would never admit it,"" he wrote on iReport. ""I can remember looking at myself in the mirror thinking how wonderful it would be to just wake up one morning, healthy and physically fit."" Pippen's wife, Susan, enjoyed walking every night after dinner. He joined her on the evening jaunts, until he started experiencing shooting pains in his arms and had trouble breathing. A visit to the VA Medical Center revealed that he had an 80% blockage in one of his coronary arteries and Type 2 diabetes. In November 2011, doctors inserted a stent to improve the blood flow to his heart. He barely fit on the operating table. Doctors offered to get him into a bariatric center for gastric bypass surgery as well, but Pippen refused. Instead, the former Airman 1st Class went on a low-carb diet, remembering that his drill instructor had forbidden potatoes and bread when an overweight Pippen entered boot camp. He had always loved comfort food -- biscuits and gravy, mashed potatoes, cheeseburgers with fries -- so the switch was difficult at first. But Pippen isn't a man to do things halfway, his wife says. It only took one nicotine patch, and an inspiring self-help book, for Pippen to quit smoking. ""Kevin becomes very focused on whatever he is working on at any one time,"" Susan says. ""I think when Kevin made the decision to get healthy, it made it easier for both of us -- that we both had to make time for exercise, and our eating choices had to be healthier."" The couple started planning their meals and grocery shopping together, trying new foods like kale and spaghetti squash. They even created healthier versions of their old favorites, like pizza. Pippen took group fitness classes at their gym and swam laps on the weekends. He did Zumba and kickboxing and body sculpting and spinning -- basically anything to get moving. ""I love it when I'm with a group of people because it just motivates the crap out of me,"" he says. ""You don't want to be left behind, so it makes you try harder."" In the first year, he lost 117 pounds. Susan worried that once Pippen reached his goal, he would revert to his old habits. He was neglecting his business in his efforts to lose weight; nothing else seemed to matter. ""Once I decide to do something, don't get in my way,"" Pippen says with a laugh. ""It may take me a while to make that decision, but once I do I'm so driven."" Over the next 8 months he lost another 70 pounds. Pippen is now maintaining at 182 pounds. His body fat percentage is approximately 17%. Susan isn't much of a scale person, but she's lost a significant amount of weight as well. She dropped from a size 10 to a size 2, and now wears extra-small shirts. Neither is worried about going back to their old lifestyle; they like the energy these healthy habits have given them too much to quit. Pippen gave up his low-carb diet after the first year and has switched to calorie counting. He tries to eat less than 1,850 a day by making tiny swaps, like using unsweetened almond milk instead of 1%. He notices that people treat him differently now that he's healthy, whether it's at the grocery store or the gym. He feels better and he thinks that self confidence shows. The couple goes to boot camp on Mondays, and takes a spinning class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Pippen does kickboxing on Wednesdays and swims laps on the weekends, while Susan runs on the treadmill. She plans to do a few races next year. ""The hardest part for me is exercising when I don't want to,"" she says. ""The easiest is eating a little chocolate every day without the guilt, and buying new clothes!""","Kevin Pippen lost 188 pounds in two years, cutting his body weight in half .

"(CNN) -- Seamus Heaney, the Irish Nobel laureate who died Friday at 74, will be remembered for his translations, for his literary essays, for his generous international public presence, but principally for the poetry he himself wrote. Though the Heaney of the poems could sound unsettled, or even tormented, he was in person equable, welcoming, generous; these qualities would enter the poetry too. And he will be remembered not for one kind of poetry, but for several: He amazed even attentive admirers as he became, over his long career, in one way the opposite of his early self. His first great poems were tough, inward, tied to the soil; his last, just as Irish, were confident, sometimes gleeful, creatures of air. Heaney began as a poet of earth. Raised in a large farming family in County Derry, Northern Ireland, educated there and in Belfast, he applied his gifts at first to the landscape where he felt at home, a place of village survivals, of un-English place names (""Broagh,"" ""Anahorish"") and eloquent modesty, comparing his poetry to ploughing, to blacksmiths' work. He wrote in ""Bogland"": . Our unfenced country . Is bog that keeps crusting . Between the sights of the sun. ... The ground itself is kind, black butter . Melting and opening underfoot. This kind ground might swallow him up, but it might also provide him with a voice. When parts of that ground became violent, Heaney was there. His time in Belfast as student and teacher encompassed the violent years known as the Troubles, the years of the UVF and the IRA, of bombings at funerals and British troops on the streets; Heaney became a poet of burial sites, of guilt and self-division in terse, halting stanzas. In ""Wintering Out"" (1973) and in ""North"" (1975), he examined the violence directly and by analogy with the Bronze Age corpses that Danish archaeologists exhumed. ""The Grauballe Man,"" he wrote, ""seems to weep/ the black river of himself"" ...""with the actual weight/of each hooded victim,/slashed and dumped."" Those poems made him internationally famous. Had he written nothing else, or nothing as powerful, afterwards, he would be remembered securely as the careful, anguished, self-accusing poet of a divided land. But he went on; he changed. After ""North"" he moved south, to pastoral Glanmore, in the Irish Republic. There, with his wife and three children in suburban Dublin, and at Harvard, where Heaney taught for most of the 1980s and 1990s, he would find new and persuasive ways to write about enduring affection, familial and civic, and about how his own spirit could feel more free. ""Glanmore Sonnets,"" from ""Field Work"" (1979), embodies nostalgia along with a pastoral joy: . ""Vowels ploughed into other: opened ground, . ... Each verse returning like the plough turned round."" (Heaney would use ""Opened Ground"" as the title for his 1998 Collected Poems.) Resistant to dogma yet drawn to the numinous, Heaney depicted himself in Station Island (1983) walking a traditional route of Irish Catholic pilgrimage, meeting ghosts from the Irish literary past. One tells him: . ""we are earthworms of the earth, and all that/ has gone through us is what will be our trace."" Another -- the ghost of James Joyce -- advises him differently: . ""The main thing is to write/ for the joy of it ... It's time to swim/ out on your own and fill the element/ with signatures on your own frequency."" And so he did. Heaney became in his later career a great poet of the spirit lifted, a writer identified with fluency and light, with water and air, as well as with his native ground. One of the twelve-line poems in Seeing Things (1991) remembers the childhood pleasures of wading: . ""Sweet transience. Flirt and splash./ Crumpled flow the sky-dipped willows trailed in."" Another retells the Irish legend of a man who fell out of a magical airborne ship, into a monastery's scriptorium, then climbed back on board, ""Out of the marvelous as he had known it."" Everyday work, even indoor work like writing, could be marvelous too. Heaney recorded these marvels in sheaves of sonnets, in complex old forms such as sestinas, in an iambic pentameter whose confidence buoyed his readers too, even when -- as in his last book, ""District and Circle"" (2006) -- he used those soaring lines to remember dead friends. He became, if book sales are a measure, perhaps the most popular serious poet writing in English anywhere in the world. And he became determinedly international, writing verse parables derived from Eastern Europe, adapting tragic drama from ancient Greece, and translating ""Beowulf"" from the Anglo-Saxon. Yet he remained connected to the particulars of the Irish spaces he knew, to his first friends in poetry (and in folk music), and to his own earlier selves. Later poems (such as ""Glanmore Revisited"") would see how he had, and how he had not, changed, and would see -- in the 1990s and 2000s -- the political change that brought calm, even peace, to the counties of his birth. ""Postscript,"" the last poem in ""Opened Ground,"" begins ""in County Clare along the Flaggy Shore""; but it rises soon enough to a space of permission and imagination, a generous space identified with poetry itself, where ""You are neither here nor there,/ A hurry through which known and strange things pass/ As big soft buffetings come at the car sideways/ And catch the heart off guard and blow it open."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Burt.","Stephen Burt: Seamus Heaney, who died Friday, wrote poetry, literary essays, translations .
His early works were of earth, and of the Troubles; he found fame writing about divided land .
He says later he went south, wrote of civic, family life, dead friends, embraced the numinous .

"(CNN) -- The news about ""Clerks III"" just keeps getting better. Writer and director Kevin Smith recently gave an update on the project while speaking with ""Clerks"" star Jeff Anderson (aka ""Randal"") on his podcast, saying that if all goes well, ""Clerks III"" will have a June start for production. Smith wrapped up the script for ""Clerks III"" last May, but struggled with finding support. After confirming that he nailed down financing earlier this year, Smith said during his podcast that ""there's plans in motion,"" and that Jay (Jason Mewes) and his own Silent Bob will be in the third installment of his 1994 cult classic. ""I don't have the reservations (for 'Clerks III' that ) I had for 'Clerks II,'"" Anderson chimed in. ""Only because the big thing was 'Clerks,' it was the protective nature of that. We've moved past that and fans have moved past that. What 'Clerks II' did was just follow these guys and it was fun to catch up with them. 'Clerks III,' where are they, what are they doing? ... I don't think we have to worry about tainting anything."" Anderson has also read the script, and added that the third ""Clerks"" is a mix of the previous two. ""I like the script; it's being introduced to these characters that are friends. ... (It's) a very different movie and that's what I like about it,"" Anderson said. ""'Clerks' to me was a gritty movie. 'Clerks II' became this brighter movie. 'Clerks III' to me feels somewhere between I and II. It feels a little gritty and we go back to the beginning stages, but we do see the progression."" Smith likes to describe it ""as kind of the 'Empire Strikes Back' of 'Clerks' movies,"" the filmmaker said. ""I can't wait to be on set ... (and) see these dudes for one more time.""","Kevin Smith gives an update on ""Clerks III""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Unlike most twenty somethings starting out in New York City, Zhang Yuzhu is not scrimping to make rent. A graduate student from China, Zhang spends her free time in the city's swankiest department stores buying designer goods. She once blew $45,000 on the coveted Hermes' Birkin that is regarded by some as the ""holy grail"" of handbags. Zhang, however, is not splashing her own cash. She is one of China's growing ranks of ""haiwai daigou,"" or overseas personal shoppers, that source luxury items for customers back home. It's a booming business that was worth 74.4 billion yuan ($12 billion) in 2013, according to the China E-commerce Research Center. ""Usually I can earn $200 to $300 for a Chanel handbag, but I will get more for a Hermes,"" Zhang told CNN. Zhang's customers get designer goods for less than they would at home by circumventing China's steep taxes on luxury items. She says they cost 30% less in the United States. Chinese are the biggest buyers of luxury goods globally, making 29% of all purchases, according to consultants Bain & Company, and these purchases are increasingly being made abroad, mostly by tourists, but also by people like Zhang. Many young Chinese studying in places like New York, London, Paris and Tokyo have started ad hoc businesses, with Bain saying that Chinese luxury sales will become increasingly reliant on this kind of ""parallel trade."" Zhang finds her clients through Chinese social media like WeChat and Weibo, where she posts pictures of the latest items about once a month. Customers then wire the purchase price by bank transfer, including a buyer's commission. Others use the eBay-like site Taobao operated by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Sometimes, Zhang secures her clients an even steeper discount by buying items in Oregon, a sales tax-free U.S. state where she used to live. In a good month, she will buy about six bags from the likes of Chanel, Hermes, Prada, Dior and Bottega Veneta and has made purchases on behalf of about 50 customers. First-name terms . Paris-based Li, who only wanted to give his family name, earns more than $6,000 a month buying luxury items in French stores on behalf of clients back home. An MBA graduate, he has no plans to pursue a different career despite his educational credentials. ""I'm a big fan of luxury products and I think daigou is a much easier job than others,"" he said. However, Li says the business is unstable. Even though he's on first-name terms with sales staff in stores like Hermes he can't get special deals. ""It's Hermes so no-one can get any discount unless you are a super VIP,"" he said. But an anti-corruption campaign launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping that saw Chinese sales of luxury goods slow significantly in 2013 has also hurt his business, said Li. His customers spend less than they used to as flaunting designer watches and extravagant gift giving to officials is now frowned upon. But Chinese wallets are expected to remain the globe's biggest source of spending on designer goods, and, according to Erwan Rambourg, the author of The Bling Dynasty: Why the Reign of Chinese Luxury Shoppers Has Only Just Begun, Chinese consumers will account for one in two purchases by 2025 and most of these will be made abroad. ""Luxury goods help Chinese fit in socially and professionally,"" he said. Smuggling or shopping? With large amounts of money changing hands under the official radar, the trade has also caught the attention of China's customs authorities. From August 1, the General Administration of Customs has stipulated that all individuals engaged in ""cross-border e-commerce"" must provide a list of imported and exported items to customs. ""Those who do not play by the rules will be seen as lawbreakers or even smugglers,"" Lu Zhenwang, chief executive of Shanghai-based e-commerce firm Wanqing Consultancy told The China Daily. ""That's a risk few people would want to take."" However, Zhang and Li both said they had no immediate plans to give up their lucrative sidelines despite the new regulation. ""You can say this is smuggling but you can't prove it. The products were purchased in a legal way,"" said Li. Zhang says she doesn't plan to be a personal shopper forever but it's an easy way for her to earn extra cash at a time when many graduates, even those who studied abroad, struggle to find a job back home. After graduating, she hopes to find a job in television or the movie industry. ""It's a part-time job for me so I can earn some pocket money.""","Personal shoppers helping Chinese get luxury goods for less .

"(CNN) -- For the first time in nearly 40 years, Congress looks poised to limit the powers of the U.S. intelligence community, an opportunity it should seize. When Congress returns from its August recess, surveillance reform will be high on the agenda. In May, the House passed the USA Freedom Act, a measure aimed at ending bulk collection of Americans' phone records under the Patriot Act. And in July, a much stronger version of the bill was introduced in the Senate. The Senate version would curb the most egregious abuses of the telephone metadata program and represents a compromise among the White House, civil liberties advocates and private industry. Yet, important work remains. In particular, the bill doesn't reform NSA surveillance under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Under that program, the NSA collects the content of phone calls, text messages, e-mails and other electronic communications of Americans who are in touch with foreign targets abroad. The problem is bigger than you think. A four-month investigation by The Washington Post into documents leaked by Edward Snowden confirms suspicions long-held by privacy advocates: The intelligence community is engaging in dragnet surveillance of people all over the world and in the process intercepting Americans' international communications without any showing of probable cause. After reviewing a cache of roughly 160,000 e-mail and instant message conversations, the Post determined that roughly 50% of the communications were either to, from or about Americans. The documents, which include health records, academic transcripts and revealing photographs, tell stories of adultery, mental illness, and religious conversion. This raises the question: When did Americans become digital bystanders? The 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act tell part of the story. In its original form, FISA prohibited the government from monitoring the phone calls and other electronic communications of Americans without a targeted order from the newly created intelligence court. The court, in turn, would only issue the order under narrow circumstances: The government had to establish probable cause that the American targeted was a ""foreign power or an agent of a foreign power"" and that each of the facilities and places to be under surveillance was associated with the target. The 2008 FISA amendments, however, upended this equilibrium and drew an arbitrary distinction between Americans' domestic and international communications. The amendments allow the NSA to listen to or read Americans' international communications in the course of targeting one, non-Americans; two, those located outside the United State; and three, those who possess ""foreign intelligence information."" All three conditions must be satisfied, and all three are vague and broad. In determining ""foreignness,"" for example, NSA analysts must have only a reasonable belief that the target is foreign and located abroad. Many have appropriately dubbed this the 51% standard, and indeed some analysts have admitted to signing off on a target simply because their e-mails were written in a foreign language. Although information collected inadvertently must be destroyed under NSA rules and regulations, there's little court oversight over this process. ""Foreign intelligence information,"" meanwhile, is defined so broadly that it includes information relating not just to crime and terrorism but also ""foreign affairs."" This language was introduced in the 2008 amendments for the express purpose of widening collection efforts. Under this approach, the communications of foreign lawyers, journalists and human rights workers can all be captured, including their communications with Americans. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, The Guardian newspaper in Great Britain and Al Jazeera, for example, have reason to be worried, as do people who communicate with them. Communications to or from these institutions could be collected under the guise of ""foreign affairs."" Others should be worried, too. Once the NSA has its database, no law precludes the NSA from searching it for any U.S. name or search term it wants. The FBI and CIA also have access to the NSA repository and engage in ""backdoor searches"" routinely. This dragnet collection violates the human rights of foreigners abroad and the constitutional rights of Americans. Indeed, in 2011, under this sole program alone, the government collected over 250 million Internet communications, not including phone conversations. The Post's investigation suggests that many of these communications reveal private details about Americans' lives. The NSA also misuses the 2008 FISA Amendments. For example, under an absurd reading of the statute, the NSA engages in so-called ""about"" or ""inadvertent"" collection, in which it collects communications that are neither to nor from a foreign target but instead merely mention that name: in other words the data from Americans who are in direct contact with foreign targets can also be collected without a warrant. The story doesn't end there. Other loopholes exist, and so do other surveillance programs. Indeed most of what we know comes from documents leaked by Edward Snowden. But there's much more that simply hasn't been revealed. Most troubling is Executive Order 12333, a 1981 presidential decree that is being used to authorize wide-ranging surveillance programs distinct and separate from the FISA one. Details are still sparse as the executive order isn't subject to court oversight and Congress has refused to intervene. But what we do know is troubling. According to the investigative website The Intercept, leaks tell us the executive order has been used to collect and store every communication coming into or out of the Bahamas as well as another country, whose name has been withheld from publication for national security reasons. And just recently, a person knowledgeable about surveillance under the executive order suggested that the NSA might be using it to create a national e-mail metadata database. Americans deserve better. So does the Constitution. Probable cause, a time-tested safeguard against unreasonable searches and seizures, has been replaced with excessive deference to the intelligence community and obscure agency rules. A robust system of checks and balances, where searches and seizures were approved individually by neutral magistrate judges, has been swapped for general surveillance orders and bulky collection. And sensible targeting criteria, such as information relating to terrorism and crime, has been jettisoned for the amorphous standard of ""foreign affairs."" Secrecy has triumphed over transparency. Indeed we still don't know how many Americans' communications are intercepted or even under what authority. Still, progress may be in sight. In June, the House voted decisively to pass an amendment to an appropriations bill that would prohibit the government from searching the NSA database for U.S. names unless it has reason to believe that they are engaged in wrongdoing. The Senate should follow suit. Protecting Americans from terrorism is undoubtedly a national mandate. But so are fidelity to the Constitution and the human right to privacy.

"(CNN) -- A judge has ordered that accused Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes undergo an additional sanity examination, saying there was good cause to believe previous testing was ""incomplete and inadequate,"" according to a ruling issued Wednesday. Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos Samour Jr. ordered Holmes to undergo an independent exam by the Colorado Mental Health Institute in Pueblo by early March, and the report must be filed by July 14. Samour further ruled the new examiner may not take into account any mitigating factors that are identified in the state's death penalty statutes. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Holmes, who is accused of opening fire in a packed movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a July 2012 midnight showing of the latest Batman installment, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Authorities have said Holmes was dressed head to toe in protective gear. Holmes allegedly threw tear-gas canisters in the theater and then opened fire on the patrons, according to witnesses. Police say he used several weapons, including an AR-15 rifle, before fleeing the theater. Outside the theater, the shooter was apprehended, identifying himself to police as ""The Joker,"" one of Batman's archenemies. Holmes faces 166 charges in the rampage that left 12 people dead and dozens more wounded. Holmes was a neuroscience doctoral student at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus until the month before the attack; prosecutors have argued that he began plotting his attack while still enrolled. The defense, meanwhile, appears to be focused not so much on what Holmes allegedly did that night but his mental state then and earlier. A psychiatrist who treated him had warned campus police at the University of Colorado how dangerous he was, prompting them to deactivate his college ID to prevent him from passing through any locked doors, according to court documents.","District Judge Carlos Samour Jr. ruled James Holmes must undergo a new exam .

Rwanda sent tongues wagging last week when it said visitors from the two western nations will be screened for Ebola. Both countries have had a handful of Ebola cases -- Rwanda has had none. Visitors from the United States or Spain were required to report their medical condition -- regardless of whether they had Ebola symptoms -- for the duration of their visit to Rwanda, the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. It urged citizens to reconsider travel to Rwanda, especially if they had a fever or had visited nations battling the virus. Rwanda's health ministry reversed the mandated screening, and issued an apology this week. ""The ministry of health is removing special screening of travelers from U.S. and Spain,"" said Agnes Binagwaho, Rwanda's minister of health. ""Apologies for any inconveniences caused by my decision."" President Paul Kagame applauded her for reversing ""herself on Ebola decision with respect to some countries."" ""She has sometimes acted first n thought later ... it should be the other way round!"" Kagame tweeted.

"London (CNN) -- ""It's terrifying coming here but we've decided it's just a big pub,"" Damon Albarn tells the audience at a packed Royal Albert Hall, assembled for the Blur and Gorillaz star's first concert in his own right at London's most prestigious music venue. He may be showing false nerves -- over the past 25 years he has developed into one of the most innovative musicians of his generation, has collaborated with the cream of the music world in a bewildering range of genres, and has the experience of headlining the world's biggest music festival, Glastonbury, twice -- but he seems genuinely humbled tonight in such grand Victorian surroundings, paying tribute to this ""ridiculously incredible, spiritual place."" Albarn is showcasing his new album, ""Everyday Robots,"" his first as a solo artist. A more stripped-back work than usual for him, the songs look back on his 46 years. ""Hollow Ponds,"" for instance, recalls various dates that define his life, including the drought of 1976 and the year 1993 when ""Modern Life"" (a reference to Blur's second album) was spray-painted around the city. Reflective though his new solo work is, Albarn is in playful mood and shows his love of performing and collaborating: he willingly shares the limelight with other musicians, such as Mali's Afel Bocoum and Madou Diabete, Blur guitarist Graham Coxon, rappers De La Soul and legendary producer Brian Eno. The concert is about far more than just promoting his new record though: effectively it revisits many of the many musical moments of his long and varied career, from his foray into world music with Africa Express, his animation side-project Gorillaz, supergroup The Good, the Bad and the Queen, and of course his first band, Blur. Despite his comments, Albarn is such a seasoned performer that he's totally at ease in the Albert Hall's vast space. Spontaneous, engaging and funny: holding hands with female members of the audience, singing directly to their faces. At one point he climbs up into the aisles to hug an adoring male fan -- it's a poignant moment. He's a master of pacing: stripped of the machismo of a Blur concert, or the graphical wizardry of Gorillaz, the music is the star. He and his band are superbly tight, as we get one highlight to the next, from ""Kids with Guns,"" and ""Don't Get Lost in Heaven,"" to the spine-tingling experience of Albarn alone at the piano singing Blur's ""Out of Time."" Just when it can get no better, guitarist Coxon bounces onto the stage to join Albarn. The pair, who had a painful estrangement as they battled their demons after the Blur years rollercoaster, roll back the years as they play ""End of the Century,"" accompanied with just a trumpet player. Albarn visibly marvels at Coxon's guitar heroics on ""Tender,"" but acknowledges their split as they struggle to recall which year obscure B-side ""The man who left himself"" was from. ""Ah the late 90s -- our difficult years,"" Albarn half-jokes. As we wipe away the tears of nostalgia, Albarn rallies us again: ""It's pure sing-a-long from now,"" he bellows. The show is building like a cabaret, with quieter moments followed by crowd-pleasing anthems like his solo hit ""Mr. Tembo,"" performed with London's Leytonstone City Mission Choir. Then on come veteran New York hip hop trio De La Soul who tear manically into the Gorillaz hit ""Feel Good Inc,"" swaggering around with dramatic menace, before Kano joins Albarn for a superb, skanking ""Clint Eastwood."" How could he top this? Easy, as Albarn announces -- only half-believing it himself -- the arrival of Brian Eno, the legendary musician, composer and record producer, to sing the wonderful ""Heavy Seas of Love,"" from this year's album, with the Leytonstone choir and Madou. It's an unforgettable experience, as indeed is the whole concert: few others could attract such diverse and entertaining stars to appear for one night; few others have such wonderful songs to perform, and few can engage with an audience like Albarn. No one else can do all three. Albarn no longer needs to be in awe of the musical legends who've performed at the Albert Hall over the decades -- he's now one of them.","Damon Albarn performs at Albert Hall, showcasing solo album ""Everyday Robots""

"(CNN) -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is not ready to admit that Republicans gave Democrats a thumping in last week's midterm elections. ""I do not believe what happened the other night is a wave,"" the California Democrat told Politico in a story published Wednesday. ""There was no wave of approval for the Republicans. I wish them congratulations, they won the election, but there was no wave of approval for anybody. There was an ebbing, an ebb tide, for us."" Republicans have so far expanded their House majority with 10 pick-ups last week, with seven seats still outstanding. Of those seven, two will be decided in Louisiana runoffs next month -- where the GOP is heavily favored -- and the GOP candidate has a narrow lead in three of the other five races. If they win the two runoffs as expected and everyone holds their current leads, then they'll have a net gain of 15 seats, for a total of 249 seats. Asked whether Pelosi is thinking about stepping down as House Democratic leader, she said she is especially needed now. ""Quite frankly, if we would have won, I would have thought about leaving,"" she said. Pelosi was one of the few Democratic leaders holding out hope for her party ahead of the midterms, saying they ""will do OK"" and predicting Democrats would retake control as soon as 2016.

"(CNN) -- The United Nations warned Monday of a possible resurgence of the deadly avian flu virus, saying there are indications a mutant strain may be spreading in Asia. A variant strain of the H5N1 avian influenza virus, which can apparently bypass the defenses of current vaccines with unpredictable risks to humans, has appeared in Vietnam and China, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) stated. Circulation of the virus in Vietnam threatens Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Japan and the Korean peninsula, the FAO said. The most recent death caused by avian flu occurred this month in Cambodia, where eight people have died after becoming infected this year, the organization added. The World Health Organization (WHO) says the virus has infected 565 people since it emerged in 2003, causing 331 deaths. Avian flu has also directly killed or required the culling of over 400 million poultry and caused economic losses estimated at $20 billion before being eliminated from most of the 63 countries infected at its 2006 peak. The virus is still present in China, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt, while areas recently affected include Nepal, Mongolia, Romania, Bulgaria, Israel and the Palestinian Territories. A geographical advance in cases of infected poultry and wild birds since 2008 has apparently been due to the movement of migratory birds, said FAO Chief Veterinary Officer Juan Lubroth. ""Wild birds may introduce the virus, but peoples' actions in poultry production and marketing spread it,"" he said. ""Preparedness and surveillance remain essential,"" he warned.","U.N. warns of possible resurgence of the deadly avian flu virus .

"Washington (CNN) -- Will pot politics push Florida Democrat Charlie Crist to victory on his quest to regain the governor's mansion? That's what some Democrats are hoping. Polls show Crist and his GOP rival, current Gov. Rick Scott, are neck-and-neck. A Quinnipiac University survey released Monday has Crist at 42%, Scott with 41%, Libertarian candidate Adrian Wyllie with 7%, and 9% of likely voters still undecided. Public Policy Polling released Sunday had the Crist and Scott at 44% each. Crist's law partner, John Morgan, spent millions to get an amendment to legalize medical marijuana on the ballot on Tuesday -- a move some say was meant to help Crist win by boosting turnout from Democratic-leaning groups. ""Democrats in Florida privately hope that having a medical marijuana initiative on the ballot can bring out a set of voters who aren't otherwise likely to vote in a midterm election,"" said Reid Wilson, a Washington Post reporter who closely follows state politics. ""It's very political calculation and one that frankly Charlie Crist's allies have put a lot of money into."" In a sign of a growing trend, 23 states and the District of Columbia have already legalized medical marijuana. Florida is not the only state where pot is on the ballot this year -- voters in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C., have a chance on Tuesday to approve measures legalizing recreational use of marijuana, following in the footsteps of pot pioneers Washington and Colorado, where weed has proved to be big business. State records show marijuana sales brought in an average of roughly $332,000 a month to Colorado communities in the first eight months of the year. There has been some big money behind the ballot battle in the Sunshine State. According to the Center for Public Integrity, an estimated $4.7 million has been spent on television ads supporting both sides of the debate. Most of that money -- $3.9 million -- has been spent by opponents of the ballot measure, who are financed in large part by conservative casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. In contrast, after a massive effort to get the measure on the ballot, Morgan and his supporters have spent just $828,800 on television ads urging voters to pass the amendment -- a disadvantage that could prove decisive in a race that will come down to the wire. That means it could be anybody's game. Holder 'cautiously optimistic' on legal pot . ""The campaign against [the amendment] has been pretty aggressive and I think pretty effective based on the polls so there are a lot of people who are now actually kind of mobilizing to vote against medical marijuana initiative, because they think it's just problematic, too many loopholes, too easy for people to basically be selling marijuana out in the open,"" said Adam Smith, the political editor of the Tampa Bay Times. ""So there's at least some speculation that rather than driving young people who are inclined to vote for it to the polls, it's going to motivate people who are against it to turn out which could help Rick Scott. The amendment needs 60% to pass and while many polls show strong support for the initiative, it is not clear that there is enough to pass it -- a sign that Democrats' high hopes the ballot measure could sway the race for their guy could go up in smoke.

"(CNN) -- The 'Chosen One' is back in football. Dumped unceremoniously by English soccer's most successful club Manchester United less than a season into his six-year deal, David Moyes is the new coach at Real Sociedad. The Scot will take the reins at the Spanish club whose defeat of champions Atletico Madrid at the weekend moved it out of the relegation zone courtesy of goal difference. It is Moyes' first job in football since being sacked by United in April. He was hand-picked to take over at Old Trafford by predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson, who retired after 27 years at the club. Despite that backing from Ferguson -- who won 13 Premier League titles and two European Champions League crowns during a trophy-littered spell -- Moyes lasted barely 10 months. Real confirmed the appointment on its official website. A statement read: ""Real Sociedad have reached an agreement with David Moyes who has been appointed coach of the first team until June 30 2016. ""Details about the official presentation of Real Sociedad's new coach and who will form part of his technical team will be published [on Tuesday] morning."" The 51-year-old follows a pair of British managers to have coached Real Sociedad, based in the town of San Sebastian, 14 miles from the border with France on Spain's northern coast. Former Liverpool striker John Toshack, from Wales, had three spells as manager of the club, winning the Copa del Rey in 1987, while Chris Coleman, now in charge of the Welsh national team, had a six-month spell in 2007. While fans and commentators have reacted positively to Moyes' appointment, Spanish football expert Phil Ball thinks it does represent something of a gamble on both sides. ""The local newspaper here is pleased because Moyes has a certain cache but if you look at what he's done since 1993 when he signed as a player for Preston he's moved in the radius of about 60 kilometers,"" Ball, who is based in San Sebastian, told CNN. ""It's not exactly the profile of the international manager is it? I'm not suggesting he's incapable of adapting but there's going to be a period of adapting. The obvious challenge is learning Spanish and also adapting to a new league. ""It's not a gamble in the sense that he's an experienced manager, but it is in the sense that he's what I would call a slightly parochial sort of manager. ""To call a person parochial when they've been in the Premier League for so long is wrong but I just don't think he's ever contemplated going abroad. ""I think it is circumstances that have pushed him to suddenly become a person that who has decided to go abroad. At the age of 51, you're not exactly a young guy going abroad. ""To be fair to him, he's moving out of his comfort zone but he also needs to re-establish his name. Whether Sociedad is the right choice, I don't know."" Dubbed 'The Chosen One' by supporters after his anointing by Ferguson, Moyes moved to United after an 11-year spell with Everton in which he consolidated them as a top-eight Premier League club. He won his first competitive match in charge of United, beating Wigan 2-0 in the Charity Shield that pits the Premier League winners against the FA Cup winners as the traditional curtain raiser to the season. But United were quickly off the pace in the title race and suffered a string of home defeats to mid-table clubs, as well as a derby thumping by Manchester City. After going out of both domestic cup competitions in January, United were dumped out of the Champions League at the quarterfinals stage by then-holders Bayern Munich. Ironically, after a defeat to Everton on his first return as United manager, Moyes was sacked in April, just 10 months after taking charge, with the club lying in seventh place. Ball thinks Moyes' stint at Everton will help his reign at Sociedad, who place a big emphasis on developing local talent through their 'cantera' -- or youth academy. ""Sociedad are sixth in the European league of providing professional players to themselves and any other teams, above Athletic Bilbao and only two places behind Barcelona, which is astonishing,"" he explained. ""Moyes was successful, not on a shoestring -- Everton weren't a poor club but they weren't rich either -- and he was clever in making those medium-guy signings and making them good. ""He's been quite shrewd in the transfer market but I don't think he's drawn particularly from European knowledge. He doesn't really know the market, the league, or the style of play that well. ""A manager of his knowledge and experience obviously knows the basics of what goes on here but it still might be a bit of a shock for him."" One thing Moyes does seem to have grasped is the club's distinct identity. Located in the Basque country, Ball says some associated with Real Sociedad don't even like for it to be known as a Spanish club. It espouses similar values to Athletic Bilbao, located 100km west of San Sebastian, who only select players from the Basque region to represent the club. Though financial constraints prevent Sociedad from adopting a similar policy, according to Ball, in many ways it is more Basque in its approach than Athletic. And, crucially, Moyes seems to have grasped this idea of identity in his dealings with Sociedad president Jokin Aperribay. ""Apparently, Moyes was incredibly detailed in his interview and was interrogating Aperribay, who is more used to interviewing the manager,"" Ball said. ""The president was impressed by that and by the homework Moyes had done. ""Aperribay laid it down and told Moyes he was coming to a very special club with a special identity. He told him it wasn't Spain, it was the Basque country which is different culturally and politically, and a club that doesn't even like to known as Spanish. ""He was impressed by the fact Moyes had realised this, from what I can gather.""","David Moyes appointed manager at Spanish La Liga club Real Sociedad .

"(CNN) -- Almost everything that can be said about Tuesday night's elections has been said, so with some trepidation, a few afterthoughts: . • The verdicts in the 2014 midterm races make it clear that President Barack Obama cannot simply blame Democratic losses on a bad map, as he did Tuesday. (The President passed off the elections as taking place in states least favorable for Democrats ""since Eisenhower."") It should be sobering for the White House that when Obama took office, Democrats had 59 senators and 256 House members; after Tuesday night, they will likely have 45-47 senators and some 190 House members. That is one of the biggest slides in congressional seats of any modern president. Surely, his White House has to take serious responsibility -- and look for ways to leave a better legacy. • This was an unexpectedly big night for the GOP: Predictions for Republicans were already high, but they blew the doors off. Who could have imagined Republicans winning the governorships of Maryland and Massachusetts, winning Senate seats in Obama states such as Colorado and Iowa, and assembling their biggest coalition in the House of Representatives since the 1940s. Conservatives will likely disagree, but one takeaway for Republicans is that they were well served this year by recruiting conservatives whom voters saw as less hard right than the tea party. Look at Cory Gardner of Colorado: The GOP establishment intentionally promoted him as an alternative in Colorado who -- unlike Ken Buck, a tea partyer who lost a few years ago (but won the conservative 4th Congressional District this year) -- would appeal to moderates as well as conservatives. Even The Denver Post endorsed him -- just as The Boston Globe endorsed Republican Charlie Baker, who wrested the Massachusetts State House from Democrats. • A bright spot from Tuesday night that needs more attention: The Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University reports Americans will now have at least 100 women in Congress -- a three-fold increase over 25 years. Women such as Joni Ernst, Shelley Moore Capito and Jeanne Shaheen also won pivotal Senate races. Past experience says that the more women leaders in Congress, the more likely the two sides will find common ground. • Tuesday night also witnessed the election of a fourth generation of the Bush family elected to public office. George P. Bush, the son of Jeb, won statewide office in Texas as land commissioner. His great-grandfather was Prescott Bush, a U.S. senator (and almost Ike's vice presidential running mate); his grandfather was President George H.W. Bush; his father was governor of Florida and his uncle was President. Will his dad now declare his own candidacy for the presidency? Tuesday night's results probably make it more likely. • For this observer, this election night was especially sweet because of the breakthrough victory by a young man I have known and supported for 15 years: Seth Moulton, a Democrat who swept to a double-digit victory as a new congressman from the North Shore of Massachusetts. Seth has three degrees from Harvard and four tours in Iraq as a Marine infantry officer. More than that, he is a model among a rising generation of leaders who I believe can transform our politics. I wrote about him and others of his generation in a recent column on CNN.com. Congratulations, Seth!

"(CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan was determined to find pink Uggs. Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert listened to Dido. Rachel McAdams auditioned for Cady. And Tina Fey took a lot of Winnebago rides to Toronto. It's amazing what the ""Mean Girls"" cast remembered after 10 years. Lohan, Seyfried, Chabert, McAdams and Fey (who also wrote the film) got together for Entertainment Weekly to chat about the 2004 movie and their experiences. (Lizzy Caplan, Daniel Franzese, Jonathan Bennett and Amy Poehler didn't participate.) Fey said that the group all stayed at the same hotel in Toronto, where the movie was shot. It allowed for bonding, but for the writer and actress, there were also some drawbacks. ""The fire alarm would go off pretty much every night at some point -- it was just a flaw of the hotel,"" she recalled. ""At the time I was coming back and forth from ('Saturday Night Live') a lot from New York. I don't remember if I was weird about flying or if it was the timing, but sometimes I would go do 'SNL,' then I would get in a Winnebago at two in the morning and be driven to Toronto. It's so stupid."" But the members of the Plastics -- the group of girls played by McAdams, Chabert and Seyfried -- had a good time. ""Amanda and I became very close very quickly,"" said Chabert, who turned 21 during filming and hosted a dinner for Canadian Thanksgiving. Chabert was obviously a good cook. ""Lacey taught me how to make pecan pie. She made my experience so magical and so safe for me,"" said Seyfried. And what of Lohan? She originally wanted to be the queen of mean, Regina, but finally gave in to director Mark Waters' insistence that she should play Cady. The pink Uggs were part of her Method process, she laughed. Oh, there was also the Chihauhua attacking Poehler's breast. The bit was done by placing a cocktail weiner in Poehler's bra, McAdams recalled. ""She's trying to do her lines and being so professional, and this dog is chomping on her fake boob. I'll never forget that,"" she said. However, though they have fond memories of the film, they're still perplexed when people recite its very quotable lines back to them. What makes a movie quote so quotable? McAdams was recently staying in Ireland when a fan asked her to say some of her favorites. ""I couldn't think of any of them!"" she said. It worked out OK. ""She literally fed me all these lines,"" McAdams said, ""Like: 'Is butter a carb?' ""","""Mean Girls"" is 10 years old this year .

"El Corpus, Honduras (CNN) -- Three of 11 miners who were trapped in a Honduran gold mine this week were rescued Friday morning, freed nearly two days after a landslide blocked their path out. After rescuers brought the three out of the mine near the town of El Corpus, live footage shown on Honduran network Televicentro showed ambulances driving them away. Scores of Red Cross volunteers, firefighters and others have been trying to free the miners since a landslide blocked a tunnel late Wednesday, El Corpus Mayor Luis Rueda said. Information on the conditions of the three freed miners and the eight who remained in the mine wasn't immediately available. The miners freed Friday had long been in contact with rescuers, who were able to give them water early in the rescue effort, the Red Cross said. Before the rescue, Rueda told CNN that efforts to reach the miners were progressing ""slowly and with difficulty,"" in part because there were risks of another landslide. Fire department spokesman Oscar Triminio also told reporters that rescuers were not using heavy machinery, because the mine was unstable. Arrests in deadly Turkish mine fire .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Coast Guard and the Jamaica Defence Force suspended their searches Sunday for signs of a prominent New York couple whose plane crashed in the Caribbean Sea north of Jamaica. ""The Coast Guard suspends a search and rescue case with extremely great care and deliberation,"" Capt. Todd M. Coggeshall, chief of response management for the Coast Guard, said in a news release. ""After a search area is saturated several times with a maximum number of assets, resources and crew effort, and persons in distress are still not located, a decision is made to suspend a case."" Jamaica suspended its search because of bad weather, said Capt. Basil Jarett of the Jamaica Defence Force. The Coast Guard said a C-130 aircraft located several small objects in the water. The crew used smoke flares and two data marker buoys to mark the location for Coast Guard and Jamaican Defense Force boat crews, the Coast Guard said, but none of the searchers could relocate the objects on Saturday. Jamaica had said one of its military search team spotted the objects. The single-engine TBM-900 aircraft, owned by estate developer Larry Glazer and his wife, Jane, crashed into the Caribbean hours after the pilot told an air traffic controller that something was wrong as it flew south over the eastern United States. Couple who went down in plane helped reshape a city . The plane's radio was silent for hours after the pilot's call, prompting U.S. and Cuban military jets to trail the small private plane. The North American Aerospace Defense Command said those aboard might have suffered from hypoxia, which sets in when oxygen is lacking. There were conflicting reports on how many people were on the plane, with the U.S. Coast Guard indicating there were three. But relatives said the couple were the only two people on board and were headed from Rochester, New York, to their vacation home in Naples, Florida. Those aboard were unresponsive for more than four hours, drifting southward over the U.S. mainland, the Atlantic Ocean and eventually into the Caribbean. Plane crash: What happened? Pilot seen slumped over . U.S. fighter jet pilots said when they looked into the aircraft, they saw the pilot slumped over and the windows frosted. The plane's radio communication ended about 10 a.m. ET Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration said. At that time, it was above Statesville, North Carolina, about 600 miles south of the Rochester airport, which it left around 8:45 a.m. The pilot asked to descend to 18,000 feet because ""we have an indication that is not correct in the plane,"" according to a stream of that transmission posted on LiveATC.net, which provides live air traffic control broadcasts. The air traffic controller told the pilot to ""stand by"" and proceed to 25,000 feet as he worked on clearing the plane to go lower. The conversation continued off and on for more than four minutes, though it was largely one-sided: The pilot wasn't clear in his remarks and didn't declare any sort of emergency. At one point, he simply repeated his call sign twice when the controller asked if he heard the request to drop down to 20,000 feet. Data indicate the plane didn't descend. It cruised for hours about 25,000 feet above the ground. The private plane dropped off radar at 2:11 p.m., according to the flight tracking site FlightAware.com. Estimates suggested the fuel would have run out at 2:15 p.m. It crashed 14 miles off Jamaica's northeast coast. Fate of couple unknown . Jamaica and the United States swiftly dispatched government aircraft to the scene. Jamaican authorities said they found an oil slick in the prime search area. The Coast Guard said search crews completed 12 search patterns covering about 3,750 square miles over 70 hours. As they searched, the Glazer family in Rochester mourned. The couple have three children. The children said in a statement they were ""devastated by the tragic and sudden loss of our parents."" They said they are waiting for answers. Larry Glazer co-founded Buckingham Properties in 1970 after graduating from Columbia University. The company owns and manages more than 50 properties in the greater Rochester area, according to his official bio. The TBM-900 plane was owned by the company. Jane Glazer founded QCI Direct, a 100-employee company that has an outlet store, according to its website. Both Glazers knew how to fly. U.S., Cuban fighter jets trail aircraft . The government stepped in when the plane lost communications with air traffic control. NORAD dispatched two F-16 fighter jets from a base in Richland County, South Carolina. Another pair of fighter jets from Homestead, Florida, took over around 11:30 a.m. and escorted the plane past the U.S. mainland. The American fighter jets broke off their pursuit 12 miles off Cuba, at which point a Cuban fighter jet took over. Despite the longstanding tensions between the two countries, Cuba cooperated with the United States and did not consider the plane's movement a violation of its airspace. Cuba let the U.S. Coast Guard aircraft go through its airspace and gave permission for American ""military aircraft, if necessary,"" according to an official statement.

"Washington (CNN) -- A key Republican senator chastised his House GOP colleagues Sunday for failing to pass a comprehensive immigration bill. ""Shame on us as Republicans,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told CNN's Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger on ""State of the Union."" ""Shame on us as Republicans for having a body that cannot generate a solution to an issue"" involving national security as well as cultural and economic considerations. ""The Senate has done this three times,"" Graham said. ""I'm close to the people in the House, but I'm disappointed in my party. Are we still the party of self-deportation? Is it the position of the Republican Party that the 11 million must be driven out? I have never been in that camp as being practical. I am in the camp of securing our borders first, fixing a broken legal immigration,"" said Graham, one of the Republican senators who pushed a bipartisan bill to passage there in 2013, but on which the House never voted. That bill included legal status for the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States and tougher enforcement measures. Graham, though supportive of an immigration overhaul, criticized President Barack Obama for taking executive action that could allow almost 5 million undocumented immigrants to avoid deportation and grant many of them work permits. He said he agrees with many of his fellow Republican lawmakers who have called the President's action unconstitutional. ""It's one thing to say, as an executive agency, I don't have the money to prosecute everybody or to deport everybody, so I'm going to rank them in order. It's another for the President of the United States to say, not only will I decide not to prosecute a group of people, but I will affirmatively give you legal status ... that is well beyond executive action."" While some in the GOP have called for possibly impeaching the President for his immigration action, Graham said he's not among them. ""I'm not going to go down the road of impeaching the President. And let me tell you why. Immigration has been dogging the country since 2006. The President is frustrated. I have a solution that I have been supporting that is comprehensive, that would allow legal status to the people in question. ""But you do it through a congressional action, where you get the entire system fixed. His action does not secure the border. It doesn't fix a broken legal immigration system. And it leaves millions of people left out in terms of the 11 million. "" Obama, meanwhile, defended his decision, pointing out that his predecessors have taken such actions. ""Congress has a responsibility to deal with these issues, and there are some things that I can't do on my own,"" the President told ABC's ""This Week"" in a taped interview. ""What I do have is the legal authority to try to make the system better. Given the resource constraints that we have, we have to prioritize."" Obama answered his critics who pointed out he had previously said he was limited in how much he could do saying earlier ""I am president. I am not king. I can't do these things just by myself."" ""What is absolutely true is that we couldn't solve the entire problem and still can't solve the entire problem,"" Obama told ABC. ""But what we can do is prioritize felons, criminals, recent arrivals, folks who are coming right at the border and acknowledge that if somebody's been there for over five years -- they may have an American child or a legal permanent resident child -- it doesn't make sense for us to prioritize them when we know that we need more resources."" He also disputed his critics who have called him an imperial president. ""If you look -- the history is that I have issued fewer executive actions that most of my predecessors by a long shot,"" he told ABC. ""The difference is the response and specifically the response of some of the Republicans. But if you ask historians, take a look at the track records of the modern presidency, I've actually been very restrained, and I've been very restrained with respect to immigration. I bent over backwards and will continue to do everything I can to get Congress to work because that's my preference."" Republicans hammer legal case against Obama on immigration .","Sen.

"(CNN) -- Geddy Kramer said he suffered from mental instability, frustration and depression. But as the 19-year-old embarked on a planned massacre at a FedEx facility north of Atlanta, he expressed no sadness, no regrets. ""I'm in my happy place,"" Kramer wrote. ""I'm in my happy place. I'm in my happy place."" These and other jarring statements attributed to Kramer, and released Friday to CNN, do not offer a specific reason why Kramer shot and wounded six people late last month at a FedEx package and delivery facility in Kennesaw, before turning a gun on himself. They do, however, help paint a picture of a man who felt isolated, did drugs and had mental issues. The violent outburst wasn't the result of a sudden decision, he explained, but ""more of a several-month snap."" ""This wasn't the result of media brainwashing and subliminal messages,"" Kramer said. ""This is my own doing. I'm a sociopath. I want to hurt people."" The Cobb County Police Department released the shooter's apparent thoughts in the form of a pair of brief handwritten notes. One labeled ""final requests"" was found in Kramer's vehicle outside the FedEx facility, and the other is a three-page note titled ""My final thoughts on paper"" that was in his house in nearby Acworth. Shortly before 6 a.m. on April 29, Kramer entered the 500,000-square-foot facility and began shooting, according to police. Authorities fielded ""numerous"" 911 calls in the immediate aftermath, according to Cobb County Police Sgt. Dana Pierce, until Kramer apparently killed himself. In the message later found in his car, Kramer said that his ""first choice for my massacre would start with anyone who sold me drugs and a few others."" He added that he'd tried ""to get help from ...a therapist, but I've also medicated with several types of drugs, most of which were illegal."" Kramer insists that no music or video games spurred his attack, saying without elaborating that ""this was personally and, I guess, to a small extent politically motivated."" ""I'm not sad or sorry for the misery I've caused,"" he wrote. Family is 'shocked and devastated'","Police in Georgia release two notes they say are from 19-year-old Geddy Kramer .

"(CNN) -- No sooner had Luis Suarez appeared to have taken a 'bite' out of Giorgio Chiellini's shoulder, social media was already sinking its teeth into the Uruguay striker. Suarez, who has previously been banned twice for biting, was accused by Italy's Chiellini of trying to have a quick nibble during the final stages of Uruguay's 1-0 World Cup victory. ""Suarez is a sneak and he gets away with it because FIFA want their stars to play in the World Cup,"" Chiellini told Sky Sports Italia after the incident. While the referee may not have witnessed the incident, millions across the world soon weighed in with their own opinions on the matter. The 27-year-old Liverpool forward might be left chewing over this one for quite a while given the volume of online activity. Suarez was banned for 10 games in April 2013 after being found guilty of biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. He was also guilty of biting during his time in the Netherlands with Ajax where he was banned for seven games after leaving a scar on the collarbone of Otman Bakkal. And Twitter users were quick to remind him of his former transgressions with even Major League Baseball getting involved. While most of the comments on Twitter criticized Suarez's actions, some took the opportunity to offer the forward the opportunity to dine out on his latest antics. McDonalds in his home country offered him a meal while he can always visit his local Nando's in Liverpool upon his return to England if he's short of a mouthful. There was also a word for Suarez from someone who knows exactly what its like to have their ear bitten off -- literally. Evander Holyfield, the retired former heavyweight boxer once had part of his ear bitten off by opponent Mike Tyson during a fight in 1997. And he was quick to throw a jab Suarez's way on Twitter.

"New York (CNN) -- Fliers with the names of four alleged campus ""rapists"" are being circulated at New York's Columbia University in an apparent vigilante effort to warn women of potential sexual assaults. One flier obtained by CNN has the names of the alleged offenders under the heading ""Rapists on Campus."" Three of the names include the claim that the men were found ""responsible"" for sexual assaults by the university. A fourth name is identified as a ""serial rapist."" In a statement, an independent, student-run online news site said it demanded that a staff member named on the list ""permanently and immediately resign from their position."" ""Our decision does not reflect a position on the innocence or guilt of this former staff member, nor does it comment on, take a position on, support, implicitly or explicitly, any allegations of fact or law made against such person,"" the statement said. It's not known who is behind the campaign, which has generated both support and outrage around campus. The university declined to comment on the fliers. ""It's not like this was a fun thing to do for whoever wrote it, I'm sure,"" Columbia sophomore Cami Quarta, who said she's a sexual assault survivor, told CNN affiliate WPIX. Normally, CNN does not name sexual assault victims but did in this case after Quarta's on-camera interview. ""Honestly, it was a last resort, just out of desperation."" Earlier this month, 23 students filed a federal complaint against Columbia University, alleging the school failed to protect victims of sexual assault, according to a statement from the students. The complaint alleges the Ivy League university discouraged students from reporting sexual assaults, allowed perpetrators to remain on campus, sanctioned inadequate disciplinary actions for perpetrators and discriminated against students based on their sexual orientation, according to a statement from the students, who are calling themselves Our Stories CU. The complaint was filed with the U.S. Department of Education, alleging violations of Title II, Title IX and the Clery Act by Columbia and Barnard College, the affiliated women's school. In a statement, the university declined to comment on the allegations but said it had taken ""a series of significant new measures dedicated to preventing such sexual misconduct."" Some students have praised the distribution of the fliers as a ""vigilante"" effort aimed at protecting women; others have taken to social media to call it a ""witch hunt."" One student who said she was the victim of a sexual assault on campus told CNN that the campaign appeared to be created ""to warn other girls at school that these men are still enrolled and pose a threat to their safety."" The student, a senior at Columbia, asked that her name not be used. Emil Ostrovski, a graduate student in creative writing, said he understood the rationale for the list. ""On the other hand, it's a very serious thing to accuse someone of and can have serious repercussions for that person,"" he said. ""I feel uncomfortable about people making accusations with impunity."" Amy, another Columbia graduate student in creative writing, said the list includes some ""big names"" on campus. ""I don't think it's anybody's right to put information in the world that hasn't been proven,"" said Amy, who asked that her last name not be used. She added, ""If somebody were angry at someone else or feeling vindictive, they could put someone's name on the list."" According to New York Police Det. Marc Nell, none of the four names on the fliers appear in a 2014 database as being involved in any criminal activity. Columbia University declined to comment directly on the fliers but issued a general statement: ""To avoid chilling complainants from coming forward and to respect all parties involved, the University does not comment on the particulars of disciplinary proceedings regarding sexual misconduct. In addition, the University is mindful of the multiple federal laws that govern these matters and provide important protections to survivors of sexual violence and to students engaged in our investigative process. These laws and our constitutional values do not permit us to silence debate on the difficult issues being discussed."" The author of the fliers added a line at the bottom saying, ""To the Columbia Community: Stay safe, protect and support each other and always, always, make sure to have sober, enthusiastic, continuous consent."" The names of four students were first discovered by university officials scribbled on the wall of a women's bathroom in Columbia's Hamilton Hall on March 7, according to Columbia officials. Those names were promptly removed by the janitorial staff. White House issues guidelines to colleges to combat rape . 55 colleges under investigation over handling of sexual violence complaints .

"(CNN) -- At least 17 people were killed when a ship carrying migrants sank Monday about 100 miles off southern Italy, the Italian navy said Tuesday. Just over 200 other people who'd been on the ship were rescued, the navy said. The incident came a day after a boat carrying illegal migrants sank off the coast of Tripoli, Libya, killing at least 40 people, according to an account from Libya's Interior Ministry. Southern Italy -- especially tiny Lampedusa, which is the closest Italian island to Africa -- is a frequent destination for refugees seeking to enter European Union countries from Africa. Migrants often pack into unseaworthy and ill-equipped boats, and shipwrecks off Italian shores are common. The Italian military has rescued about 2,000 migrants in the last five days alone, Italy's navy said Monday, highlighting the difficulty in keeping up with the flow of migrants seeking to reach European soil. Tens of thousands of people are rescued from the Mediterranean Sea each year, according to the European Union border agency, Frontex. The U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, expressed its dismay Tuesday over the rising number of migrants dying as they try to make the perilous crossing. UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards told reporters that those who lost their lives Monday include 12 women, three children and two men. In addition, 121 people are believed to have died in three separate boat accidents off the Libyan coast over the past two weeks, he said. Some of the 53 survivors of a shipwreck off Libya on May 6 told the UNHCR that the smugglers pushed them onto the boat and set off even though the boat was damaged in the middle, Edwards said. It's believed 77 people drowned in that incident. The deaths of more than 300 African migrants in a shipwreck off Lampedusa last October shocked Italy and the world, and led to calls for EU lawmakers to review their migration policies. A rescue operation established by the Italian government after that tragedy saved more than 20,000 people at sea through early April, the United Nations refugee agency said. Nearly 43,000 migrants arrived in Italy by sea in 2013, according to the agency. Many of the migrants are from African nations, while others have fled war-torn Syria. The UNHCR believes more than 170 migrants have died at sea trying to reach Europe so far this year. It praised rescue efforts by the Italian and Libyan authorities, as well as private boats, but said more still needs to be done. ""We also urge governments around the world to provide legal alternatives to dangerous sea journeys, ensuring desperate people in need of refuge can seek and find protection and asylum,"" the agency said. ""These alternatives could include resettlement, humanitarian admission, and facilitated access to family reunification."" Migrants appear undeterred, even after deadly shipwrecks .

"(CNN) -- It is by no accident that the AIDS Memorial Quilt -- which now measures more than 50 miles laid side by side and weighs 54 tons -- is gracing the National Mall in Washington this weekend as the global HIV and AIDS community gathers nearby for the XIX International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2012). As scientists, doctors, and program experts articulate a new and hopeful AIDS narrative at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, the Quilt will serve as a not-so-gentle reminder that this devastating disease continues to claim the lives of too many, too soon. The Quilt lends voice and volume to the nearly 94,000 individuals whose names are lovingly sewn into panels by more than 100,000 friends and family members -- and symbolically to the 1.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS in this country alone. Due to its vastness, The Quilt blankets the national capital region, with sections of the tapestry on display in 50 other host venues throughout the area. Today, worldwide, more than 34 million people now live with HIV/AIDS, and 3.4 million of them are under the age of 15. Every day more than 7,000 people contract HIVâ€”nearly 300 every hour. The global numbers are staggering, but so are some of the numbers in the hardest-hit cities in this country. Indeed, recent research shows some U.S. cities have HIV rates that rival Africa in their magnitude. Opinion: End the HIV stigma . Yet behind the cold statistics, there are faces and stories with legacies. The faces on the Quilt are our fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters. They are our aunts and uncles, grandparents, daughters, sons, neighbors, our doctors and ministers, our best friends, and co-workers. And, after the tears that are shed for them subside, they are celebrated with lace and mink and bubble wrap...with pearls and buttons, and their favorite T-shirt or logo stitched into the 3-by-6-foot panels, roughly the size of a human grave. These are the stories and lives that together make up the world's largest living work of folk art. Throughout its 25-year history, this masterpiece created ""by the people, for the people"" has been used to fight prejudice, and to raise awareness and funding for direct service and advocacy groups. The Quilt is a catalyst and conduit, a tool for healing and grief therapy, a springboard for frank dialogue, both civic and private. It gives voice to far too many lives lost, telling us that never again should we ever leave a community in need and dying, ignored and uncared for. It is a stark reminder that we can never forget that we are all inextricably linked in life. In America: A quilt displays an American tragedy . More than 20 million individuals around the world have attended displays and witnessed the extraordinary power, beauty, love, rage and sorrow of this multitude of voices. The Quilt's powerful lessons and poignant imagery provide compelling evidence that HIV/AIDS can happen to anyone, anywhere, at any age. What started out as an activist action has become a powerful voice with artistic and cultural expression, now considered an American Treasure by an act of Congress. It is indeed difficult to walk away from the Quilt, whether a single panel, a block, or miles of expressions of love on material, unmoved. And yet, unfortunately, almost every day, a new panel arrives at the NAMES Project Foundation, which curates, cares for and manages the Quilt. Each new panel is then added to the Quilt and helps to advance the cause of human rights and social justice. In 1988, a lone panel was delivered quietly to the NAMES Project in Atlanta. Unlike any other panel among the tens of thousands of panels made at that time, this special panel arrived simply with a handwritten note that read: ""I hope this quilt will find a permanent place and help mark the end of this devastating disease."" The panel itself was stark in design, white letters on a black background, simply saying ""The Last One."" In the decades since this panel was left on our doorstep, we have held on to it with hopeful anticipation that we would one day reach ""The Last One."" We unveiled this panel publicly for the first time on the National Mall during our opening ceremony Saturday. (It will remain on display until Wednesday.) We did so with heavy hearts, with hopeful hearts, but we still can't yet stitch it into the Quilt. Not until we see the last new infection, the last AIDS case, the last death from AIDS, the last one left orphaned, the last person to face discrimination for living with HIV. In the meantime, as AIDS 2012 goes about its mission to push the boundaries of science and medicine to find an end to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, we will continue to preserve, care for, and use the AIDS Memorial Quilt to foster healing, to be a bully pulpit for social justice and, most important, to inspire action in the age of AIDS and beyond. Everyone can help us live to honor ""The Last One."" Educate, help prevent infection, be an advocate, volunteer in the many communities around the country who host displays, donate to keep hope alive. Only then will we know our work -- like the work of our scientists and researchers the world over -- by our artists and advocates, communities and corporate partners, friends and family members was not in vain. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julie Rhoad.","The AIDS Memorial Quilt is on display this weekend in the National Mall .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two years after his death, music legend and celebrity icon Michael Jackson's legacy remains clouded by the debate over how he died and who, if anyone, is to blame. A Los Angeles coroner ruled that a surgical anesthetic called Propofol killed the then 50-year-old Jackson, in combination with several sedatives found in his blood, on June 25, 2009. Ever since, there have been ongoing efforts -- from awards to statues to new songs -- to keep his memory, and music, alive. Still, much of the talk about one of the world's most celebrated singers has occurred in courtrooms, centered around a host of cases related to his untimely death. Authorities claim that his personal doctor, Conrad Murray, administered the fatal dose. He has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the singer's death. The doctor's defense attorney, Ed Chernoff, contends Jackson was ""a desperate man in many respects"" and gave himself the fatal dose of surgical anesthesia while the doctor was not watching. One of Michael's sisters, LaToya Jackson, told CNN's Piers Morgan this week that her brother ""told me that they were going to murder him"" -- identifying ""they"" only as ""the people involved in his life, the people that were controlling him."" The late singer's father, Joe Jackson, also fingered unidentified individuals in an interview with CNN on Saturday. ""We're striving for justice, because there's more to it than they're claiming,"" said Joe Jackson, who has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Murray and also said he's still fighting over who controls his son's estate. ""There is somebody else involved."" The singer's mother, Katherine Jackson, has filed a lawsuit accusing AEG Live of causing her son's death by pushing him to rehearse for his comeback concerts despite poor health. In the suit, she described Jackson in his last months as ""confused, easily frightened, unable to remember, obsessive, and disoriented."" Yet for all the legal entanglements, the last 24 months has also been marked by numerous attempts to celebrate, give new life to and capitalize on the singer's historic career. According to Forbes, Jackson's estate brought in a whopping $275 million between October 2009 and 2010. The singer's good fortune is due in large part to licensing deals cut by executors of his estate, a surge in sales of his music catalog and the $250 million box office of the Sony Pictures film, ""This Is It."" That documentary, focused on the singer's preparations for his world tour, came out within months of his death. Sony was under a contractual obligation with Jackson's estate to not use anything that showed the icon in ""a negative light"" -- though Pastor ruled that additional, raw footage could be used in Murray's upcoming trial. In a rare public appearance, two of Jackson's three surviving children -- Prince Michael and Paris -- appeared in January 2010 at the Grammy Awards to help accept a Lifetime Achievement Award on their father's behalf. The singer's music and dance also inspired a Cirque du Soleil show, ""Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour."" And for months, there's also been talk about a full-length album entitled ""Michael,"" featuring 10 songs and collaborations with rapper 50 Cent and rocker Lenny Kravitz -- including a duet with Akon that was released online last November. But not all such Jackson-related efforts have been directly tied to his music. Mohammed Al Fayed, for instance, helped erect a statue of Jackson to stand outside the stadium of English Premier League football club Fulham, which he owns. The Egyptian-born businessman, who had owned Harrods department store and was a friend of the singer, told fans -- some bemused and others questioning the statue's relevance -- they can ""go to hell"" if they object. Also in England (but not the United States), the Discovery Channel planned to broadcast a special early this year featuring a re-enactment of Jackson's autopsy. But the program, ""Michael Jackson's Autopsy: What Really Killed Michael Jackson,"" was dropped before airing after repeated complaints. Investor Reginald Garcia said this spring that he will use cash from the sale of 130 unpublished photos he had taken of a then-19-year-old Jackson to fund testing of a motor that he claims generates more electricity than it uses. And this weekend, the King of Pop's signature red and black jacket with ""winged shoulders,"" which he wore during the filming of the iconic ""Thriller"" music video, was one of several pieces of music memorabilia up for sale at a California auction. In his interview Saturday with CNN, Joe Jackson touted his plan to further develop his son's dream and build amusement parks -- called ""Happyland"" -- around the world. (In the same interview, he also publicized his new ""Jackson"" cologne and vodka, called ""Vodka Precious."") ""I'm grieving over Michael,"" the late singer's father said. ""It's going to take me a long time to get over what happened to him."" Katherine Jackson told CNN this past spring that she struggles each day without Michael, even as she cares for his children, whom she has legal custody over. ""There's not a day that passes I don't think about my child, and he should be here right now,"" his mother said.","Michael Jackson died June 25, 2009, of a drug overdose .

"(CNN) -- The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups has taken a new twist as football's world governing body FIFA lodged a criminal complaint with the Swiss judiciary Tuesday. The complaint relates to the ""international transfers of assets with connections to Switzerland, which merit examination by the criminal prosecution authorities."" The FIFA statement added: ""The subject of the criminal complaint is the possible misconduct of individual persons in connection with the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup."" FIFA lodged the complaint with the Attorney General of Switzerland in Berne on the recommendation of German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert -- FIFA's independent ethics adjudicator. ""I lodged the criminal complaint upon the recommendation of Judge Eckert,"" FIFA president Sepp Blatter said. ""I cannot, however, comment on any possible criminal offenses. I am not a lawyer. ""I also was not the addressee of the investigatory report, which I have never seen. However, given Judge Eckert's recommendation, it was my duty -- as the President of FIFA -- to lodge the complaint."" Eckert's recommendation was based on the evidence compiled by Michael Garcia -- chairman of the investigatory chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee -- who has been examining the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. However Blatter insisted there was no change to Eckert's statement ""that the investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups is concluded."" Eckert, who is set to meet with Garcia on Thursday to discuss the report, says he came across ""indications that pointed to suspected unlawful activity in connection with Switzerland."" He told FIFA's website: ""In the circumstances, I saw it as my duty to bring this to the FIFA President's attention and to recommend to him that the Swiss criminal prosecution authorities be informed."" Eckert has been heavily criticized since publishing his 42-page summary into Garcia's 18-month investigation last Friday. The German told reporters last week that he had been surprised by the strength of bad feeling surrounding his summary. ""I would like to point out that not once did my statement involve a so-called ""whitewashing"" of the award process with regard to the various allegations and assumptions made, contrary to what has been claimed in some quarters,"" he said. ""My statement was based on the Garcia report -- I can only work with the material contained in it, and in my view, there was insufficient clear evidence of illegal or irregular conduct that would call into question the integrity of the award process as a whole. ""However, in certain places, the report does indicate that further clarification is needed of certain circumstances. Much of this clarification work can be carried out by the FIFA Ethics Committee itself, while the remainder is the responsibility of the relevant national investigatory authorities."" With Garcia and Eckert set to discuss their differences over the summary on Thursday, Kevin Carpenter, who specializes in sports law for Kevin Hill Dickinson LLP, raised questions over the timing of the announcement. ""It's interesting that Garcia said his report had been misrepresented, yet Eckert decides to take evidence to the Swiss judiciary now,"" he told CNN. ""Why lodge the criminal complaint given they are meeting later this week?"" Carpenter also believes that Garcia, who has appealed to FIFA's appeal committee over the findings in Eckert's summary, could take his complaints further. ""Michael Garcia has referred the matter to the appeals committee, but if his complaint is rejected he could then go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is extremely thorough and can look at all the evidence. ""CAS' decision and reasoning would be made public. Names would have to be redacted but it would be a way for the bulk of his report -- the sections he believes to be most important coming into the public domain.""","FIFA launches criminal complaint .

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez has been hit with a 10-game ban for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. The Liverpool striker was found guilty by the English Football Association Wednesday following the incident which occurred during his side's 2-2 draw with Chelsea last Sunday. An FA statement read: ""A three-person Independent Regulatory Commission today upheld the FA's claim that a suspension of three matches was clearly insufficient and the player will serve a further seven first-team matches in addition to the standard three. The suspension begins with immediate effect. ""The Liverpool forward had accepted a charge of violent conduct but had denied the FA's claim that the standard three-match sanction was insufficient for the offense. ""The incident was not seen by the match officials and has therefore been retrospectively reviewed. ""Suarez has until midday on Friday, 26 April to appeal the additional suspension, above the standard three matches."" Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre was unhappy with the severity of the verdict. He told the club's official site: ""Both the club and player are shocked and disappointed at the severity of today's Independent Regulatory Commission decision. ""We await the written reasons tomorrow before making any further comment."" Suarez, 26, had apologized for his actions and was heavily fined by Liverpool. ""I've spoken to Ivanovic on the phone so I could apologize directly to him,"" he tweeted. ""Thanks for accepting."" He added: ""For my unacceptable behavior the club has fined me. ""I have asked the club to donate the money to the Hillsborough Family Support Group for the inconvenience I have created to the Liverpool fans and to Ivanovic."" It would appear that Suarez's past record has been taken into account by the FA. The Uruguay striker was given an eight-match ban and a $63,000 fine back in 2011 after being found guilty by the FA of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra. Suarez also courted controversy in Holland while at Ajax where he was banned for seven games after biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal's shoulder during a match in November 2010. The Uruguay star, who has scored 23 goals in the English Premier League, has even drawn criticism from British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""It is rightly a matter for the football authorities to consider,"" a Downing Street spokesman said. ""As part of their consideration, I think it would be very understandable if they took into account the fact that high-profile players are often role models."" Suarez's ban is by no means the most severe handed out by the FA. In 1998, current Sunderland manager Paolo Di Canio was banned for 11 games after pushing a referee while playing for Sheffield Wednesday. In 2003, Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand was suspended for eight months after missing a drugs test. Another Manchester United star, Eric Cantona, was banned for nine months after launching a kung-fu style kick at a supporter during a game at Crystal Palace in 1995. Former Australia goalkeeper Mark Bosnich was also punished with a nine-month suspension after testing positive for cocaine in 2003.","Liverpool striker Luis Suarez hit with 10-game ban by English Football Association .

"(CNN) -- Are you missing a beloved four-legged friend from the past? Or, on a far sillier note, would you like your very own Grumpy Cat or Doge? A new app aims to help you find a lookalike for your departed or dream pet by using photo-matching software to find the closest match in your area. PetMatch lets you upload a picture of a dog or cat, or use one from its gallery. It then tries to find you a pet available for adoption that is the closest possible match to the one you posted. The app is from startup Superfish and uses its patented image-recognition technology. It scans your photo, registering details like the shape of an animal's mouth, the distance between its eyes, its coloring and its general size and shape. It then performs a similar search on PetFinder, a database with photos of hundreds of thousands of animals up for adoption throughout the United States, and gives you the closest overall matches, as well as the closest ones in your area. Of course, it's not perfect. If the picture you upload shows an animal at an odd angle, is blurry or otherwise differs from typical shots by animal-rescue groups, there's no telling what it will return for you. (Tech-news site The Verge claims a photo of Lady Gaga produced a ""matching"" image of a hamster.) The app also doesn't necessarily consider the breed of the animal you photograph, if that's something that's important to you. And, of course, we love our animals for reasons other than their appearance. Photos don't show personality. Or intelligence. Or, in special circumstances, megalomaniacal tendencies and palpable disdain for underlings. We tested the app with a photo of Cash, a gray-and-white Scottish Fold cat in Atlanta, and it returned matches of cats with similar coloring in Jefferson, Georgia; Knoxville, Tennessee; Huntsville, Alabama; Charlotte, North Carolina, and other neighboring states. A few of the cats looked vaguely like Cash, although most did not. But the pool of available cats may grow larger as more pet shelters connect with the database. The PetMatch app, released this month, is currently available only on Apple's iOS operating system. And while it will no doubt be helpful to pet seekers, PetMatch is not the only product the folks at Superfish have in mind. The company has been around since 2006 and its photo-recognition tool has been available as a standalone iOS app or a Web browser extension for a while. Now, it's planning to expand its item-specific offerings, with jewelry and furniture apps in the works.","New PetMatch app lets you upload photos to find a lookalike for a dog or cat .

"(CNN) -- Liverpool's Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez has been charged by the English Football Association (FA) with making racist remarks towards a fellow player. Suarez has been accused of aiming racial taunts at Manchester United's French defender Patrice Evra during a match in the English Premier League last month. He denies the charges and has vowed to clear his name. A statement on the FA's web site read: ""It is alleged that Suarez used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behavior towards Manchester United's Patrice Evra contrary to FA rules,"" the association said in a statement. Blatter: No on-field racism in football . ""It is further alleged that this included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or color and/or race of Patrice Evra."" The FA has taken over a month to charge Suarez and they are also investigating allegations of racism by Chelsea and England captain John Terry towards a fellow player in a separate incident. CNN Blog: How should football tackle racism? London's Metropolitan police have also launched a probe after Terry was accused of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. Terry denies the claims. Liverpool said they had been informed of the charge against Suarez by the FA and planned to review the documentation. ""We will discuss the matter fully with him when he returns from international duty, but he will plead not guilty to the charge and we expect him to request a personal hearing,"" the club said in a statement. ""Luis remains determined to clear his name of the allegation made against him by Patrice Evra."" Suarez's charge comes on the day that FIFA president Sepp Blatter claimed there is not a problem with player-on-player racism within football. Speaking to CNN World Sport, the head of soccer's world governing body suggested any player who is abused during a game should shake hands with their opponent upon the final whistle and move on. He later moved to clarify his comments, stating he was ""committed to fighting this plague and kicking it out of football.""","English Football Association charges Luis Suarez with making racist remarks .

"(CNN) -- He helped resurrect Liverpool's footballing fortunes, and he has been called up by England ahead of the World Cup in Brazil. Britain's most successful Olympian Chris Hoy calls him the ""voice of reason,"" snooker champion Ronnie O'Sullivan credits him with bringing him back from the brink of retirement, while footballer Craig Bellamy says he saved him from mental torture. The list of sporting luminaries queuing up to wax lyrical about Professor Steve Peters paint the picture of a miracle worker, but the 61-year-old modestly downplays his role in helping shape British sport across a myriad of disciplines. ""It isn't that I have a magic model,"" he says. ""People think it's a cure but it's not that. I just want to bring the best out of people. ""I can't take someone off the street and make them a world champion in whatever sport they wanted. That's not possible, as you need skill and ability with it."" But Peters' success in helping athletes is truly remarkable, being involved with numerous Olympic and world champions. Not that he ever counted such things -- it simply isn't in his psyche. Growing up in the northern English town of Middlesbrough, the son of a docker was the first in his family to go to university. He taught maths before retraining to become a doctor, and jokes that he turned to psychiatry because ""that had less on-call hours in those days."" But it started his fascination with the human mind, which has not diminished. However, it was never his overriding ambition to win medals -- he got into sport by accident rather than design, working with a cyclist in 2001 ""merely to help out a friend."" ""I just want to help people,"" he explains. ""My biggest satisfaction is getting a better quality of life, where you've seen that suffering and been able to remove that suffering, whether that's in sport or their personal lives."" His greatest and most prolonged success has come with British Cycling, where he was brought in by the forward-thinking Dave Brailsford -- the man behind the success of Team Sky, home of Tour de France winners Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome. Despite knowing little about football, Peters helped guide Liverpool to the brink of a first English league title in 24 years -- and will again work with the club's captain Steven Gerrard in the England World Cup campaign in Brazil. He has helped five-time world champion O'Sullivan to fight his very public mental demons, and came to the aid of renowned ""bad boy"" Bellamy after the suicide of the former Liverpool and Manchester City striker's mentor Gary Speed. ""Both Ronnie and Craig have been amazing pupils -- both have worked really hard,"" Peters says. ""Both started from a tough place. Sometimes people find it hard to understand that people have gifts but they can be put in a position that they're not quite capable of understanding the emotion that goes with it, and they say or do things they regret. ""Both were determined to change and get the best out of themselves. It was hard work but enjoyable."" So how exactly does Peters teach people how to control their brains? The basis of it is ""The Chimp Model"" -- which he explains in his book as the different parts of the brain that battle for domination. The emotional, irrational part is the chimp, which he challenges athletes to control, while seeking to remove ""gremlins"" and ""goblins"" -- negative beliefs or behaviors that can inhibit performance. ""I use that model to access the mind as it's much easier for people to think of something accessible,"" Peters says. ""But you have to be adaptable to the individual, to understand their environment and get the best out of them. I often get asked for five tips to help people or something like that but it's just not possible. A tip to one person won't help another. Everybody is individual."" Peters says athletes need to work on their mind as they would their technical skills or strength and conditioning, and he believes it requires just five or 10 minutes a day -- which he does himself to keep his inner chimp at bay. Despite all the successes, there are inevitable blips. Peters' Midas touch, for example, seemed to evade him in recent weeks as O'Sullivan was unable to retain his world title while Liverpool slipped up in final stretch of the Premier League season. ""The driving force is that I like to see people succeed whatever it is they try to do, whether that's medals or whatever,"" he adds. ""I get asked if I fail but I can't make people win. What I try to do is to take away the barriers that are governing them: 'What are you trying to do, what's stopping you?' ""It's not for me to tell people. I just give suggestions. ""Ronnie O'Sullivan is a good example. People said it must have been a terrible day in that final. It wasn't. Obviously Ronnie was disappointed as he wanted to win the title. ""But he was in a good place in the dressing room and was talking about someone playing out of his skin. He was like, 'I'm doing what I can.' For 20 years, he made three world championship finals and now he's made the last three finals consecutively."" Liverpool's players and management alike have paid tribute to the Peters effect. He has generally worked with individuals, but likens tackling a football team as similar to his cycling experiences. ""Both Dave Brailsford and Brendan Rodgers are amazing managers, they know how to run teams. It makes my life easier as I'm just brought in to help. I'm just one of a number of people in a support team in both cases."" It is all a far cry from his previous job working at a high-security psychiatric hospital for 12 years, dealing with people with a wide variety of personality disorders, and being helped to track down the Soham murderer Ian Huntley. Are there any parallels between such clinical work and sport? ""In sport or the corporate world, in whatever, it's more or less the same as you're dealing with people and what's going on in their head,"" Peters says. ""If people are ill or people have forensic personalities, you still have to adapt in the same way to, 'What's my role in this?' ""Of course, it's a very different remit deciding whether people need to be detained for public safety than riding a bike around a velodrome but it's the same brain mechanics. It's a little bit like running a car -- it could be they have different engines but there's a generic feel for those engines."" If Peters can help England's footballers to win the World Cup for the first time since 1966, he will indeed be dubbed a ""sporting savior"" -- but he is wary of being seen as the only solution in such circumstances. ""It's not just me, there are lots of people doing this,"" said Peters, speaking more generally about his work, rather than specifically about the England team. ""And people shouldn't think mine is the only way. ""I might not work for some people, so my advice would be to find the model that works for you.""","Professor Steve Peters has been hailed as a savior by a long list of sports stars .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Prosecutors dropped drug charges against rapper T.I. related to his arrest in West Hollywood, California, last month, the Los Angeles district attorney's office said. T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, and his wife, ""Tiny"" Tameka Cottle, were arrested on drug charges after a traffic stop on Sunset Boulevard in September. The arrest and a failed drug test the next day resulted in a federal judge in Georgia ordering the rapper back to prison for 11 months for violating his probation from a weapons conviction. Harris. 29, must turn himself in next week to begin serving his prison term next week for the probation violation. Defense lawyer Steve Sadow told CNN the decision to drop the charges was ""the right thing to do under the circumstances."" ""Both his Los Angeles defense attorney, Blair Berk, and myself commend the Los Angeles district attorney's office for exercising its discretion to reject prosecution in light of the legal and factual issues involved,"" Sadow said. An arraignment hearing had been set for next month, but the decision to reject charges against Harris will save Los Angeles taxpayers the expense of flying him from a federal prison in Georgia to California. No decision has been made about the drug charges against Cottle, 35, the prosecutor's office said. Harris acknowledged in federal court this month that he had a drug addition problem. ""I screwed up big time and I am sorry,"" Harris told U.S. District Judge Charles Pannell Jr. ""I am sincerely sorry. I am scared that you will send me to prison."" ""Mr. Harris has had the limit of second chances,"" Pannell said as he imposed the 11-month sentence. Harris received an unusual plea agreement two years ago to resolve federal gun charges. Those charges followed his attempt to buy three machine guns in the parking lot of an Atlanta grocery store. He served a year of house detention before he spent nine months in prison and three months in a halfway house. The cornerstone of the plea deal was his community service which included the rapper speaking to young people about the importance of staying off drugs and out of trouble. ""He was supposed to be living what he was preaching,"" said U.S. Attorney Sally Yates. Harris is an Atlanta-based rapper, music producer and actor. He is also the head of the Grand Hustle record label. CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","NEW: Defense lawyer Steve Sadow says it's ""the right thing to do""

"(CNN) -- The newest monument in Washington dedicated to the memory and legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. is attracting thousands of Americans and foreign tourists. It will finally get its official day in the sun on Sunday. That is when the federal government will formally dedicate the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial on the National Mall. This weekend in Washington should not be a destination, however. It should be viewed as a new leg on a long journey to find the America that King spoke of 48 years ago when he gave his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. When a quarter-million people turned out for the 1963 historic March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, the nation's capital was also not so much a destination but a journey. It is that journey that several of King's Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity brothers took to heart to spark the campaign to build a memorial in his honor. Little did they know their idea for a small tribute would become the monument that it is today. Little did fraternity members know that the young Atlantan who joined the fraternity in 1952 at Boston University would become a world leader and historic figure who inspires millions. Fraternity historian Robert Harris, a professor of history at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, says the idea for the monument started 28 years ago when brother George Sealey and his wife, sitting at their kitchen table, said there should be a tribute to King in Washington. Harris says they got the idea after watching President Reagan sign into law the King holiday bill in the fall of 1983. Sealey, then living in Silver Spring, Maryland, brought together four other Alpha men in his local chapter, and from there the idea became a national mission of the fraternity. After years of producing fiscal and fundraising plans, drawings and blueprints and galvanizing public support, Alpha Phi Alpha persuaded Congress and key elements of the executive branch, including the Department of the Interior and the White House, to green light the project. King's brothers' dream is now a reality. ""Many people didn't think this could be built, but we did it, through hard work across the country,"" said Herman ""Skip"" Mason Jr., general president of the fraternity. ""In our local chapters, we worked with community groups to build support from local leaders to members of Congress, pressing why it was important and why we were willing to do whatever was needed to make this memorial happen."" It also would take raising $120 million. Alpha Phi Alpha boasts the largest contingent of individuals to donate, at approximately $3 million. There are thousands of other private citizens who gave, including children who raised dollars at elementary school events. The U.S. government allocated $10 million in matching funds, and the remainder came from about 100 corporate sponsors. Thousands of people were set to descend on Washington on August 28 for the unveiling and dedication. It was planned to coincide with the anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington. But Hurricane Irene came along and disrupted everyone's plans. It was going to be one big party, an international celebration not seen in Washington since the inauguration of President Obama in 2009. The fraternity did hold a private dedication that drew more than 5,000 on August 26 before the rest of the weekend events were canceled. This weekend's government event may be a bit smaller than the originally planned celebration, but it will still have star power and a festive flair. The president will speak, civil rights legends will tell stories of the struggle, and we'll hear about the long journey to build this worthwhile memorial. Also, it still will have a link to an historic day in America: October 16 is the anniversary of the 1995 Million Man March. But the question remains, what really will happen after all the pomp and circumstance? What lessons will be learned and applied? This year, King would have turned 82 years old. He would be in the club of all those veteran civil rights warriors who have made it to the 21st century. The iconic Rev. Joseph Lowery, a co-founder the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King, turned 90 last week. Many now are in their twilight years. They march to a slower cadence, many with a third leg. Some are pushed along in wheelchairs. Many say the memorial is a marvelous and well-deserved tribute to a man who helped America find its soul. A man who showed the country how its citizens could - and should - be treated despite their race, color, creed or station in life. None of us know what King would think of all the euphoria surrounding this memorial, but my guess is that he would say we still have a lot of work to do. You do not have to look far for evidence that he would be right. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center shows that the wealth gap between whites and African- and Latino-Americans has grown by leaps and bounds. According to Pew, ""median wealth of white households is 20 times that of black households and 18 times that of Hispanic households."" So it is clear the King memorial has to be more than just a ""stone of hope."" It must be more than just another tourist site we put on our maps. It has to rekindle the enthusiasm in people for those issues King cared about. It has to be a living monument. It has to transform lives of those who will make the journey to see it up close. ""The Alpha men who originally pushed this idea of a memorial saw this not just to honor King, but as an inspiration to schoolchildren who visit the capital each year,"" Harris said. ""Having this memorial to King could be inspirational as they go back home."" Sealey never got to see his dream become reality. He died several years ago. But now the world has the chance to benefit from that dream and to see Martin Luther King Jr. in a new way. However, it will mean nothing if we do not put action and meaning into what we glean from this monument. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rick Blalock.","Martin Luther King's fraternity brothers started a drive for monument in Washington .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- I'm not an early riser. I have a rule against stepping outside my Paris apartment without first indulging in my café au lait. But after close to a decade of living here, I also know that if you're craving a croissant, you have to go to a bakery well before noon to taste the city's iconic breakfast staple at its most exquisite: still slightly warm from the oven, the irresistible aroma of freshly baked dough wafting upward while you're pulling the whole thing apart, layer by buttery layer. Travel Snapshots: Paris . So on a recent morning, I rose early and set out to find the city's top pastry. Others have gone on a quest for the perfect croissant, but always landed on swanky Left Bank addresses. I thought it was time to give the Right Bank its due, now that a new generation of young bakers have set up their ovens. Travel + Leisure: Affordable small hotels in Paris . To start, I didn't have to go far from my apartment in the lively Bastille quarter. In fact, I went right next door to Au Levain du Marais. I've long appreciated this bakery's croissant for its extra-crisp ends—the best part—while the delicately layered center was soft and tender. It was a promising first stop, but there was more tasting to be done. Heading up the hill toward Montmartre, where shaggy-haired Gontran Cherrier is known for spicing up baguettes with curry and rye bread with miso, I was surprised to find his croissant resolutely unadorned. The distinct layers, more shards than little flakes, had more of a crunch than the dainty bite I had hoped for. Travel + Leisure: Europe's best neighborhoods for foodies . An equally obsessed friend sent me to a busy corner of Rue Paul Bert for La Pâtisserie by Cyril Lignac, whose owner is a spirited presence on French television. Here, the horseshoe-shaped croissants were lined up right next to the register. I ripped off one crisp end and let the wisps of warm, yeasted puff pastry melt in my mouth. This one stopped me in my tracks. Was this the end of my quest? Never one to shy away from being thorough, I made a beeline for Du Pain et des Idées, in the scenic Canal St.-Martin neighborhood. Christophe Vasseur's rustic breads are among the best in Paris, and I was curious to see how his artisanal croissant stacked up. This specimen was more substantial than the others, with a sturdy crust and hearty interior—too dense for my Proustian ideal. But I couldn't resist a crusty loaf of my favorite pain aux céréales for later. Travel + Leisure: World's strangest desserts . When I arrived in the charming Square Trousseau, I was worried I wouldn't have room for the hefty croissant at Pâtisserie Boulangerie Blé Sucré. One look at its crackly glazed crust, one bite into the tender interior, and I was enchanted. What set it apart? A masterful hint of French sea salt in the dough. Satisfied that I had found the ne plus ultra of croissants, I strolled out of the bakery, vowing to return the next morning, leaving a trail of crumbs in my wake. Paris Croissants Address Book .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Imagine every time you closed your curtains, you were capturing enough solar energy to power your laptop. The technology is available, but no one's packaged it up in a handy DIY kit at your local hardware store. Solar textiles use the same technology as traditional solar panels to convert sunlight into energy. Sheila Kennedy hopes to be the first. She's not an interior designer but an architect and professor in practice at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is convinced that solar textiles will revolutionize the way we collect and consume power. ""I've been thinking about what happens when power and light become flexible, literally flexible,"" she said. She calls it ""soft power,"" as in the ""soft energy path,"" a term coined Amory Lovins in the 1970s as a way to describe a world where renewable energy would gradually replace the centralized grid. Later, Joseph Nye used the term ""soft power"" to describe the ability of persuasion, values and culture to influence change. Kennedy's work with soft power builds on both of these ideas. For her , soft power is the ability of flexible materials to convert sunlight into energy. ""The soft power approach says there are some incredibly sensual, compelling, beautiful spaces and products that we can be producing using these emerging energy-harvesting materials,"" Kennedy said. Her Boston-based firm, Kennedy & Violich Architecture, has been working with thin-film photovoltaic material, a fabric that looks and moves like cloth but does the job of a solar panel. ""These are materials which can be prepared in the chemistry lab or can be found in nature. They produce electricity when exposed to light. They are very efficient and flexible,"" she said. ""We are pairing the thin-film photovoltaic material with another semi-conductor material, the light-emitting diode; they're two sides of the same coin. One takes a little bit of the energy of sunlight and transforms it into electricity; some takes that electricity and turns it into light."" Rechargeable batteries pocketed into the hem of the curtains gather energy that can be downloaded into a larger home battery. ""From a technical view, the thin-film has the potential to be produced in very high volumes, with a very low embodied energy and a low carbon footprint. These new photovoltaic materials can be produced in the same way one might print and produce a newspaper, roll to roll. That can make it very affordable,"" Kennedy said. Its limitations are its performance. It's less efficient that glass-based solar technology, but Kennedy predicts that's going to change. ""Right now there's research being done on developing sensitivities in thin-film that will allow the energy to continue to be harvested, even at night. That's going to revolutionize the applications for solar textiles,"" she said. The current technology can be found hanging in the Vitra Design Museum in Essen, Germany, in a prototype pre-fabricated home called the Soft House. Farther south and west, the designers are taking their ideas from the Soft House and applying them to a research project for a Soft City. Kennedy and her team have calculated that by covering just 10 percent of a roof area in Porto, Portugal, solar curtains could provide as much as 70 percent of the average electricity used by a typical household each day. ""It goes to show that you don't need a very large area. We've calculated that 15 square meters would be enough."" Kennedy envisions a future in which a single homeowner or a group of neighbors would decide to wean themselves off the centralized grid and power their homes using the energy they've ""harvested"" themselves from the sun. ""You could look at it as a type of urban farming,"" Kennedy suggested, adding that one of the reasons people aren't doing it now is not the lack of technology but old habits and inherited centralized building systems in architecture. ""Instead of tucking way electricity and lights in walls and accessing that with a plug, we have the possibility of thinking of a whole new experience for energy, energy-harvesting and for light."" She talks about material that you could reel in from the roof and wrap around to make a new type of instant room, a Zip Room. Plastic wall plugs would cease to exist; instead you'd harness your appliance into the surface or edge of the textile. Her ideas may seem radical to homeowners who don't give much thought to where their power comes from or how much it costs, which is why Kennedy is so keen to see the solar curtains in consumer-friendly packs on hardware store shelves. ""Energy-harvesting solar textiles are a very good beginning point. I think that the notion of tying in a new technology with something very familiar really has its advantages if one's about large-scale uptake and widespread adoption of a new energy regime."" Regime may sound like a hard word to be used in the context of soft power, but as Kennedy says, it's up to architects and designers to convince homeowners that there are more efficient alternatives to traditional homes. Her firm is going one step further with the offer to work with developers and manufacturers who are interested in building digitally fabricated Soft House demonstration projects. ""My team is actively interested in speaking to people who are serious about realizing a pilot program that adapts the Soft House model to actual needs on urban or rural sites. I do think the moment is now.""","Solar-harvesting curtains could convert sunlight into power source for homes .

"(CNN) -- Jose Luis Zelaya shed tears of joy Friday morning. ""It's just insane,"" the graduate student at Texas A&M University said. ""I've been working on this for six years. It is just overwhelming."" Zelaya was electrified by news that the Obama administration will stop deporting illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children if they meet certain requirements. Zelaya came to the United States illegally from Honduras at age 14 to find his mother, who was already in the country, he said. Without the change announced Friday, he couldn't get a job to help pay for school; Zelaya, 25, is pursuing a master's degree in education with hopes of earning a doctorate and teaching middle school. He also wouldn't be able to consider job offers that presented themselves afterward. The uncertainty over what loomed after graduation spooked him. ""Now, maybe I will be able to work without being afraid that someone may deport me,"" he said. ""There is no fear anymore."" Immigration shift sparks reaction from both sides . News of the change raced across the country, buoying the spirits of immigrants and immigrant advocates who have campaigned for such a change for more than 10 years. ""I'm definitely speechless,"" said Pedro Ramirez, a recent graduate of Fresno State University who was student body president when he admitted that he was in the country illegally. ""It gives us a chance to show the American people that we're not here to use your tax dollars; we're not here to take your jobs; we're here to contribute,"" he said. Not everyone viewed the change with such enthusiasm. ""This is a classic Barack Obama move of choosing politics over leadership,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said on Twitter. ""This decision avoids dealing with Congress and the American people instead of fixing a broken immigration system once and for all."" Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said the decision would invite fraud and hurt unemployed Americans. ""President Obama's decision to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal immigrants is a breach of faith with the American people,"" said Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Read Napolitano's memo here (PDF) Under the new directives, those who were brought into the country illegally before the age of 16 and are not criminals, among other requirements, are eligible to receive deferred action for two years, and will be eligible to apply for work authorization. ""It's a step in the right direction,"" Ramirez said, though he characterized it as a ""Band-Aid deal."" ""It's not the solution; it's a temporary fix. But it implements part of the key focal points of the DREAM Act,"" he said. The Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors -- or DREAM -- Act, would create a path to citizenship for immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in the United States for at least five years, obtained a high school or General Education Development diploma, and demonstrated ""good moral character,"" the White House said. Efforts to pass the DREAM Act in Congress have failed. Laura Vazquez, spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza, said the Obama administration is within its authority to enforce the change. ""This is a legitimate use of the tools that the administration has to focus on their immigration enforcement resources,"" she said. ""In light of the congressional inaction on immigration reform, this is the right step for the administration to take at this time."" Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform said the policy is politically motivated and misguided. What to know about immigration in the U.S. ""They're going to throw 830,000 people into an already dismal work environment,"" he said, referring to estimates of the number of people who could become eligible to apply for work authorization under the new policy. Mehlman said the law also disregards the authority of Congress. ""The president is basically announcing amnesty without authority from Congress,"" he said. ""This is what they need to rally a certain part of their base, but it's going to come at the expense of a lot of other people who say this is bad policy and a usurpation of the authority of the legislative branch of Congress,"" he said. In Arizona, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough anti-illegal immigration stance, said that politics is behind the policy action. ""Why now? Why not let Congress decide next year on this issue and on all the illegal immigration problems we have?"" he said. Arpaio said he will abide by the directive, but added he will continue to enforce state laws as he sees fit. ""We're going to continue enforcing these illegal immigration laws, including the state laws,"" he said. The new immigration directive could also help resolve immigration snafus that that system has created. Elizabeth Olivas nearly missed her graduation and salutatorian speech because she was caught in one such mix-up. An undocumented immigrant who was brought to the United States by her parents when she was 4, Olivas traveled to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, last month to beat a deadline to apply for a visa. But because of a miscalculation, she missed a deadline and risked being barred from the United States for three years. It took a waiver to allow her to return to the United States, where her father is a naturalized citizen. Her attorney, Sarah Moshe, said those who have grown up in the United States after entering illegally did so without intent to violate the law. Overheard on CNN.com: Decision to defer some deportations symbolic . ""It's not the end of the road, but it is great news,"" she said of the administration's announcement. ""It will allow them to live without the fear looming over their head that they can be sent to their home country at any moment."" In downtown Los Angeles, about 150 young demonstrators -- many of them undocumented immigrants -- rallied in front of the federal immigration office Friday and exalted over the news from Washington. Some shed tears of joy and chanted, ""undocumented, unafraid!"" Demonstrators then symbolically blocked a freeway on-ramp and next obstructed Aliso Street for about an hour to halt the movement of a fleet of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement vans and buses, which are typically used to haul away illegal immigrants to the border for deportation. Protestors then broke up peacefully. Protest organizer Neidi Dominguez asserted that ""there's so many undocumented youth graduating from UCLA, Harvard, Stanford"" and the executive order will ensure ""that they are going to be able to use their degree and work. ""It's a night and day change, and there's hope,"" Dominguez said. Alex Chavez, 20, a senior at California State University Fresno, drove four hours to downtown Los Angeles early Friday to participate in the ""historic moment,"" he said. ""I was brought here at the age of 3 (from Mexico) and was raised in Tulare, California. I grew up here, this is my country and I have no intention of going back,"" Chavez said. ""I want to come here and contribute, to be a teacher, educating young minds. That's what I plan to do for the rest of my life."" Photos: Putting a face on the immigration debate .

"(CNN) -- Though he's best known for his comedic work playing Frasier Crane on ""Cheers"" and ""Frasier,"" Kelsey Grammer is enjoying critical success in dramatic fashion these days. On the Starz original series ""Boss,"" Grammer plays Chicago Mayor Tom Kane, who is suffering with DLB, a degenerative neurological disorder. The show is a look inside a backstabbing and corrupt political culture, where Grammer takes Kane into twisted, dark places, yet at the same time, exudes a sadness that makes fans feel a little empathy for the guy. The first season was just eight episodes, but it was enough to earn Grammer a Golden Globe for ""Best actor -- Television Series Drama."" The series enters its second season Friday, with actors Jonathan Groff, hip-hop artist/actor T.I. and Sanaa Lathan joining the cast. CNN recently spoke with Grammer about the politics surrounding ""Boss"" and how a show like ""Cheers"" prepares one for a dramatic role. CNN: You won a Golden Globe for ""Best actor -- Television Series Drama"" for ""Boss."" Was that a shock? Grammer: Well, you know, I thought I had a shot with the Hollywood Foreign Press. They had a great meeting, where they do that chat thing that they do and asked a bunch of great questions. It's like a press conference. They asked questions that were interesting and required some thought to answer, so I thought they were obviously engaged a bit in this project. CNN: Audiences know you in comedic roles, but might not think of you as a dramatic actor. Grammer: Right, yeah, well that's something we were keeping secret all this time [Laughs]. Pull 'em out when you need 'em. CNN: On a general level, what's in store for ""Boss"" season 2? Grammer: There's so many twists and turns on plot points that can't be revealed, but what I can tell you -- the first half of the season is a series of manifestations of his disease and the decisions he's making are maybe colored by it. A bit more rash than he's been previously. So what we have is an accelerated, rhythmic shift in the energy of the show. I think some will find welcome, but also confusing in a weird way. It all changes again in the middle of the season, where we shift him back in a more slightly evil way and what his choices are for the next season, if we have one. CNN: What was great about the first season was how manic he became and how it overtook him. Grammer: What I like about Tom is that he's such a fighter. He won't let it finish him until it destroys him. That's what I love about him. CNN: I read that the character isn't based on any current Chicago politicians. Grammer: No, none of those guys are as cool as Tom Kane is. That's all I say. CNN: Are there any aspects of the new season that mirrors what's happening in current politics? Grammer: We really try to avoid it. If you take a look at the political world, it's 3,000 years old of difficulties and egos and aspirations and power grabs and betrayals. We just wanted to explore what we think is the whole condition of something that always seems current, which is politics. CNN: Where does he fall in terms of the complexity of characters you've played? Grammer: He's probably the brightest guy I've ever played. He's the greatest fighter I've ever played. MacBeth is similar to him, certainly. What I love about MacBeth is that he starts out as a hero and ends up as heroically evil in the end. So Tom Kane might start out where MacBeth is, but Tom Kane will fight you for that last ounce of life. I love that about that character. I wish I was more like him. CNN: There's this great balance that the viewer gets of this guy. He's estranged from a lot of people that once meant a great deal to him in his life, and he has this disease that will make him nothing that he planned. But at the same time, he can be quite horrible to people. How do you balance that in bringing that out? Grammer: It's confusing. What's interesting about Tom is that when he's in a caring moment, it's real, it's full, it's rich. You spot the humanity that's within this monster. You start to feel sorry for the monster, which is typical of a great horror-movie villain. You discover this humanity in him and you long for it in a weird way. But when he cares, he really cares. He's not phony. But then it becomes more confusing. It's just a great thing to get to play. He's so disabled by his own choices. CNN: What most of us know about politicians is through these mediated filters: what we see on TV or the Internet . But this show is interesting because it gives a deeper look into these people that have a lot of responsibility. Grammer: It's funny, I like the idea that my politicians might be human. I also want them to be real. I like it when politicians acknowledge ""I'm good at this, I'm not good at that, you got to help me do that."" I'd love more candor. But we're not going to get it. That's life. CNN: Are there things that you learned working on a show like ""Cheers"" that that you're using still on ""Boss""? Grammer: Well, comedy's interesting. For a great laugh to happen, you have to believe the situation and believe the character. Comedy today is really gag-gag-gag, one-two punch. With Frasier we tried at least a page, a page-and-a-half without asking for a laugh. That's a slightly different experience. ""Cheers"" was a bit like that, but ""Frasier"" more. What you learn from a drama like ""Boss"" is that there are big choices I make as that character and you have to believe it's possible. I mean, Frasier ended up jumping up and down on a bed, pretending he was having sex with himself (Laughs). This is extraordinary s**t. But you have to believe this is possible and coming out of a real situation. So I end up tearing some guys ear off as the mayor and you believe it. Because you bought into why he's there. Maybe those things are what you learn as a result of knowing what works ... you have to lay the foundation. CNN: Have you been following the current race? Grammer: Listen, this one was really predictable to what was going to happen, from both sides at this point. It has been for a couple years. If you're not doing well in office, then the country's split. They've been playing that card for awhile now. We're in that cycle. I've been rooting for the conservative side of the equation for awhile now and that's where I'm at. Only because I think it's time for change this time, a different kind of change. The new season of ""Boss"" premieres August 17 on Starz.","""Boss"" returns for season 2 on Friday .

"(CNN) -- In a potential landmark case, a Massachusetts teenager is on trial this week after prosecutors say his texting while driving caused a crash that led to the death of a 55-year-old man. Aaron Deveau's trial got underway Tuesday in Haverhill, with opening statements and the prosecution beginning to present its case. The first few days of the trial included testimony by the victim's family and a crash survivor, the replaying of Deveau's original interview with police and a visit to the crash site, as the defendant looked on from afar. Almost exactly one year earlier, the then-17-year-old Deveau pleaded not guilty to a host of charges tied to the fatal February 20, 2011, crash, the Essex County District Attorney's office said in a press release at the time. Those charges were motor vehicle homicide by negligent operation, negligent operation of a motor vehicle, being an operator under 18 using a mobile phone, being an operator reading or sending an electronic message, a marked lanes violation and two counts of negligent operation and injury from mobile phone use. Some 38 states ban text messaging for all drivers while 31 prohibit all cell phone use by ""novice drivers,"" according to the Governors Highway Safety Association. Yet Deveau's case is thought to be unique, in that his texting is being linked to another person's death. Prosecutors allege that Deveau was texting when his car crossed the center line and hit a vehicle being driven by Donald Bowley, a resident of Danville, New Hampshire. Bowley's girlfriend, Luz Roman, was in his car with him and suffered serious injuries. Haverhill Detective Thomas Howell testified this week that the two ""were almost folded into the floorboards,"" the impact was so severe. Bowley died March 10, after he was taken off life support. ""My brother received such head trauma that... there was no hope for him,"" Bowley's sister, Donna Burleigh, said this week in court. According to reports from several CNN affiliates, prosecutors claim that Deveau received and sent a total of 193 text messages on the day of the crash, including several around the time the accident occurred. During her opening remarks, Assistant District Attorney Ashlee Logan suggested that Deveau may have erased some of his texts or fibbed to police after the accident. ""He states the last message that he received was at 2:33 (p.m.), and then shows the officer the next message is at 3:10,"" Logan said. ""When records were received, it's learned: there are two (texts) missing."" Deveau said after the crash in a taped interview with police, which was played in court this week, ""I was tired. I was distracted. When I looked away for one quick second, I came too close to her and I was trying to hit my brakes."" His defense lawyer claimed authorities set out from the beginning to link texting to the crash, a cause-and-effect relationship that he contends is not valid. Joseph Lussier, the attorney, furthermore urged jurors not to let the sad, gruesome nature of the crash and its effect on its victims cloud their determination as to whether Deveau's texting was to blame. ""Please don't listen to the sympathies of the commonwealth when you're making your decision,"" Lussier said.","The trial of Aaron Deveau, now 18, began this week in Haverhill, Massachusetts .
Authorities say he was texting before a fatal crash, then erased some of the texts .
The defense argues authorities had an agenda in trying to link texting with the crash .
The teen had told police after the incident, ""I was tired, I was distracted"""
"(CNN) -- Forget Disneyland! Costa Rica is the happiest place in the world, according to an independent research group in Britain with the goal of building a new economy, ""centered on people and the environment."" Costa Rica is known for its lush rain forests and pristine beaches. In a report released Saturday, the group ranks nations using the ""Happy Planet Index,"" which seeks countries with the most content people. In addition to happiness, the index by the New Economics Foundation considers the ecological footprint and life expectancy of countries. ""Costa Ricans report the highest life satisfaction in the world and have the second-highest average life expectancy of the new world (second to Canada),"" the organization said in a statement. They ""also have an ecological footprint that means that the country only narrowly fails to achieve the goal of ... consuming its fair share of the Earth's natural resources."" The Central American country, tucked between Nicaragua and Panama, touts its lush rain forests and pristine beaches. Its president, Oscar Arias Sanchez, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for trying to help end civil wars in several Central American countries. This year's survey, which looked at 143 countries, featured Latin American nations in nine of the Top 10 spots. The runner-up was the Dominican Republic, followed by Jamaica, Guatemala and Vietnam. Most developed nations lagged in the study. While Britain ranked 74th, the United States snagged the 114th spot, because of its hefty consumption and massive ecological footprint. The United States was greener and happier 20 years ago than it is today, the report said. Other populous nations, such as China and India, had a lower index brought on by their vigorous pursuit of growth-based models, the survey suggested. ""As the world faces the triple crunch of deep financial crisis, accelerating climate change and the looming peak in oil production, we desperately need a new compass to guide us,"" said Nic Marks, founder of the foundation's center for well-being. Marks urged nations to make a collective global change before ""our high-consuming lifestyles plunge us into the chaos of irreversible climate change."" The report, which was first conducted in 2006, covers 99 percent of the world population, the statement said.","Costa Rica beats out Dominican Republic as ""happiest"" place in world .

"COCHABAMBA, Bolivia (CNN)  -- A hundred years ago a Brazilian physician, Carlos Chagas, showed that monkeys were susceptible to a rare parasitic illness carried by a particular Latin American bug. A mother and baby visit a clinic in Bolivia to get tested for Chagas. Today an estimated 16 to 18 million people are infected with Chagas, as the disease is now known, and it claims some 50,000 lives each year. Yet most people have never heard of it. Chagas disease is exclusive to Latin America, and kills more people there than any other parasitic illness, including malaria. In Bolivia, an estimated one in five people are infected. So why is so little known about the disease? One crucial reason is that it only affects the poor. In the mud and thatch homes of rural villages and urban slums, bugs known locally as vinchuca, make their home in cracks in the walls and holes in the roofs. The bugs carry the parasite that causes chagas, in their saliva and their feces. Infection occurs when they bite, or if their are unknowingly eaten in uncooked food, or rubbed in the eye. Infected women can transfer chagas to their child during pregnancy, delivery or while breastfeeding. In its early stages, Chagas it is eminently treatable, but there are many problems. ""Most people don't know they've been infected,"" says Dr. Tom Ellman, who works in Bolivia with humanitarian agency, Doctors Without Borders. He told CNN: ""Many of them will drop down dead usually from heart problems cause by the disease 10, 20, 30 years after they've been infected and no one will know why."" For Dr. Ellman, this lack of effective treatment is a symptom of a much sadder cause. ""In terms of getting better treatment, you're not going to have the interest of pharmaceutical companies, who will only investigate new drugs if there is a market that is willing to buy them. ""What we need now is more interest. We're still using drugs invented over forty years ago, that have huge numbers of side effects and take sixty or ninety days to work,"" he told CNN. Even after these extensive courses of anti-parasitic drugs, there is no definitive test to see if the patient has been cured. Doctors can only advise patients to return in two years. Dr. Ellman also has particular concerns for children over the unavailability of new drugs: ""At the moment we have to cut adult doses of tablets into much smaller sizes for children which brings pricks of getting the dosage wrong and makes it much more complicated."" Chagas can be detected via blood test. In the clinics where Doctors Without Borders work, they advise parents to have themselves and their children tested whenever they visit a clinic. But the challenge they face is vast. How to make a population wise to the threat of a disease that is already plaguing them, and that many have still never heard of.

(MNN.com) -- While dogs offer wet kisses to just about anyone within licking distance, the feline persuasion prefers that you earn their purrs and cuddles. Since the American Pet Products Association (APPA) estimates that about 38 million U.S. households have cats, plenty of people are working overtime to please their feline houseguests. Are you ready to join the ranks? Here are a few tips for how to adopt a cat: . Prepare for a long-term love affair . ""There is this general thinking that cats are no-fuss pets, which couldn't be further from the truth,"" says Gwen Sparling, owner of Camp Kitty boarding facility in Atlanta. She notes that cats live from 15 to 20 years, which equates to thousands of litter box cleanings as well as other expenses. Annual expenses for veterinary care, food, toys and preventatives also add up quickly. Expect to drop around $1,000 for the privilege of kitty cohabitation. If you're ready to handle the time and financial commitment, it's time to find a match. MNN: Cat called for jury duty in Boston . Consider the source . Millions of adoptable cats await the chance to pounce on your freshly laundered socks. Start your search with a walk through the county animal shelter or by browsing Petfinder.org. Cats adopted from a shelter typically are up-to-date on their shots and have been spayed or neutered for less than $100. From kittens to fully matured cats, calico to tiger stripes, the options are endless. Rescue groups provide another route to finding the perfect cat. These nonprofit organizations typically pull adoptable pets from local shelters and place them in pet-friendly surroundings to help them find a forever home faster. ""A rescue group is probably more familiar with the cats they have and therefore are able to answer any questions you may have about the cat's personality,"" says Sparling, who fosters cats at her facility for Atlanta Animal Rescue Friends. ""I recommend that those adopting a cat for the first time adopt from a rescue group because the group can also be a great resource should you have any questions in the future."" Both options save a life because they create space for another cat to find a forever home. Often rescue groups go one step further by agreeing to take the cat back if things don't work out. MNN: A documentary from a feline point of view . Get expert (matchmaking) advice . ""Sometimes people have been known to come into the shelter with a cat in mind but, once the counselor has met with them and discussed their environment, they have gone home with an entirely different cat,"" says Samantha Shelton, executive director and founder of Furkids pet rescue, Georgia's largest cage-free, no-kill cat shelter. (The organization also shows love to homeless dogs through a network of foster homes.) Shelton shares the story of one woman who sought a kitten for her older cat. Counselors pointed her in a different direction, suggesting an easygoing adult cat instead. ""A kitten would be like a toddler wanting to play with the old cat and would eventually end up annoying the cat and upsetting the balance in the home,"" Shelton says. ""The adoption was a great success because the adopter was willing to consider our advice, which comes from eight years of successfully placing well over 5,000 animals."" Speaking of toddlers, Sparling and Shelton advise against mixing young cats with young kids. ""A child could easily kill a kitten because he doesn't know his own strength or how to properly handle a kitten,"" says Sparling, who suggests that households with children opt for an adult cat that has a history of playing well with youngsters. Shelton adds, ""As a general rule, most shelters will not adopt kittens into homes with children under the age of 6."" Start things off on the right paw . Once you do find the best match, these tips from Sparling and Shelton will ensure that your feline roommate settles in with no problems. MNN: Study reveals physics of how cats drink . Set aside bonding time: Cats love routine and they enjoy companionship, says Shelton, who suggests bringing a new cat home during a time when you have a few days to help it adjust to new surroundings. Create a ""safe room"" for the cat: Place the cat's litter box, food, water and bed in a designated space, preferably near a window. Shelton said this is particularly helpful when cats are being introduced to a canine companion or other cats in the house. ""This will help the cat feel secure in a new environment,"" she says. ""If other cats or dogs exist in the home, place the cat in a room that will allow some access under the door so the animals can sniff and stick a paw out if they like."" She says the furry roommates should live separately for a few days. ""Once the cat is feeling confident, you can then begin the introductions."" Introduce the cat to canine roommates ... sloooowly: If your dog is cat-friendly, the introduction should still happen very slowly. Shelton also said it helps to have an outgoing cat, but patience is key. ""Our adoptions of a cat into a home where a dog exists have gone very successfully because of a slow introduction,"" she says, adding that it also helps to install a baby gate to allow the cat a safe getaway. Avoid a cat-on-cat catastrophe: There is a reason that cats are described as finicky. Sparling stresses that you use caution when introducing new felines to the family: ""Many people will adopt a new cat, then throw it into a room with the resident cat and let them work it out. Bad idea!"" Sparling says it can take days and even weeks for your cat to accept the idea of a new kitty on the block. To ease the transition, she suggests keeping them separated at the beginning. Also, regularly swap their blankets so each becomes familiar with the other's scent. ""When they do finally meet, make sure there is a cat tree or a shelves in the room so each cat can have a high spot,"" she says. ""Some cats get along great from the beginning and some will hate each other for the rest of their lives. It all comes down to the cat's personality."" In other words, there will never be a dull moment in Catville. MNN: How one feline mascot saved the trains in Japan . Get the good stuff: An investment in high-quality cat food, is an investment in the long-term health of your cat. ""You will avoid some of the health issues that stem from poor food, such as urinary track issues,"" Shelton says. ""By feeding a higher-quality diet, I think you can expect to pay $30 to $40 a month, depending on how many cats you have in your home.""

"(CNN) -- A 44-year-old male teacher from my hometown is set to be released after just 31 days of incarceration for raping a 14-year-old girl who later killed herself. Someone believed Cherice Moralez of Billings, Montana, when she accused her 49-year-old teacher, Sandy Rambold, of forcible rape. He confessed, faced charges and then should have received a sentence commensurate with the crime of rape. But the legal process played out over three years, and just before her 17th birthday, Moralez, shamed and shunned by classmates, shot herself. District Judge G. Todd Baugh sentenced Rambold to just 30 days. (The public outrage that followed caused Baugh to attempt a review of his own sentencing, a move the Montana State Supreme Court denied.) ""He'd suffered enough,"" Baugh said of Rambold at the initial sentencing, and besides, Moralez, ""older than her chronological age,"" was ""as much in control of the situation"" as her teacher, he said. ""Obviously a 14-year-old can't consent,"" the judge explained in the wake of public outrage, but this wasn't ""some violent, forcible, horrible rape."" It wasn't, said the judge, ""this forcible beat-up rape."" Where does this bizarre line of reasoning come from? We need only look around for clues at a media culture that regularly tells young girls that growing up means shedding all signs of pink princess innocence for a porn version of sexy. A culture that celebrates Robin Thicke singing, ""I know you want it"" at the VMAs as Miley Cyrus -- having made the lightening quick transformation from teen role model to sex object, whose job it is to give pleasure to a grown man -- twerks in his crotch. We reward girls and young women who take off their clothes, tell them that their sexual availability and sexual power are their most important assets. We grant them record deals, reality TV shows, and global news coverage. Once they cross over, slut-shaming and Judge Baugh-like sentences enable men like Rambold to take full advantage -- as long as it's not ""this forcible beat-up rape."" We rarely hear from young women themselves about what it's like to traverse this cultural terrain. So I asked members of the SPARKteam (girl activists ages 13-22 from SPARK Movement) to talk about what happened to Cherice. What does it feel like to be 14 and want to be wanted, to experience this new kind of power and illusion of control? Erin, 18, says she immediately identified with Cherice, because ""I was her. I remember being 14 and talking to 30 year-olds on the Internet. I was feeling really alone and struggling to come to terms with who I was. I wanted to have some kind of social (and sexual) connection with people. That's what led me to leer in chat rooms and talk to men who were more than twice my age. Maybe they would love me and maybe I could feel less insecure."" Erin knows firsthand how easy it is ""to get caught up in your undying feelings for someone, especially someone who is manipulating you into loving them. At 14, you think that you know everything -- you think this person isn't doing anything wrong by having a relationship with you, and that no one understands. He becomes your world. You think that you're in love, when what you're really in is abuse."" ""When you're 14,"" 15-year-old Luci says. ""It seems like the rest of the world is against you, especially if, as the judge described Morales, you're 'a troubled kid.' I can get that, and I can see why Cherice found refuge in a relationship with her teacher. When I was her age, there was this one teacher who everyone at my school adored. He saw potential in me that I was too insecure to see in myself. I looked like I could be in college. He treated me like I was grown up, so I thought I was more mature than I really was. But that's the thing: Looking older than you are in no way equals being emotionally mature."" Celeste, 20, implicates Judge Baugh's unquestioned participation ""in a culture where representations of Latinas prioritize sex appeal. Baugh's claims speak volumes about the way women of color are hypersexualized. Cherice was only 14, but when Baugh looked at her he saw someone older who was therefore experienced enough to understand, and even control, a sexual situation. She did not fit his image of 'youth' and 'purity,' so this 70-year-old Judge did not see a young girl who was victimized, but a sexually viable woman."" Because the lines are blurred, we need judges who are educated and aware enough to see through the subterfuge of sexism and racism, who do the right thing -- whether in Steubenville, Billings, or my hometown. Whatever else is going on in girls' lives, whatever media messages we all receive about the commodification of their sexuality, we need to send a clear message that rape and sexual assault are crimes for a reason, that justice has nothing to do with how mature a girl looks or acts and everything to do with her suffering and her right to human dignity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lyn Mikel Brown.","Lyn Mikel Brown: Montana teen raped, teacher confessed, then judge gave one month sentence .

No stitches. No hospital,"" said Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman.

"(CNN) -- Far-right extremist groups had been on the rise, particularly in reaction to President Obama's election in 2008 and the financial crisis around the same time. But now, hate group prevalence is taking a downward turn, according to a report released Tuesday. The number of hate groups declined 7% from 2012 to 2013, the Southern Poverty Law Center said in the report. ""We had four years of spectacular growth of the radical right,"" said Mark Potok, senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center. Now, it ""seems to be turning a corner."" It's unclear whether the decline will continue, Potok said. There were 1,007 groups in 2012 and 939 last year, but those numbers are still substantially higher than in 1999, when there were only 457 such groups. ""Patriot"" groups in particular saw a significant drop, falling 19% from 1,360 groups in 2012 to 1,096 in 2013. These anti-government groups had been strengthening in numbers substantially; there were only 149 of them in 2008. The report attributed the overall declines in hate groups to factors such as Obama's re-election, an improving economy and law enforcement crackdowns. ""In other words, the same groups that were galvanized by Obama's first election and swelled dramatically as a result, were demoralized by his re-election, which seemed to signal that their battle was lost despite enormous effort,"" Potok wrote in the report. Reasons for the trend . Mainstream politicians have also adopted right-wing extremist issues, which could be another reason for the drop. Laws in Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee aim to stop Islamic Shariah law from being imposed on American courts, the report said, even though that could not happen under the Constitution. State legislatures also have passed or considered laws that try to ""nullify"" federal legislation, which courts have repeatedly found to be unconstitutional, the report said. This ""nullification"" idea dates to the defense of slavery before the Civil War, resurrected ""by Southern states resisting school desegregation and the civil rights movement."" Extremist groups also suffered because of their own internal dynamics, the report said, citing the National Alliance, which has gone from 1,400 people to under 100 since its founder died in 2002. The law center attributed the decline of this group -- which used to be the best organized in America -- to ""its new leader's ineptitude and the SPLC's exposure of a series of embarrassing secrets about the group and its leaders."" But although fewer groups may be active, violence and terrorism stemming from them are still very much present, Potok said. ""When the groups are more out of step with public opinion, when they are weaker and more weakly led, is often when you see followers strike out violently,"" he said. For instance, a self-described member of the Ku Klux Klan and an accomplice were arrested and charged with conspiracy to provide material support for use of a weapon of mass destruction last year, according to the criminal complaint. Federal officials said they were planning to develop a mobile X-ray system that would be used kill people whom they deemed ""undesirable."" Feds nab KKK member, accomplice for lethal X-ray plot . Some geographic areas are more concentrated with extremist groups than others. California has the distinction of being the state with the most number of hate groups -- 77 -- followed by Florida with 58 and Texas with 57, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center's interactive map. A move toward secrecy . Besides the obvious clash of values, there's an emerging trend among some extremist groups that runs counter to mainstream American society: leaving the Internet. In some ways, that's not surprising, Potok said, because the more serious groups have always been underground. Ku Klux Klan groups ""held steady"" with 163 chapters in 2013, but they are dampening their online presence, the report said. They appear to be leaving the Internet ""in an apparent bid to regain the secrecy that marked their heyday."" A major specific group that ditched their digital presence is the United White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, which has 30 ""klaverns"" (chapters), the report said. More recently, the 10-chapter Fraternal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan declared that it had ""gone underground so we can be more productive in our struggle. The only way you will be able to contact us from now on is through the old way, word of mouth,"" according to the report. The group added, according to the report: ""We are everywhere.""

"(CNN) -- Turning 50 is a major milestone in a person's life -- and a country's history. Kenya celebrates Thursday its Golden Jubilee year following 50 years of independence from British rule. To commemorate the event, Nairobi-based photographer Mutua Matheka teamed up with Samsung last month to launch Picha Hamsini, a photo contest celebrating the East African country's heritage from past to present. They asked photography enthusiasts from across Kenya to submit images of people or places with historical and cultural significance and explain why these were relevant to them or the country. ""The goal of the contest was to see and show Kenya from the eyes of Kenyans,"" says Matheka. ""(To) use images to celebrate our country and get people involved in that celebration. We have a lot we are not happy about as a country, but I believe we also have a lot to celebrate and I feel photography is usually a tool to further and foster that."" Read this: Africa's most exciting new photographers . The organizers received more than 2,000 images submitted via Facebook, Twitter and Istagram. In the end, the 25 best were selected and featured in a street exhibition in the center of the Kenyan capital, alongside some of Matheka's photos. ""The images we received were fantastic,"" says Matheka. ""Some celebrated people, others celebrated our activities, others celebrated beautiful places,"" he adds.

"(CNN) -- The movie ""Big"" is celebrating its 25th anniversary, but the 1988 blockbuster almost didn't become the movie beloved by audiences today. For starters, Tom Hanks originally turned down the lead, writers were seriously considering the title ""When I Grow Up,"" and producers had trouble attaching a director to the picture. ""Tom Hanks was my first choice but he said 'no,' "" director Penny Marshall told CNN, ""and so did everyone else because there were other movies with the same premise. So I decided to go with someone who's a behavioral actor -- Bob DeNiro."" The tale of a boy whose diminutive stature prevents him from enjoying what he perceives to be the spoils of maturity makes a wish to be ""big"" at a carnival, only to wake up the next day as a 30-year-old man. It's hard to imagine Robert DeNiro in the man-child role of Josh Baskin, but DeNiro was, in fact, attached to the role prior to backing out in negotiations. DeNiro's interest in the film validated the project for Marshall. It was only her second directorial effort, and she soon found A-listers vying for the part of Josh. Marshall knew Hanks from their days as sitcom stars on the Paramount lot. The former ""Laverne and Shirley"" actress thought the former ""Bosom Buddies"" star's ""sweet, innocent face"" would be a good fit. But there was big trouble for Marshall, whose career as a director was at stake. Not only were three other body-switching movies currently in production (""Vice Versa,"" ""Like Father, Like Son,"" and ""18 Again""), but ""Big"" was the last one out of the gate that year because the crew had to wait for Hanks to become available. Despite those odds, ""Big"" garnered Hanks his first Best Actor Oscar nomination and the movie earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. It was one of 1988's top-grossing hits, and the first movie directed by a woman to break the $100 million box office mark. Actor David Moscow, who played young Josh, told CNN that he originally auditioned for the role of Josh's best friend, Billy. It was the child actor's second audition ever. Months later, when Hanks came aboard, Moscow got a callback. Moscow's hair was dyed slightly darker and he wore green contacts in order to better resemble Hanks. ""In the first week of shooting I lost a tooth,"" said Moscow. ""I was very late in losing my teeth, and I remember production lost their minds. They built what they call a 'flipper' -- a band attached to the tooth that I had to wear in my mouth during scenes; but I could pop it in and out of my mouth if I wanted to."" Marshall recalled demanding that Moscow, a fellow Bronx, New York native, ""stop flipping"" multiple times on-set. Moscow and Hanks, of course, could not be in any of the same scenes, but Hanks' nice guy reputation was already filmdom lore. ""The producers were nervous for him [Hanks] because he refused to take a limo to the set and said he would just take the subway,"" said Moscow. ""He showed up with a backpack and a hat on and he was just really down to earth."" For the sake of authenticity, Marshall built the Josh character around the real-life Moscow. Josh's bedroom resembled Moscow's. ""The Giants poster on the wall, the Yankees game, that was me,"" he said. Marshall recorded home movies of Moscow and his friends interacting so Hanks could study their movements: how kids acted, ran, talked, and joked around with one another. The role required that Hanks un-learn the societal disciplines of being an adult. Moscow even read many of Hanks' lines as a guideline to ensure a truly childlike delivery of lines that wasn't over-the-top. Moscow wasn't the only child to contribute to the production end of things. The song Josh sang to prove his identity to Billy (""Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa pop. Shimmy, shimmy, rock... "") was taught to Hanks by his then 10-year-old son, Colin, who learned the little ditty at summer camp. Hanks still knows it by heart (and soul). The FAO Schwarz sequence arguably stands out as the film's most iconic. The piano scene was key for many reasons, but primarily it was instrumental in getting Josh and his boss to bond. Because Silly String, pizza and loft apartments don't pay for themselves. Marshall recalled preparing for the piano scene months in advance. The director approached the inventor of what is now the tourist attraction known as the Big Piano and asked for a practical instrument that the actors could play ""Heart and Soul"" and ""Chopsticks"" on. Cardboard mockups of the piano were created for Hanks and actor Robert Loggia to practice on at home. Dance doubles were hired for close-up insert shots of the actors' feet, but in the end the footage was never used -- Hanks and Loggia were just that good. As a nod to the scene, when the front cover of Fox Home Entertainment's new 25th anniversary edition Blu-ray/DVD is opened, ""Heart and Soul"" plays via an internal sound chip. Moscow believes ""Big"" still resonates with audiences because ""anybody can watch it. All ages. There's no violence in it. There's no gratuitous sex in it. It's something that's safe. But there are also these moments of pure magic."" Fans of ""Big"" have their own personal magic moments from the film, whether they're reminiscing about the excitement of one's first paycheck ($187!); or watching Tom Hanks in a white-sequined tuxedo lick cream cheese out of a celery stick, put it back, eat baby corn as if its on-the-cob and then proceed to dry heave after sampling Beluga caviar; or remembering the days of being uninhibited enough to jump on a trampoline in a skirt. For others, perhaps it's the simple sweetness of Josh giving his colleague and soon-to-be girlfriend, Susan (played by Elizabeth Perkins) ""a glow-in-the-dark compass ring. So you don't get lost."" The writers agonized over whether it was even appropriate for the Josh character to enter into a sexual relationship with a grown woman. They eventually defaulted to Judaic law and made him 13 -- he was originally supposed to be 12 -- meaning he'd already been bar-mitzvahed and thus undergone the rite of passage into manhood. Of course (spoiler alert!) Josh misses his family, tracks down the Zoltar machine, and everyone (except maybe Susan) lives happily ever after. Moscow said the scene in which he walks away from Elizabeth Perkins, swimming in the Tom Hanks-sized suit was particularly memorable. He kept looking at the wrong place as he said his lines. ""Sometimes the camera is the actor and you have to act to it even if the actor is standing four feet away,"" he said. ""In the scene where I was wearing the big suit, gazing at Elizabeth, I was looking at the real Elizabeth instead of at the camera and Penny would be like, 'Cut!' "" Marshall hopes audiences continue to come away from the film with the notion that while everybody has to grow up, it's important not to lose the child inside. That life will never be that simple again, and it's important to retain that innocence. ""Everyone says, 'When I'm big I'm gonna ...' ,"" Marshall told CNN. ""That's the message I held onto during 'Big.' "" Tom Hanks spoke about the wonder of childhood in an interview on the DVD extras. ""We go through periods of our lives where we're able to fall asleep in the back of the car while Dad drives home,"" said Hanks, ""and later on we find ourselves being Dad who has to stay awake and drive while everybody's asleep in the back of the car. When you grow up it's all over with.""","The movie ""Big"" was released in 1988 and remains a classic .

"(CNN) -- The man charged Wednesday with attempting to blow up the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the latest alleged jihadist to be charged in a law enforcement sting, may or may not have had the capability to create a major terrorist incident. But if his case follows the pattern of other similar sting operations, what is clear is that he faces very long odds in court. Quazi Mohammad Rezwanual Ahsan Nafis, a 21-year-old Bangladeshi from Queens, is accused of plotting to detonate a 1,000-pound bomb outside the Federal Reserve building in Manhattan. Sounds pretty terrifying. But as acting Assistant FBI Director Mary Galligan explained, ""It is important to emphasize that the public was never at risk ... because two of the defendant's 'accomplices' were actually an FBI source and an FBI undercover agent."" According to the complaint against him, Nafis did travel to the United States by his own account to wage ""jihad."" But Nafis doesn't seem like the sharpest aspiring terrorist. According to the complaint, Nafis believed that the undercover agent he was talking to had traveled overseas to meet al Qaeda's leadership to get approval for the New York plot during the summer of this year. Not too many folks are known to have traveled to Pakistan's tribal regions from the United States to meet with al Qaeda's leaders in recent years. Terror plotting: Bravado or sincerity? Yet Nafis will be quite unlikely to successfully mount a defense that he was entrapped by the feds. Since September 11, 2001, 207 individuals have been indicted on charges related to jihadist terrorism. Of those, 94 had interacted with an informant or an undercover law enforcement officer in the leadup to their arrest, according to data compiled by the New America Foundation. Defense attorneys and members of the local community have in many of those cases accused authorities of entrapment, though that claim is rarely used as an official defense, since entrapment is extremely difficult to prove. In one such contentious case in 2004, two imams at a mosque in Albany, New York, Yassin Aref and Mohammed Hossain, became embroiled in an elaborate terrorism plot created entirely by the FBI after Hossain approached a longtime FBI informant to ask about obtaining an illegal driver's license for his brother. Then, after agreeing to launder money that the FBI informant said would be used to buy a surface-to-air missile for terrorists, the two men were tried and convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison on money laundering and terrorism charges. Aref -- who spoke broken English -- maintained throughout the trial that he hadn't even known he was laundering money, much less that he was supporting terrorism, and dozens of community members -- Muslim and non-Muslim -- wrote letters to the courts and to local newspapers describing Aref as a devoted father and peace-loving, law-abiding member of society. However, the odds are stacked against suspects like Aref. Of the 81 jihadist terrorism suspects who have gone to trial since 9/11 in cases involving an undercover agent or informant, every single one has either been convicted or pleaded guilty. Entrapment defenses just haven't worked in post-9/11 jihadist terrorism cases. By contrast, of the 45 non-jihadist terrorism suspects -- who include neo-Nazis, anarchists and anti-government extremists -- who have gone on trial since 9/11 in plots involving undercover agents or informants, the rate of successfully obtaining convictions or guilty pleas was about 77% rather than the 100% conviction rate in jihadist terrorism cases. New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Wednesday, ""Whether al Qaeda operatives like Iyman Faris or those inspired by them like Jose Pimentel, terrorists have tried time and again to make New York City their killing field.Â We're up to 15 plots and counting since 9/11, with the Federal Reserve now added to a list of iconic targets that previously included the Brooklyn Bridge, the New York Stock Exchange and Citicorp Center."" But few of these 15 plots were truly threatening to New York. One of the terrorist suspects Kelly mentioned, Pimentel, allegedly came close last year to completing the construction of three pipe bombs he planned to use against New York police officers and returning U.S. troops, before authorities arrested him. But the FBI had turned down more than one request from the New York City Police Department to get involved with the investigation because its agents were of the opinion that Pimentel ""didn't have the predisposition or the ability to do anything on his own,"" according to one anonymous law enforcement official. In fact, multiple acquaintances of Pimentel's told police he was mentally unstable and had once tried to circumcise himself. He had difficulty drilling the holes in the pipe bomb parts that the undercover informant had provided him with and asked an upstairs neighbor to help him. This doesn't sound like a cunning terrorist plotting to wreak havoc on the American public. Similarly, the other terrorist mentioned by Kelly, Pakistani-American Iyman Faris, was certainly someone who had met with al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan, but the harebrained plan he hatched to bring down the Brooklyn Bridge was to use a blowtorch to burn through the massive steel cables of the bridge, which had no chance of succeeding and which he never attempted. The good news is that even these not especially threatening cases, like that of Nafis, are becoming increasingly unusual. Since 2009, jihadist terrorism cases in the United States has been on a steady decline, with only three suspected jihadists indicted in 2012, compared with 25 in 2011 and a record 44 in 2009. Why these jihadists' terrorism cases have so precipitously declined in number is hard to diagnose precisely.

"(CNN) -- Nearly four decades after hundreds of people were led to their deaths in a mass murder-suicide pact in a South American jungle, the cremated remains of nine of those victims have been found in a shuttered funeral home in Delaware. The eerie find was made after the owner of the site of the former Minus Funeral Home in Dover contacted authorities about 38 small containers left behind on the property, authorities said. The discovery harkens to a sensational case involving more than 900 people who followed the charismatic Rev. Jim Jones from San Francisco to a jungle settlement in Guyana in 1978. They believed they were being delivered to a place of racial harmony and social justice. Ultimately, they were ordered or forced to drink cyanide-laced punch after Jones' gunmen killed a visiting U.S. congressman and four others at a nearby airstrip. Of the 38 containers of cremated remains found at the former funeral home, 33 were marked and identified, said Kimberly Chandler, a spokeswoman for the forensic science division of the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security. Nine of the marked containers held the remains of Jonestown massacre victims, Chandler said. The bodies of some Jonestown victims were transported to Dover Air Force Base, which has the nation's largest military mortuary. Chandler said she did not know the connection between the funeral home and the military base. The remains in five other containers have not been identified. Authorities will attempt to track down relatives or make arrangements to dispose of the remains, Chandler said. There was no evidence of criminality in the remains' disposal, Chandler said. It appears the remains went unclaimed. The discovery prompted Delaware authorities to conduct an exploratory excavation on the property on Wednesday. Dover police officers identified areas on the property with loosely compacted soil. Several bronze grave markers for veterans who served from World War I through the Vietnam War were found, police said in a statement. The markers were to be presented to family members or returned to the Veterans Administration. More than 900 men, women and children died in what became known as the Jonestown massacre -- the worst mass murder-suicide at the time. On November 18, 1978, Jones' idealistic dream of creating a socialist paradise turned deadly when his followers were ordered or forced to drink cyanide-laced punch. Earlier, California Rep. Leo Ryan had arrived on a one-man investigative mission, bringing along a TV camera crew and various reporters. Fifteen church members asked to leave with him. But Jones sent gunmen to a nearby airstrip, where they killed Ryan, an NBC correspondent and his cameraman, a newspaper photographer and one of the departing family members. Ryan and his party were ambushed as they were loading the plane with Jones' followers who wanted to leave. The 227 children in the so called ""Peoples Temple"" were poisoned first. Syringes were used to squirt the poison in the mouths of babies. Some adults drank willingly. Most of those who protested were shot by armed guards. A few escaped into the jungle. Jones was later found with a bullet in his head. It is not known who shot him or whether he shot himself. CNN's Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.","Cremated remains of nine victims of the 1978 Guyana massacre have been found in Delaware .

"(CNN) -- Seventy-nine years ago this week, as he signed the Social Security Act into law, my grandfather, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, observed, ""The civilization of the past hundred years, with its startling industrial changes, has tended more and more to make life insecure. Young people have come to wonder what would be their lot when they came to old age."" The first half of that sentiment carries even more weight today than it did then. Recent decades have witnessed changes in technology, in the workplace, and in the work force, that would have been difficult to imagine in 1935. As our economy continues to recover from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, we're finding it necessary to adapt to a new economy that bears little resemblance to that of previous generations. But as for the latter half of that sentiment, it is astonishing is how untrue it rings today. Even without the assurance of walking out the door 40 years down the line with a gold watch and a pension, younger Americans today have far less reason to fear living out their final years in abject poverty. The reason, quite simply, is that Social Security has been one of the most successful programs in our nation's history. According to the Census Bureau, more than 35% of Americans age 65 and older were below the poverty line in 1959. Today, that number is below 10%. Take into consideration the families who receive Social Security benefits on account of the premature death of a parent or disability, and in 2012 Social Security lifted more than 22 million Americans out of poverty. I'll admit that contributing to my appreciation of the Social Security program is that it is one of my grandfather's proudest legacies. The Social Security Act fundamentally transformed America by putting in place a commitment to the most vulnerable members of our society; that commitment has been expanded with the additions of Medicare and Medicaid and strengthened by the reforms put in place by the Affordable Care Act . I also had the opportunity to work in the Social Security Administration, which has helped bring to light just how disingenuous are the attacks lobbed against the program's long-term viability. Despite Social Security's extraordinary success, and the program's deep popularity with the American people, it has been targeted with lies and distortions by those who would seek to end the program as we know it based on rigid ideology. We have been repeatedly told that the program is bankrupting our country or is insolvent. Critics who point to the glut of Baby Boomers entering retirement seem to forget that their generation has paid into the system since they started working about 50 years ago. Their Social Security benefits have been earned, not handed to them. In truth, as laid out in the Trustees' annual report, Social Security is still projected to be able to pay out full benefits for nearly another two decades. Even without any action by lawmakers, the program would still be able to pay out about 75% of scheduled benefits after that point. The American people should be skeptical of Republican leaders who suggest that the only way to save the program for future generations is to gut it. In 2006, opposition to President George W. Bush's plan to privatize Social Security was part of the platform that contributed to Democrats winning control of the House and Senate. In 2016, Republicans could nominate a candidate like Rand Paul, who just last week suggested that we increase the retirement age for Social Security by five years. Social Security has afforded millions of Americans the opportunity to retire with dignity after a lifetime of hard work. Raising the retirement age would severely threaten to take that away from people who've done the best they can day in and day out, but for whom the demands of their job make working into their 70s unrealistic. And it is frightening to think what would have happened to the earliest Baby Boomers, who reached retirement in the aftermath of the economic crisis, had they been totally subject to the whims of Wall Street where they may have lost everything. Because of my grandfather's polio, he relied on my grandmother who shared with him accounts of the poverty she observed around the country. Those stories fortified his resolve to enact a program that would address the extreme hardship of struggling Americans. The paucity of such stories in America today should not be misinterpreted as a sign that we no longer need Social Security but instead taken as proof of the program's success, and evidence of the importance of its continued existence for future generations.

"(CNN) -- It's Friday afternoon and Berlin Tegel Airport is overwhelmed. Several flights are delayed and passengers crowd the terminal, scowling at the departure screens and tapping away at their smartphones in frustration. It's not a typical scene at Tegel but hardly a surprising one. The airport was built 40 years ago to handle just 6 million passengers a year in a city that was then an island surrounded by the former East Germany. Berlin has since changed almost beyond recognition, becoming one of Europe's major capitals and a popular travel destination. Tegel now handles 20 million passengers annually and should've closed down long ago, but an embarrassing series of setbacks and delays to the city's state of the art new Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER), have earned it a stay of execution. The new airport was originally due to open in 2012, but there's currently no scheduled launch date. Surprisingly, rather than becoming increasingly frustrated with using Tegel's creaking facilities, many locals are glad it's still operating. ""Tegel has grown in Berliner's hearts,"" says Lars Wagner, a spokesman for the Berlin Airport Authority, the body that will eventually have to sign Tegel's death warrant. ""As so often in life, people find it hard to part with what they're used to."" Proximity to the action . Suzanne Stoffe, flying to Frankfurt after a conference in the German capital, is among those who have developed a deep affection for the airport. ""I hope Berlin Tegel stays for a long time,"" she says. ""It's just so easy to reach and to go back and forth."" Stoffe's colleague, Torsten Warg, agrees. ""I always find the check-in very quick, it's super,"" he says. ""The new airport will never be ready anyway, so there's isn't really a question of flying from somewhere else in the near future."" Just a 20-minute taxi ride from the city center, many travelers love Tegel's proximity to the action. ""It's super convenient,"" says Winnie Heun, a Berlin-based cinematographer and Tegel fan flying to Kiev to film a commercial. ""Because of the round design, you can drop off at the gate and from there it's 30 meters to check-in. And right behind the check-in, is security. It's super fast."" He also likes Tegel's rather outdated but distinctive hexagonal style. ""The great thing is the design of the airport,"" he says. ""It's really marvelous, it's really retro and it really fits Berlin."" Other passengers aren't as enamored. On this particular Friday, the simultaneous conclusion of several international conferences stretches Tegel's already overstretched systems and there's a backlog at check-in for the afternoon flight to London. ""Up until this point I was quite impressed, but I'm not impressed now,"" says Alan Frost, a British business traveler who's been standing in line for some time. Fellow Brit Trevor Smith, who travels through Tegel two or three times a year on business, is also frustrated by the airport experience. ""It's normally terrible, because there's no facilities,"" he says. ""You always have to queue. ""The sooner the Germans sort out their new airport the better. It needs a decent airport, one that caters for passengers."" Blown budgets . Tegel's small size does have advantages. Two flustered passengers are allowed to check in with bags just half an hour ahead of takeoff. Each gate has its own luggage belt, so even latecomers have the chance to make the plane. Berlin's Airport Authority says the new airport won't work in quite the same way, but it will have a modern and fast check-in system. Today, though, the beautifully designed wooden check-in desks at BER are empty, new equipment wrapped in plastic while technicians work through a series of glitches. ""One of the main problems we still have is with fire-safety issues,"" says the airport authority's Lars Wagner. This isn't the only headache for the airport's developers. With construction ongoing since 2006, costs are running at least double the original budget of â‚¬2.8 billion ($3.6 billion). ""The airport is different to the one which was originally planned. We've grown over the years,"" says Wagner. ""It's like when you plan a home for one family, but over time you realize you need a home for three families. But that's no excuse for the mistakes which we made. ""A lot was done wrong and a lot was planned badly. We have to correct that."" Another issue is that air passenger traffic in Berlin is growing faster than anticipated. BER was originally planned for 27 millions passengers, but with the city's two existing airports currently handling close this number, the concern is the new hub won't be able to cope. Controversial closure . For airlines the new airport can't come soon enough. Air Berlin is currently housed in a temporary terminal at Tegel Airport that's so makeshift it has a corrugated iron roof. It says it's had to put growth plans on hold because of the delays. Tegel has limited capacity for long-haul jets -- it's runway is too short for the Airbus A380 super jumbo -- so airlines are unable to expand their route networks until BER opens. Air Berlin's Robert Peres says the delay is affecting the entire German travel industry. ""Clearly, Berlin needs a modern and fully operational airport,"" he says. ""We all need BER. We are looking forward to the day it will open."" Global travel expert Simon Calder says Berlin is coping, largely because its old Cold War division bequeathed it an airport on either side of the city: Tegel and the east's Schonefeld. ""The one really regrettable thing is that Tempelhof was closed -- the city center airport would be thriving today had it been allowed to continue,"" he says. Since its controversial closure, Berlin Tempelhof Airport -- famous for its role in the 1948 Berlin airlift -- has been turned into a public park, its old runways crowded with cyclists and skaters and visitors filled with nostalgia for their most beloved inner city airport. Berliners are equally interested in the new as the old, and while BER might not be ready for takeoff yet, it's already welcoming tourists. For â‚¬10, visitors can take a bus tour of the new facility and can even buy T-shirts and teddy bears with the airport logo. Runway bus tours . Tour guide Christian Franzke says BER has had more than a million visitors to date. ""Many people are from the area who know about this project,"" says Franzke. ""There's been a lot of talk about the airport and we want other people to be able to join that conversation and to see what's happened in the past few years."" Visitors can speed down the new runway on the tour bus -- the closest they'll get to flying from here until the airport actually opens. ""We hope it isn't too much longer,"" says Antje, a visitor from Berlin, ""because we stood in front of the check-in hall and it was really nice compared to the other airports we have here."" Airport tourist Michael Schulz was pleased with what he saw, too. ""I thought it would be a big construction site, but it actually looks ready,"" he says. ""It's quite nice. It looks good inside, the wood, a lot of light, a lot of glass. I'm not sure when I'll be using it, but it will be good for Berlin."" Any possible opening is still a long way off. Authorities are reluctant to announce a date and face further embarrassment of yet again having to reschedule. So for now, those who enjoy flying out of Berlin Tegel Airport, can be assured it will be operating for some years to come. Not such good news for those who find the travel experience at this small local airport frustrating.

"(CNN) -- ""What's wrong with your foot?"" asked the medicine man as I ducked into his grass hut to escape the tropical downpour. He could see that I walked with a slight limp. Like many an aging athlete, I had injured myself while training for a hike. I knew I had to condition myself to be able to walk 50 miles carrying a backpack at 9,000 feet. So strenuous was the training that I hurt my foot and had to hobble into the offices of physicians, orthopedists and chiropractors -- in short, anyone who might heal my affliction. I tried massage, ice packs, heating pads and whirlpool baths. I took aspirin, ibuprofen, anti-inflammatories, prescription pain pills and a cortisone injection in search of relief. The pain was reduced to the point where it became bearable, and I completed the hike. But I felt my injury every step of the way. In the ongoing debate over the enormous health care costs in America, we can do well to look southward at the tropical American countries where shamans reside and practice their healing. Like physicians, shamans are not infallible and vary in abilities. This shaman -- Amasina of the Trio tribe in southern Suriname -- I knew to be a master of his craft. He looked up from a fire he was stoking, over which he was boiling local herbs in a battered old aluminum pot. The smell of the plant potion filled the dwelling as I entered. Amasina wasted no time on pleasantries, even though he had not seen me for almost a year. ""Take off your shoe,"" he ordered, and I complied. He examined my foot carefully, and then issued another order: ""Give me your machete!"" I removed the machete from my belt and passed it to him. With one clean stroke, he sliced a fuzzy fern off the bark of a nearby palm tree, carried it back to the hut and threw it directly into the flames. After less than a minute, the shaman snatched the fern from the fire and applied it to the base of my foot, causing me to howl with pain. When both my foot and the fern had cooled, however, the pain had disappeared. He then threw the fern in another pot of water, warmed it over the fire, and had me drink the entire potion. The pain in my foot went away. And for seven months, there was no pain. Then I returned to the jungle for another successful treatment. To some, the term ""shaman"" may conjure up images of tricksters more than healers. But authentic shamans are masters of a sacred craft, living repositories of centuries of therapeutic wisdom. The depth of shamans' knowledge on preventive medicine and diagnostics has astonished even physicians who have studied their approach. Dr. Christopher Herndon, a Yale-trained physician and ethnobotanist specializing in the Amazon, recently noted, ""when asked about disease conditions, shamans present highly detailed and specific descriptions of disease characteristics and associated symptomatology. They frequently comment on disease associations and responsiveness to therapy, often demonstrating a remarkable insight into the natural history of disease processes as we understand them."" Many scientists who study tribal people's use of plants can recount experiences of injuries or ailments that physicians failed to cure that were then treated successfully by an ""uneducated"" herbalist, or shaman. In other words, we have a lot to learn from shamans. But our pharmaceutical industry is often dismissive of nature as a source of healing. It seems to overlook the fact that many of the most important classes of prescription drugs like ACE inhibitors for high blood pressure (first developed from Brazilian snake venom), beta blockers (from hallucinogenic Mexican fungi), and cholesterol-lowering statins (from Penicillium fungus) came from natural sources. And new finds continue to be made. Herndon and his colleagues in Peru have recorded indigenous people employing hallucinogenic frog slime to heighten sensory acuity. It may contain properties to treat high blood pressure. And I have observed medicine men in the northeastern Amazon using insects to treat arthritis and bacterial infections, indicating that local wisdom regarding the healing potential of plants and animals has been underestimated. When I entered the field of rainforest conservation more than three decades ago, there were two basic areas of focus: protecting rainforest ecosystems and protecting traditional rainforest cultures. Many in the first group overlooked the opportunity to enlist tribal inhabitants of the rainforest, its natural guardians, as allies. Many in the second passed over the hard truth that these cultures cannot survive unless the forests are preserved intact. In the spirit of the interconnectedness of all things, we launched the Amazon Conservation Team to protect the forests, preserve the tribal populations and their cultures and knowledge, and along the way, hopefully discover new medicines from nature. The Amazon Conservation Team has joined forces with our tribal colleagues and local governments to achieve these goals. We have partnered with elderly medicine men and women to establish shamans' apprentice programs and clinics to improve local health care and transmit traditional healing knowledge to succeeding tribal generations. We hope you'll join us to broaden the world's knowledge. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Plotkin.","Mark Plotkin: In the debate over huge health care costs, we should look south .
