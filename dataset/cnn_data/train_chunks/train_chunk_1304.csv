"The man who sparked a hijacking scare on a flight to Bali has appeared at Brisbane Magistrates Court. Matt Christopher Lockley was clean shaven, had his hair slicked back and wore a grey suit, to face a charge of interfering with a crew member stemming from the April 25 incident.

Matt Christopher Lockley was clean shaven, had his hair slicked back and wore a grey suit as he fronted the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday . The 27-year-old faced court after sparking a hijacking scare on a Virgin Australia flight from Brisbane to Denpasar, Indonesia . It's alleged he banged on the cockpit door, causing pilots to trigger an 'unlawful interference' alert that put the Indonesian air force and police on notice for a hijacker on arrival. Lockley cut a different figure on Friday to the man arrested by Indonesian authorities when he got off the plane in Bali on Anzac Day. His lawyer Mark Williams asked for the case to be adjourned for three weeks. Mr Williams said he'd only received the brief of evidence from prosecutors late on Thursday. Commonwealth prosecutor Anita Sharma didn't oppose bail and the case was adjourned until June 27. After his arrest in Indonesia Lockley was released without charge and sent back to Australia. Australian Federal Police issued Lockley with a notice to appear in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on June 6.

"Listening to the radio, singing along to the latest chart-topper, people often find themselves red-faced having to mumble a line or two. But, it turns out, struggling to catch every word of your favourite song is nothing to be ashamed of, with 65 percent of people admitting they can’t follow the lyrics of modern pop hits. And it’s not only contemporary groups that have fans straining to hear, with The Beatles, Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie also singled out in a new survey revealing the lyrics that most confuse British listeners. The Beatles song 'I am the Walrus' was voted as having the second most confusing lyrics by 27 per cent of Brits in a survey by Blinkbox music . The line which left the largest number . of people (30%) scratching their heads was, ‘Are we human, or are we . dancer?’ from the song Human by American rock group The Killers, which . reached number three in the UK charts. The band’s lead singer Brandon Flowers has previously said the odd line was inspired by a quote from journalist Hunter S. Thompson: ‘We’re raising a generation of dancers,’ critiquing the conformity of modern society. The frontman told MTV: ‘It’s taken from a quote by Thompson: “We’re raising a generation of dancers,” and I took it and ran. I guess it bothers people that it’s not grammatically correct, but I think I’m allowed to do whatever I want.’ The Killers were voted as having the most confusing lyrics of all in their song with the line 'Are we human, or are we dancer?' from the tune Human . 'What about elephants? Have we lost their trust?': Michael Jackson's Earth Song left 18 per cent of Brits confused . Second . place was taken by The Beatles, with 27 percent of people failing to . grasp the famously confusing line: ‘I am the eggman, they are the . eggman, I am the walrus, goo goo g’joob’, from their 1967 song I Am The . Walrus, the B-side to their number one hit Hello, Goodbye. 1.‘Are we human, or are we dancer?’ – The Killers, Human - 30% . 2.‘I am the eggman, they are the eggmen, I am the walrus, goo goo g’joob’ – The Beatles, I Am The Walrus - 27% . 3.‘What about elephants? Have we lost their trust?’- Michael Jackson, Earth Song - 18% . 4.‘Tom bol li de se de moi ya, hey jambo jumbo’ - Lionel Richie, All Night Long - 12% . 5.‘Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad’ - Carly Rae Jepson, Call Me Maybe -11% . 6.‘Beats so big I’m stepping on leprechauns’ - Black Eyed Peas, Boom Boom Pow - 10% . 7.‘The reflex is an only child, he’s waiting in the park’ - Duran Duran, The Reflex - 8% . 8.‘Club Tropicana, drinks are free, fun and sunshine, there’s enough for everyone, all that’s missing is the sea’ - Wham!, Club Tropicana – 8% . 9.‘Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter, and my daddy said stay away from Juliet.’ – Taylor Swift, Love Story - 7% . 10.‘Slowly walking down the hall, faster than a cannonball’-Oasis, Champagne Supernova-7% . There . have been several explanations put forward for the unusual lyrics, but . Martin Cloonan, professor of popular music politics at Glasgow . University, said: ‘John Lennon spoke of writing some of this while on an . acid trip, which might help explain things. ‘It is an . exercise in surrealism and word play – a true highlight of UK . psychedelia. Lennon did once declare that ‘The Walrus was Paul’ but it . appears to in fact be a reference to Lewis Carroll’s The Walrus and the . Carpenter and so, a reference to surreal or imaginary worlds.’ Lennon . himself told Playboy magazine in an interview that the song was part of . his ‘[Bob] Dylanesque period’ which was characterised by ‘the trick of . never saying what you mean but giving the impression of something more. Where more or less can be read into it. It’s a good game.’ Michael Jackson completes the top three, . with 18 percent of people struggling with the Earth Song lyrics: ‘What . about the elephants? Have we lost their trust?’ The famously eccentric Jackson wrote Earth Song, which reached number one in the UK charts, as a protest over his concerns regarding animal welfare and the environment but it is branded ‘misjudged’ by Professor Cloonan. Explaining the words 'Tom bo li de se de moi ya, hey jambo jumbo,' in Lionel Richie’s All Night Long, Professor Cloonan said: 'Richie has himself admitted that the lyrics are ‘a wonderful joke’ and an attempt to insert some African dialect into the song, which he couldn’t do in time, so just made up. They have no meaning outside of sounding right in the song.' Gobbledegook: Ever sang 'Tom bol li de se de moi ya, hey jambo jumbo' from Lionel Richie's song All Night Long and wondered what you were saying? If so then you're not alone - 12 per cent of Brits polled said they didn't have the foggiest either . But he admitted he was baffled by the Black Eyed Peas 'Beats so big I'm stepping on leprechauns'. He said: 'Sometimes I think we just have to accept songwriters are strange.' When asked for their reasons for failing to follow the songs, 40 percent of people said it was because they simply could not make out the words, 27 percent said the lack of logic made them think they had misheard the lyrics, while ten percent said the use of slang puzzled them. Almost two-thirds (64 percent) said the problem had become worse over time. Despite the issue, 28 percent said that not understanding all the lyrics to a song would not stop them from enjoying it. This is borne out by the fact that, out of the ten songs voted to have the most confusing lines, nine made it into the UK top ten – the exception is Oasis’s Champagne Supernova – including four number ones. The poll, conducted by blinkbox music, also asked people to vote for the modern pop star with the worst lyrics. Miley Cyrus came first with 17 percent of the vote, followed by the rapper Pitbull, American pop star Robin Thicke, The Voice judge Will.i.am and his group The Black Eyed Peas, Sting, country singer Taylor Swift, Robbie Williams, Duran Duran frontman Simon Le Bon, Noel Gallagher and Brandon Flowers of The Killers.","Poll of 2,000 Brits reveals more than half of us mumble along to songs without knowing what we're singing .

"Bobby Beale being unmasked as the killer of his half-sister Lucy in EastEnders was not the only surprising plot twist in the last seven days. Over in west London, Matthew Benham, the owner of Championship Brentford, confirmed the equally remarkable news that the club and manager Mark Warburton would part company in the summer. And if fans of the BBC soap were left disappointed that after 10 months of twists and turns an 11-year-old was revealed as the killer, then the Griffin Park faithful were left equally confused that the man who led them to promotion last season and is in the process of guiding them to their best season in 70 years is now set to depart. Mark Warburton celebrates after Chris Long's strike settled the tie and kept them in the hunt for the play-offs . It took less than a minute for the fans on the Ealing Road Terrace to start chanting Warburton’s name during Saturday’s excellent win. But anyone thinking that was a dig aimed at the owner were proved wrong as those same fans started singing ‘There’s only one Matthew Benham’ straight after. Benham, 43, invested in the club when they faced going out of business and by funding the new ground half a mile down the road has secured Brentford’s long-term future. Jonathan Douglas celebrates after opening the scoring for Brentford in their clash with Bournemouth . Many see Benham’s decision to part with Warburton and adopt a more continental style of management as a gamble. But that is exactly what Benham is. A gambler. A physics graduate from Oxford University, he became a financial trader before moving on to become one of the world’s leading gamblers. He set up Smartodds, a company which provides statistical and qualitative research to its clients in order for them to bet on football matches. The firm has developed a sophisticated probability model which takes into account theories, trends and anomalies to help get the best results. Matthew Benham, the owner of Championship Brentford, has had a clash of philosophy with Warburton . Since taking over Brentford in 2012, Benham has shunned publicity and rarely gives interviews. But he did talk to Michael Calvin for his 2013 book on football scouting called The Nowhere Men. ‘If I am looking at a striker I absolutely do not care about his goalscoring record,’ Benham told Calvin. ‘For me, the only thing that is interesting is how the team do collectively, offensively and defensively, within the context of an individual’s performance. ‘I always thought Alan Shearer gave his team an amazing outlet. The team would be under pressure. You knew if you hoofed it in his general direction there’d be a high chance the ball would stick, and he’d win a foul. That’s the great defensive service Shearer is offering. Warburton applauds the home Griffin Park crowd having defeated promotion rivals Bournemouth . ‘The fact a front player can hold the ball up means you are not going to concede another attack. ‘We’re working towards a new football model, we’re pretty far away. It is a computational issue.’ This approach does not fit well with Warburton’s philosophy. After Saturday’s win the manager said: ‘The emphasis is going slightly more to that mathematical model allied with the traditional scouting methods. ‘That is what the club have chosen and I have to respect that. But if I disagree with something now then I would rather be honest rather than leave in six months and look back with regret.’ For a club like Brentford the way to success is either to do what everyone else is doing and try and do it better. Or do things differently and try and get an edge. The owner accepts that getting rid of Warburton and going down this new route is a risk. But what else would you expect? GRAPPLE OF THE WEEK .

"Jose Mourinho has called for Burnley striker Ashley Barnes to be banned for what he claims was a 'criminal' and 'career-ending' tackle on Nemanja Matic. Matic was sent off for a retaliatory shove in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley and will miss three games including the Capital One Cup final against Spurs next Sunday. But the Chelsea boss understands why the red mist descended on the Serbian midfielder. Jose Mourinho says the incidents  in the 1-1 draw with Burnley were 'clear for everyone, not just me' Chelsea manager Mourinho was appearing on Sky Sports on Sunday morning to discuss the incidents . Mourinho says referees should be given assistance by video technology if they can't get decisions right . A refereeing performance in a Southern Mediterranean or South American country like Martin Atkinson's at Stamford Bridge on Saturday would have started accusations of corruption. Here in England thankfully we accept honest incompetence. Click here to read Graham Poll's analysis . 'End of career,' said Mourinho. 'I can't find words to describe what that player did. I can't find an adjective any stronger than to say end of career. 'Matic is a lucky guy. Matic had reason to lose his emotions. What are the consequences of Matic's push on the other player? Nothing. One second later, he stands and goes. The consequence for Matic could be the end of career.' Mourinho noted a seven-match ban imposed on Barnes two years ago for tripping a referee and used it to make a point about officials being influenced by Diego Costa's reputation. This studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Nemanja Matic and Mourinho backed up his player . Matic's reaction to Barnes's tackle earned the Serbian a red card - he'll now miss the Capital One Cup final . Matic is sent off by Martin Atkinson after reacting angrily to a horrid tackle on Saturday at Stamford Bridge . Referee Atkinson shows Matic a straight red card after his altercation with Barnes in the second half . 'This Burnley player involved in two actions has a grey past,' said the Chelsea boss, speaking on Sky Sports less than 24 hours after refusing to discuss the incident. 'There was a very dark point in his career when he was suspended for seven matches, because of a big incident with a referee.' He also criticised Sky's coverage of Costa's stamp on Liverpool's Emre Can, and added: 'When you say Diego's 'crimes' because he put his foot on another man you have to say this is a criminal tackle.' Mourinho admitted his comments could lead him back into trouble with the Football Association and he might be right, since he accused them of being influenced by things happening beyond the confines of the game in question.

FA disciplinary chiefs will study referee Martin Atkinson's report before they examine the two Barnes incidents - the tackle on Matic and a challenge on Branislav Ivanovic. The clash with Ivanovic is less likely to be reviewed as Atkinson awarded a free-kick at the time. Roberto Martinez, meanwhile, accused Mourinho's players of pressurising referee Jon Moss during Everton's defeat at Chelsea, two weeks ago, when Gareth Barry was dismissed and Ivanovic grabbed James McCarthy by the neck in the ensuing skirmish. 'I never felt there was any consistency in judging every action equally between the two teams,' said Martinez, in his programme notes for yesterday's 2-2 draw against Leicester. 'Unfortunately, the sending off really late on reflected the emphasis that the home team had in trying to influence the referee and take advantage of their role of playing at Stamford Bridge. 'Big games need strong referees but for the future we relish the challenge of finding the way of overcoming these disadvantages by playing our football.'

"Arsenal supporters are furious that their FA Cup quarter-final against Manchester United at Old Trafford has been scheduled for a Monday night and have accused the Football Association of damaging the competition. The scheduling decision, in order to show it live on BBC One, has left Arsenal fans unable to catch trains back to London after the game, which kicks off at 7:45pm on March 9. They are angry that the demands of the television companies have been pandered to by the FA at their expense. Olivier Giroud celebrates after scoring Arsenal's second goal in their 2-0 win against Middlesbrough . Arsenal fans will hope that a late train service will be provided from Manchester Piccadilly station . Arsenal Supporters' Trust spokesman Tim Payton said: ‘One of the magic things of the FA Cup is the large away fan allocation but the Football Association are damaging their own competition. They are sullying the brand of the cup. ‘The football authorities need to explain why with four quarter-finals we can’t play two on Saturday and two on Sunday. ‘This is another example of broadcasters and their money dictating to the inconvenience of fans. Broadcasters should remember, without fans at the ground there would be no atmosphere for them to show.’ Arsenal are working with Virgin Trains, who provide the service between London and Manchester, and exploring their options to help supporters get back after the match.

"So, Joao Moutinho picked Arsenal apart in the Champions League, that name rings a bell… . Chelsea manager? Hates referees, Sky Sports, Ashley Barnes, Jamie Redknapp, etc? Moutinho… Moutinho… T-T-T… tinho… . Only kidding, yes the Portuguese midfielder with loads of international caps and those oh-so-underrated Iberian midfield qualities of keeping the ball, passing it to a team-mate, getting it back, controlling the game, sliding through passes to the strikers. Doesn't score much, but you know… . Joao Moutinho impressed as Monaco beat Arsenal 3-1 in the Champions League last-16 first leg . The Portuguese star and his Monaco team-mates celebrate at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night . That's him, good player, eh, why don't one of the English teams sign him? Well, they've tried. For the last seven years they've been trying, since David Moyes tried to sign him for Everton and made an £11.8million offer when Moutinho was still a little-known Portugal U21 international who was catching the eye at Sporting Lisbon. Always had a good eye, did Moyes, why didn't he get him? The buy-out clause was nearly £20m. Everton signed a 20-year-old Belgian called Marouane Fellaini instead. Everton manager David Moyes (rightwas keen on signing the midfielder when he was at Sporting Lisbon . How did Moutinho wind up at Monaco? He stayed in Lisbon for two more years and then moved to Porto under cloud with Sporting chairman Jose Eduardo Bettencourt branding him a 'rotten apple'. It was a complicated deal which included his economic rights being split between the two clubs and a third-party investor. This tangle probably didn't help when Tottenham tried to sign him in before the transfer deadline in August 2012. Even with an hour's extension granted by the Premier League, they were eight minutes late with the paper work and he went back to Porto. Moutinho made the move to Monaco after starring at Porto - with James Rodriguez joining him in the transfer . That must have been another of those strokes of genius by the transfer master Daniel Levy… . Could be. Andre Villas-Boas was furious by all accounts. Having just replaced Spurs boss Harry Redknapp, he named Moutinho as a priority target, a fee of £24m was eventually agreed and then the deal collapsed in stoppage time. AVB must've been hopping mad, literally. A year later, the midfielder moved to Monaco as the cheaper end of a £51m package for both him and James Rodriguez. At the time, Monaco's new Russian owners were trying to sign anyone who moved, including Cristiano Ronaldo. Daniel Levy and Tottenham were minutes away from acquiring Moutinho's services at one stage . I thought Monaco had sold all their big names… . Yes, the strategy quickly changed. James was sold to Real Madrid, a year later, after an impressive World Cup and Radamel Falcao was loaned to Manchester United where he festers on the bench. There were rumours of a bust-up between Moutinho and the club and he was said to have thrown in a transfer request back in August when the exodus was in full swing. But he stayed and says he is focused on the season at Monaco and is in good touch, as Arsenal discovered. He returned from an ankle injury in time to sparkle at the Emirates and remind everyone he is perhaps the last of the club's prized assets, but the French club are producing a new generation promising young players. Moutinho returned from an ankle injury in time to sparkle at the Emirates Stadium . Will we see him in England? There is still interest from all the big clubs, including Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United. They are aware of his situation and Monaco's change of strategy under the strict FFP rules. But they will be aware of his complicated ownership background. With his previous failed attempts to move to the Premier League he might accept his destiny is elsewhere.

"Dominique Strauss-Kahn was last night being held in police custody as officers questioned him over an international prostitution ring. The disgraced former head of the International Monetary Fund – who lost his job amid claims he tried to rape a New York chambermaid – could face jail over the ‘sex parties’ he has admitted attending around the world. Strauss-Kahn, 62, whose wife Anne Sinclair is standing by him, has made the extraordinary claim that he was unaware the women at the orgies were prostitutes because ‘they were naked at the time’. Arrested: Former International Monetary Fund director Dominique Strauss-Kahn arrives by car for questioning in Lille, Northern France. He faces criminal charges relating to an illegal prostitute racket . Huge interest: Dominique Strauss-Kahn's car is surrounded by the media today. He will be held in custody until Wednesday at least before bail can be considered . But detectives have told Strauss-Kahn, who once had hopes of becoming president of France, that there is evidence linking him to ‘complicity in pimping’ and ‘misuse of corporate assets’. He will face criminal charges if prosecutors can prove the prostitutes were being paid with fraudulently obtained money – in this case funds from a major construction company – and that Strauss-Kahn knew about it. His dreams of high office a  distant memory, he was yesterday driven to Lille police station in northern France in a Mercedes  limousine with blacked-out windows after being summoned for questioning. He will be held in custody until today at least before bail can be considered, according to a source close to the case. Strauss-Kahn was a leading  member of the French Socialist Party who planned to run for president this year, after years of quietly and diligently climbing the political ladder. Couple: Dominique Strauss-Kahn is pictured here previously with his wife Anne Sinclair. She has caused astonishment by staying with her husband, despite him admitting to numerous affairs . But last May he was engulfed in scandal and had to resign from his prestigious post at the IMF after being accused of attempting to rape Nafissatou Diallo, a 32-year-old chambermaid, in a New York hotel. He insisted the sexual encounter was ‘inappropriate’ but not violent, and prosecutors eventually dropped the charges because of doubts about the alleged victim’s credibility. Alleged victim: New York chambermaid Nafissatou Diallo . She is still threatening a civil action. Shortly afterwards French writer Tristane Banon came forward and accused Strauss-Kahn of trying to rape her during an interview for a book she was writing in 2002, when she was 23. French prosecutors dropped their investigation last October, saying the incident had happened too long ago to be taken to trial. Strauss-Kahn admits taking part in orgies and having what he describes as an ‘uninhibited sex life’, but insists ‘he never paid a centime’ for it. ‘I have a horror of prostitutes and pimping,’ he said. Although using prostitutes is legal in France, supplying them to others and misusing company funds to pay for them are not. Strauss-Kahn is accused of being involved in a high-level pimping ring which supplied the women to men at the sex parties. There is also a suggestion some of the women may have been under-age. Strauss-Kahn, . who lives in Paris with his determinedly loyal wife, allegedly attended . parties arranged by the ring at a hotel and  restaurant in the French . capital and, most recently, in Washington DC just before the attempted . rape scandal. His mobile phone records are said to show he used the services of at least ten prostitutes from France and Belgium. In . December, his lawyer, Henri Leclerc, revealed Strauss-Kahn’s . extraordinary defence – he did not know the women were prostitutes. Questions to answer: Journalists film and take pictures of  disgraced former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn as he enters the gendarme station yesterday . He . said: ‘He could easily not have known, because as you can  imagine, at . these kinds of parties you’re not always dressed, and I challenge you to . distinguish a naked prostitute from any other naked woman.’ Strauss-Kahn had previously asked to speak to judges leading the inquiry to put the record straight. The prostitution ring is said to have operated out of Lille’s upmarket Carlton Hotel, and a number of men have already been charged with organising orgies in what the French press has called ‘the Carlton affair’. A building company executive is also accused of using its funds to entertain guests at the parties. If convicted of ‘complicity  in pimping’, Strauss-Kahn would face a maximum prison sentence of five years. ‘Misuse of corporate assets’  carries a seven-year jail-term.","Dominique Strauss-Kahn will be held in custody until 'Wednesday at least' before bail can be considered .

"The mother of gang rape victim Jyoti Singh Pandey celebrated the death sentences handed to her daughter's four killers - saying 'she is now at peace'. Asha Devi watched her daughter suffer for 13 days in hospital from eventually fatal internal injuries after being repeatedly raped on a Delhi bus. Sitting by the bedside in a hospital in Singapore, Asha, 46, promised her 23-year-old child justice would be served. Finally, after a fast-tracked trial, all four rapists were sentenced to death at in Delhi on Friday - gym instructor Vinay Sharma, 20, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, . fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26. Relieved: Parents Badri Singh, right, and Asha Devi celebrated the four hanging sentences for the men that raped and killed their daughter Jyoti. Asha, 46, said it was her dying wish . Convicted (clockwise from top left): Hanging sentences were handed to gym instructor Vinay Sharma, 20, Mukesh Singh, 26, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, at Saket Court on Friday . Ram Singh, co-accused and . widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his . cell in March. He was the brother of convicted Mukesh Singh, who drove the bus during . the ghastly crime. A minor who was also accused has been sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. The grieving mother told the Sunday Mirror: 'She kept saying her only wish was to see them hanged. I know this result will help her be at peace now.' 'Words cannot explain the horror. She cried every time she talked about it. I will never forget how disgustingly brutal they were. 'I remember trying to make her eat. But she was in so much pain she couldn't even eat a spoonful. 'She kept telling me to sit and hold her hand instead.' Jyoti, a physiotherapy student, sparked a global debate about mysogyny in India when she was attacked on 16 December last year. The international attention forced judges to prioritise the case - and the lawyer's association in the district of Saket reportedly refused to defend the accused. Justice: A police van, carrying the four convicts, leaves Sadek Court in Delhi after a judge ruled death by hanging . Infuriated: Hordes of protesters calling for the rapists to be hanged gathered outside Satek Court on Friday . Gripped: The case shook the nation and the world. A lawyer emerged from the final day making a 'victory' sign . In January, Asha revealed that Jyoti wanted her rapists 'burnt alive'. Father Badri Singh, 53, told the paper he 'felt so relieved' when the judge ruled death by hanging. He said: 'When the judge announced the death penalty I stared right at these men and I saw the fear of death in their eyes. Two of them were crying even. 'But I wasn't bothered and I had no sympathies for them. I will never forgive or forget what they did to my daughter. They're now paying the true price for what they chose to do that night.' The couple added that Jyoti was born a fighter, having spent her first month in intensive care. Even when she was in hospital she believed she would battle through, they explained. Determined to fight for equality between sexes in honour of his daughter, Mr Singh declared her death has been an inspiration for India. He said: 'I feel her life has been sacrificed to teach the world that rapes and this kind of behaviour cannot go on.' When the sentence was announced all convicts broke down apart from Akshay Thakur. Each were ordered to pay 55,000 rupees to the family of their victim. In his closing speech, Judge Khanna said he could not turn a blind eye to rising cases of sexual assault against . women. He said: 'The convicts, in the most . barbaric manner, pulled out her internal organs with their bare hands and caused her irreparable injuries. 'She and her . friend were then thrown out of the moving bus in naked condition, . profusely bleeding, on a cold winter night. 'Their unprovoked crime . demonstrated exceptional depravity of mind of the convicts. 'The crime of such nature requires exemplary punishment.'","Asha Devi, 46, said daughter Jyoti Singh wanted her rapists to be killed .

"Repair work has begun on a massive sinkhole that grabbed worldwide attention after appearing on a scenic golf course in Inverness-shire. Bosses of the course are relieved work is under way after drainage issues caused a 23ft long and 10ft wide crater on the seventh green at Traigh Golf Course in Arisaig last November. Fears had escalated that the stunning 68-par, nine-hole course could become a bog, and bosses faced a funding crisis to repair the damage. Work is underway after drainage issues had caused a 23ft long and 10ft wide crater at Traigh Golf Course . It was estimated that the repairs could cost in the region of £16,000 and 200 tonnes of sand would be needed to fill the pit. At one point the 80-member club faced an uncertain future. The Traigh Golf Course committee has now confirmed contractors have started work on the massive sinkhole and hopes are high that the course will be playable for the start of the golf season on April 1. A spokesman said: 'Corries of Fort William have started works which are scheduled to take about two weeks. It looks a bit messy just now, but all should be well for the start of the season on 1 April. 'The course remains open for members to play, weather permitting, and when the new season starts visitors will again be welcomed back. A digger and a tractor were used to help fix the damage and a new drainage pipe has now been installed . 'Some of the costs will be covered by insurance and the owners, who remain passionate about the course, have confirmed that they will be making up the shortfall. All being well, we might even have a new feature to make the seventh more interesting.' A digger and a tractor were used to help fix the damage and a new drainage pipe has now been installed in the 11ft deep hole. Course admin manager Bill Henderson, 70 said: 'The hole is now just about history because the work started earlier this week and we are renewing the whole drainage pipe from the course down to the sea. 'That should be finished soon and then we can get the work completed and get the course open. Fears had escalated that the stunning 68 par course could become a bog and bosses  faced a funding crisis . 'The money to repair it has mostly come from private money and a little bit of insurance. 'I couldn't believe the publicity we got when the sinkhole appeared on the course, it seemed it was everywhere around the world. 'But I just hope that now more people have heard about the course they will want to come and play it. 'It is a lovely course with great views over the isles round about us and it will be ready for play come the start of the season.' Traigh Golf Course is a picturesque 68-par course with 80 members in Arisaig, Inverness-shire . Sinkholes are depressions in the ground caused by a collapse in the surface layer and can be devastaing . Traigh Golf Course is also notable for being the most westerly golf course on the UK mainland. Heavy rain and poor drainage saw the hole suddenly appear in November. Golf fans posted on Twitter and Facebook in support of the club that is more than100 years old. TV shows in the US featured the hole on their golf coverage and it made news reports in China, Germany, Holland and Canada.

"The Bayern Munich players laced up their boots one final time ahead of making their way to Lviv to face Ukrainian opponents Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League last 16. With the game relocated from Shakhtar's usual surroundings in the conflict-torn eastern city of Donetsk, Pep Guardiola's men were looking sharp ahead of their 1500 mile round-trip.

With Ribery netting the last of the eight goals at the Allianz Arena, and the stellar Arjen Robben curling in his 13th league goal of the season in a near-perfect performance from the home side, the odds look to be stacked in Bayern's favour. Added to this, Shakhtar will also be travelling some 800 miles themselves to take part in the face off and will be without duo Bernard and Taras Stepanenko. 'For us, [not playing in Donetsk] is a big problem, because we are not playing at home, we are playing away, a new arena,' Shakhtar captain Darijo Srna told Associated Press.

"Luke Shaw and Phil Jones believe Manchester United's home fans can play a crucial role in helping their side get back to winning ways against Sunderland at the weekend. The Red Devils duo are desperate to make amends for Manchester United's 2-1 Barclays Premier League defeat against Swansea City in their last league outing. Manchester United have lost just two games at Old Trafford this season - against Swansea and Southampton - and the England duo have put their consistent home form down to their strong fan base. Luke Shaw (right) is looking forward to play at Old Trafford following Manchester United's defeat at Swansea . Phil Jones (left) insists United's home match against Sunderland will be no easy ride . Shaw, speaking to Manchester United's official website, said: 'We always get that extra push at home from the fans and they've also been amazing away from home as well. 'At home it's always different - when teams come to Old Trafford they can feel that atmosphere and it can be a scary place for other teams. It’s a big pitch and United have always been strong at home and won a lot of games here so that’s a very important factor as well. 'I always look forward to playing every game but we’re especially looking to make sure we win this one.

United fell to their fifth defeat of the season against Swansea despite taking the lead through Daley Blind . And Jones added: 'You have to stick together and get back on the training pitch and prepare well. That’s what we've been doing this week. It's an important game for us. 'It won’t be easy, Sunderland are a tough team but we've done well at home recently and we need to bounce back from the defeat at the weekend. It’s never nice to lose a game.

"When David Luiz was sold to Paris Saint-Germain for around £50million last summer, most Chelsea fans couldn't quite believe that their club had acquired such a fee for the Brazilian. Last season saw Luiz slip down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge as Jose Mourinho put his faith in John Terry and Gary Cahill leaving the 27-year-old limited to the occasional appearance in defensive midfield. However, when analysing the Brazilian's statistics in a PSG shirt, there is an argument that Luiz has actually been outshining the 2014-15 Blues backline. David Luiz (left) was sold from to Paris Saint-Germain for £50million last summer . In his 25 Ligue 1 and Champions League games for the Parisians, Luiz has won an impressive 147 duels which is more than Chelsea's defensive duo Cahill (116) and Terry (122). Luiz, who can often be seen stepping in front of his opponents in a bid to win the ball quickly, has also recorded 60 interceptions - more than Cahill and Terry's combined total of 47. It must be said that Luiz is now playing for arguably the best team in a far less competitive league, but his figures still go some way to proving that he still had a lot to offer Chelsea - particularly with the dip in form of England vice-captain Cahill. Luiz has won 147 duels and made 60 interception in 25 games for his new club . John Terry (left) and Gary Cahill have started the majority of Chelsea games alongside each other this season . Terry has made 145 appearances in 30 games for Chelsea so far this season . After several poor performances in a blue shirt, Cahill has had to look on as French youngster Zouma flourishes with every chance he is given by Mourinho and the 20-year-old has already made nine appearances in a blue shirt. Despite conceding just 20 Premier League goals so far this season, the Chelsea defence has rarely looked as solid as games in which Nemanja Matic and Luiz sat in front of the back four last season for the west London club's biggest games such as the 1-0 victory against Manchester City in February, 2014. Blues fans will argue that Luiz's style of play would be too dangerous now that their team play a more expansive, possession-based games following the introductions of Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa.

"Perhaps when Wayne Rooney leads Manchester United on to the pitch, it will all begin to sink in for Cambridge United and their manager Richard Money. The club’s cycle of gloom ended last year with a return to the Football League and since the FA Cup fourth round draw paired them with United, this tie has been transformed into a celebration of their survival against the odds. Here is the happy ending: a windfall of £250,000 from the Football Association and a couple of hours on prime-time BBC as reward for those responsible for keeping the club alive when fate conspired against them. The Abbey Stadium, home of Cambridge United, will host Manchester United in the FA Cup on Friday night .

Louis van Gaal will lead his Manchester United side to Cambridge seeking to avoid the Cup banana skin . Wayne Rooney will lead the Manchester United side at the Abbey Stadium on Friday night . While United's expected line-up cost £235.5m to assemble, Cambridge were put together for nothing . It is an uplifting reminder of the power of the FA Cup. But Money and his players insist this is not the end. They will pour everything they have into trying to beat United or (even better from a financial perspective) take them back to Old Trafford for a replay. Money has already warned his players that shirts swapped with United’s megastars after tonight’s game must be replaced at their own cost. A shirt-swap souvenir with Rooney and Co will cost £39.99 at the club shop — unless they can persuade chairman Dave Doggett to dip into the cash the League Two club will earn from the game. Even if Cambridge are beaten, Friday night's match still represents a triumph for individuals who have made sacrifices during nine years outside the Football League — among them Colin Proctor, a director on behalf of the supporters’ trust Cambridge Fans United, who also draws footballers and sells his sketches to support the club’s youth system.

It won't be the most comfortable of nights for Manchester United's substitutes . It is a hobby which delivered a distant connection to Rooney, via David Moyes, the former United boss who played 86 times for Cambridge from 1983-85. Proctor stayed in touch with Moyes and the pair were in conversation when then Everton boss mentioned an exciting teenage prospect about to break through at Goodison Park. ‘He said he’d earn the club £2million,’ said Proctor, who sketched the young Rooney from a photograph. He posted the drawing to Moyes who got the youngster to sign it and send it back. Proctor is now in possession of a very early Rooney autograph — a spiky scribble in Biro beside a pencil sketch of Rooney in Everton blue — and he will go in pursuit of an updated version for a new caricature. No one can begrudge a souvenir for the 76-year-old who sold his lifelong collection of Cambridge memorabilia, dating back to 1947, for £10,000 — less than a third of its estimated value — to save the club when they were in administration and facing a winding-up order.

Wealthy directors like Doggett and his predecessor Paul Barry have dug into their pockets and chief executive Jez George — the club’s former manager — launched into a series of fund-raising events. ‘I did a couple of walks for our academy when we had no funding,’ said George. ‘I and the centre of excellence manager did a walk from Torquay to Cambridge when we had lost to them in the play-off final. 'It highlighted how ludicrous it is that one football result dictates whether your academy gets funding. It’s crazy. ‘I walked round all the clubs in the Conference and then to Wembley, and that was 420 miles. Last year I did 26 marathons in 26 days to raise about £100,000 for our Trust.

Protests have persisted in and around Ferguson since Brown's death. And protesters have pledged continued civil unrest until officer Darren Wilson is arrested and charged in Brown's death. At around 11pm ET, Twitter lit up with reports of possible looting and rioting on West Florissant Avenue, where several hundred protesters converged chanting, 'we want an indictment, police don't like it,' and 'no justice, no peace.' Police responded in full force to the impromptu rally, setting the stage for yet another tense standoff. The Blaze reported that a group of demonstrators damaged the Beauty Town supply store as screams and the sounds of gunfire filled the night air. St. Louis Alderman Antonio French said one protester yelled, 'burn it down,' after smashing a window at the store. The owner of the targeted business told KMOV that this is the third time that his store has been looted. So far, he has lost more than $100,000 in stolen merchandise.

A second memorial, background right, was rebuilt by residents after it burned early Tuesday, causing many who live near the scene to become upset . On Twitter, French blamed the fire at the Michael Brown memorial for jeopardizing a 'fragile peace' in Ferguson. Ferguson resident Meldon Moffitt said the fire started around 6.30am Tuesday on Canfield Drive, the street where Brown was fatally shot last month by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. About two dozen residents gathered at the site Tuesday morning, many of them angry. One man said it was like a grave being desecrated. Ferguson resident Marcus Henley told MSNBC 'I woke up to it. They light candles with no problem. I think somebody set it on fire. And that says a lot to me.' Many who gathered at the site Tuesday blamed police for the blaze, even as the chief said officers did everything they could to keep the stuffed animals and other items from burning. 'It's the same as if somebody came and desecrated a grave,' Anthony Levine of Florissant, another St. Louis suburb, said as he studied the charred scene and shook his head. More than six weeks after Brown's death, residents and others remain upset about the way his body lay in the street for more than four hours while police investigated the shooting. Many insist he was trying to surrender, with his hands up. The memorial fire and ensuing outcry was a reminder of the simmering tensions that have only deepened since Brown's death, which prompted several nights of riots and protests in the predominantly black suburb where just three blacks serve on a 53-officer force. People who showed up at the fire scene doubted a candle was the culprit, though. Most were certain someone set the blaze. Some said they smelled gasoline. 'That's very disrespectful to burn down a memorial to someone that got killed,' said Meldon Moffitt, who lives nearby. ""That's just wrong! The police came here and watched it burn.'

Investigation: Police Chief Tom Jackson said the fire department was called after a police officer with a fire extinguisher could not put the fire out . Victim: Michael Brown was fatally shot in August by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson . Ferguson police spokesman Devin James says the cause of the fire is under investigation. Police Chief Tom Jackson said in a statement to KSDK 'We're all saddened by the fire that was reported at one of the Michael Brown Memorials this morning and are trying to obtain as much information as possible to determine what happened. At this time the cause is unknown. 'To anyone who believes we didn't do everything in our power to put this fire out I want to apologize and let you know that was not the case. Some of our police cars are equipped with an emergency kit that includes a fire extinguisher and Sgt. (Harry) Dilworth was first on the scene and attempted to put the fire out but couldn't so he alerted the Fire Department and they ultimately put out the fire. 'Anyone who has any information or videos please reach out to us as this will help as we investigate this incident.' 'There was no way a candle did this. That fire was burning too high and too hot,' David Whitt told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. KMOV reporter Laura Hettiger, who was on the scene, tweeted the fire took place at 'around 6:40' and that no one was injured. Brown's death led to several days of protests and unrest in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. Investigations into the shooting by a state grand jury and the U.S. Department of Justice are ongoing.

"Oldham Athletic could make a shock bid to have Paul Scholes as their new manager. Current Latics supremo Lee Johnson is expected to be named boss of League One rivals Barnsley on Wednesday. Sportsmail understands the 33-year-old is due to be unveiled at Oakwell  barring any last-minute hitches after a compensation package was agreed with Oldham. League One outfit Oldham Athletic are interested in enticing Paul Scholes to Boundary Park . Scholes (second left) has turned his hand to TV punditry since hanging up his boots . The 40-year-old, pictured after winning the Champions League in 2008, won 11 Premier League titles at United . And the play-off chasing Latics could now turn to the United legend, a boyhood fan who lives in the town, initially until the end of the season. Whether Scholes, now a respected TV pundit and newspaper columnist, would be open to taking the job is unclear. But Oldham chairman Simon Corney is a longstanding friend of the 40-year-old who has previously helped out and monitored training sessions at the club. A source at Oldham said: 'It's certainly something that would capture the imagination and it is something that is being considered.' Scholes, who was part of the ITV team at the Etihad Stadium for Manchester City's 2-1 Champions League defeat by Barcelona on Tuesday night, is also a co-owner of non-League Salford City along with a number of his Class of '92 team-mates. Johnson, who was the league's youngest manager when he took over at Oldham, has won praise for the work he has done at Boundary Park. Current Oldham manager Lee Johnson is close to completing a move to League One rivals Barnsley . Scholes, pictured watching Oldham's 3-1 FA Cup defeat by Everton in February 2013, is a fan of the Latics . In his first season he guided them away from relegation and in his second he performed an admirable rebuilding job after losing his top players. Oldham currently lie in ninth position, two points outside the play-offs. Scholes has often been spotted in the stands watching the Latics. Following England's 1-0 win over Argentina at the 2002 World Cup the midfielder was asked by reporters who his favourite player was. He gave the name of Frankie Bunn, the Oldham striker who scored six goals in a 1989 League Cup victory over Scarborough. When asked to name another, Scholes replied: 'Andy Ritchie'. Scholes posed with Oldham's new 2014-15 away shirt back at the beginning of the season . The former Manchester United midfielder played his entire club career under Sir Alex Ferguson .

"It's always been Match Of The Day 2's job to be the more rock n' roll version of its Saturday night, big arena counterpart. The quirky use of music, voiceovers and graphics likes to play with convention. And on Sunday night, they really pushed the boat out by inviting Manchester City's most famous fan-with-a-band to take the middle seat in pundit corner. Musician and Manchester City fan Noel Gallagher made his first appearance on Match Of The Day 2 . Jermaine Jenas (left), Gallagher (middle) and Mark Lawrenson (right) appeared on Sunday night's show . In fact, the trio sitting opposite Mark Chapman looked like they could just as easily be about to share their thoughts with us on the latest floor-fillers from the hit parade. Jermaine Jenas, to Noel's right, would make a perfectly good ex-boy band member. While Mark Lawrenson to his left looked like he could be about to take the Bay City Rollers back out on the road again. But as Chappers pointed out, it was Noel's 'fan's eye view' that he was there for. Which included being filmed on a very successful trip to see his team take Newcastle United apart at The Etihad. After we'd seen Gallagher leaping about in the stands, Chapman asked him back in the studio if he missed being just in amongst the fans? The 47-year-old was in good spirits on the BBC's football highlights programme . Gallagher wasn't impressed with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho's appeared continued dig at refeeres . 'You sign too many autographs', replied Noel, clearly as someone wanting to keep his eye on the action. 'Although he did add '(there's) champagne in the director's box...and they've got these heated seats.' Having appeared to be something of the angry and cynical young pop star, Noel seems to have turned into a musician and grown-up who has no trouble keeping a twinkle in his eye nowadays. We saw that working well last November in his little Manchester derby-day battle with Gary Neville. And once again here he proved to be insightful, knowledgeable and witty. He warmed up for his contribution to the show by eulogising 'the Brodge' - better known to you and me as Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. Gallagher joked that if he was the referee he'd send Wayne Rooney (right) off before he put his boots on . Gallagher referred to Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers as 'the Brodge' on Sunday night's programme . 'One should never underestimate the Brodge' was Noel's prophetic advise about him and his resurging Liverpool team, before proclaiming 'power to the Brodge!'. This he did as part of a theme that he was to pursue throughout the night. Namely, have a pop at United. Because Gallagher was all about Liverpool staying in the top four, so as to keep Manchester United out of it. He then went on to point out, quite reasonably, that managers should take some responsibility in the issue of how to improve refereeing. He also said he wouldn't mind having a go on the whistle himself. But mainly, it would seem, because 'Rooney (would) be getting sent off before he put his boots on'. He was also quite happy to offer to sit alongside Sir Alex on the show should he be required to do so. I imagine a call was put into the Ferguson household immediately. There were also a few words to be had about Jose Mourinho, particularly for his 'digging out of referees'. But he did still concede that he thought it was going to be Chelsea's title, if only 'by two or three points, though'. Which must have been particularly galling for him. Because when Chappers asked him - at the end of a most entertaining programme that he fully contributed to - if seeing his team win the Champions League was his ultimate ambition, Noel pondered for a moment and replied 'if I'm honest, I'd like to win the Premier League more'. Which would be definitely, then, Noel? No, maybe?","Noel Gallagher was a pundit on Match Of The Day 2 on Sunday night .

"Louis van Gaal still intends to contest his FA disrepute charge despite asking the governing body for an extra 24 hours to officially respond. Van Gaal was charged for criticising referee Chris Foy after United’s 0-0 draw with Cambridge in the FA Cup two and a half weeks ago, with United subsequently winning the replay. 'We knew in advance everything would be against us - but you have to survive,' the 63-year-old said after his side were forced to a rematch by a stubborn Cambridge performance at Abbey Stadium.

"The U.S. Army is set to replace its 'Universal Camouflage Pattern' less than a decade after it was first introduced at a cost of $5billion. The design, which combines grey and green blotches in a pixellated pattern, was supposed to disguise soldiers equally well in desert and in more temperate terrain. But critics claim that the camouflage did not work properly in either environment - and some have even suggested that its main purpose was to make the Army appear 'more cool' than the Marines. Scroll down for video . Dangerous: This pixellated camouflage design fails to protect soldiers fighting in the Middle East, experts say . Innovative: But the original design is said to be no improvement on wave-based camouflage patterns . The inspiration for the innovative design, known as UCP, came after the start of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to The Daily. While soldiers were issued with desert camouflage uniforms, their darker equipment - including flak jackets - stood out against the light-coloured clothing, making troops dangerously conspicuous. So researchers at the United States Army Soldier Systems Center in Natick, Massachusetts got to work designing a replacement which could be used by soldiers wherever they are in the world. But their delicate work was held back by official meddling, accord to some of the people involved in the process. 'It got into political hands before the soldiers ever got the uniforms,' Cheryl Stewardson, a textile technologist at the centre, told The Daily. Redundant: The design is being replaced even though it has already cost the Army around $5billion . The problem was apparently that Army commanders were envious of a cutting-edge new camouflage recently developed by the Marine Corps which incorporated pixels rather than the more traditional waves of colour. So officials from PEO Soldier, which is responsible for procuring equipment, ordered developers to adapt their new grey-green colour scheme into the pixel pattern - even though experts argued this compromise would leave soldiers vulnerable in battle. 'Brand identity trumped camouflage utility,' according to military journalist Eric Graves. 'That's what this really comes down to: we can't allow the Marine Corps to look more cool than the Army.' The results, according to some of the soldiers who had to wear the new uniform after it was introduced in 2004, was a disaster. New look: This MultiCam design is a temporary replacement for the failed Universal Camouflage Pattern . 'Essentially, the Army designed a universal uniform that universally failed in every environment,' an Army specialist who served in Iraq told The Daily. 'The only time I have ever seen it work well was in a gravel pit.' He continued: 'As a cavalry scout, it is my job to stay hidden. Wearing a uniform that stands out this badly makes it hard to do our job effectively. If we can see our own guys across a distance because of it, then so can our enemy.' Now researchers are working on developing a replacement to the $5billion flop, and for the time being have introduced a temporary fix in the form of a new green and brown camouflage known as MultiCam. The permanent solution will not be ready for battlefield use until some time next year. When it is introduced, the UCP saga will formally come to an end, though not without a certain amount of recrimination within the military. 'You've got to look back and say what a huge waste of money that was,' camouflage expert Lawrence Holsworth said. 'UCP was such a fiasco.'

"Garry Monk had his first drop of alcohol in almost a year on Saturday evening, yet it was possible to imagine Louis van Gaal reclining with the same smug sense of a job well done. Such can be the occasional madness of old king Louis, the Manchester United manager who is either desperate to spare his team from public criticism or blind to their glaring shortcomings. Given his success at the top level, it seems highly unlikely to be the latter, though if he cannot see what most others can then a drama really will become a crisis. His assessment after losing 2-1 to Swansea was that United had been the ‘dominant team’. He was ‘amazed’ they had lost having created ‘so many chances’. Louis van Gaal (centre) had claimed that Manchester United were the best team in the league on current form . Swansea scored twice at home against United for the first time since January 1982. When the points were relayed to Monk, who has twice got the better of Van Gaal this season, the rookie manager smiled and raised an eyebrow. Truth is, United did not deserve to win. A defeat might have been a touch harsh in light of possession of more than 60 per cent, but it was not ‘dominance’, as Van Gaal put it. Not even close. It was error-strewn, mistakes in all areas. With Robin van Persie, who left the stadium on crutches, discovering on Monday if the injury to his right ankle is serious, it might prove to be a costly defeat in more ways than one. Van Gaal struggles to watch another defeat unfold, sitting on a glum looking Manchester United bench . Manchester United players can't hide their frustration having conceded twice at Swansea on Saturday . Ki Sung-Yeung guided home a beautiful cross from Jonjo Shelvey to equalise for Swansea on Saturday . Jonjo Shelvey's long range shot was deflected off Bafetimbi Gomis' head for Swansea's winner . But Van Gaal did not see it that way. In his leather document wallet, one can imagine all manner of flattering numbers. He had already decreed this week that United were the ‘best team in the league’ on form. Coming into this one they had lost just once in 19 games in all competitions. But those numbers also hide performances that have often been sub-standard and unimaginative. He didn’t like Sam Allardyce’s barbs about United being a long-ball team, but when United were 2-1 down and desperate at Swansea, their play reverted largely to high balls to Marouane Fellaini. It did not work. Another statistic — goals conceded — will show the 26 shipped by United amounts to the fourth-best defence in the Premier League. But again, it conceals the details of a backline requiring major investment. Inside the first minute Marcos Rojo gave the ball away and conceded a corner. Phil Jones then failed to mark effectively at the set-piece, allowing Bafetimbi Gomis a header that had to be cleared off the line. When Ki Sung-Yueng levelled after Ander Herrera’s opener, it was because Luke Shaw was too slow responding to his run. Those are not the actions of a functioning defence. Manchester United's Marouane Fellaini was booked having been penalised for a succession of fouls . Robin van Persie, who left the Liberty Stadium on crutches, could be set for a period on the sidelines . And the rest? Van Gaal said United ‘created a chance every two minutes’ in the second half. The truth is they had three shots on goal in the match (Swansea had six, including Gomis’s winner). Wayne Rooney was given his first league game in attack since December and offered little beyond enthusiasm. Van Gaal still seems unsure of his best combinations, although the side has developed since opening the season with a 2-1 home defeat against the same side. United failed to build on superior possession that day, as well. Monk enjoyed it, saying: ‘I probably haven’t had a drink in eight or nine months, so I will have a glass of red tonight.’ Ki celebrates with Shelvey after the former Liverpool midfielder supplied a superb cross for his goal . He has targeted a club record of more than 47 points. ‘We want to make a bit of history,’ he said. For United, the only progress under van Gaal has been a return to grinding out wins from mediocre performances. Will that be enough in remaining games against Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal? You would assume they need to find an extra level if they are to finish fourth — the only number that truly matters to van Gaal.","Louis van Gaal's side slumped to 2-1 defeat at Swansea on Saturday .

"Manchester United are facing a nightmare repeat of the saga that saw Paul Pogba reject a new deal at the club and go on to join Juventus.

Pereira is a reported target of Paris Saint- Germain although the Belgium-born player has not ruled out following in the footsteps of Pogba, who left Old Trafford in the summer of 2012 to join the Turin club as a free agent. 'Everyone knows that Juve are a great club,' Pereira told Turin-based sports newspaper Tuttosport. 'I have spoken with Pogba many times, he is a good friend and he told me that I would be well served in moving to Turin, both personally and professionally, two important things for me. 'At this time I'm tied to United. My agent is evaluating the offers that have arrived, including that of Juventus, but it's no secret. Just as it's no secret that I have turned down the offers made by my current club. 'I know the Italian league and I certainly would not be disappointed to play there as it is one of the best leagues. But I have not taken a decision yet. 'Alongside my entourage, I will evaluate all the offers that we have received and will evaluate many things before taking a decision.

Pereira made his debut for Louis van Gaal's team as a substitute in their 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat by MK Dons last August. Pogba was the subject of a bitter wrangle between United and Le Havre when he was lured to Old Trafford as a highly-promising teenager in 2009. He was tipped to have a big future at United but left for Juventus having made just seven substitute appearances for the Red Devils. Sir Alex Ferguson tried to tie Pogba down with the offer of a new contract but the Frenchman rejected that after limited first-team opportunities. He soon became a permanent fixture in Juve's midfield and helped the Old Lady claim Italian title triumphs in 2013 and 2014. Pogba is also firmly established in France's midfield and is one of the hottest properties in world football.

"Cancer-survivor Jonas Gutierrez and Newcastle United are in disagreement over his readiness to return to Premier League action. The 31-year-old's contract expires this summer and the Magpies had been willing to allow him to return to Argentinian club Velez Sarsfield earlier this month. That move broke down at the last minute and Gutierrez has since returned to Tyneside and declared himself fit for first-team football, tweeting: 'Healthy and ready, now is a board decision'. Jonas Gutierrez feels he's ready to play for the first team again after overcoming testicular cancer . He also said: 'I'm available. I know there is a situation with my contract and I don't know if I'm going to get the opportunity to play again. 'I'm ready and I want to, but I know other things have to happen to be back. 'What I can do is work hard and to be ready if the situation changes.' John Carver is unsure whether Gutierrez will be ready to return to the first team before the end of the season . Newcastle fans are desperate to see the popular winger at St James' Park just one more time before he leaves at the end of the season. Gutierrez has been building fitness with the club's reserve team since being given the all-clear from testicular cancer for the second time in November. He told Sportsmail last month that it was his 'dream' to play again for United, but that is looking increasingly unlikely. Head coach John Carver said: 'A little bit of it (whether he will play again) is in his hands. The Argentinian is a favourite with the Newcastle fans, who would love to see him play for the club again . 'He can play (for the reserves), but you know when you're ready to go at Premier League level. I am waiting for the right time and it's not right at the moment. I can see that on the training ground. 'He has come back from a serious situation and I'm not putting any pressure on him. 'I don't know (if he will play again). I'd like to think so. It's got to be right. He's got to get in the team, in his position. He has to compete to get on the left hand side and there is a lot of competition there, more than we've had for a long time.' The best Gutierrez can perhaps hope for is an emotional cameo at the end of the season, especially as there is likely to be little riding on Newcastle's final few matches. Carver was handed the Newcastle job until the end of the season but is yet to impress the fans . Of that prospect, Carver said: 'At this moment in time it's too early to say that. Let's see what happens as we get towards the end of the season.' One factor complicating the situation slightly is that Gutierrez has a clause in his contract which, after eight appearances this season, would trigger an extension to his deal. The club will not allow that to happen but fans are still hopeful of them affording him a farewell outing. In the meantime, Gutierrez's next appearance in black and white is likely to be a week on Monday when the Under-21s entertain Stoke at St James' Park.","Jonas Gutierrez feels his he is ready to return to the Newcastle first-team .

"Flying low over the Jordanian desert, F-16 fighter jets flatten targets in the sand while tanks unleash their deadly firepower and paratroopers dot the late afternoon sky. These were the scenes a fortnight ago in Operation Eager Lion, the United States-led exercise involving 8,000 service personnel that the military insists was only routine. In Jordan, though, the war games now feel like a precursor to the invasion of neighbouring Syria. And not just because live rounds were fired. Special operations forces from Iraq, Jordan and the U.S. conduct an exercise as part of operation Eager Lion at the King Abdullah Special Operations Training Center in Amman, Jordan . The coastal city of Aqaba was the site of military exercises are said to be designed to promote military relationships and face terrorism . Concerns were raised further last . week with news that the CIA and US Special Forces are training Syrian . rebels at a secret base in the remote south-west of the country. The . Free Syrian Army fighters are mainly from Daraa, where the uprising . began in March 2011. It is not known how many of the rebels have passed . through the US base, but it is understood 20 to 45 at a time have been . attending two-week courses since December – and are being trained with . Russian-designed 14.5mm anti-tank rifles and 23mm anti-aircraft weapons. Operation . Eager Lion may have ended two weeks ago but 900 combat-ready American . servicemen remain behind, with many now based close to the . strategically important northern border. Disquiet . over what may happen next is felt all over this desert kingdom – a key . ally of Britain and America and one that has played a pivotal role in . the power struggle in the Middle East. Few Jordanians doubt that the West is now more determined than ever to meet the rebels’ demand for heavy arms. But . while they share the same desire to rid Syria of President Bashar . Assad, the majority – motivated by a strong sense of self-preservation – . view the unfolding scenario as potentially disastrous. And . not just because of the fear that the weapons will find their way into . the hands of extremist elements among the rebels, including Al . Qaeda-linked Jabhat al-Nusra. Or that Assad’s friends in Russia and Iran will respond in kind. The military training exercises are based close to the strategically important northern border with Syria . A rocket is fired during the operation. Jordan's Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour insists that US forces are not preparing for a war in Syria . t . is because they believe the arms will inevitably have to pass through . Jordan to reach Syria. This, they argue, will enrage Assad, who may well . seek revenge. In the . wood-panelled bars of Jabal Al-Weibdeh, the Christian quarter of the . capital Amman, opinion-formers and decision-makers meet daily over tea . and shisha to discuss the threat to their country. Here, . whenever David Cameron and Barack Obama speak of civil war in Syria, . which has already cost the lives of more than 100,000 men, women and . children, their words are seized upon, scrutinised and debated. Coverage of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland was almost as keenly watched in Amman as the Arab Idol song contest. Should . Jordan be seen to be too readily helping its Western allies, it is . argued, Assad might activate Syrian ‘sleeper cells’ in the capital and . elsewhere. ‘It is estimated . that around 4,000 Assad loyalists and Hezbollah members have . infiltrated our towns and cities and are ready and waiting to rise up,’ said Ahmad Hassan Alzoubi, one of Jordan’s foremost political . commentators. Their numbers . have been swollen by fighters who have entered the country among the . waves of Syrian refugees. Mr Alzoubi added: ‘The fear is they will try . to destabilise our country.’ Targets are thought to include strategic . military facilities. Operation Eager Lion may have ended two weeks ago but 900 combat-ready American servicemen remain . If Jordan is seen to be too keen to help its Western allies, it is argued, Assad might activate Syrian 'sleeper cells' in the capital and elsewhere . A senior government official said that the cells ‘may try to assassinate prominent Jordanians’. In the past, sleeper cells in Jordan have been activated by Hezbollah for attacks on Israel through the West Bank. Even so, Jordan remains, at least for now, one of the region’s safest countries, its significance arising partly from its strategic location at the crossroads of the Holy Land. It is also one of only two Arab nations to have made peace with Israel. ‘So far the spotlight has been on northern Syria, around Aleppo, where the rebels are strong,’ said Mr Alzoubi. ‘But the significance of what is happening in the south, near our border – which is near Damascus – cannot be overlooked. ‘This is the route the West will use to move arms for the rebels. And, ultimately, it is only in the capital of Syria that victory for the rebels can be achieved.’ For the time being at least Jordan’s Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour insists that US forces are not preparing for a war in Syria. He said they are in the Arab kingdom to bolster its defence and prevent the civil war from spreading across its border. Of the 900, he added, 200 are training Jordanians to handle a chemical attack. The remaining 700 are manning a Patriot missile-defence system and F-16 fighter jets. ‘If the war continues, it’s a problem, and if it ends with the collapse of the regime, we also have a problem,’ said Mr Ensour. He added that the fall of Assad’s regime would leave a ‘vacuum, whereby attacks and conflicts would persist’. That scenario appears to be a long way off. For now, few believe Assad will go anywhere soon, particularly as he appears to be in the ascendancy. After successfully recapturing the town of Qusair near the Lebanese border, regime forces have moved on rebel strongholds around Damascus and the Jordanian border. Jordan's Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour insists that US forces are not preparing for a war in Syria . ‘The regime is directing its forces to the border region,’ said Abu Mohammad al-Darawi, who heads a Free Syrian Army battalion outside the southern city of Daraa. ‘We can no longer guarantee the safety of refugees trying to enter Jordan.’ Yesterday, thousands of refugees were stranded across the border because pro-Assad forces, fighting alongside mercenaries from Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia party, had cut off access routes to Jordan, which has already taken in more than 550,000 people. More than 160,000 of them are in the Zaatari refugee camp, which has effectively become Jordan’s fifth largest city. While many are still desperate to reach it, others are already starting to leave. Already this month some 9,000 Syrians abandoned Zaatari to answer the rebels’ call to return to their homeland and ‘defend’ their towns. Many more have simply had enough of the camp, which has become increasingly lawless, and long to start a new life in Amman which is off-limits to them. Bearing the brunt of the Syrians’ frustrations have been humanitarian agency workers. ‘There have been around 70 cases where agency workers have been attacked with sticks and rocks,’ said Mohammed Ali, a clinic manager with Jordan Health Aid Society. ‘Last month a policeman was stabbed by a refugee. There have been demonstrations, with refugees burning down their tents. People are becoming frustrated because they have been here so long.’ On the surface, however, the camp appears well-equipped, with schools, sports facilities, shops and even a tailor. ‘I don’t want to go back to fight in Syria – I just want to go home and live peacefully,’ said Abu Jarah, a 30-year-old barber. He arrived at Zaatari in December with his wife after his two-year-old daughter, Shouq, was shot dead by regime forces as he carried her across a street in Daraa. ‘The bullet hit her in the head and she was blown out of my arms,’ he said. ‘It was the most terrible day of my life.’ On Wednesday Jordan’s King Abdullah said: ‘We will not allow anything to compromise our national security or harm our citizens.’ On Friday, at Jordan’s main border crossing with Syria, a burly guard’s discourse on Manchester United’s chances of success without Sir Alex Ferguson was brought to an abrupt halt by a burst of mortar fire. The loud boom broke the desert stillness and made the guard spring from his chair. Jabbing the air with a cigarette, he estimated that it came from at least two miles away, which seemed to calm his colleagues. Eventually their tension subsided, but didn’t disappear entirely. The men fell silent, their discussion about football and ‘Mr Alex’ forgotten. Despite the King’s assurance, his people remain edgy. They simply can’t escape the feeling that Jordan, a bit-part player, has been reluctantly shoved on to centre stage.","8,000 military personnel are behind Operation Eager Lion training exercise .

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic showed his support for the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) once again by displaying the words '805 million names' on his boots during Paris Saint-Germain's 1-1 draw against Chelsea. The Sweden international took to Twitter shortly before his side's Champions League encounter against the Blues to reveal what he had penned on to his footwear.

Ibrahimovic said of his gesture: 'Wherever I go people recognise me, call my name, cheer for me. 'But there are names no one cares to remember. That no one cheers for: the 805m people suffering from hunger in the world today. 'I have the supporters all over the world. From now on I want this support to go to the people who suffer from hunger, they are the real champions. 'So whenever you hear my name, you will think of their names.'

Blanc said: 'Imagine if he'd got another yellow card after 20 minutes? We may as well have abandoned the game in the 70th minute because we would have been down to seven men. 'It was a good initiative, but I don't know whether him taking his shirt off was good for us. I hope that, on Tuesday, if he scores he doesn't take the shirt off because he will be booked again.' Ibrahimovic removed his shirt to reveal the 50 names after scoring after just 72 seconds of the match . Ibrahimovic wore most of the tattoos on his arm, chest and midriff .

"In the latest propaganda video from Islamic State, hostages are paraded in cages through the packed streets of Iraq to cheers and jeers. But in a cruel twist, the orange jumpsuit-clad prisoners are interviewed by their captors - ahead of their presumably grim fate. The nine-minute video allegedly shows 21 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, who are paraded through the crowded streets of the Iraqi province of Kirkuk, before being seemingly marched to their deaths. Scroll down for video . The video allegedly shows 21 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters paraded through the  the Iraqi province of Kirkuk . A militant, whose microphone bears insignia associated with the terror group, talks to the camera in front of the cages . In a cruel twist, he even interviews prisoners who are shackled inside their cages and guarded by militants . A young hostage speaks to his 'interviewer' before he is dragged from the cage by by the scruff of his neck . The prisoners are driven one by one on the backs of pick-up trucks along with flag-waving militants - who are cover their faces and carry firearms - accompanying each prisoner. Several men are then interviewed by a militant, who carries a microphone bearing the terror group's insignia, before being taken out of their cages and pushed to their knees. The camera then stops on several hostages in turn and text appears on screen, apparently revealing details about each individual. And the footage ends with a haunting shot of an elderly man's face before abruptly cutting to black, hinting that a terrible fate awaits him and his fellow prisoners. The prisoners were driven on the backs of pick-uyp trucks along with flag-waving gun-toting militants . They were greeted with cheers and jeers as they were driven through the streets of the Kirkuk province . People are seen crowding around the pick-up trucks and shouting at the prisoners as they are paraded . Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at the International Center for Study of Radicalization at King's College in London, wrote on Twitter: 'New Islamic State video shows Peshmerga being paraded through Kirkuk province in cages.' He says the video is 'not as gory' as previous ones, but adds that although it ends before it is seen, the men were presumably murdered. Earlier this month, a video emerged showing a similar procession apparently taking place through Kirkuk in northwest Iraq. Those men were purportedly burned alive on camera in a horrific echo of the murder of Jordanian pilot Lieutenant Muath al-Kaseasbeh. Lt. al-Kaseasbeh was filmed being burned to death by Islamic State extremists in a 22-minute film which was expertly edited before being posted online. The scenes echo a video released earlier this month of 17 Kurdish Peshmerga paraded through the same area . The men were later grabbed and marched from their cages by militants and then forced to kneel in a row . The hostages are seen bowing their heads as menacing militants carrying guns force them to their knees . The video then focuses on each hostage in turn and appears to reveal information about the individuals . The nine-minute films ends with a lingering close-up of an elderly prisoner's face, before cutting to black . Titled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', it showed the captured airman locked in a cage before a trail of petrol leading up to its bars is set alight. The terror group and the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have been locked in a series of tense battles for control of the Kirkuk province since January. The video comes as a senior U.S. military official said a massive operation to retake Iraq's second-largest city from the Islamic State using up to 25,000 Iraqi troops will likely begin in April or May. The official from U.S. Central Command said the operation would involve 12 Iraqi brigades, five of which would be trained for the mission by the coalition in the coming weeks. Those five would make up the core fighting force that would launch the attack. But they would be supplemented by three smaller brigades serving as reserve forces, along with three Peshmerga brigades who would contain the Islamic State fighters from the north and west. News of the offensive comes amid reports the terror group is facing a growing number of defections and cases of corruption in its ranks in two of its major strongholds, Mosul and Raqqa. The terror group has faced a growing backlash over the brutal death of Jordanian pilot  Lt Moath al-Kasasbeh, who was burned to death in an ISIS video released earlier this month . Terror expert Shiraz Maher tweeted that the video is not as gory as previous ones, but he presumes the men were later murdered .","Nine-minute video shows 21 Kurdish fighters paraded through Iraqi streets .

"If ever an incident provided compelling evidence that footballers need to change their ways then it was the incident at the KC Stadium on Saturday. Joey Barton is in the spotlight for making a lunge with his hand towards Tom Huddlestone’s genitals. In Barton’s own words, he 'touched Huddlestone up'. Barton was rightly sent off. How did he think lunging at Huddlestone’s groin would help his team-mate, or his team? Huddlestone’s revelation after the game that this sort of incident happens dozens of times every week in training is surprising, to say the least. Joey Barton was sent off for QPR after he, in his own words, 'touched up' Hull midfielder Tom Huddlestone . Referee Anthony Taylor had no choice but to send Barton off after his behaviour crossed a line . Huddlestone revealed this sort of incident often goes on in training as players pass it off as banter . This grabbing or touching each other’s genitals, what is that all about? Do footballers do it because it’s something else that passes as banter? Do other players laugh when one of their team-mates grabs someone else’s private parts in training? Is that a source of amusement that passes most people by? Do footballers really grab each other’s pants for the bants? Or is there something else going on? Are the players who take part in this behaviour actually showing signs of some repressed sexuality they don’t feel comfortable fully expressing in a football environment. It’s a possibility. If you check back through all the instances of footballers and other sportsmen taking part in group sex, two things become clear. Firstly there are a lot of cases. Go and check them. Secondly, they almost always involve a lot of men and one female and often they are filmed by one of the guys. Barton walks off the pitch at the KC Stadium after his red card for grabbing Huddlestone's genitals . What may have been acceptable on the training ground was certainly not in front of 24,000 watching fans . The idea of watching one of my male colleagues or friends strip, get aroused, and then carry out some sort of sexual act with a female fills me with horror to be honest. Yet in the sometimes bizarre, worryingly immoral world of sport, this is accepted as normal behaviour. I urge you to read Anna Krien’s amazing book Night Games: Sex, Power and a Journey into the Dark Heart of Sport. It’s one of the most important books written in recent years on this subject and highlights how lawless some sportsmen (she focuses on Australian sport) seem to be. As an extreme example closer to home, remember the England coach who defecated from a great height into a pint glass as a way of keeping his bored players entertained? 'He did it for the lads,' one of those players explained to me. I don’t think I could find that entertaining in any way. Do players laugh when one of their team-mates grabs someone else’s private parts as Barton did? Barton (second left) gave an apology that was the correct thing to do, but trying to mitigate it was disgraceful . Having said all of that, I am very much the kind of person who accepts that what might not be right for me, might work for others, and if that is the kind of stuff that floats your boat then go for it. As long as it’s a private thing, and nobody gets hurt or violated, who can have a problem? Where it becomes an issue is when the line is crossed. And that’s what happened with Barton on Saturday. He didn’t understand that even though footballers might enjoy that kind of thing in training, doing it in front of over 24,000 paying spectators, including many children, is absolutely not acceptable behaviour. His norms are warped. His apology was the correct thing to do, but trying to mitigate it by saying it was in defence of his young team-mate was disgraceful. If a player carried out this genital grab on a female referee, it would absolutely be treated as a sexual assault, and rightly so. Barton is lucky he did it to another man who accepts that genital touching is apparently all part and parcel of being a professional footballer. If a player carried out a genital grab on a female referee then it would rightly be treated as sexual assault .

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic is set to lead the line for PSG in their Champions League last-16 first leg clash against Chelsea at the Parc de Princes on Tuesday night. The unpredictable forward has never been short of words, or self-belief for that matter, and he will be hoping to have the last laugh against former manager Jose Mourinho. But as the Chelsea defence prepares to keep the PSG striker quiet, Sportsmail reminds you of 10 of the Sweden international's best quotes. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (centre) trains ahead of Chelsea's visit to PSG in the Champions Legaue on Tuesday . Jose Mourinho's defence will be aiming to keep the Sweden international quiet at Parc de Princes . 'In my head I am the strongest of all. I certainly don't need the Ballon d'Or to prove that I am number one.' Ibrahimovic may not have been named on the shortlist for the 2012 Ballon d'Or award, but it clearly didn't affect the striker's confidence in his own ability. 'A World Cup without me is nothing to watch so it is not worthwhile to wait for the World Cup.' Ibrahimovic came up against Cristiano Ronaldo in the play-off to reach the World Cup in Brazil last summer, but it was Sweden that were on the losing side and the PSG forward let everyone know there wasn't much point in watching a tournament that didn't feature himself. 'I couldn’t believe it. I was like ""No way, Zlatan doesn’t do auditions"".' Arsene Wenger revealed that he came close to signing Ibrahimovic when he was a fresh-faced 16-year-old but he refused to have a trial at the north London club. Maverick striker Ibrahimovic had talks at Arsenal but didn't want 'an audition' Ibrahimovic has no need to buy his wife a birthday present because she already has him . 'Nothing. She already has Zlatan.' As any man will attest to, buying a gift for your loved one can be a difficult task. Not for Ibrahimovic though, who admits his wife needs nothing else for her birthday when she already has Zlatan. 'Well, I don’t know. You’ll have to ask your wife about that.' As a member of the media you have to remember to choose your questions carefully when interviewing Ibrahimovic. This reporter wasn't, and asked the striker how he got the scars on his face. 'What Carew does with a football, I can do with an orange.' Ibrahimovic didn't take too kindly to criticism from Scandinavian counterpart and former Aston Villa and West Ham striker John Carew. Jose Mourinho will be hoping to keep his former player quiet when Chelsea meet PSG on Tuesday . Ibrahimovic celebrates after scoring against Caen in Ligue 1 on Saturday . 'Come  to my house  and you'll see if I'm gay, and bring your sister.' During his spell at Barcelona a picture emerged of  Ibrahimovic getting rather close to team-mate Gerard Pique but the Sweden international strongly refuted suggestions he was gay, particularly when they were voiced by one female reporter. 'It was the fault of David Trezeguet, who made me do one drink of vodka after another. I slept in the bathtub. Now I hold my vodka much better.' Ibrahimovic tried to pass the blame to former Juventus team-mate David Trezeguet after reports of excessive behaviour following the club's Serie A title success. Ibrahimovic attracted the attention of Europe's top clubs during three seasons at Dutch giants Ajax . 'I like fireworks too, but I set them off in gardens or kebab stands. I never set fire to my own house.' After Mario Balotelli, a former team-mate of Ibrahimovic's at Inter Milan, set fire to his bathroom when he let fireworks of out the window, the PSG hitman admitted his like for fireworks. 'You bought a Ferrari but you drive it like a Fiat.' Ibrahimovic's short and tumultuous stint in La Liga with Barcelona was riddled with arguments and falling outs, particularly with manager Pep Guardiola and the 33-year-old was not happy with his role in the team. Ibrahimovic spent two seasons at Barcelona before leaving the club after a falling out with Pep Guardiola .","PSG play Chelsea in the Champions League last-16 first leg on Tuesday .

Just imagine what the big boys of European football will do to Arsenal if they can limp through to the next phase of the Champions League. They will chew them up and spit them out. Before it all gets a bit complicated, this Arsenal team were leading three zip and playing like champions thanks to the enduring charm of Alexis Sanchez. Now they look like chumps. How they came to draw it 3-3, combusting in front of a nervy and anxious crowd at the Emirates, will take a separate inquest all of its own. What a shambles this Arsenal team can be at times. Aleksandar Mitrovic looks ecstatic after scoring Anderlecht's last-minute equaliser at the Emirates .

Ratings by ROB DRAPER at The Emirates . Aleksandar Mitrovic, a second half substitute, scored Anderlecht’s dramatic equaliser when he headed beyond Arsenal keeper Wojciech Szczesny. It was incredible to witness. ‘Clueless,’ was the brutal assessment of former Arsenal forward Paul Merson, sitting in the TV studio, when he was asked about Arsene Wenger’s role in this capitulation. The Gunners know of no other way to play. They will never learn, that much is clear. ‘They tried to score a fourth and at 3-2 you see Arsenal start to have a bit of doubt,’ declared Anderlecht coach Besnik Hasi. He and Wenger did not shake hands at the final whistle because Hasi was too busy cavorting on the pitch with his wild-eyed players tearing off those fetching purple shirts. ‘It doesn’t hurt me if I don't get his hand. We come from a small competition and we can only imagine playing these teams. Maybe Arsenal wanted to have fun with their public.’ Arsenal were booed off at the final whistle by their increasingly frustrated supporters and it was tempting to join in with them. ‘It was a poor defensive performance,’ admitted Wenger. ‘At 3-0 we thought the job was done. We got punished, we under-estimated Anderlecht sub-consciously.’ No kidding. To be this far ahead, thanks to goals from Mikel Arteta, Sanchez and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, and press the self-destruct button really is something else. ‘We threw everything away,’ admitted Arteta, who has torn his hamstring and will miss Sunday’s trip to Swansea. ‘This is not the standard required.’ After Anthony Vanden Borre scrambled Anderlecht’s opening goal, the gods were with the Belgian champions. Hasi’s side, battered in the opening 45 minutes, played on the nerves and anxiety that transmits into the stands whenever Arsenal concede a soft goal. Whatever training drills this defence does - if any - during the week will have to be revisited after this implosion. They remain second in Group D, but suddenly the home game against Borussia Dortmund (hopeless in the Bundesliga, different class in Europe) and the trip to Galatasaray have a menacing air about them. From 3-0 up after 58 minutes at the Emirates there is an outside chance they will fail to qualify for the second stage for the first time in 15 years. To the first half, then. Sanchez, this dreamy No 10 in Arsenal colours, ran the show for the home team. Danny Welbeck is bundled over by Anderlecht defender Chancel Mbemba in the box to gift a penalty to Arsenal . Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta cheekily dinks his penalty over Silvio Proto to give Arsenal the lead . Proto dives to his right as the ball sails over him and in to the roof of the Anderlecht net . Arteta wheels away in celebration after putting Arsenal in the driving seat midway through the first half . As Arsenal blew their lead, fan Piers Morgan made this plea to City defender Vincent Kompany.... Morgan: If I pay you £50m will you play for us? Kompany: Great club but no. Morgan: £60m & 2 Ferraris? Kompany: Those days have gone, I play for glory. :-) The delay on the reverse pass into the penalty area for Danny Welbeck to run on to in that move that led to Arsenal’s opening goal was reminiscent of the late, great Billy Bremner. It was delicious. Chancel Mbemba cut across Welbeck, getting all tangled up inside the area as he attempted to hold off the Arsenal striker and bundled him over. Penalty, no question. Arteta scored easily and it seemed fitting that the captain of the team should be responsible for the 500th goal scored by Arsenal since their move to the Emirates in 2006. They pressed the accelerator again. Sanchez scored their second in the 29th minute after he was knocked to the ground just outside the area by Vanden Borre. He immediately took responsibility for the free-kick, reacting first when it cannoned off the wall to pick it out of the night sky and drive a low volley beyond the Anderlecht keeper. That was 2-0 and Oxlade-Chamberlain added a third when he raced clear and beat Silvio Proto with a curving effort that hit the inside of the side netting. ‘Sanchez was one of the very few who was at his level,’ admitted Wenger. ‘He was involved in the three goals, he was one of the two or three at the level.’ At that stage it was game over. Or so we thought. Anderlecht took a foothold in this match with a combination of canny second half substitutions by their coach. That, plus some outrageous good fortune.

Theo Walcott - recently returned from injury - was named on the substitutes' bench for Arsenal but never came on . Nacho Monreal was punished for pulling in the box, the offence that prompted Sportsmail’s campaign after grappling excesses in the Premier League. Monreal hauled down substitute Aleksandar Mitrovic and French referee Clement Turpin awarded the penalty to put life into Anderlecht. When Vanden Borre scored the Belgians first when he met the cross from substitute Andy Kawaya, the stadium was gripped by fear. Nacho Monreal did nothing to lift the fog. This dopey Arsenal defender, an accident waiting to happen at the best of times, conceded a penalty when he body-checked Mitrovic. Vanden Borre, who had a colourful game to say the least (and was booked before the final whistle), beat Szczesny with a neat penalty in the 73rd minute. It was then Hasi, who thrashed around inside the technical area for 90 minutes, believed. Anderlecht inevitably made it 3-3 in the 90th minute when Mitrovic arrived inside the Arsenal’s penalty area to head in a dramatic equaliser. If Wenger’s team makes it to the business end of this competition, they will get blown away. Mitrovic beats Per Mertesacker to a near-post header to complete the most unlikely of comebacks .

But a former English teacher has found unlikely fame on the streets of Syria's largest city becoming known to many residents as 'the female sniper'. Dressed in a jumper dress, hijab and green khaki trousers, Guevara, named after the Argentine revolutionary, sits hidden in a war damaged building waiting for a sight of the enemy - government troops. Scroll down for video . War-torn: The female sniper, known simply as Guevara, stalks the streets of Alleppo with her rifle . Treacherous: Guevara moves from one sniper position to get a better vantage point. She says that she waits for hours to get a sight of a government soldier . Take aim: The 36-year-old looks down the sight of her rifle. She fights against government soldiers following the death of her two children who were killed in an airstrike . Danger: The former English teacher first picked up a weapon at a training camp run by Palestinian militant group Hamas . Although fighting is not often considered the right way to behave for a woman in a conservative Muslim country, Guevara holds her own in a group of fellow fighters - some 30 men and boys. And she claims to be happy in her unusual and dangerous role. She told the Telegraph: 'I like fighting. When I see that one of my friends in my katiba [rebel division] has been killed, I feel that I have to hold a weapon and take my revenge.' The 36-year-old is motivated by the death of her children several months ago, a daughter aged 10 and a son aged seven. The pair were killed when an airstrike hit the family home. Now she says she feels compelled to kill a government soldier every time she learns of the death of one of her fellow rebel fighters. Patience: Guevara watches the enemy lines through her sniper sight on the frontline in Salah Addeen . The job, she says, takes patience, speed and intelligence, and she often has to sit for hours waiting for civilians to clear the streets and government soldiers to take their place. She watches soldiers and civilians trying to get on with their everyday lives from her hidden vantage point, but doesn't shoot until just the soldiers roam the streets. And despite being unsure whether she has killed them or not, Guevara claims to have hit four or five soldiers. 'It makes you feel good. Whenever I hit one I shout ""yes!"",' she said. Originally from Palestine, the sniper told the Telegraph that she first picked up a gun at a military training camp in Lebanon run by Palestinian militants from the Hamas group. Smiling assassin: Guevara smiles for the camera on the front line in Alleppo . Even before the uprising against Bashar al-Assad's regime began in the spring of 2011, Guevara says that she was staunchly opposed to his rule, helping to create an underground opposition newspaper while studying at Aleppo University. She was even part of an underground political party for Palestinians who met to plot the defeat of al-Assad's regime. Her first marriage broke down because her husband was not revolutionary enough and she threatened to leave her new husband, the leader of her rebel brigade, when he initially refused to let her fight. Despite her hardened attitude to her role, Guevara says that she sometimes wakes up crying in the night over the death of her children and the horrors she has seen. She admits that she has seen more than 100 bodies in the last few months and has had several brushes with death herself, including one incident where a bomb exploded near a car she was travelling in.","Former English teacher turned sniper is known as Guevara .

"Louis van Gaal had the look of the emperor with new clothes as West Ham outplayed, outfought and out-thought Manchester United - until, that was, the final minutes  when he was bailed out by Daley Blind. United had been bereft of any attacking ideas despite what had seemed, on the face of it, fielding a team of offensive possibilities. At times it was a bit like the blind leading blind until Blind’s intervention. Daley Blind (left) rescued a point for Manchester United, and saved Louis van Gaal's blushes at Upton Park . Blind celebrates after scoring an equaliser for United in the dying moments of the match against West Ham . But just when it seemed the Hammers had done enough to earn a deserved victory - they had indeed wasted a couple of late chances to seal it - Blind picked up the pieces of a half-cleared free-kick and did what none of the United forwards had managed all afternoon by producing an emphatic finish. On the evidence of this though Van Gaal needs to get back to his whiteboard, and whatever other tools he uses, and find a formation that works. More to the point, one that doesn't waste Wayne Rooney. A couple of weeks ago, Van Gaal declared that playing 4-4-2 gave him a twitchy 'a***', saying that he felt more secure with a 3-5-2 or a variant of it. It was certainly a squeaky-bum afternoon for the United manager. It was a turn-up for the books when Van Gaal fielded an unchanged team from their previous Premier League match; last week's 3-1 home win over Leicester. And it was once again 4-4-2 with a twist… the midfield was set out in a diamond shape. In that respect, you could describe the formation as 4-1-2-1-2. Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao and Wayne Rooney (left-right) all proved ineffective against West Ham . Van Gaal (second right) watches on as his Manchester United team struggled until a late equaliser . Blind operated as the anchor man ahead of a back four,  Rooney played towards the right, Adnan Januzaj to the left, with Angel di Maria roaming in the hole behind two front-runners Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao. It is seen as a way of of getting all of United’s best attackers in the same team but as the game started to take shape it didn't work that way, and Rooney looked lost most of the time. The England captain found himself shuttling up and down, somewhere between right-midfield and and inside-right, and often embroiled in a battle with West Ham skipper Kevin Nolan. If Rooney is deployed in a deeper role surely it should be more advanced, in the hole. Indeed it wasn’t long before it appeared United would have been better served had Rooney and Di Maria swapped roles. After all, Di Maria is naturally a wide player who thrives when he has space ahead of him to exploit his pace and trickery running at defenders. As it was, the Argentine found it hard to find space, constantly crowded out by West Ham’s busy midfield and a direct pathway to Van Persie and Falcao was usually blocked by Alex Song who played the holding role for the Hammers. It meant United’s two strikers were starved of service not least because of a lack of width. Van Persie wipes his brow at Upton Park as he struggled to make an impact against West Ham . Cheikhou Kouyate (second right) celebrates after scoring a goal to put West Ham 1-0 up against United . Rooney was reluctant to go wide, and his passing was too often square and safe. Januzaj just couldn’t get into the game. Nor did the front two do much to help themselves. Both Van Persie and and Falcao were too static, making it easy for James Tomkins and make-shift centre-back Cheikhou Kouyate to keep them under wraps. What, on paper, seemed to be a team full of attacking possibilities could not even get close to opening up the West Ham defence in the first half; keeper Adrian only having to make one save of note from a speculative Di Maria shot. In contrast, West Ham’s similar diamond system was more fluid and full of possibilities. That was because West Ham’s two strikers Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho offered much more movement, as did Stewart Downing who operated as the tip of the diamond. Kouyate was afforded three touches in the box as he fired home to give the Hammers the lead . Kouyate smiles after his goal, which put West Ham 1-0 up against Manchester United in the Premier League . While Di Maria was bogged down in the middle, Downing roamed around with menace and flitted from wing to wing. Injury to Andy Carroll meant that Valencia and Sakho started together for the first time since the beginning of the season when Carroll wasn't fit. Their pace, energy and finishing was one of the main reasons the Hammers got off to such a good start. And there was a good case to argue that Carroll’s absence was a blessing of sorts. Without the long high-ball option into the big centre-forward, West Ham played a much slicker passing game, and the two strikers were a constant threat. While United’s defence looks far more sound and settled than it was at the start of the campaign - ironically with a back four that Van Gaal does not favour - there were still several alarms in the first half; West Ham just lacked a precise final ball or finish. Falcao spurns a golden opportunity, putting the ball wide of the post after going through one-on-one . Falcao's heat map shows the Colombia forward's poor performance on Sunday - he did not play well . But that changed just four minutes after the break. Indecision in United’s defence from a set-piece, and weak work by Rooney, allowed Cheikhou Kouyate to bring the ball down from a free-kick, before swivelling to lash home. It was an exciting finish, but it was poor defending. United responded by upping their tempo - but only a bit. It was still too predictable, lacking in pace and nous. And Van Gaal offered nothing in any inspiration from the sidelines. He just sat in his seat on the bench and stared blankly. His only idea to change things was to take off Januzaj and bring on Marouane Fellaini. Van Gaal claimed the introduction of Fellaini was a 'plan B' but all it amounted to was United hitting more long balls. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce couldn’t resist smirking at the irony of that . In the end the only way he could see United getting back into the game was to go route one. So much for the tactical genius of the supposed Dutch master. Rooney was pushed out wide and was wasted by a poor tactical decision from United boss Van Gaal .

"Sydney man Peter Gardner, who has been detained in China on suspicion of drug smuggling for more than three months, is still languishing in a Chinese jail as he awaits a decision on whether his case will go to trial. New Zealand-born Gardner was arrested on November 8 in Guangzhou, where authorities allege he tried to smuggle 40kg of methamphetamine out of China. His travelling partner, Sydney woman Kalynda Davis, 22, was released without charge in December after a month in custody. Peter Gardner was arrested on November 8 in Guangzhou for allegedly trying to smuggle 40kg of methamphetamine out of China . But Gardner, a 25-year-old from Richmond in northwest Sydney, could face the death penalty. New Zealand human rights lawyer Craig Tuck has joined Gardner's defence team and will travel to China soon to work with his client's Chinese legal counsel. 'Mr Gardner has had his file transferred from the police to the prosecutor's office,' he said in a statement. 'He is detained in a cell while he awaits the decision about whether or not his case will proceed to trial.

The Gardner family has requested privacy and won't comment to the media while the case proceeds. When Ms Davis returned to Sydney, her father revealed she was cleared because she had carry-on luggage only. She had been shackled in a small cell during the 30-day interrogation, was allowed no contact with the outside world and had her long, blonde hair cropped. But after her month-long imprisonment in a Chinese jail late last year, Ms Davis' life appears to have returned to normal.

Mr Stella went on to describe the emotion he felt when he discovered he may never see Ms Davis again, saying he felt truly 'blessed' to have her back. The pair visited Naru Beach in Newcastle together in the first week of 2015, with Ms Davis joking she wanted to forget how sunburnt she was after spending the day in the sun. Mr Stella likened Ms Davis' return to 'winning the lottery' to which she replied 'love you so much' and 'Makes each time we spend together so much more special'.","Peter Gardner is still awaiting a decision on whether his case will go to trial .

"Jonny Evans admits Manchester United have failed to produce the kind of attractive football their fans have become accustomed to this season. United sit third in the Barclays Premier League and are in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup after a sequence of just one defeat in 19 matches. Yet despite that run, United manager Louis van Gaal has come in for criticism in recent weeks. Jonny Evans admits Manchester United have failed to produce the kind of attractive football their fans want . Sam Allardyce branded Van Gaal's team 'Long-ball United', Paul Scholes said his former club had often played 'miserable' football this season and fans at Old Trafford recently whistled at their own team. The United supporters have been spoiled after watching more than two decades of largely enterprising football under Sir Alex Ferguson, and Evans understands why criticism has been directed at the team this year. When asked whether he had been surprised by the criticism United had received, the defender said: 'No. I think as players we know that we could perform better. 'I think the manager wants us to play more attractive football.' Ander Herrera talks to Manchester United team-mates Chris Smalling and Evans during the defeat of Preston . There was little sign of improvement on Monday night when United had to come from behind to beat League One Preston 3-1 at Deepdale. Van Gaal's team did not have a shot on target until the second half and they only kicked into life when Van Gaal replaced Radamel Falcao with Ashley Young and altered the formation to a regular 4-4-2. Evans believes the team is improving though. 'I think we are seeing progress,' the Northern Irishman said. 'You can see that with the performances. 'At the start of season we were not playing well and we were not getting results but the manager has got us organised and everyone knows their jobs. Louis van Gaal has faced criticism over the tactics he has employed at Manchester United . 'I think once we get that cemented then we can go and start entertaining again. 'Once we get the ball down show our composure I think the football will be attractive.' United sealed a quarter-final clash against Arsenal thanks to goals from Ander Herrera, Marouane Fellaini and Wayne Rooney, who converted a controversial 88th minute penalty. Evans, who was also at the stadium for the launch, thinks United were more deadly at Deepdale when Angel di Maria was moved out on to the wing from central midfield in the second half. 'When Angel was out in the wide position it allowed him to run at the full-back a bit more,' said Evans of Di Maria, who has struggled since his £59.7million move from Real Madrid. 'He has come from a different environment at Real Madrid in a different league to work under a new manager here. Evans feels Argentine winger Angel di Maria needs more time to find his best form for the club . 'He has a different system he wants us to play so it will always take time. 'I think he has been fantastic. We know how much of a danger he is. 'We have seen him in training and we are hoping he can produce that on the pitch as well.' Scott Laird, who put Preston ahead on Monday, can only dream of taking home the kind of money Di Maria is on at United. The left-back from Taunton revealed that he receives a bonus of just £1 from his grandmother Pat Smith every time he scores. 'Every time we scored as kids, she used to give me and my brothers a pound,' Laird told BBC Somerset the day after scoring against the 20-time English champions. 'Even though I'm 26 now, I still carry that tradition on. 'She was the first person I rang last night and I said 'I want that pound'. 'I tried saying I wanted a bit more because it was against Manchester United, but she says that wasn't in the contract.'

"Morocco have appealed against sanctions levied by the African Football Confederation following the decision to withdraw from hosting this year's African Nations Cup. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FMRF) announced in November that it would not be going ahead with the tournament which started in January due to fears over the ongoing ebola outbreak in West Africa. Equatorial Guinea eventually stepped in as replacement hosts but CAF came down hard on the Moroccan governing body, banning its national side from the next two editions of the competition and imposing fines and compensation orders totalling almost £7million. Ivory Coast defeated Ghana in the final to win the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea .

'In its appeal to the CAS, the FRMF requests the annulment of the challenged decisions and that a final award be issued by the end of March 2015. 'An arbitration procedure has been opened and is being conducted according to the Code of Sports-related Arbitration.' The FRMF last week posted a statement on its website registering its shock at the measures taken by CAF. 'The executive committee is said to be greatly surprised by the decisions taken by CAF,' it read. 'They do not correspond in any way to the conclusions of the first meeting in Cairo with the president of CAF. '(We will) take all necessary measures to uphold the rights and interests of Moroccan football and provisions.'","The Africa Football Confederation came down hard on Morocco .

"The FIFA ethics report into World Cup bid corruption is expected to blame England more than Qatar for breaching regulations when it is published on Thursday morning. Judge Hans-Joachim Eckert’s long-awaited conclusions, after an investigation carried out by New York lawyer Michael Garcia over two years, effectively clears Qatar to host the 2022 tournament while pointing the finger of suspicion firmly at England’s 2018 bid. This will cause consternation within the FA, who considered their campaign the most transparent of the lot, and ensure relations with the world governing body remain at rock bottom for years to come. Qatar were named as the host nation for the 2022 World Cup back in 2010 . England are being criticised for trying to woo former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner . Lord Triesman was FA Chairman from 2008-10 and 2018 CEO Andy Anson led the bidding process . The Russian and Australian bids are also expected to be criticised more than a Qatari campaign that has been the focus of so much controversy. England’s transgressions, expected to be listed in the Eckert summary of Garcia’s 430-page findings, were widely regarded as insignificant compared to the multi-millions spent by Qatar on securing the World Cup, which is now having to be moved to winter because of the stifling heat there in the summer. The FA are set to come under fire for trying to woo former FIFA vice president Warner . Warner promised Prince William and Prime Minister David Cameron he would vote for England - then reneged . Warner appeased over FA chief snub . It's in the bag ... England 2018 World Cup bid shoulders arms and hands out the Mulberries . England's 2018 World Cup traitor Warner has vital vote again . Shame on you! Now FIFA allow Warner to wriggle free following corruption allegations . FIFA investigator Michael Garcia clasping at Mulberry bags which caused controversy during England's World Cup 2018 bid . Yet although Eckert will name and shame former FIFA ExCo members Jack Warner and Mohamed bin Hammam, who have already left all their football posts and, in Bin Hammam’s case, been banned from the game for life, there is no major criticism attached to Qatar’s 2022 campaign. Qatar have insisted from the start of the scandal that Bin Hammam played no prominent role in their campaign. There are understood to be at least two significant references to England breaking the bidding regulations in Eckert’s summary, centering around failed attempts to woo Warner. The biggest rogue in the FIFA gallery promised Prince William and Prime Minister David Cameron that he would vote for England, then reneged. Eckert is expected to detail the £35,000 sponsorship by England 2018 of a gala dinner in Trinidad during the Caribbean Football Union summit in 2010 — part of the regular business of the CONCACAF confederation run at that time by Warner.

Fans in Qatar celebrate on the streets as their country are awarded the 2022 World Cup back in 2010 . And Eckert is also expected to mention the hosting by England 2018 of a UK training camp in the summer of 2009 for the Under 20 Trinidad and Tobago federation team who had links with Warner. An FA spokesman said: ‘We strongly refute any suggestion of impropriety by those involved in the England bid.’ Russia, who will host the next World Cup in 2018, are admonished for a lack of co-operation with the FIFA investigation, including ‘losing’ emails relating to their bid. The report by US attorney Michael Garcia is set to clear Qatar to host the World Cup . Garcia was not allowed to enter the country because he is on a list of people barred as a consequence of a human rights dispute between the US and Russia. Meanwhile, Qatar has come under fire from Amnesty International, who claim the Gulf state’s efforts to prevent the abuse of migrant workers have been negligible. Qatar said in May it would implement reforms to address conditions for migrant labourers, many of whom are helping to build stadiums for the 2022 World Cup. But Sherif Elsayed-Ali, Amnesty’s head of refugee and migrant rights, said: ‘Time is running out fast. Urgent action is needed to ensure we do not end up with a World Cup that is built on forced labour and exploitation. The steps taken so far are woefully insufficient.’","Qatar were named as hosts of the 2022 World Cup back in 2010 .

"It is an assignment few will envy - taking on the one of the strongest teams in Europe and the favourites to win this season's Champions League. And if Shakhtar Donetsk are to have any hope of beating Bayern Munich in their last 16 tie, they will need their star man Luiz Adriano firing. The Brazilian hotshot was the top scorer in the competition after the group phase, scoring nine times, including five in Shakhtar's 7-0 thrashing of BATE Borisov. VIDEO Scroll down for Luiz Adriano's scores stunning bicycle kick for Shakhtar Donetsk . Luiz Adriano arrives at the Arena Lviv for a training session ahead of Shakhtar Donetsk's Champions League last 16 tie with Bayern Munich on Tuesday night . Luiz Adriano blows a kiss to the crowd after scoring Shakhtar's seventh and final goal in the thrashing of BATE Borisov in which he scored five - equalling the Champions League record for goals in a game . Adriano drills home a penalty to complete the Ukrainian club's emphatic victory in Belarus . His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Lionel Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. But taking on the German champions is an entirely different proposition and current circumstances aren't exactly ideal for the reigning Ukrainian champions. They are currently living a nomadic existence, with their Donbass Arena abandoned amid the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists. As if to illustrate the volatility of the situation in eastern Ukraine, the Arena was shelled back in October, causing damage to the giant glass panels that form its facade. Luiz Adriano in action during the return match with BATE, played in Lviv back in November . Includes all competitions . 2006-2007 . 6 games, 0 goals . 2007-2008 . 19 games, 5 goals . 2008-2009 . 29 games, 9 goals . 2009-2010 . 36 games, 17 goals . 2010-2011 . 37 games, 20 goals . 2011-2012 . 35 games, 16 goals . 2012-2013 . 32 games, 15 goals . 2013-2014 . 39 games, 25 goals . 2014-2015 . 20 games, 14 goals .

Ukrainian Super Cup 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014 . So the first leg tie will be played some 750 miles (1,200km) to the east in Lviv, meaning Shakhtar miss out on many of the home advantages so crucial in the Champions League. But one constant amid the upheaval has been Luiz Adriano's goals - he has 14 in just 20 matches across all competitions so far this season. And he is out of contract in the summer. With the upheaval at Shakhtar unlikely to be resolved in the near-future, Adriano hasn't committed to a new deal and this has alerted a host of Europe's leading clubs as he would be available for nothing. He hails from Porto Alegre, grew up idolising Romario and Ronaldo and started his career at hometown club Internacional, for whom he made 12 league appearances and scored three goals during the 2006-2007 campaign. But before he reached that stage, he had to choose between football and his other great talent - music. He played in a rock band back home and never misses an opportunity to show off his singing skills. The highlight of his short career at the club came against European champions Barcelona in the final of the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup. Having scored the winner against Al-Ahly in the semi-finals, the striker came on as a late substitute in the final and assisted Adriano Gabiru in scoring the winner. Luiz Adriano celebrates with Willian (right) after scoring against Chelsea in a Champions League tie in 2012 . Around this time, he was involved in the Brazil Under 20 squad, making 11 appearances and scoring twice, but he didn't make the step-up to the Selecao's first team until last year. In March 2007, Luiz Adriano followed in the footsteps of many other Brazilian players by moving to the Ukrainian league with Shakhtar for a fee of about £2.5m. His first full season with Shakhtar resulted in Ukrainian league glory and in 2009, he scored the team's first goal in their UEFA Cup final win over Werder Bremen. By 2009-2010 he was fully settled in Donetsk and his goalscoring ratios steadily climbed - in 2009-10 he scored 17 goals in 36 games and the following year got 20 in 37. Luiz Adriano goes up for a challenge with Fulham's Aaron Hughes during a 2010 Europa League tie . His goals helped Shakhtar to an outstanding period of success as they won the title five seasons in a row and became a dangerous opponent to face in Europe. In February 2011, he scored the decisive goal in their 3-2 away win over Roma in the first leg of a last 16 tie. His involvement in Europe has sometimes been controversial. He received a one-match suspension for unsporting behaviour after pouncing on a Willian backpass to the Nordsjaelland goalkeeper following an injury and going on to score. Shakhtar backed UEFA's sanctions and said they were deeply disappointed by Adriano's actions. Across all competitions, he has 122 goals in 253 appearances for the club and his fourth goal against BATE meant he overtook Andriy Vorobey to become their all-time leading goalscorer. Adriano had understandably hoped to receive a call-up to the Brazil squad for last summer's World Cup finals on home territory but Luiz Felipe Scolari overlooked him. However, in October, Dunga called him up for the friendlies against Turkey and Austria, and he made his debut in the former.","Luiz Adriano will lead the line for Shakhtar Donetsk in their Champions League last 16 tie with Bayern Munich on Tuesday night .

"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused feminists of not understanding the special status that Islam attributes to mothers . Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has set off a new controversy, declaring that women are not equal to men and accusing feminists of not understanding the special status that Islam attributes to mothers. Addressing a meeting Monday in Istanbul on women and justice, Erdogan said men and women are created differently, that women cannot be expected to undertake the same work as men, and that mothers enjoy a high position that only they can reach. He said: 'You cannot put women and men on an equal footing. It is against nature. They were created differently. Their nature is different. Their constitution is different.' Erdogan told the audience of Turkish women - which included his own daughter Sumeyye - that Islam has 'defined a position for women [in society]: motherhood.' 'Some people can understand this, while others can't,' he added. 'You cannot explain this to feminists because they don't not accept the concept of motherhood.' He recalled: 'I would kiss my mother's feet because they smelled of paradise. She would glance coyly and cry sometimes. 'Motherhood is something else.' The president went on to say that women's 'characters, habits and physiques are different.... You cannot place a mother breastfeeding her baby on an equal footing with men. 'You cannot get women to do every kind of work men can do, as in Communist regimes. 'You cannot tell them to go out and dig the soil. This is against their delicate nature.' He was apparently referring to the practice during and after World War II for women in Communist states like the USSR to do heavy manual work in factories or in roles such as tram drivers. Erdogan's Islamic-rooted government  has long attracted criticism for of seeking to erode the country's secular principles and limiting the civil liberties of women. In particular, Erdogan has drawn the ire of feminist groups for declaring that every woman in Turkey should have three children and with proposals to limit abortion rights and the morning-after pill.

'It is alleged that the American continent was discovered by Columbus in 1492,' he said. 'In fact, Muslim sailors reached the American continent 314 years before Columbus, in 1178.' 'In his memoirs, Christopher Columbus mentions the existence of a mosque atop a hill on the coast of Cuba,' Erdogan said, adding that he'd like to see a mosque built on the hilltop today.

"Louis van Gaal has dismissed criticism of his tactics and claimed that Manchester United’s traditional 4-4-2 formation leaves him nervously ‘twitching my ass’ on the bench. After discussing the merits of a back-three over a back-four on Thursday, the United boss resorted to talking about his backside. In a variation on Sir Alex Ferguson’s famous quote about ‘squeaky bum time’, Van Gaal said: ‘I know that with 4-4-2 the stats are giving the positive results, but when you analyse the game I have twitched my ass on the bench because we were out of balance. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is keen on sticking with his favoured 3-5-2 formation . Van Gaal, pictured at Loftus Road, has said he twitches his 'ass' on the bench when his play 4-4-2 . ‘All the matches when we play 4-4-2, like against West Ham United, it was always twitching your ass and I don’t like it.’ The Dutchman’s comments came after frustrated United fans were heard chanting for their team to switch to a more attacking 4-4-2 formation at QPR last weekend – a move that was rewarded with goals from Marouane Fellaini and James Wilson. Former United captain Gary Neville has also urged Van Gaal to ditch his preferred 3-5-2 system, claiming that the use of three centre-backs slows down play and encourages a safety-first approach. Statistically, United have conceded fewer goals per game using that system this season, but also picked up fewer points. Van Gaal admitted that his players are still uncomfortable with the new tactics, and there is a growing feeling that United should return to the cavalier style that made Ferguson’s teams so entertaining. The Dutchman believes his players are struggling to get to grips with his preferred 3-5-2 formation . But Van Gaal dismissed the criticism as ‘ridiculous’ and claimed that it was brought on unfairly by the recent home defeat against Southampton. Reminded of the chants from supporters at Loftus Road, he maintained that he must be left to make decisions irrespective of the feeling among the club’s fanbase. ‘I have to take into account 600million opinions?’ said Van Gaal. ‘I have to communicate with my players and observe my players and analyse my players and my team and my opponent and the quality of my opponent, and then I have to make a decision with my staff. ‘The players are still not comfortable (with 3-5-2). It is very important that they are comfortable, and I would like them to feel more comfortable. ‘But after I switched the system we have won nine or 10 in a row. Then we lose one match and the discussion about the system is coming, so it is ridiculous.’ Gary Neville, pictured with Jamie Carragher, has urged Van Gaal to revert back to four at the back .","Louis van Gaal believes his side are not balanced when they play 4-4-2 .

"A former Playboy bunny today accuses embattled comedy legend Bill Cosby of drugging and raping her - and sexually assaulting 12 other Playboy bunnies. P.J. Masten, from New Jersey, said she was in her 20s and working at Playboy's famous Chicago club in the late 1970s when she met the star, who then invited her out to lunch. A dinner date soon followed, at the end of which, she claims she woke up naked and bruised in a bed after being drugged and attacked by Cosby, adding: 'There were bruise marks all over me. I knew I was raped.' And in shocking claims, Masten - real name Patricia - told CNN: '(There are) 12 former bunnies that I know of that are ashamed to come forward, frightened to come forward, married with families (and) don't want to come forward. But they were also drugged and raped by Bill Cosby.' Fresh claims: Former Playboy bunny P.J. Masten is the latest woman to claim Bill Cosby drugged and raped her . Allegations:  P.J. Masten, pictured with Cosby, first met the star in the Playboy club in Chicago . Coming forward: P.J. Masten say she was prompted to come forward by Judy Huth, who claims Cosby attacked her when she was 15 at the Playboy mansion . P.J. Masten donned the famous bunny ears, tight-fitting corset and fluffy tail for her job as a waitress at the Chicago club. She started working for Playboy in 1972 in her home state of New Jersey and went on to work in LA and Chicago for the organisation. She said she first met Cosby in Chicago and he invited her to lunch, telling CNN how he jumped behind the counter to make hot dogs, saying: 'Everybody was in there laughing. It was a lot of fun.' The next day, she said the comic called and asked her to dinner and told her to meet her at the Whitehall Hotel. Email: tips@dailymail.co.uk . Going up to his room, she was greeted by four of his friends who were watching sports with the star, and smoking cigars and playing cards. Cosby asked Masten if she wanted a cocktail before dinner and she drank a glass of Grand Marnier and ice he handed her. 'The next thing I knew, it was 4 o'clock in the morning,' she told CNN: 'I woke up in a bed naked, bruised. He was laying next to me, and I slithered out of the bed... I got myself together, I went downstairs, I got in a cab, and I went home.' Asked if she knew what had happened, Masten said: 'There were bruise marks all over me. I knew I was raped.' Masten said she told her supervisor at the Playboy club soon after the alleged assault, only to be told: 'You know that's Hef's best friend, right?', referring to Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. Masten recalled: 'I said, 'Yes.' She said, 'Well, nobody is going to believe you. I suggest you keep your mouth shut'.' The blonde said she's been in therapy for years - but said she had been prompted to come forward decades later by Judy Huth, who claims Cosby attacked her at the Playboy mansion in LA when she was just 15 in 1974. Huth is suing the star for sexual assault - but Cosby is suing her, calling her claims 'absolutely false' and accusing her lawyer of extortion. Lawsuit: Bill Cosby is accusing Judy Huth, who says he attacked her when she was 15, of extortion. She has launched a lawsuit against him for sexual assault . P.J. Masten speaks to CNN's Alisyn Camerota . Former Playboy bunny Carla Ferrigno in circa 1980 in Los Angeles, California, with her husband, actor and bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno. She claims Cosby assaulted her too . Victoria Valentino, a former Playboy Playmate in 1963, has come out to say Bill Cosby raped her as well. However, Masten said: 'That was it for me. This man has to be held accountable. He's a serial rapist. He's been that way since the '60s.' And she is convinced there are other Playboy bunnies with similar experiences of Cosby. She said Cosby has come up at a recent reunion of Playboy bunnies, as well as in blogs and Facebook pages restricted to them. The public allegations stirred up lots of private conversations, involving a number of women, Masten says. Demands: Attorney Gloria Allred is flanked by Bill Cosby accusers at her office on Wednesday, from left, Chelan Lasha, Beth Ferrier and Helen Hayes . Weeping: Chelan Lasha, now a grandmother, breaks down on Wednesday afternoon as she claims that Cosby drugged and assaulted her when she was 17 . 'A couple of (them) private messaged me and said, 'He did me too. It happened to me, too',' she told CNN. Cosby, now 77, is accused of attacking 20 women, and has so far remained silent amid the myriad of claims. However, his lawyer Marty Singer launched legal action against Judy Huth this week, accusing her of making up claims of assault and demanding $33,295 in damages. In another link between Playboy and Cosby, another accuser, Carla Ferrigno, says she was an 18-year-old Playboy bunny when she went with a male friend to Cosby's Beverly Hills home in 1967 and he kissed her roughly after her date left the room. Meanwhile, Playboy playmate Victoria Valentino says a friend introduced her to Cosby hoping to help her get work on his show I Spy in the late 1960s. She alleges he gave her pills at dinner to 'cheer up', after which she felt 'stoned' as he took her to another place. There, Valentino said Cosby pushed himself near her mouth, before turning her around and raping her. Asked by CNN why she didn't speak out about the incident until recently, Valentino said, 'As a playmate, I thought, who would believe me?' Attorney Gloria Allred has challenged Cosby to pay $100 million in damages to the women who claim he sexually assaulted them. The lawyer this week introduced three alleged victims - two who have never spoken before - and as they broke down in tears, she told Cosby he could waive the statute of limitations so all the women accusing him of assault could have their day in court. The woman who started it all: Andrea Constand, a former basketball player, sued Cosby in 2005 and settled later on. Beth Ferrier was Jane Doe No 5 in Andrea's civil court case . Emotional: Former supermodel Janice Dickinson says Cosby drugged and raped her in 1982 . Alleged victims: Tamara Green (left) and Barbara Bowman (right) join the ranks of woman who claim Cosby assaulted them . If not, she said, he could stump up $100 million - and the money would be handed out to the women by a committee of retired judges. Speaking at her California law offices, Miss Allred said she had been forced to tell many women who had contacted her to report abuse at the hands of the comic legend that they were too late to file a lawsuit due to the statute of limitations. However, she said: 'Today, I am here to propose two new solutions to this public dilemma and a away to determine if Bill Cosby is a saint of a sexual predator.' She said that if Cosby is 'confident' he has done nothing wrong, he could waive the statute of limitations, adding: 'Then his alleged victims would have an opportunity to have their allegations dealt with on their merits. 'Bill Cosby would have an opportunity to address there allegations in a court of law and the victims and Mr Cosby would have an opportunity to have a judge and jury decide who should be believed.' Chelan Lasha, from California - now believed to be a 46-year-old Grandmother- claimed that Cosby attacked her when she was just 17 in 1986 when she was an aspiring model. 'I laid down,' she said: 'He laid down next to me on the bed and began pinching my left nipple and humping my leg while he was grunting. 'I could not open my eyes. I couldn't move or say anything. I felt something warm on my legs. Then I blacked out.' 'Thirteen to sixteen hours later I woke up by hearing Mr Cosby clapping his hands and saying 'Daddy says wake up'. He gave me $1500. He said the money was to buy something nice for me and my grandmother and he also invited me to go to the Temptations show with my grandmother. 'My grandmother went but I did not go because I was too sick. Then he invited us to his show. My grandmother really want to go. I did not, but I went with her and heckled him. As a result, I was fired from my job.' No comment: Bill Cosby yesterday thanked Whoopi Goldberg and singer Jill Scott for their support on Twitter - but has made no public statement . Chelan was joined by two other women, Helen Hayes, who claims Cosby fondled her breast after stalking her and her friends 'like a predator' after they met in the summer of 1973. Beth Ferrier, meanwhile, who has already come forward, alleges that she had an affair with Cosby, which ended in him drugging and raping her - and leaving her to come to in her car in an alleyway. She was Jane Doe 5 in the civil suit brought against Cosby by Andrea Costand, the first woman to allege he had attacked her, in 2005. Former basketball player Andrea ended up settling out of court.","Former Playboy bunny P.J. Masten says star attacked her in 1970s .

"Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville has admitted he is still waiting for the 'penny to drop' with under-pressure defensive trio Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling. Neville remains a passionate United fan despite his new career as England assistant manager and TV analyst for Sky Sports. The former Old Trafford full back has claimed the current United defence lacks 'control' but has attributed that to injury problems. Gary Neville (left, with Roy Hodgson) believes Manchester United defensive trio Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans and Phil Jones still have work to do if they are to develop into reliable players at the highest level . Neville still has great hopes the 'penny will drop' and Smalling will develop into a top-class player . Evans in action during Manchester United's 2-0 win at Queens Park Rangers on Saturday . Jones has also struggled to find consistent form for United at times this season . Click here to read Stretty News editor Dale O'Donnell's interview with Gary Neville . Meanwhile, he has revealed that United’s three central defenders still have work to do if they are to develop in to proper players at the very highest level. Neville said: 'When you are with England and you work with the likes of Smalling or Jones, you hope that a manager comes in and grabs them, plays them, trusts and puts belief in them. 'So when David Moyes came in last season we thought that would be good news because David likes British players. 'This season Louis van Gaal has come in. A great coach and someone that worked all over Europe. 'He’ll get them good on the ball, good defensively, in good positions to receive the ball, opening their body out and passing forward with composure. 'For Luke Shaw it’s perfect. The manager believes in attacking full backs and Luke is fantastic going forward. Luke is powerful, quick and hugely talented. Then you want to get a grip on him and mould him into a world-class player. 'Then with the likes of Smalling, Jones and Evans we still have great hopes for that penny to drop. Neville believes coach Louis van Gaal is the perfect man to get the best out of his defensive players . Luke shaw could fit Van Gaal's idea of an attacking full-back and could develop into a world class player . Neville was a wonderful servant for United, playing in 602 matches over nearly two decades at Old Trafford . 'If you remember for many years we had players that potentially had it. Darren Fletcher all of a sudden became the most important person in the team for a few seasons. It was like: ‘Wow, here we go, he’s a player now’. 'Cristiano took two or three seasons and the penny dropped. People have got to remember the frustrating Cristiano to appreciate the great one. 'Aaron Ramsey at Arsenal is another example. You lose a bit of patience at times but you know they have the talent inside them and you think they’ve got the brain and willingness to do it. 'They’re still developing and picking up injuries but when they stop and the penny drops you think: ""We’ve lived with his faults, development and now we’re getting the benefit of it."" 'There is no doubt that Jones, Smalling and Shaw have talent but they need experience, maturity and injuries to stay clear and they will fly.' Neville cites the example of midfielder Darren Fletcher, who grew into one of United's indispensable players . Neville also praised Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey (right) as a player who has reached his potential . Neville made his comments in a wide-ranging interview with the Stretty News fanzine and website. United fans will be interested to hear that he still has hopes for Evans, Jones and Smalling, who have been criticised at times this season as part of United’s much-discussed back three. Jones is only 22 but Smalling is 25 and Evans 27 which does make some people wonder how long Van Gaal will have to wait for them to reach the potential Neville talks about. Neville added: 'When I look at the United defence what it lacks is control. 'I see players that have talent but they’re all individually working, not having controlled movements together or in-sync. That comes through understanding and from playing together. 'No manager, whether it’s Sir Alex Ferguson or someone else, over the past three years, would be able to put a consistent defence out there. 'Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Jones, Smalling and Evans all had injuries. Now Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind get injured. I don’t care which manager you are. Marouane Fellaini celebrates scoring United's opening goal at QPR with Antonio Valencia . Young striker James Wilson sealed United's win at Loftus Road with a goal in stoppage time . United are currently fourth in the Premier League table, 12 points behind the leaders Chelsea . 'The reason that Chelsea have the best back four in the league is because they have good players, they play every week without many injuries. 'United have been absolutely blitzed with injuries in those positions for the last three years. 'At times they look all out at sea but you have to say in Louis van Gaal’s defence, he has had Darren Fletcher in defence, Michael Carrick in defence with Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young as wing backs that have done well. 'But if you said last season that Louis van Gaal’s going to come in and Young is going to be a left back, you’d start laughing. You’d laugh your head off but he’s been fantastic. 'There has been so many changing formations, systems and personel that it’s so difficult to get that sense of control in-between the units. That’s all it lacks.' Antonio Valencia evades a challenge from QPR's Clint Hill during Saturday's match in London . Ashley Young has enjoyed a renaissance as an attacking full back under Van Gaal this season . Asked elsewhere in the interview which are his three favourite United players, Neville mentions Wayne Rooney and Angel di Maria but is unstinting in his praise of Michael Carrick. He added: 'I love Carrick. I have respect for Carrick. 'You never hear anyone that’s played with Carrick at Manchester United have a bad word to say about him. 'Ultimate professional, understanding and loves the club by the way. 'Don’t get bought into this: ‘Michael Carrick doesn’t show passion’ and all that crap. He loves Manchester United. 'You see him on a team night out when we won the league and he can be the loudest of the lot. 'So, the idea that Michael Carrick just comes in as a bit of a mouse that does his job unnoticeably is rubbish. 'If you look at Louis van Gaal at the start of the season and we were struggling, ask yourself who wasn’t playing? Michael Carrick wasn’t playing. Neville rates Michael Carrick as one of his favourite members of the Manchester United squad . Carrick fights for the ball with Eduardo Vargas of Queens Park Rangers during Saturday's match . 'Now he’s playing and the club went on a great unbeaten run. I think he would be first or second on Louis van Gaal’s team-sheet because he brings control and authority. 'Manchester United fans get it. I wanted Bryan Robson and someone to run through brick walls and coming out with bandages wrapped around his head. That’s what Manchester United fans want. 'But then when you play with Michael Carrick you think there is authority, control, peace. 'When you are on a football pitch playing against Liverpool or Manchester City, you need peace around you as well. 'You sometimes don’t want people running around like blue-arse flies. 'Scholes and Carrick together was peaceful. It was like going into a bar and hearing a piano playing. It’s relaxing. 'Listening to some good rock is good and you like that too but sometimes it’s nice to listen to a piano. Carrick’s a piano.'

"Our guide shouts: ‘Do you know what culture is?’ to a group of rowdy Americans trying to climb a column in  the gladiators’ arena. Before they can answer, he adds: ‘I don’t think you do.’ We are just starting our tour of Pompeii, and it is already obvious that Giuseppe runs a tight ship. When Vesuvius erupted (‘How far away is Vesuvius? I already told you. Nine miles.’) on August 24, AD 79, the explosion was the equivalent of two atomic bombs being detonated. Blast from the past: Pompeii, where the Temple of Apollo recalls former glories, is a wonderful site . Anyone who did not escape the ash was asphyxiated. ‘They had a few minutes when they knew their fate,’ Giuseppe informs us solemnly. One of the remarkable plaster-cast bodies that were formed using the spaces these unfortunate souls left in the earth when they shrank to nothing — displayed in a glass cabinet — shows a contorted man on his back, with his hands up in front of him. His terror is almost palpable. There are only nine of us on this escorted tour with Back-Roads Touring, which is a refreshingly intimate luxury as Guiseppe reveals Pompeii’s sophistication. It was built on a grid, with roads running north to south and east to west - with stepping stones across the main street to help pedestrians avoid cascading water. Much maligned: Naples has a reputation for grime and crime - but few cities have a more picturesque setting . They also built vaulted ceilings at the public baths (so condensation did not drip on people having massages), bakeries on most street corners and ornate houses. They even used to write graffiti. These flourishes of street art have modern-day echoes in Naples, the starting point for our tour, a 15-mile hop from Pompeii. Almost every space on the city’s pastel-coloured buildings has been used as an informal canvas. Naples is known for grime, but it can be enthralling, its narrow lanes packed with people, beeping mopeds and laundry hanging from balconies. Our group get along well. We also have plenty of time to ourselves and don’t eat every meal  together, so it never feels like a school trip. Here's one I made earlier: Kate emerges from her cookery class at Tenuta Seliano, clutching an Easter cake - and perhaps still wondering about her encounter with a naked Prince Harry in Naples (not the one shown here) The Via San Gregorio Armeno is a wonderful Neapolitan oddity — an alley where Christmas is a permanent affair. Little workshops sell festive figurines, although I struggle to grasp how the naked statuette of Prince Harry (or the, thankfully, clothed Silvio Berlusconi) could be a seasonal bauble. We are all awestruck when we enter the Sansevero Chapel and glimpse its marble centrepiece, Il Cristo Velato (The Veiled Christ), carved in 1753 by Giuseppe Sanmartino. We move on to Tenuta Seliano in Campania. Perfectly positioned for a trip to the nearby ruined Greek temples at Paestum, it is part of Baronessa Cecilia Baratta’s 250-acre buffalo farm. She turned this cluster of stone buildings into a haven for rural tourism in 1991. Come explore: Naples has many intriguing districts - like the Quartiere Spagnoli - that many visitors never see . Tenuta Seliano also features a splendid old farmhouse, the Masseria Eliseo. Here, the Baronessa and her kitchen staff give us a cooking lesson, making ricotta-filled ravioli, Easter cake, sublime pizza and fried mozzarella. I eat my bodyweight in carbohydrates, and we tour the farm. The buffalo are docile and curious. One licks my foot with a giant grey tongue as the cows queue to be milked. As we return to the house we see that a calf has just been born. Its innocent expression is the exact opposite of the frightened faces frozen in time at Pompeii.

"Russian billionaire Alexander Lebedev faces up to seven years in jail after being charged yesterday with ‘hooliganism’ over a televised punch-up. Moscow prosecutors launched a criminal investigation against Mr Lebedev, whose family backs the Independent and London Evening Standard newspapers, after he threw a punch at a property developer during a prime-time talk show. The 52-year-old media tycoon – who also co-owns Novaya Gazeta, Russia’s main pro-democracy paper, and is a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin – faces the same draconian charges that resulted in members of female punk group Pussy Riot being jailed, prompting global outrage. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Hooliganism': Alexander Lebedev, left, has been charged in connection with the punch-up withSergei Polonsky . Take that: Lebedev punches fellow oligarch Polonsky in the head during a heated discussion for a TV show . The anti-corruption crusader and . staunch defender of a free press believes he is being punished by the . Kremlin for political reasons. Friends of Mr Lebedev say he has been . subjected to a campaign of harassment, with offices raided by scores of . investigators, prospective business partners warned off and smears about . his private life posted on the internet. The billionaire claims the case against him is a vendetta by President Vladimir Putin (pictured) His son Evgeny, owner of the British . newspapers, writing on Twitter, said: ‘He is being targeted by people . who don’t like his stance against corruption, and hate Novaya [Gazeta]. ‘I don’t condone violence, but the . punishment does not fit the crime here. We need more Russians to speak . out against injustice, not fewer. I hope this isn’t the start of a new . crackdown.’ He later said: ‘This is an extraordinarily disproportionate response to what happened in a TV studio many months ago. ‘My father has been targeted because . of his determination to fight against corruption and to be a crusader . for democracy in a country where this has not always been welcome. My . father has spent his life trying to promote freedom of expression and . justice in his fight against corruption in Russia. ‘I hope that common sense prevails and . that these excessive charges are dropped. I really hope that this does . not presage a new phase of crackdowns on those who speak out against . injustice.’ Mr Lebedev, reported by Forbes . magazine to be worth $1.1billion, knocked Sergei Polonsky to the floor . during a televised debate on Russian TV last September. Mr Polonsky told him during the show about the global financial crisis that he would like to ‘punch someone’s lights out’. Mr Lebedev later said: ‘I don’t regret . hitting him. As far as I am concerned, I had to act as he had been . aggressive throughout the show and had made threats. Calm before the storm: Lebedev, left, was a . studio guest with Sergei Polonsky, right, but the discussion soon boiled . over into violence . Taking a stand: Lebedev has had enough and looms threateningly over Polonsky . ‘Anyone in my position would have done the same – in fact, I showed restraint. ‘The only thing I regret is that people might now perceive me as a violent person, which I am absolutely not.’ 'My father has been targeted because of his determination to fight against corruption and to be a crusader for democracy in a country where this has not always been welcome' Evgeny Lebedev, Alexander's son . The media magnate and his close . friend, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, own a 49 per cent stake . in Novaya Gazeta, Russia’s main opposition newspaper. Its relentless . criticism of the Kremlin, and its investigations into official . corruption have put many of its journalists in danger. Four Novaya reporters have been killed . since 2000, including Anna Politkovskaya, a fierce critic of the . Kremlin and its policies in Chechnya, who was gunned down in the . elevator of her Moscow apartment building in 2006. Others have been . harassed and attacked. Mr Lebedev was charged with . hooliganism and assault ‘motivated by political, ideological, racial, . national or religious hatred, or hatred of a particular social group.’ Last month, writing in The Mail on . Sunday, he said: ‘I have been the subject of several criminal . investigations after allegations made against me, including one of money . laundering and one of harassment. Calming: Polonsky persuades Lebedev to sit down again . Fight night: Lebedev snaps and sends Polonsky flying onto the studio floor . ‘I have no doubt these were a direct . result of my part ownership of the leading opposition newspaper in . Russia, Novaya Gazeta, which has published many stories about abuses of . power within Putin’s government.’ 'Anyone in my position would have done the same – in fact, I showed restraint. The only thing I regret is that people might now perceive me as a violent person, which I am absolutely not' Alexander Lebedev . In the same article, Mr Lebedev urged . Mr Putin to pardon the three members of the Pussy Riot band – jailed for . two years for their anti-government performance in a Moscow cathedral – . and totally reform the Russian justice system. Mr Lebedev described the band’s . treatment as ‘just one of many examples of politically-motivated abuses . of the criminal justice system’, adding: ‘This means that those who, . like me, are viewed as opposing the government, often find themselves . enmeshed in ludicrous accusations.’ He predicted his imminent legal . problems in an interview in Moscow on Tuesday, saying: ‘I know the . position of the president. He thinks it is true that if you have been . funding (the opposition), so I was violating rule No 1 – if you have . money you should not interfere ( in politics).

"A tap in apiece from Carlos Tevez and Alvaro Morata ensured Juventus left Turin with a slender advantage over Borussia Dortmund in this Champions League last 16 tie. Jurgen Klopp's rejuvenated team arrived off the back of three consecutive Bundesliga wins, and a composed first-half finish by Marco Reus means they travel home with an away goal in a 2-1 defeat. The Italian champions searched for a third but it was in vain as Juventus face Dortmund in the second leg on March 18 at Westfalenstadion with the tie perfectly poised. Read Kieran Gill's full match report from the game here. Host commentator . Juventus have secured a slender advantage to take to Dortmund for the second leg after a hard-fought 2-1 win against Jurgen Klopp's win. The visitors bossed the first half but goals from Carlos Tevez and Alvaro Morata sandwiched between a goal from Marco Reus, means Juve have the advantage. 89min: Carlos Tevez receives a standing ovation as he is replaced by 18-year-old Coman for his Champions League debut. 86min: Vidal is replaced by versatile Italian Padoin. 85min: Substitute Pereyra drags his shot wide - but he really should have put this game out of Dortmund's reach. Excellent build-up play from Marchisio and then Morata results in the 24-year-old finding space in the area, but his left-footed shot doesn't find the net. 80min: Pereyra is cautioned for a late challenge on Mkhitaryan. 77min: Tevez goes close again with a right-footed strike from close range, as Weidenfeller parries the ball out for a corner. 75min: Immobile won't be scoring against his former side tonight as he makes way for Blaszczykowski. Paul Pogba has been a joy to watch yet again - the midfielder will surely attract Premier League interest this summer after yet another impressive campaign to date. This heatmap from our excellent match zone service shows just how much the 21-year-old has commanded play in the middle - while also helping his side attack on the front foot. Pogba has also registered a second assist in as many European appearances, including the assist for Morata's goal against Dortmund here tonight. 62min: Juve go close to adding a third goal of the evening as Tevez hits a thunderous half-volley in the area after Lichtsteiner's cross from the right found the Argentine inside the box. 55min: Immobile goes close again for Dortmund, getting hold of the ball inside the area, but can only fire his shot straight at Buffon. A good chance goes begging for the visitors. 53min: Marchisio's corner causes mayhem in the Dortmund area. Weidenfeller gets extremely lucky there as he grasps the ball gratefully to his chest. 49min: Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal is penalised for a late challenge on Marco Reus. 45min: Kirch for Papastathopoulos . Juventus lead here at half-time by two goals to one, but Jurgen Klopp will be shaking his head wondering how they are losing this one. There's a long way to go though and the Dortmund manager will take plenty of encouragement from that first-half display . 43min: Goalscorer Tevez is involved in the build-up teeing the ball up for Pogba, whose cross across goal finds Morata, and the 22-year-old makes no mistake from close range. It's harsh on Dortmund who have been the better side. 36min: Pereyra on for Pirlo - The veteran midfielder has picked up a knock and has also been forced off. A real shame. Will be interesting to see how Juventus recover from this. 32min: Ginter on for Piszczek - The 29-year-old has had to come off after failing to recover from a few knocks he's received in this game. A huge blow for the visitors midway through this first half. 18min: An instant response from the visitors as Reus punishes a mix-up at the back between Juve pair Chiellini and Lichtsteiner to calmly roll the ball home past Buffon. What a start to this game! GOAL! JUVENTUS 1-0 Borussia Dortmund . 13min: Tevez nets his fourth goal in the Champions League this season and 20th in all competitions, as he taps home from close range after suspect goalkeeping from Weidenfeller in the Dortmund goal after Morata's shot was initially blocked. 10min: Dortmund are beginning to settle into the game now after Juventus looked to be firmly in the ascendancy in the opening stages. There'll be goals in this game, mark my words. 1min: Immobile nearly gives the visitors a dream start after just a minute. The 25-year-old's rasping right-footed effort from just outside the area goes inches over the bar with Buffon rooted to his spot. Juventus kick us off from left to right as the Serie A leaders look to maintain their sensational 46-match unbeaten home run. We are just minutes away from kick-off here at the Juventus Stadium. Serie A leaders Juventus will be hoping to take a lead into the second leg in Germany, with Jurgen Klopp's side aware how crucial an away goal could be in this tie. Juventus starting XI: Buffon, Lichtsteiner, Bonucci, Chiellini, Evra, Marchisio, Pirlo, Pogba, Vidal, Tevez, Morata . Juve subs: Storari, Caceres, Ogbonna, Padoin, Pereyra, Coman, Llorente .

"St. Louis County authorities planning for the grand jury decision in the Michael Brown shooting case asked for the National Guard to be stationed in Ferguson, where Brown was shot by city police officer Darren Wilson. The request for troops and armored Humvees was turned down because Missouri Governor Jay Nixon preferred to have the police on the front lines for the announcement of the jury's decision according to records released on Tuesday. The November 24 announcement that Wilson, a white officer, wouldn't be charged for killing the unarmed black 18-year-old led protesters upset by the decision to loot stores and set fire to businesses and vehicles as images of the destruction were televised nationwide. Some residents, local officials and state legislators have since questioned why Nixon didn't more quickly deploy the National Guard to those areas. Ferguson police asked for the National Guard to be deployed for the grand jury decision in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown. The request was not granted as Governor Nixon preferred to use the Guard in a support role . Nixon's office provided hundreds of pages of documents to The Associated Press on Tuesday in response to an open records request that had been pending since early December. The materials also were given to a legislative committee that has been holding hearings on Nixon's use of the National Guard. The records show that security planning began long before the grand jury announcement, as officials sought to avoid a repeat of the sometimes violent protests that occurred after Brown was shot on August 9. On October 10, the National Guard sent Nixon's office a presentation outlining its potential use. Among other things, it noted that the Guard could be mobilized early to reduce the potential of the president deploying troops, and it said up to 1,500 security forces could be staged in the St. Louis area on the day of the grand jury decision. Michael Brown (left), 18, was unarmed when he was shot on August 9, 2014, by police office Darren Wilson (right). Wilson has since resigned from the Ferguson Police Department . In November a state grand jury decided not to charge Wilson. The announcement of the decision sparked a night of riots and damage to property in parts of Ferguson where Guard deployment had been requested . About a month later, the Missouri State Highway Patrol met with police from St. Louis city and county about specific locations where the Guard could be used. The police sought Guard protection at numerous government buildings, including fire stations, as well as at various businesses, according to memos provided to Nixon's office. A November 13 patrol memo said that St. Louis County police sought to use National Guard troops at the Canfield Green apartments, near where Brown had been shot, and along West Florissant Avenue, which had been the focal point of prior protests and looting. The memo said county police also sought the Guard's protection at the Ferguson Police Department but were told that probably wasn't possible. Nixon has said that he wanted to avoid the potential for soldiers to point guns at — and potentially shoot — American citizens. He has noted that no one was killed in the November 24 riots . Violent protests and looting erupted in Ferguson on November 24, and many buildings and vehicles were burned and vandalized . A St. Louis County police spokesman did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Tuesday. An internal National Guard memo, dated November 18, said the proposal to send eight armored Humvees and 64 soldiers to the Canfield Green apartments 'does not appear to meet Governor's intent for initial National Guard use.' That same day, Colonel Dave Boyle sent an email to National Guard colleagues updating their preparations for potential unrest in the St. Louis area. 'Optics of various sorts are important as we head towards this mission,' Boyle wrote, adding that the Guard was planning for a 'lower profile, less confrontation' mission that would emphasize its support role and 'minimize public militarization perception.' Nixon has said that he wanted to avoid the potential for soldiers to point guns at — and potentially shoot — American citizens. He has noted that no one was killed in the November 24 riots, even though many buildings were burned and vandalized. 'I think when people look back on this, they will appreciate that we showed an incredible amount of discipline,' Nixon told reporters last week. The Guard was eventually sent to the Ferguson areas that were burned and looted, but only after much of the damage had been done. The remnants of Prime Beauty after the November riots in Ferguson.

"Businessman Andrew Woodhouse, 43, apprehended a burglar at his tyre firm and was then charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent . A businessman who confronted a burglar raiding his premises appeared in court yesterday accused of attacking him. Andrew Woodhouse, 43, was chasing thieves off his property when he claims one of them 'came at' him with a wooden stick. Father-of-five Woodhouse allegedly used the stick to injure the man's legs before holding him down while his wife called the police. But when officers arrived they arrested Woodhouse and held him in a cell for 18 hours. He appeared at Newport Crown Court yesterday charged with grievous bodily harm with intent which has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Andrew Taylor, defending, said: 'Mr Woodhouse apprehended two of the burglars at his tyre depot. 'It happened after two or three men decided they were going to remove a large quantity of diesel from his premises. 'Mr Woodhouse has been interviewed by police and has provided a full explanation about what happened. 'There is a CCTV recording of the incident and we are waiting to see the footage.' Woodhouse denies the charge and was given bail until next month. A Facebook page has been set up in support of Woodhouse, of Abergavenny, South Wales with more than 2,000 supporting him. Woodhouse was in bed with his wife Lisa at their detached home in the village ofGovilon, near Abergavenny, when his burglar alarm went off at about 12.30am. The alarm is fitted to his business premises on an industrial estate a mile from his six-bedroom £350,000 home. Woodhouse drove to his business premises where the alleged assault happened. Campaign: A Facebook group has been set up in support of Andrew Woodhouse with more than 2,000 people pledging their support . His wife Lisa said her husband was prepared to go through the legal process to clear his name. She said: 'But I fail to see where there was any intent on Andrew's part. 'He didn't intend to get up in the middle of the night to assault anyone. All he did was protect his property. 'People may think he took the law into his own hands but what was he supposed to do, stand by and watch?' Woodhouse employs six staff including two of his sons at the family business, which was set up 20 years ago. The firm has lost £15,000 in recent years to thefts of diesel and tools. Two fuel thieves who stole £50 worth of diesel from Woodhouse's premises on the night of the alleged assault have been dealt with in court. Timothy Cross, 31, and Kevin Green, 52, took two jerry cans of diesel from Woodhouse's tyre depot in Abergavenny. Cross and Green both admitted theft and were fined £75 by Cwmbran magistrates.

"A 24-year-old man was tasered at least 13 times before he died in police custody, an attorney for the deceased victim has revealed. Gregory Lewis Towns, Jr was killed last April in East Point, Georgia after he was arrested by police who responded to reports of a domestic dispute with his girlfriend. Towns died after Cpl Howard Weems and former Sgt Marcus Eberhart tasered him a combined 13 times while he was laying on the ground, in an attempt to get him up and moving, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Scroll down for video . Justice: 24-year-old Gregory Lewis Towns, Jr was killed on April 11 after he was tasered by police officers a combined 13 times. An attorney for his family said on Tuesday that they plan to file a lawsuit. Above, a picture of the incident . Police even tased Towns when he was wet and lying in a creek . However, this revelation contradicts what the officers self-reported at the time - that they only tasered Towns six times. The Medical Examiner later ruled Towns death a homicide. Now Chris Stewart, an attorney for Towns' family, plans to file a lawsuit against the department later this week for wrongful death. 'This situation is indefensible,' Stewart said. Killed: The Medical Examiner ruled Towns' (pictured) death a homicide. He leaves behind a now 7-month-old son . The Fulton County District Attorney is also awaiting the evidence of an investigation into the incident, before deciding whether to bring up criminal charges to a grand jury. In a press conference on Tuesday, Stewart recounted the deadly confrontation on April 11, after Weems and Eberhardt responded to a 911 at Towns' girlfriend's townhouse, where she lived with their now 7-month-old son. After getting into a foot-chase with Towns, the man ended up on the ground. According to records stored on the taser, and eyewitness accounts, Towns was tasered about 13 times - including once while he was wet in a creek. Eberhardt triggered his taser 10 times to Weems' three times. Stewart says Towns was on the ground, and that the officers were trying to get him up and moving to go back to the squad car. Savage: Chris Stewart, an attorney for Towns' family, says the officers used their tasers to 'cattle prod' the 24-year-old . 'He wasn't cursing. He wasn't being abusive. He was saying, ""I’m tired,""' Stewart said. 'They used their Tasers as a cattle prod on Mr Towns while handcuffed.' Stewart adds that the incident was not racially-motivated since both of the officers were black, like Towns. 'Mr Towns' killing is not about race. It's about police brutality...going to the extreme.' Cpl Weems continues to appeal his firing from the department. Neither officers issued a statement following news of the lawsuit.","Gregory Lewis Towns, Jr was killed on April 11 after a confrontation with police in East Point, Georgia .

"Steve Jobs asked his former girlfriend for tantric sex in the garden shed after returning from a trip to India - but refused to climax because he wanted to conserve his energy for work, she has claimed. Chrisann Brennan added that they 'shared nights of lovemaking so profound that, astonishingly, some . fifteen years later, he called me out of the blue to thank me'. Brennan, who dated the late Apple boss for five . years until she became pregnant with their daughter Lisa, has shared the . intimate details in a new book due out this month, 'The Bite in the Apple: A Memoir of My . Life With Steve Jobs'. The couple began dating in 1972 and two years later, he visited India - and returned a changed man. Former flame: Chrisann Brennan (left) dated Steve Jobs (right, in 1977) for five years in the 1970s before Apple went public. She has shared intimate details of their relationship in a new book due out this month . During the trip, he came across a religious gathering, shaved his head and experimented with drugs. He then left for the U.S., giving all his money to his travel companion. After he returned, 'it all broke open between us when he asked if I would make tantric love with him in his garden shed,' Brennan writes in the book, as quoted by the New York Post. But she added that she refused because they were not spiritually prepared for the experience. She said that he returned from the trip with a sexist attitude towards women and 'started to reject the feminine aspect as inferior to the glorious masculine'. This extended to their sex life, she explained. Opening up: Brennan (left with their daughter Lisa) has written a book (cover pictures above) about her five-year relationship with Jobs. They split aged 23 when he learned she was pregnant . Married: Jobs wed Laurene Powell, right, in 1991 and they went on to have three children together . 'Our birth control method up to that . point was Steve’s coitus interruptus, also called the pull-out method, . which for him was about his conserving his energy for work,' she wrote. He explained that he didn't want to climax so he could build 'power and wealth by conserving one’s vital energies'. Child: He also accepted his daughter, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, and paid for her to attend Harvard . She . was concerned about their lack of contraception and was fitted with an . IUD - but fell pregnant within the following 24 hours when their . lovemaking was 'truly kinder', she said. But when, at 23, she told him that she had fallen pregnant, 'Steve's face turned ugly. He gave me a fiery look,' she wrote. 'Then he rushed out of the house without a word.' He refused to talk about the child and 'told me he felt like I was stealing his genes', she said. The couple broke up in 1977. He went on to deny that the child was his - but in 1979, a paternity text proved that Lisa was indeed his daughter. Afterwards, he agreed to pay $500 a month support. He later accepted his daughter and paid for her to attend Harvard. She now works as a journalist. In 1983, he cruelly told Time magazine that '28 per cent of the male population in the United States could be the father'. After . he agreed to the meager child support, Apple - which he had built up . while living with Chrisann - went public weeks later, making him . millions of dollars. Jobs married Laurene Powell in 1991. The couple had three children together before his death from cancer in 2011.

"Jose Mourinho has criticised the tactical ineffectiveness of Roy Hodgson and Vicente Del Bosque at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Hodgson's England and Del Bosque's Spain both crashed out in the group stages, and Mourinho admitted that he could not understand the manager's decisions when losing matches. Speaking to Alastair Campbell for his new book 'Winners: And How They Succeed', the Chelsea boss said of England: . Roy Hodgson looks on, hands on hips, as England struggle at the Brazil World Cup in June 2014 . Luis Suarez scored twice for Uruguay to resign England to defeat in Sao Paolo in their second Group D match . Suarez spreads his arms in celebration - and Mourinho admits he would have treated the game differently . 'They are losing [to Uruguay in their second group match] and, if they lose, they are out of the tournament, so they have to score. They made two changes at 1-0 down. But when Roy Hodgson made these changes — [Raheem] Sterling out, [Ross] Barkley in, then [Adam] Lallana in for [Danny] Welbeck — I couldn't see a strategic change. Same tactical model, same system.' 'You are losing 1-0, you need to get a draw at least, so I say take one defender off and play three at the back, put an extra man to midfield/attack. 'So maybe take off [Leighton] Baines and play [Gary] Cahill sweeper, [Glen] Johnson and [Phil] Jagielka marking one each, an extra man to midfield or attack. Then Uruguay have to adapt.' The Chelsea boss (centre) has criticised the way Hodgson didn't change his tactics against Uruguay . Some England fans felt the same as Mourinho - that Hodgson hadn't done enough tactically . Mourinho also stuck the boot in to Vicente Del Bosque - the Spain manager who also saw his side crash out . Mourinho's in-depth analysis of England will haunt fans who wanted him in charge in 2007, when he came close to accepting the role before his wife told him to turn it down 'because he'd be bored'. The now-Chelsea manager, who has guided his team to top of the Premier League, then turned his attentions away from analysing England, instead focusing on Spain, whose  World Cup exploits were equally as bad as the Three Lions - if not worse. 'They [Spain] are losing — so Diego Costa out, Fernando Torres in. Why? Play them together. You need to change. They will say, ""Ah, but Spain has its own system, its own philosophy"" — hell, if it is not working, you change.'","England and Spain both crashed out at the group stages of the World Cup .

"Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has some unexpected roots, it has been revealed - his ancestors were carpenters in Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria. The family of the former Massachusetts governor lived in England's industrial northwest for generations before converting to Mormonism and heading for the New World. Romney is one of the wealthiest . Americans ever to run for the White House and has estimated his fortune . at between $190million and $250m. Scroll down for video . British connections: Mitt Romney, left, has family in the north of England while President Barack Obama, right, last year visited an Irish village where one of his forebears once lived . Before we were Mormons: Romney's ancestors lived in Dalton-in-Furness before moving to the US in 1837 . Many of his remaining family in Britain's rainy north, however, are factory workers or unemployed. Jennie Iveson, a 69-year-old widow who lives in a modest home in Barrow-in-Furness, the shipyard town once at the heart of Britain's industrial revolution, said: 'It's all come out of the blue. 'It's a surprise really. Big surprise.' Her link to Romney came to light when her grandson-in-law began tracing their family history by . delving into archives in their home county of Lancashire two weeks ago. Records show that Mrs Iveson is Mitt Romney's fourth cousin - they share a . great-great-great grandfather, George Romney, who died in 1859. Now . she can't help but notice that her distant American relative bears a . striking family resemblance. 'I saw him on the telly twice the other day, last week I think. He looks . a bit like my brother,' said Mrs Iveson, a retired factory worker, most of . whose children have no jobs. '[My brother] looks quite like him. He had dark hair like him. It's all . grey now. He (Romney) looks like our Mike. Same sort of face and . everything.' Distant cousins: Jennie Iveson, a former factory worker, said she believes the wealthy American looks like her brother . Cuppa and a catch-up, Mitt? Simon Nash, his wife Maria and their 12-year-old daughter Sarah at their home in Preston, northern England. Mrs Nash is Romney's fourth cousin, twice removed . She shrugs and smiles when asked about Romney's privileged status in the US, where he is sometimes accused by . critics of being out of touch with poor people. 'I wish him luck and . everything else,' she said. For Romney, his faith and English roots remain a sensitive issue, partly because his Mormon religion is still regarded with suspicion by some American voters. When he came to Britain in July this year, Romney did not visit the area where his family have their roots - unusual since emphasising a European heritage is often seen as an electoral plus in U.S. politics. Barack Obama, who faces Romney in the November 6 presidential election, went down well last year when he toured an Irish village where one of his forebears once lived - despite being born in Hawaii himself. Romney's campaign spokeswoman made no comment when asked how the Republican challenger felt about his English origins. In Lancashire, the county the candidate's ancestors left behind, Romney enthusiasts offered their own explanation. 'He is Mormon and this is Mormon central,' said Christopher Nelson, a local vicar with an interest in Romney's heritage. 'Perhaps he would perceive (coming here) as highlighting his Mormonism more than highlighting his roots.' Amateur genealogist Simon Nash was astonished to discover while digging into regional records recently that his wife Maria - Mrs Iveson's granddaughter - was Romney's fourth cousin twice removed. Humble origins: A sign for Romney Road in Dalton-in-Furness, where relatives of the Republican candidate were born and bred in the 18th and 19th century . Poring over archival material at his home in the industrial city of Preston, Mr Nash, whose day job involves dressing in a duck outfit and posing as a mascot for a local football team, more interested in US politics. 'If he got in, America would be a completely different place in three years time to what it is now,' he said. 'I don't know if it will be for the better.' Mrs Nash, 32, was equally astounded by his research. 'I was very much shocked ... It still feels like... it's not quite happening to (me),' she said. 'It's quite an unreal feeling.' She said meeting Romney in the White House would be 'surreal', but she 'would like to go there for a brew if he ever got in there.' The village of Dalton-in-Furness, a picturesque scattering of mediaeval cottages, is where the Romney clan began. Hidden past: Romney did not visit the area his family are from when he came to Britain in July . One of his ancestors was carpenter William Romney, who gained notoriety for making his own coffin and putting it on display in his workshop before he died in 1915. 'I get the impression that quite a few Romneys were carpenters. It seems to be a family trait,' said Jim Walton, a Dalton historian, outside a canary-yellow cottage where William Romney used to live and work. 'Should Mitt Romney succeed and become the next president of the United States, he would be able to look around in pride and say: ""My great-great-granddad came from Dalton-in-Furness"". Well, I hope he can say that in pride.' Another famous son in the family was George Romney, who went to London and became one of the most celebrated portrait painters of the 18th century. Who do you think you are? An original baptism record shows details of some of the presidential candidate's relatives in what was then Lancashire . Two streets and a park are named after the artist, who is said to have had a secret affair with the mistress of Lord Nelson, the naval hero who defeated the French at Trafalgar. George was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's parish church - where Mitt Romney's great-great grandparents, Elizabeth and Miles, were baptised and married before converting to the Mormon faith in 1837 and moving to the United States. Their daughter Sarah's baptism record from the year before is still in the archives in Preston, with her father's vocation - joiner - scribbled in an old parish book. 'It's a fascinating story that Dalton holds,' said Reverend Alan Mitchell, gazing over the town's skyline from the top of a church tower - a view that has changed little since Romneys lived here. Pointing at a couple of old communion cups, he added: 'The Romneys could have touched these.' At the time, Lancashire was a tough, polluted and chaotic place to live, and disease and drunkenness were rife. Mormon promises of a better and more orderly life fell on fertile ground. 'It was a grimy, mucky hell on earth,' said Nelson, the vicar. 'Why on earth you would want to stay here, if somebody tells you there is milk and honey elsewhere? It was a horrible place.'","Romney did not visit his family when he came to Britain in July .

"Santa Claus came to town in his droves, as hordes of Christmas-lovers dressed up as St Nick to mark the start of the festive season. Hundreds of men and women dressed as Father Christmas descended on London for SantaCon 2014. The event is a flash mob style celebration that started several years ago and has gained popularity through social networking sites. Scroll down for video . Christmas lovers dressed up as St Nick for the annual Santacon event in London . Sea of red: Throngs of men and women dressed as Father Christmas descended on London . Festive fun: The crimson-crew spread Christmas cheer by handing out gifts and singing Christmas carols . Ho Ho Ho: Organisers of the London event describe it as 'non-profit, non political, non religious and non sensical Christmas parade' The holiday themed revelry now takes place in  300 cities around the world, including New York, Vancouver, and Moscow. The first SantaCon took place in San Francisco in 1994. The New York parade is said to be the largest with around 30,000 Santas taking part. The crimson-crew  spread Christmas cheer in London by handing out gifts and singing Christmas carols. Among the mob of red suites and white beards were the odd elf, Christmas tree and even a reindeer. Event organisers describe it as 'a non-proﬁt, non-political, non-religious and nonsensical Christmas parade takes place in London one Saturday every December.' They said: 'There’s no particular reason to dress up in Santa suits, run around, give gifts, sing songs, have strangers sit on our laps and decide who is naughty or nice. But it’s a lot of fun so Santa does it anyway.' This train load of participants were keeping to the rules of the event by donning their Christmas apparel . The festive parade took in a selection of London landmarks, as well as a number of bars and pubs . Crimson-crew:  These three friends were getting in the festive spirit as they enjoyed Santacon 2014 . Participants start in three different locations before converging into one massive parade . The Santas set off at three different meeting points across the north, east and south of the capital before converging into one big festive parade. The route included Oxford Street, Covent Garden, Hyde Park Corner and Brick Lane. Ahead of the event participants were advised of two rules  - Christmas apparel was mandatory and they must not turn into a bad santa. Elsewhere around the world hundreds of santas also took to the streets to take part in numerous other events this week. Las Vegas, US, Toyko, Japan, Budapest, Hungary, and Bucharest, Romania held Father Christmas themed charity fun runs . Over 400 people competed in a Santa  fun run in Toyko,  Japan .

"East London will stop for a moment on Wednesday night. As Lionel Messi clambers off the Argentina coach on Green Street, hundreds will gather to catch a glimpse. Half of the world’s big two is in town for one week only. It’s not to be missed. Messi has already captured the imagination around West Ham’s Rush Green Academy base – particularly after playing a practice match against the club’s Under 21 side – and is set to dazzle under the East End lights. Lionel Messi practices his shooting as Argentina train at West Ham's Rush Green Stadium . The Barcelona superstar listens to Argentina coach Gerardo Martino during the training session .

Alen Halilovic (right, pictured while at Dinamo Zagreb in 2012) is set to play some part for Croatia during the friendly . Halilovic (left, playing for Croatia Under 21s) was snapped up by Barcelona but has only featured for the B team thus far . There are question marks over whether Atletico Madrid striker Mario Mandzukic will feature for Niko Kovac's side . Luka Modric (playing against Rayo Vallecano on Saturday) is likely to start on the bench for the Croats in east London . Sergio Aguero scoring for Manchester City against Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Rob Green during the weekend's 2-2 draw . That fleeting game was described as an ‘unreal experience’ by youngster Sam Westley as fever engulfs this pocket of the capital. Messi has sprinkled a little bit of magic already. But that will hit new highs when Argentina take on Croatia at Upton Park. Only Cristiano Ronaldo – with the added gravitas and swagger – is bigger business than Messi. For many, the little forward is their hero and any opportunity to see him in the flesh - in their own backyard - has to be taken. Although West Ham are only hosting a friendly, one which should be relatively one-sided, you only had to be down at Rush Green on Tuesday to fully realise what this means. Diafra Sakho might be banging in goals this season and on his way to becoming a new icon, but it is not often a three-time Ballon d’Or rocks up ready to play ball. The Barcelona star will play wide for Gerardo Martino’s team against depleted opposition. Add to that suggestions of Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero also playing, and there could be goals aplenty. There is also the added subplot in Tevez’s return to a place he is adorned for the first time since November 2012 on a night when he will end a three-year absence from international football. Only he won’t be a rival on this occasion, but a striker to celebrate and applaud. Javier Mascherano too, although his stock isn’t quite so high with Hammers. Manchester City striker Aguero is one of several Premier League stars selected in the Argentina squad . Argentina's players warmed up for their friendly encounter with a behind closed doors game against West Ham's Under 21 side . The 27-year-old appeared to be feeling the effects of the British weather away from the warmer climate in Spain .

Argentina have an embarrassment of riches up front with Tevez (left) and Messi (right) likely to be accompanied by Aguero . While Niko Kovac’s Croatia are without a number of star names, likely to rest Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic while striker Mario Mandzukic may be on the bench. Modric would actually rather be out there amongst it. ‘Of course I’d love to play against Argentina,’ he said. ‘I’d be wonderful, but the match against Italy is much more important and we’re going to prepare well for Sunday. ‘I think the game against Argentina will be a good one. I think they’re scary and play really well, but we’re going to work hard to get a good result. I hope we can put up a good fight.’ But it does hand an opportunity to an 18-year-old who – if he continues a startling rise – seems primed to carry the hopes of a nation for the next decade and more.

Barca thought enough of him to hand the teenager a five-year contract after an encouraging spell in the first team at Dinamo Zagreb. There has been Premier League interest, but you fancy the Catalans want to keep him close. ‘Obviously he has great potential and there is a great career ahead of him,’ Kovac said. ‘He has the quality and has spoken with his Barcelona team-mates regarding Wednesday's match. I'm sure they are all looking forward to it.’ Watching Messi strut his stuff and having a look at a star in the making - Angel di Maria hasn't even got a mention. And they said international friendlies had lost all meaning.","Argentina warmed up for their international friendly against Croatia with a practice game against West Ham U21s .

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho could have breached his BT ambassador contract by his surprise appearance on rival network Sky's Goals on Sunday. Mourinho used the programme to make a 27-minute attack on referee Martin Atkinson's performance in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley culminating in Nemanja Matic's sending off following Ashley Barnes's horror tackle. And Mourinho choosing Sky - whom he wasn't speaking to a few weeks ago following their comments about Diego Costa - to make such a controversial TV appearance naturally infuriated BT. Jose Mourinho asked specifically to be a guest on Sky Sports' show Goals on Sunday to air his grievances . After Mourinho requested to go on Goals on Sunday, planned guest James Beattie had to make way . The studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Chelsea star Nemanja Matic and his manager  Mourinho . Mourinho is lucratively paid to represent BT and his deal stipulates that he can only appear on other networks when his Chelsea club work demands - such as Premier League, Capital One Cup, FA Cup and Champions League commitments or when the club insist on other occasions. BT, who are more annoyed with Mourinho's representatives than Jose himself, are considering what action to take as a consequence. But it is likely to be resolved with Mourinho doing extra work for BT to compensate for their upset, . Mourinho's camp are saying that Chelsea ordered him to go on the programme, but Goals on Sunday co-host Chris Kamara claimed on Twitter that Mourinho had been promising to come on the show for some time and contacted him last Saturday. A Chelsea spokesman said that it was a joint decision between the club and Mourinho made after the game against Burnley. Matic's reaction to Barnes's tackle earned the Serbian a red card - he'll now miss the Capital One Cup final . Martin Atkinson, the referee for Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley, was criticised for his decisions on Saturday . The Chelsea manager did not look happy as he watched on from the sidelines, and later aired his thoughts . Mourinho appeared to be agitated during the game, airing his frustrations to media after the match . After Chelsea's game against Burnley, Jose Mourinho listed four minutes; four key incidents that he believed the referee had got wrong. Here, Sportsmail looks at them: . 30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up when he realises no action is being taken. It should have been a free-kick and could have been a yellow card for Barnes. Barnes catches Ivanovic with his right boot during an aerial challenge in the 30th minute . 33 - Ivanovic goes for goal but Michael Kightly diverts it with an outstretched arm, as he turns his back to goal. Martin Atkinson waves play on. It should have been a Chelsea penalty. Ivanovic fires a shot at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of Michael Kightly . 43 - Diego Costa goes to ground after  Jason Shackell leans into him with an oustretched arm. Atkinson waves play on. It could have been a Chelsea penalty but would have been  soft. Diego Costa vents his frustration after being shoved inside the box by Jason Shackell . 69 - Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic's left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand. It was a shocking tackle that merited a red card for Barnes and a Chelsea free-kick.

"Diego Costa may have taken the Premier League by storm since arriving at Chelsea last summer, but the Spain international is lagging behind opposite number Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the Champions League. A £32million signing from Atletico Madrid in June last year, Costa hit the ground running in England, scoring seven times in his first four league games including a brace against Everton and a hat-trick against Swansea. The 26-year-old has continued his impressive form for the league leaders and leads the way in the Premier League goalscoring charts with 17 from just 19 games. Diego Costa will return to the Chelsea side for the PSG clash after three-game domestic suspension . Costa has yet to score in five Champions League appearances for Chelsea this season . Zlatan Ibrahimovic prepares for Tuesday's Chelsea match at PSG training on Monday . But Costa has failed to have the same impact on the European stage and has failed to find the net in five Champions League group stage appearances this season. The powerful striker has drawn a blank against Schalke and Sporting Lisbon twice while he was unable to make an impact as a half-time substitute during the 1-1 draw with Slovenian minnows Maribor. Jose Mourinho will be hoping that statistic comes to an end on Tuesday night when Chelsea travel to PSG for the first leg of their last-16 clash at Parc de Princes. Stats courtesy of Squawka . Costa in action against against Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League back in September . Ibrahimovic has scored twice in the Champions League this season, including against Barcelona . Ibrahimovic celebrates after scoring against Caen at Parc de Princes in Ligue 1 on Saturday . The Brazilian-born striker will return to the starting line up for the Blues following a three-game domestic ban and if Chelsea are to advance to the quarter-finals they will be relying on Costa to outperform PSG talisman Ibrahimovic. The 33-year-old comes into the fixture having scored in each of his last two Ligue 1 games for Laurent Blanc's side and will be the main threat facing John Terry and Co in the Chelsea backline. Ibrahimovic has made two fewer Champions League appearances than Chelsea hitman Costa this season but has outscored his opponent finding the net twice for the French champions. Despite his struggles in Europe Costa is leading the way in the Premier League with 17 goals . Sweden international Ibrahimovic scores from the penalty spot against Lyon earlier this month . Costa celebrates after scoring in the Premier League against Arsenal during Chelsea's 2-0 win . The Sweden international scored PSG's second in a 3-1 win against Ajax in November before giving his side the lead against Barcelona, only to eventually lose the game 3-1 at the Nou Camp. The former AC Milan and Barcelona striker has featured in Europe's top club competition for 266 minutes compared to Costa's 307 minutes and has needed had only 11 shots to score his two goals. Costa, meanwhile, has failed to fins the target from his 14 strikes at goal, but the former Atletico forward has tested the goalkeeper more with 63 per cent shooting accuracy compared to 50 per cent for Ibrahimovic.","Chelsea travel to PSG for Champions League last-16 first leg on Tuesday .

Mr Bitmead, who created the car with help from his brother, Geoff, and friend Nigel Douglas, said: 'I love setting myself a challenge, and once I'd got the idea in my head, I was determined to see it through. 'We were chatting one day about how more people have probably driven a Cozy Coupe than any other kind of car - and it snowballed from there.

We set up the company to make unique bespoke vehicles for film, television and photography, and hopefully, we might be able to use this car to raise some money for charity too.'

"A new scathing report has unearthed shocking statistics about student maths teachers. It claims typical student teachers have the maths ability of a 12-year-old and they wouldn't have the necessary skills to pass a Year 9 NAPLAN test.

A new scathing report has unearthed shocking statistics about student maths teachers . He tested the maths ability of all of his 125 students, including 40 students in the third year of their bachelor of education degree. The 125 students had enrolled in a graduate diploma of education at Griffith University, which only accepts students who have already completed a bachelor degree. Of the 165 students tested, just about half of them could convert 5.48km into metres. It claims typical student teachers have the maths ability of a 12-year-old and they wouldn't have the necessary skills to pass a Year 9 NAPLAN test . Dr Stephen Norton, a lecturer in mathematics at Griffith University in Queensland, conducted the research, which shows that nearly half of his class would not pass the year 9 test, even after three or four years of study . More than half of the student teachers who took the test could not answer the simple question: 'If the total cost of three tickets is $5.64, how much will 10 tickets cost?'. 17% of the students ran in to trouble converting 6kg into grams and only 16% were able to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. Interestingly, one in four easily converted fractions to percentages while just one in five were able to find the highest common factor of the numbers 28 and 70. More than half of the student teachers who took the test could not answer the simple question: 'If the total cost of three tickets is $5.64, how much will 10 tickets cost?' In another worrying find, one in three students were capable of finding the areas of rectangles and triangles. Speaking to The Weekend Australian, Dr Norton vented his frustration over the results, claiming his students should have mastered the ability to answer all these questions by the end of primary school. 'Every year I test my students and they've got th understanding of a Year 7 or Yaer 8 kid,' 17% of the students ran in to trouble converting 6kg into grams and only 16% were able to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit .

"A former civil service aide to Tony Blair, Sir Jeremy (pictured) was nicknamed 'Sir Cover-up' for his role preventing the release of documents during the Iraq War inquiry . Britain’s most powerful civil service mandarin is trying to ‘sabotage’ an attempt by David Cameron to restrict his growing empire, it was claimed last night. Sir Jeremy Heywood was accused of a Sir Humphrey-style attempt to ‘dodge’ new rules that the Prime Minister decides who gets top civil service jobs. The row comes amid fears that the unelected official is now the most important person in the Cabinet after Mr Cameron and the Chancellor. Sir Jeremy, 52, has even been described by one ex-Tory aide as so powerful that he has the Prime Minister ‘by the balls’. A former civil service aide to Tony Blair, he was nicknamed ‘Sir Cover-up’ after preventing the Iraq War inquiry from seeing letters between Mr Blair and George W Bush in the run-up to the war. Now the Cabinet Secretary, he is accused of a bid to thwart Mr Cameron’s efforts to reduce his and other top mandarins’ influence. Under reforms which were agreed two months ago, the Prime Minister will get the final say on appointing senior Government posts, instead of the Civil Service Commission. The move has been condemned by civil service unions, amid concern from Ministers that some top mandarins are blocking or obstructing Government policy. But Ministers privately claim that Sir Jeremy is already trying to get round that by ensuring his favoured candidate Melanie Dawes lands the coveted £190,000-a-year job as the next permanent secretary at the Department of Communities and Local Government. Scroll down for video . Ms Dawes, 48, a former senior Treasury official, is currently the Cabinet Office’s director-general for economic and domestic affairs. One Minister privately said last night: ‘Sir Jeremy is making it very clear that she should get the job. Ms Dawes is very talented but if the many other able candidates think it’s a done deal, they won’t bother applying. No sooner do we adopt new rules taking the power of appointment away from top mandarins then they try to sabotage them.’ Referring to the classic TV comedy series, the Minister added: ‘It’s classic “Yes Minister” tactics. Sir Humphrey will be proud of him – observe the rules in principle but work round them in practice.’ A MP claims Sir Jeremy has made it clear that Melanie Dawes (pictured) should get the £190,000-a-year job as the next permanent secretary at the Department of Communities and Local Government . An MP has likened the behaviour to that of Nigel Hawthorne's Yes, Minister character Sir Humphrey Appleby. Pictured from left are Hawthorne, Paul Eddington and Derek Fowlds in a publicity photo for the TV show . A Cabinet Office spokeswoman last night denied any interference by Sir Jeremy in picking the new permanent secretary. She insisted the process was being carried out ‘externally’ by the Civil Service Commission, which will draw up the shortlist and present it to the Prime Minister. She added: ‘It’s not Sir Jeremy’s decision.’ Last night, sources close to Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said he simply wanted the best person for the job. But one added: ‘I do think Eric would like the selection process to be in accordance with the new rules – and that means the Prime Minister having the final say.’ The new appointment will replace Sir Bob Kerslake, who is due to retire next February.","Ministers claim civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood is trying to 'dodge'  rules .

"Security is to be stepped up around the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during an official visit to New York amid widespread demonstrations over the death of an unarmed black man at the hands of local police. Thousands of protesters have flooded the city's streets after it was revealed officers who killed father of six Eric Garner would not face criminal charges. The disruption comes ahead of the Royal couple's three-day tour of the US, during which Prince William will be hosted by President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, at the White House. Scroll down for video . The Duke of Cambridge will be hosted by President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, at the White House next week . Tonight it was claimed the couple, who are expecting their second child, will be given extra security by the New York Police Department in light of recent turmoil. While an NYPD spokesman declined to comment, they confirmed the Duke and Duchess 'will be getting security.' Sources close to the couple, who will be joined with their own team of Scotland Yard bodyguards, however said they will be subject to extra precautions. ‘There is no suggestion of a direct threat to the Duke and Duchess whatsoever but the way these demonstrations are spreading is being taken into account when planning their movement,’ said one. William and Kate are due to arrive in New York on Sunday afternoon where they will be staying – like William’s late mother before him – at the Carlyle Hotel, where a suite costs £9,000. The couple will undertake a whirlwind trip, packing seven public engagements in two days. On their first night, the Duke and Duchess attend a private dinner held on behalf of American Friends of the Royal Foundation in New York. The foundation was set up by Princes William and Harry in 2009 and was heavily involved in the organisation of the Invictus Games. The couple, who will be joined by their Scotland Yard security team, will be subject to extra NYPD measures amid widespread disruption in the city . The couple's security team will take extra precautions throughout the visit as tensions continue to flare over the death of an unarmed black man at the hand of a New York police man . Clashes continue in the city following the decision that officers who shot Mr Garner will not face charges . Eric Garner died after being restrained by police . Tensions continue to flare in New York City following a Grand Jury decision not to bring charges against a police officer involved in the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed father of six who died after being put in a chokehold by NYPD police officers. Mr Garner, 43, was stopped in the street on Staten Island in July on the suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes. After an altercation with one of the police officers, the asthma-sufferer was placed in a chokehold on the ground. Struggling for breath, he can be heard in a video of the incident telling officers: 'I can't breathe'. The man later became unresponsive. A coroner ruled his death was the result of pressure on his chest while being restrained. Widespread pressure on the justice system to indite the police officers involved in his death came to a head this week when it was revealed they would not face prosecution. Thousands of protesters have clashed with authorities in New York City, with one crowd blocking off the Brooklyn Bridge. President Obama welcomed the city's announcement to increase police presence in protest-stricken areas, adding that the country has a sense of 'deep unfairness' over the case. During his visit, the Prince will be hosted by President Barack Obama in Washington DC while Kate remains in New York. Tonight a White House spokesman said it welcomed the Prince's devotion to the issue, describing it as 'both a national security threat and a devastating environmental problem.' His visit comes almost thirty years after Prince Charles and Diana were hosted by then President Ronald Regan and his wife, Nancy, in 1985. In New York, Duchess will carry out two solo engagements  accompanied by city's First Lady, Chirlane McCray. The two women will visit a local child development centre and a lunch, hosted by the British Consul General, to celebrate the achievements of a successful British community in New York from the culture, arts, hospitality and business sectors. As Patron of the University of St Andrews 600th Anniversary Campaign, the prince, accompanied by his wife, who met while students at the college, will also attend a Gala Dinner attended by stars including actor Tom Hanks. Time has also been set aside for a visit to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum and even an NBA Basketball game, where many are hoping they will be introduced to fans Beyonce and Jay Z. A Kensington Palace spokesman said neither royal had been to New York before and were hugely looking forward to the visit. 'The couple really are very much looking forward to all the special moments of the visit. 'They've been an integral part in planning it,' a spokesman said.

"Loving couple: Elizabeth Smart and Matthew Gilmour, in a Scottish kilt, were pictured walking hand-in-hand out of the temple after their wedding in Hawaii . New details are emerging about how Elizabeth Smart and her new husband Matthew Gilmour incorporated their respective family traditions into their tradition-filled Hawaiian ceremony on Saturday. The 24-year-old bride, who made headlines when she was found nine months after being kidnapped at knife-point when she was a young teen, looked stunning in a lace boat-necked dress with a full, drop-waist skirt. Mr Gilmour, 22, showed off his Scottish heritage with pride as he wore his dead father’s kilt and a boutonnière with blue thistle that had been flown in for the occasion. To outside observers, a quickly-planned Hawaiian wedding may not seem fitting for the ever-traditional couple, but the location has a real resonance with the bride: it is the place where she and her family visited in 2003 shortly after she reunited with her family after her harrowing kidnapping. ‘I guess you could say it was kind of a refuge,’ Ms Smart told People magazine. ‘Oahu is a very special place for me, very different than what I was used to.’ The couple, who met while on their . missionary year in France, married at an 11.30am ceremony in the LDS . Laie Hawaii Temple which was only attended by very close family and . friends. Recently married: Elizabeth, right, married Matthew Gilmour, left, in Hawaii in February . In accordance with the religion’s . teachings, the actual ceremony itself can only be attended by fellow . Mormons who have been given a ‘temple recommend’ sign-off, which . essentially says that they are viewed in good standing with the church. Traditionally, Mormon brides are . allowed to wear their wedding dress in the temple for the ceremony, . though without anything covering their face or head which meant that Ms . Smart would have had to take off her beautiful, flowing lace veil. Cover girl: Ms Smart incorporated Hawaiian flowers into her big day by using them in her bouquet . After the ceremony, which took . approximately 30-minutes, the  celebration continued as the group- which . only included 12 guests- went to the Turtle Bay Resort for the wedding . luncheon. The elegant lunch highlighted the . cuisine of the region, as the group of immediate family and a select few . close friends dined on island fish in mango-papaya salsa, Huli Huli . chicken, teriyaki steak and roasted Molokai sweet potatoes. Mr Gilmour and Ms Smart then took a . boat ride amid the beautiful Hawaiian surroundings as men in native garb . rowed and played the uekelele. That evening, the party continued at a . luau where guests were treated to a buffet-style dinner of Lomi Lomi . salmon and Kalua pig as well as some instructional hula dancing. While the Hawaiian culture was seen throughout the day, Scottish customs were scattered throughout. One such instance was the toast that . Mr Gilmour gave at the luau, where he began with the traditional ‘On . behalf of my wife and I’ introduction, which was met by a roar of cheers . and clapping by the group. Throughout the day, Ms Smart and Mr Gilmour continued wearing their wedding outfits. The ring: Elizabeth was seen wearing her new- and very unique ring- while she and her husband shopped Monday . Married couple: Elizabeth Smart and her new husband Matthew Gilmour were seen grocery shopping in Hawaii after they got married on Saturday during a secret wedding ceremony that they fast-tracked . The . bride finally found her perfect dress- after trying ‘just about every . dress in Utah’- off the rack at Kleinfelds bridal salon in New York. She certainly isn’t the first would-be . bride to have luck there: the store is the hub of activity on the TLC . reality show Say Yes To The Dress. In . order to look appropriate on her wedding day, Ms Smart had the dress . tulle dress retrofitted with lace sleeves and a demure neckline of . scalloped lace. Mr Gilmour . represented his Scottish ancestry- and his father, who died in 2008 . after a battle with cancer- by wearing his dad’s kilt. ‘I . wasn’t surprised Elizabeth was ready before Matthew because there is a . lot to putting on a kilt,’ his uncle Neville Henderson said. Announcement: The first glance of her ring came on a February 1 appearance on Good Morning America where she told the world that she was due to marry Mr Gilmour . Reception: After the Temple ceremony, the wedding guests and happy couple had lunch at the Turtle Bay Resort . The groom’s mother Kay made sure to . let the other men get in on the action, as she brought ties for Mr . Henderson and Elizabeth’s father that matched the same tartan as his . kilt. Young love: The couple met while abroad on their missionary year in the south of France . Though their wedding was clearly a . start of their new life together, the couple have visited each other’s . hometowns and plan to settle in Salt Lake City where Mr Gilmour will . attend university. After their missionary year, the then-friends realized that they were bound for more and began dating. The sparks really flew when she . visited him in Scotland and they visited historic castles, getting a . true sense of his heritage. He followed suit by flying to Salt . Lake City to spend time with her. While there, he asked for her father’s . permission to propose, picked out the unique sapphire ring, and asked . her the big question while they were out walking near her house. ‘The thing that attracted me the . most-at the beginning and now- is how confident she is, especially . considering everything she has been through,’ Mr Gilmour told People. Venue: The couple married at the Laie Hawaii Temple, the first Mormon temple outside the U.S. mainland . Secret: The Hawaii wedding was planned just a week in advance thanks to intense media attention . The wasted no time planning after . they were engaged, and while they originally wanted to get married in . the summer in Salt Lake City, they switched to the Hawaiian option due . to the massive amount of unexpected  media attention. Instead, they rushed to get everything together in less than a month after he proposed. 'Elizabeth's desire was for what most . women want — to celebrate her nuptials in a private wedding with family . and close friends,' said family spokesman Chris Thomas. 'After the story broke about her . engagement and the media became increasingly invasive, Elizabeth . recognized it was going to be impossible to have a traditional wedding . devoid of distractions and unusual challenges outside of her control. Never forgotten: Miss Smart, now a 24-year-old university student, wiped tears from her eyes as she recounted the details of how Mitchell 'married' then raped her . Captors: Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Barzee were both charged with various crimes for her kidnapping . 'She decided…the best way to avoid . significant distraction was to change her wedding plans and to get . married in an unscheduled ceremony outside of Utah.' Though she has become an occasional . ABC News contributor, Ms Smart has been wary of unwanted media attention . since she first made headlines in 2002 when itinerant street preacher . Brian David Mitchell broke into the Smart home and kidnapped her. He and his wife Wanda Barzee held her . for nine months, during which she was continuously raped and was even . married to Mitchell in a bizarre ceremony. In December, Ms Smart spoke out about . the ordeal, saying: 'He went straight from marrying me to raping me. And . after that moment I couldn't feel more worthless and more degraded. It . was the worse feeling I could have ever felt.' Going home: Elizabeth Smart with her mother Lois and police officers after being found close to her home nine months after she was abducted . He was convicted of kidnapping and sexual assault and was sentenced to serve life in prison in May 2011. Wanda Barzee was sentenced to 15 years in a Texas federal prison hospital for her role in the kidnapping of the girl. Now, after testifying at their respective trials and even forgiving Mitchell of the atrocities he committed against her, she is determined to move on with her new life, accompanied by her husband throughout. The couple were spotted on the Monday after their wedding, buying groceries at a local store while they enjoy their honeymoon at the same hotel that hosted their reception. The National Enquirer quotes an insider as saying that they hope to start a family immediately and aim to have their first baby by their one-year anniversary.","Husband is Scotsman Matthew Gilmour, a fellow Mormon .

"Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel says a new contract for David De Gea would send an important message as the Old Trafford club look to get back to the top. De Gea's fine form this season in an otherwise shaky United side has raised fears that the Spanish goalkeeper could make a move to Real Madrid with just a year-and-a-half left on his contract. And Schmeichel, who won five Premier League titles, three FA Cups and one Champions League title with United, says the club must tie the stopper down to show their rivals at home and abroad that they mean business after a difficult 18 months following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea has less than 18 months left on his Old Trafford contract . Legendary keeper Peter Schmeichel recognises the importance of getting De Gea to sign on at United . 'It's very important the club's best players sign new contracts to send a signal,' Schmeichel told Sky Sports. 'It shows that they believe in the Manchester United project and believe the club will go back not only to the top of the Premier League but also European football.' A sixth-place finish under David Moyes last season saw United fail to qualify for Europe at all but with United in fourth place and with an FA Cup quarter-final on the horizon, prospects are looking better this season. Schmeichel says De Gea signing would show he believes in United's ability to get back to the top . With signings like Angel di Maria coming in, United are certainly hoping to fulfil De Gea's ambitions . However, their indifferent form makes a title charge an unlikely prospect although a new deal for De Gea would be a huge boost to their hopes next year. 'If De Gea signs a new deal it would be a very big signal,' Schmeichel added. 'I'm sure everyone who loves the club would love that. 'Fingers crossed he will sign another five-year contract.' De Gea makes yet another of the string of brilliant saves he has produced in the Premier League this season .","David De Gea has less than 18 months left on his Old Trafford contract .

"A group of mothers have staged a mass breastfeed outside Claridge's after staff at the London hotel told a woman to cover up while she was feeding her baby. The demonstration took place days after Louise Burns complained that she was asked to place a large napkin over her baby's head in the restaurant as she breastfed. Ukip leader Nigel Farage became embroiled in the row suggesting mothers could 'sit in the corner' in restaurants to avoid offending people - and he insisted it was 'not too difficult' to feed a child in a way that was 'not openly ostentatious'. Scroll down for video . Demonstration: A group of mothers staged a mass breastfeed outside Claridge's today after staff told a woman to cover up while she was feeding her baby . Making a stand: Carla Mastroianni, 30, from west London, breastfeeds her seven-month-old daughter, Sienna, outside Claridge's during today's protest . At 2pm today, around 40 mothers braved freezing conditions to sit outside the hotel's grand front doors and feed their infants. The protest was organised by Free to Feed, which campaigns for the 'normalising' of public breastfeeding. Claridge's has said it 'embraces' breastfeeding, but requests that women are 'discreet towards other guests'. But mother-of-three Mrs Burns, 35, said she was 'shocked and appalled' when she was told to cover up. Emily Slough, 28, founded Free to Feed in March after she was labelled a 'tramp' on Facebook for breastfeeding in public. She travelled from Staffordshire with her 18-month-old daughter Matilda to be at the protest. Reaction: The demonstration took place days after Louise Burns complained that she was asked to place a large napkin over her baby's head in the restaurant as she breastfed . Claridge's has said it 'embraces' breastfeeding, but requests that women are 'discreet towards other guests' The 2010 Equality Act makes it unlawful for a business to discriminate against a breastfeeding woman . She said: 'I am here because someone broke the law by telling a woman to be unnecessarily discreet when she was breastfeeding in public. 'Lou Burns was being discreet when she was feeding her baby. We are here to show Claridge's they are not above the law. But they have said nothing to us, they are pretending we're not here. 'Every time something like this happens, many women are put off for life from breastfeeding. 'We're here to challenge that stigma and show women it's normal and natural.' At 2pm today, about 40 mothers sat outside the entrance to the hotel to feed their babies in a protest organised by Free to Feed, which campaigns for the 'normalising' of public breastfeeding . Breastfeeding mothers and supporters of Free To Feed staged a peaceful protest outside Claridge's . In reference to Mr Farage's comments, she said: 'Not everyone agrees. I'm not bothered what people think. We're here to encourage women to breastfeed, regardless.' Protest: Carla Mastroianni feeds seven-month-old daughter Sienna outside Claridge's . The 2010 Equality Act makes it unlawful for a business to discriminate against a breastfeeding woman. Setting out his views on the subject on his regular LBC radio phone-in, Mr Farage said: 'I am not particularly bothered about it, but I know a lot of people do feel very uncomfortable. 'This is just a matter of common sense, isn't it? Given that some people feel very embarrassed by it, it isn't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that is not openly ostentatious.' He argued it was 'up to Claridge's' what rules it wanted to operate. Pressed on whether it would be right for a hotel to ask mothers to use the 'ladies' room' to feed, the MEP replied: 'Or perhaps sit in the corner, or whatever it might be. That is up to Claridge's. 'It's not an issue I get terribly hung up about but I know particularly people of the older generation feel awkward and embarrassed by it.' Mumsnet chief executive Justine Roberts said: 'It's bemusing that some people have a problem seeing mums breastfeeding. 'It is of course a natural, essential human process and those with an issue simply need to get over themselves - babies need to be fed when they're hungry and there's nothing ostentatious about a mother responding to that need.' Downing Street left no doubt that David Cameron disagreed with Mr Farage's comments, saying that it was 'totally unacceptable' for mothers to be made to feel uncomfortable when feeding their babies in public. Protesters: Two mothers sit on the pavement outside the London Hotel in an act of defiance . Proud: Two mothers laugh as they breastfeed their babies today in response to the incident at Claridge's . A Number 10 spokeswoman said: 'It's for Mr Farage to explain his views. 'The Prime Minister shares the view of the NHS, which is that breastfeeding is completely natural and it's totally unacceptable for any women to be made to feel uncomfortable when breast-feeding in public.' Posting on Twitter, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'After 'that' interview, Nigel Farage should sit in a corner!' Louise Burns (left) was told to cover up while breastfeeding in Claridge's. Nigel Farage (right) became embroiled in the row suggesting mothers could 'sit in the corner' in restaurants to avoid offending people . Mr Farage later issued a statement to clarify his position: 'As I said on the radio, and as I repeat now, I personally have no problem with mothers breastfeeding wherever they want. 'What I said was - and it is immensely frustrating that I have to explain this - that if the establishment in question, in this case Claridge's, wants to maintain rules about this stuff, then that is up to them, as it should be. 'I remarked that perhaps they might ask women to sit in a corner. Did I say I believe they should have to? No. Did I say I personally endorse this concept? No. Snub: One protester strapped a sign to the back of her baby claiming in future she would be breastfeeding at the Ritz rather than Claridge's . Downing Street left no doubt that David Cameron disagreed with Mr Farage's comments, saying that it was 'totally unacceptable' for mothers to be made to feel uncomfortable when breastfeeding . 'We do however have to recognise that businesses have a responsibility to all of their customers, some of whom may well be made uncomfortable by public breastfeeding. 'It's a two-way street - breastfeeding women should never be embarrassed by staff asking them to stop and most mums will recognise the need to be discreet in certain, limited, circumstances. It is just a question of good manners.' The 2010 Equality Act makes it unlawful for a business to discriminate against a breastfeeding woman.

"A £300million tycoon who has failed to pay a £450,000 fine was slammed by Britain's most senior judge, who said 'it seems there is one law for the rich and another for the poor'. Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the Lord Chief justice, said multi-millionaire Philip Edward Day should pay the fine imposed on him for damage caused to ancient Cumbrian woodland. The judge made the comments after he discovered Day had not paid the fine within a court-ordered 112-day limit. Tycoon Philip Edward Day (left), has not paid a £450,000 fine for damage caused to ancient woodland, with Lord Thomas (right), the Lord Chief Justice, saying 'it seems there is one law for the rich and another for the poor' Day is battling to clear his name and is challenging he £450,000 fine imposed on him in August for allowing workmen to decimate a beauty spot so a track could be built to his pheasant shoot. Natural England took Day to court after a huge swathe was cut through picturesque Gelt Woods, flattening trees, churning up soil and disturbing wildlife on his land near Brampton, Cumbria. Before the illegal felling, the area was sheltered by birch and oak trees. Mosses and liverworts grew on sandstone outcrops and birds such as pied flycatchers, redstarts and wood warblers thrived. But by the time Mr Day's workmen had finished, the landscape – which provided stones for Hadrian's Wall – was a scarred scene of destruction. Lord Thomas told the Court of Appeal: 'We send people to prison, we do not wait for the outcome of any appeal - why should this be any different? 'It seems to me there is one law for the rich and another for the poor. It is really of concern that a fine of this magnitude has not been paid, in light of the destruction of part of the common heritage of mankind. 'There is no reason why the exchequer should not have had these funds - if the appeal is successful, they would pay it back.' Philip Day admitted causing the 'devastating' damage near Edmond Castle, his Tudor-style mansion in Cumbria . Natural England took Day to court after a huge swathe was cut through picturesque Gelt Woods in Brampton . Mr Day, who lives in Edmond Castle, a 19th Century Tudor-style mansion, said he did not know the work was being carried out and had not authorised it. However, after Judge Peter Hughes QC ruled the offence was one of 'strict liability' - and did not depend on Mr Day's state of knowledge - the businessman admitted two counts of allowing unauthorised work to be carried out. Mr Day was given 112 days to pay the fine, with a jail term of four years to be served in default, but his lawyers told Lord Thomas the payment had been 'put on hold' pending the outcome of his appeal. Richard Matthews QC, for the tycoon, argued the fact the works had taken place on his land was not enough to attach any blame to Mr Day for what happened. He added the fine imposed on Day, said to be as rich as the Queen, was 'excessive', and that too much weight had been placed on the accused's wealth, with a £40,000 fine more reasonable. Judge Hughes did not take enough account of the £30,000 spent on restoration works at the site, Mr Matthews also argued. Worken flattened trees, churned up soil and disturbed wildlife on Day's land hich provided stones for Hadrian's Wall . Famous structure: The cliffs at Gelt Woods still bear the marks of Roman stonemasons who worked during the building of Hadrian's Wall (pictured) in around 122AD . He said: 'There was the opprobrium of the criminal conviction, this is the loss of character. 'It is real, and would have been without the publicity and the judge's sentencing remarks.' But Rex Tedd QC, for the Crown, urged the court to uphold the conviction and said the level of the fine was not excessive given the size of Mr Day's fortune and the damage to the site - which the judge had visited. He said: 'The judge was in an unrivalled position to consider the extent of the damage to the site. We say the starting point is that there is no reason to disturb the judge's findings as to the harm actually done. 'There was a witness who described himself as being deeply shocked at what he saw and we say that the word 'devastation' was not an inappropriate expression in the circumstances.' The Court of Appeal has reserved its decision on Day's appeal and will give its ruling at a later date.","Britain's most senior judge slammed a tycoon for not paying a court fine .

"Surveillance video of Vonderrit Myers that has just been released shows the teenager purchasing a sandwich just moments before he was shot and killed by an off-duty police officer. Myers, 18, is seen with friends at Shaw Market in Shaw, Missouri, walking around, talking and then heading back outside. In the video, which is time-stamped a little after 7:00 pm, there is never any sign of a visible gun on Myers, who is wearing a fitted shirt and has his pants slung down low, leaving few places, if any, to conceal a weapon. This comes as major protests and riots are beginning to break out in the area, with police even using pepper spray to control the crowds and protesters burning American flags. Scroll down for videos . Last shot: One of the final images of Vonderrit Myers . Video: Myers is seen buying a sandwich just moments before being killed . Gun claims: At no point in the video is a gun seen on Myers . Hard to hide: It seems it would be hard to conceal a gun in his outfit . Tragedy: Myers pictured left with his mother and right, was shot dead by an off-duty police officer on Wednesday night. Police said he fled when approached by the officer and a fight ensued . Police claim that it was Myers who first opened fire on an unidentified 32-year-old officer that caused the officer to shoot and led to his fatal shooting, just a few feet away from the market. He was struck by seven or eight bullets, St. Louis city Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Graham said Thursday night. 'All but one gunshot wound were to the lower extremities,' Graham said according to CNN. 'The one fatal wound was to the head.' The officer, who is a six-year veteran of the force, was in a car working a secondary job for a private security company and paroling the area when he saw three males in the street and thought they were acting suspiciously, St Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said in a press conference. As he approached them, one of them started to run away, so the officer did a U-turn and then all three ran, Dotson said, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Protester: A woman has water and milk poured over her face after being pepper sprayed by police . Blockade: Police wearing riot gear form a line to contain protesters . 'One of them ran in a way that the officer believed that he was armed with a gun – holding his waist band, not running at full stride,' Dotson said, referring to Myers. The officer, who was wearing a Metropolitan Police Department uniform, jumped out of his car and chased them on foot before getting into a scuffle with Myers, who reached for his gun, Dotson said. Myers shot at least three times at the officer, who then returned fire - and when the teenager tried to fire again, his gun jammed, Dotson said. Heading out: Less than 30 minutes before the shooting Myers and his friends leave the store . Dispute: Myers, pictured, was just buying a sandwich before he was chased and shot dead, his family said . Authorities said Myers, in white, was known to them and was wearing a monitoring device on his ankle as part of the bail conditions for a previous arrest for gun charges. He was due to go on trial in November . Street fight: Cops say that the teen shot at the off-duty office first and then he shot back, killing him . The officer, a white male, then fired 17 times at the teenager. He died from his injuries. Police recovered a 9mm Ruger at the scene, he said. The officer was working for Hi-Tech Security, which employs several St. Louis police officers in secondary jobs. He was patrolling the neighborhood on behalf of the company rather than the Metropolitan Police Department but was wearing his police officer's uniform. He has been placed on administrative leave and an investigation is underway. He was not hurt. Dotson said that the 18-year-old was 'no stranger to law enforcement', the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. He was wearing an ankle bracelet at the time as a condition of bail in a gun case, according to his lawyer and police, the Post-Dispatch reported. The newspaper reported that Myers was due in court in November for unlawful use of a weapon and resisting arrest after he allegedly ditched a gun after jumping from a car that had been involved in a high-speed chase. Weapong: Police claim they recovered a 9mm Ruger (above) at the scene . Backup: The 32-year-old officer, who has not been identified, was not on duty when he shot the boy . Protest: People at the scene put up their hands, like the protesters who showed they were not armed in the aftermath of the killing of Michael Brown. Protests still continue in the area following that death in August . Police caught him nearby and recovered the loaded .380-caliber pistol he had allegedly dropped. He was jailed for a few days before being released on $1,000 cash bond and fitted with an electronic monitoring device. He was allowed to leave his home for work, school, court appearances, meetings with attorneys and meetings with the private monitoring firm, the Post-Dispatch reported. His family said he was still in high school and disputed police claims that he was armed. 'He was unarmed,' said his cousin, Teyonna Myers, to the Post-Dispatch. 'He had a sandwich in his hand, and they thought it was a gun. It’s like Michael Brown all over again.' The boy's uncle, Jackie Williams, also says he is not buying the story being told by police. 'My nephew was coming out of a store from purchasing a sandwich. Security was supposedly searching for someone else. They Tased him,' Williams said. 'I don’t know how this happened, but they went off and shot him 16 times. That’s outright murder.' Nearby: The incident unfolded less than 10 miles from where Michael brown (above) was killed in Ferguson . Officers are claiming they recovered a gun at the scene and that the officer did not have a Taser. Another man, Lavell Boyd, who lives in the neighborhood, claimed to hear as many as 15 shots fired. 'When I pulled up I saw the cop standing over him [Myers] then he pointed the gun at everyone else telling everyone to get back while he was searching for another clip,' Boyd said. News of the death quickly spread across social media and sparked more protests in the street - just the latest outcry after the death of Michael Brown. David Carson, a photographer for the Post-Dispatch, reports that protesters filled the streets near where the shooting happened and have been chanting 'Black lives matter.' Some also vandalized a police SUV as they chanted 'F*** the police.' It comes just days after St. Louis Cardinals fans were seen screaming racial insults at protesters in the city.","An off-duty police officer, who has not been identified, shot and killed high school student Vonderrit Myers Jr. last night in Shaw, Missouri .

"A Premier League star has sparked outrage after a video emerged of him posing with an open bottle of champagne while driving his Range Rover at night. Cheick Tiote, 28, who earns £45,000 a week playing for Newcastle United, took his eyes off the road for several seconds and grinned at the camera instead of looking where he was going. The footballer, who pleaded guilty to using a fake Belgian driving licence to obtain a UK licence last year, then hands the bottle to a friend in the back seat and urges him to take a swig. Newcastle have reprimanded Cheick Tiote  after he was caught clutching open champagne while driving . He apologised after pictures emerged of his indiscretions in The Sun on Friday night. 'I deeply regret my actions and am sorry for any offence caused. I realise as a professional footballer I should set a good example with my behaviour on and off the pitch,' he said. The video is believed to have been taken by friends in his native Ivory Coast. A statement from his club said: 'Newcastle United have been made aware of a video of Cheick Tiote driving whilst holding a bottle of alcohol, which is understood to have been filmed in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. 'Clearly his actions were not appropriate. The club have spoken privately with Cheick today and reminded him of his significant responsibilities as a representative of Newcastle United and a role model.' The player, whose Muslim beliefs forbid alcohol, does not drink from the bottle in the video. Tiote (right) has apologised for his actions - which were believed to have been filmed in his native Ivory Coats . But he is heard telling a friend in their native French: 'Take a glass of champagne. It's the best, rosé.' He then adds: 'Not for me, not champagne.' The footballer will not be dropped for the misdemeanor and played a full match against Chelsea today. But fans and driving campaigners have blasted the player saying he is setting a bad example to youngsters. Warren Davies tweeted: 'He completely took his eyes off the road. So dangerous.' Choco Play said: 'You're not a good Muslim anymore.' Anti-drink driving campaigner Carole Whittingham, 72, whose son Stephen, 27, was killed by an 18-year-old drunk driver, said: 'I'm shocked and appalled. 'Tioté is supposed to set a good example to young people who are going to football matches and want to be like their heroes.' If caught doing the same in the UK he could be charged with failing to have proper control of a vehicle and face a driving ban. This is not the first time Tioté has courted controversy, as he pleaded guilty to paying £12,800 for a forged Belgian driving licence and trying to swap it for a UK one. He was given a suspended sentence and ordered to do 180 hours unpaid work. He was also given a £600 fine and six points for no licence. Two months later he was banned from the road for six months after it emerged he already had six points before the October sentencing. The 28-year-old, who currently lives with his wife Madah and their two children in a £1.5million mansion in Ponteland near Newcastle, also has a one-year-old child with mistress Nikki Mpofu. The footballer defended his lifestyle by claiming there is nothing unusual about having two wives and a mistress.","Newcastle star filmed driving Range Rover with an open champagne bottle .

Otamendi was a target for David Moyes while at United a year ago but Porto sold him to Valencia in a deal that saw him loaned initially to Atletico Mineiro in Brazil as he was a non-EU player. Otamendi's ownership is understood to involve the Doyen Sports Group who also had a share in Marcos Rojo's rights prior to his move to United from Sporting Lisbon. The new Valencia owner Peter Lim is a United fan and has a 50 per cent share with the Neville brothers, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes at non-league Salford City - but he is putting significant investment into the Spanish club and is reluctant to lose key assets. Otamendi is contracted to Valencia until 2019 and wants to lead them back into the Champions League. His idol is the former Valencia and Argentina defender Pablo Ayala. West Bromwich Albion have asked about Fiorentina left back Marcos Alonso. The 24-year-old had a successful loan spell with Sunderland last season and played a pivotal role in helping them steer clear of relegation. He has featured regularly for Fiorentina this season but they are willing to listen to offers and may allow him out on another loan. The former Bolton and Real Madrid player has been used in midfield also by coach Vincenzo Montella. Fiorentina left back Marcos Alonso, formerly of Sunderland, is interesting West Bromwich Albion . A few changes are afoot at Albion as manager Tony Pulis steps up his interest in £6m-rated winger Callum McManaman at Wigan. Albion are ready to terminate the loan of Porto winger Silvestre Varela and allow him to join Parma. The Italian side are also signing Cristian Rodriguez from Atletico Madrid. Olympiacos, meanwhile, are showing interest in Joleon Lescott. The centre-back missed the first four games of the season but has been an ever present in the league since. Albion want another defender and a striker. Burnley want Albion midfielder Graham Dorrans but have yet to make a bid. Joleon Lescott (right) is a surprise target for Greek champions Olympiacos . Wigan's Shaun Maloney, a target for Leicester, QPR and Celtic, is poised to join Chicago Fire if they agree a £1m fee as he remains under contract until the summer. Reading manager Steve Clarke will attempt to bring Glenn Murray back from Crystal Palace to the Madejski Stadium. Clarke, who also wants to sign Stoke defender Robert Huth on loan, is offering around £2m for Murray who helped Palace launch their comeback at Burnley on Saturday. Glenn Murray is back at Crystal Palace for now but Reading want to sign the striker permanently . Palace are continuing negotiations with Blackburn Rovers over a deal for Rudy Gestede on Monday and hope to complete the £5m deal. Clarke hopes that allows him the chance to prise Murray away. Meanwhile, Reading's Royston Drenthe is in talks to join Turkish side Erciyesspor. Crystal Palace scouts ran the rule over Watford's Ikechi Anya and Troy Deeney on Saturday. The pair were in action against Charlton. Palace want a winger and a striker and have targeted Bolton's Chung-Yong Lee as well as Gestede but South Korea international Lee has a hairline fracture of his leg and will be out for three weeks. Palace had scouts watching Watford's Troy Deeney (pictured) and Ikechi Anya on Saturday . Leicester have made a late enquiry about taking Lloyd Dyer on loan from Watford. The 32-year-old was poised to sign for Birmingham on loan on Monday until the end of the season. Bolton had also asked about Dyer. Watford are signing Serbia defender Vujadin Savic on a short-term deal. Birmingham have confirmed that French midfielder Guy Moussi will not have his contract renewed at the club. Sevilla have shown a surprise interest in Manchester United goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard. The Dane, who is sporting a newly shaven haircut, knows that he is surplus to requirements following the signing of Victor Valdes and his representatives have been discussing opportunities at new clubs. He is available now and out of contract in the summer. Sevilla want a new keeper and believe Lindegaard could still revive his career in the right environment. He is one of a number of players they have in mind. Anders Lindegaard (left) has fallen out of favour behind David de Gea and Victor Valdes at Manchester United . Chelsea are holding a meeting on Monday to discuss the offer from Roma for Mohamed Salah. Jose Mourinho protested that he could not let the Egyptian go because he has a small squad following Saturday's 5-0 trouncing of Swansea. Mourinho would like Chelsea to get another player in if they let Salah out. The Egyptian has made seven appearances this season but is in dispute with lawyer Oliver Kronenberg who was involved in his transfer from Basle. Salah tweeted on Sunday: 'Please don't take any news from my ex agent Oliver Kronenberg and don't believe any of his words.' Jose Mourinho says Mohamed Salah won't be sold but Chelsea are considering an offer from Roma . Roma have offered Chelsea £1m to loan Salah with view to a £11.5m permanent transfer. Salah has interest from Besiktas, Inter Milan, Hamburg and Sunderland but is keen on the idea of a move to Rome. Chelsea beat off interest from Liverpool to sign Salah from Basle for £11m a year ago but he has been on the periphery of the squad, making just seven appearances this season. He was on the bench at the Liberty Stadium and is eager to get more game time. Aston Villa and Liverpool are watching Lewis Cook at Leeds United. The 17-year-old played 78 minutes of Saturday's draw against Birmingham and was watched by Villa scouts who are looking for bargains to bring into their squad. England Under 18 international Cook has made 25 appearances for the Elland Road side in a difficult season and has the trust of coach Neil Redfearn who has watched him develop through Leeds' academy. Leeds midfielder Lewis Cook (left) is being watched by Aston Villa and Liverpool . Ipswich Town are signing former Leeds goalkeeper Paddy Kenny on Monday. The 36-year-old is joining until the end of the season. Wolves have made a £500,000 offer for Zulte Waregem forward Idrissa Sylla. The 24-year-old is out of contract in the summer and currently on Africa Cup of Nations duty with Guinea. Blackpool have had a £30,000 offer for Partick Thistle's Stephen O'Donnell rejected. The 22-year-old right back is out of contract in the summer. Swansea have had an offer of £5.5m rejected for Stuttgart midfielder Alexandru Maxim. Sportsmail reported Swansea's interest in the Romania international last week but they hope to have more success in negotiations with Norwich after their bid went in for Martin Olsson. Swansea have had a £5.5m bid for Stuttgard midfielder Alexandru Maxim rejected by the Bundesliga side . Bafetimbi Gomis has declared he may still leave but that could depend now on Borussia Dortmund following up their initial interest. They want a striker in their bid to stay in the Bundesliga. Talking to Canal Plus, Gomis said: 'It is one of the possibilities (leaving) yes, it is one of the possibilities. It is planned that my entourage will meet with Swansea’s representatives. 'Then I will have a discussion with my representatives to find the best solution. I want to stay abroad. It is true that I have had not a bad amount of approaches from clubs. There are strong possibilities that I remain in one of the major leagues but, to come back to Turkey (one of the journalists previously mentioned it), they have done good things in the Champions League recently. 'There have been approaches yes. For the moment I am concentrated on Swansea. Especially after the heavy defeat on Saturdayit would show a lack of respect to the club (to discuss specific clubs).' Bafetimbi Gomis says he could leave Swansea but it depends on Dortmund following up their initial interest .","Transfer news: For all the latest click here .

"This footage captures the 'skin-crawling' moment a man discovers three live grubs in an OXO cube about to be crumbled into a meal. James Pearson, 35, of Telford, Shropshire, filmed the maggot-like creatures wriggling around on his kitchen unit after breaking the cube in front of his girlfriend, Charlotte, 22. Another of the slimy yellow creepy crawlies was living in a second cube from the same pack - and all of the specimens have been sent to the local environmental health agency for investigation. Scroll down for video . Gross: The yellow grubs wriggle around on the kitchen unit after being discovered in an OXO cube . Mr Pearson said: 'It was my girlfriend Charlotte who spotted them - at first they looked like little bits of noodle. 'But then it looked like something was actually embedded in the cube. 'Obviously when we saw what it was I was shocked to see these maggot like things which were about to go into her dinner. 'The cubes were bought around March this year and we'd used about four from the pack already which is a little skin-crawling when we imagine there were more in other cubes.' Disgusting: The creatures and remaining OXO cubes from the pack have been sent off to be investigated . He added: 'She was making rice and was about to put the OXO cube in to give it a little bit of flavour - but noticed that the cube's texture felt different. 'She definitely went off her dinner after that. 'The following day I went to crumble another cube and something pinged out of it and I almost lost sight of it.' Mr Pearson said the cubes had nine months left on their use-by-date but claims their texture was far more gooey than usual. He added: 'It's quite possible one of them was sprinkled into a previous meal we'd eaten, it's not something you usually look out for. 'And for someone who is prone to gastrointestinal distress-  it doesn't fill me with joy.' Disgusting: Another of the slimy yellow creepy crawlies was found in a second cube from the same pack . Mr Pearson claims the cubes had nine months left on the use-by-date - but claims their texture was far more gooey than usual . Mr Pearson contacted Premier Foods, who make OXO cubes, and they requested he send them the box of cubes and the grubs so that they could investigate. But he instead decided to contact the environmental health agency so they could look into the incident independently. He added: 'I am not looking for compensation. Premier Foods said that they would replace the cubes but I won't be losing sleep over that. 'It's more about public awareness. It's unacceptable to be finding live insects in food products and if this prevents it happening again then that's a good thing. A spokesman for Premier Foods, who make OXO cubes, said: 'Premier Foods takes pride in the quality of our food products and we take any complaint incredibly seriously. 'Our customer service team and Mr Pearson have recently been in contact so that we can investigate the complaint but unfortunately the product was never returned to us. 'We understand that the Environmental Health Office has now been informed and we are cooperating fully with their investigation.' Mr Pearson said: 'I am not looking for compensation. It's more about public awareness. It's unacceptable to be finding live insects in food products' A spokesman for the local council's enviormental health department said: 'I can confirm that Telford & Wrekin Council has received a complaint from a member of the public about live grubs in a chicken OXO cube that was purchased from a local shop. 'The member of the public decided that he wanted the council's environmental health team to deal with the issue on his behalf.

"The crux of the matter with Dimitar Berbatov is that you always want a little more. Just imagine how good he might be if he tried harder, or broke into a sprint even, just now and then. Those who formed the best working relationships with him, like Martin Jol, seemed to get beyond that temptation and accept Berbatov was not like the others. Perhaps he understood the enigma better than others or saw traces of the Dutch in his game. Berbatov fashioned his game on Marco van Basten and there were flickers of Dennis Bergkamp in his effortless control, vision and appreciation of the space around him. Dimitar Berbatov (right) is back in London on Wednesday night as Monaco face Arsenal . Berbatov (here sauntering away from West Ham's Kevin Nolan in 2013) is known for his laid-back nature . The Bulgarian (celebrating scoring against Chelsea in the 2008 Carling Cup final) had his best years at Spurs . 'In his style, he works hard,' said Jol, who coached him at Tottenham and lured him to Craven Cottage, where he hailed this piece of business as 'Fulham's biggest ever signing'. In a way it was. Berbatov arrived from Manchester United at the age of 31, with plenty in the tank, certainly for someone who operates at strolling pace. No-one ever questioned his talent. A flash of his brilliance could brighten the dullest of games. Questions about his application, however, were never far away, exaggerated by his demeanour. He rarely spoke but his body language screamed that he couldn't care less. Not good, especially for the captain of a struggling team. At White Hart Lane and Old Trafford, the quality of those around him could carry him along on those quiet days, but at the Cottage the team was misshapen, high on flair, low on graft and ultimately unable to shield their best player from criticism. Jol was sacked and Fulham were heading for relegation when the Bulgarian departed for Monaco, bringing an end to his seven-and-a-half years in the Barclays Premier League, with most people none the wiser about how good he had actually been. Martin Jol was the manager to get the best out of Berbatov after signing the striker at Tottenham . Berbatov modelled his game on Dutch striker Marco van Basten (pictured scoring for AC Milan in 1989) Berbatov is as casual on the pitch as he is off it (pictured while at United back in 2012) There was certainly more to him than the miserable looking figure playing in tights, gloves and a roll-neck vest for protection from the wind whipping off the Thames. There were trophies, two Premier League titles and two League Cup wins. He came on in the Champions League final when United lost to Barcelona in 2009, although Sir Alex Ferguson left him out of the squad two years later when they lost again to the same team. There were goals, lots of goals at a healthy rate. He scored five in a game for United against Blackburn. There were fabulous volleys and crafty flicks, swerving free-kicks and ice-cool penalties, tap-ins and headers to prove there is deceptive strength in his wiry frame and the occasional overhead kick. Then there were the tricks and flicks, a sneaky nutmeg, a disguised pass or an aerial back heel with a hint of Zlatan Ibrahimovic or Eric Cantona. Perhaps these are too quickly forgotten. The striker (pictured winning a penalty against Liverpool in 2011) was impressive at Manchester United . Fulham under Jol signed Berbatov but he was never at his best during the spell at Craven Cottage . If football is purely about entertainment, then Berbatov is a worthy prince but he would never become the new Cantona at United as Ferguson hoped he might when he forked out £30million. There was the same brooding presence, physical gifts and technical craft but without the ability to influence the big games at the crucial moments. There was a time when there seemed a chance he might join Arsenal where he will appear on Wednesday night. With six months left on his deal at Fulham, Wenger lost Nicklas Bendtner to injury and the rumours started but he joined Monaco instead, which seemed an appropriate fit in many ways. He has always fancied himself as something of a matinee idol with an elegance and idle swagger to suit Monte Carlo. He often played as if there was a pastel-shaded jumper draped across his shoulders, tied loosely by the arms, which he really didn't want to fall in the mud. Berbatov netted 48 Premier League goals for United in 108 starts under Sir Alex Ferguson . For a thirty-something striker of mature years with no great desire to return to his native Bulgaria, this seemed like a good place to wash up. 'He is a really important player for us,' said Monaco's vice president Vadim Vasilyev. 'His vision of the play and his technical ability is outstanding. And he likes Monaco a lot. He has integrated well. His team-mates like him. It is going well for him. It is good for us.' Berbatov's is the image on the posters pushing tickets for Sunday's game against Paris Saint-Germain at the Stade Louis II. He still has box office glamour for a club which has changed tack and allowed some of its big names to depart. He is also perhaps the closest thing Leonardo Jardim has to a reliable goal source with six in Ligue 1, the top scorer in a team which has found the net 26 times this season. Monaco, fourth in the French league, reached the last 16 of the Champions League by winning their group with only four goals. Last year, he scored six in 12 games after his move from Fulham. Still he contributes and yet, still you want more.","Dimitar Berbatov's Monaco face Arsenal in the Champions League .

Exeter winger Whitten took a gamble and rushed off his line to block Luke Wallace's attempted pass with Quins players to spare outside him.

"CLICK HERE to read Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher's verdict as to why Louis van Gaal is fortunate not have the heat on him. As half-time approached at Loftus Road with their team looking out of sorts once again in an ill-fitting 3-5-2 system, United fans showed their first signs of discontent with the reign of King Louis, demanding a switch to '4-4-2'. The Dutchman has resolutely stuck to his guns since his arrival and his reluctance to change has had many of the club's faithful scratching their heads. Here, Sportsmail looks at whether some of the curious goings-on at Old Trafford this season are as bizarre as they seem - and examine whether there is method in the manager's apparent madness. FORMATIONS . They stuck with their team through the dark days of the David Moyes era and have been relentless with their backing for Louis van Gaal. But as half-time approached at Loftus Road with their expensively-assembled unit still tip-toeing around each other like strangers at a wedding, United's faithful had had enough. It came from the back of the School End upper and was stunning in its simplicity. 'Four-four-two,' they chanted. The message could not have been clearer. Manchester United fans, pictured celebrating, were screaming ‘four-four-two’ during the initial struggles . Only 24 hours previously Van Gaal had repeated his reasoning for using a 3-5-2 and appeared insulted by the repeated questioning. He still felt it gave his team the best balance, he said. But while the Dutchman may be stubborn he is not stupid and at the break, with the match at 0-0, he gave supporters what they had noisily demanded. United went on to win 2-0 with the players seemingly more at ease in a familiar environment. But after the game Van Gaal reiterated his support for his tainted tactic and claimed that while the switch to 4-4-2 saw his team create more chances it also opened them up to the home side. This may not be the end of the dreaded 3-5-2. Louis van Gaal insisted after their win at QPR that he cannot observe opinions on formation from the fans . HOW DO YOU SOLVE A PROBLEM LIKE (DI) MARIA? When he broke the British transfer record by paying Real Madrid £59.7m for Angel di Maria, Van Gaal hailed the capture of a 'a world-class midfielder'. United fans purred at the prospect of the Argentine bringing his talents to Manchester. He was even given the iconic No 7 shirt, reserved for playmakers such as Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. So why then, has he started the last two matches as a striker? Angel di Maria (left) started in attack for United against QPR during Saturday's Premier League clash . Van Gaal would no doubt point to lack of pace up front. He might also state that it is difficult to drop Juan Mata, who appears to be in the best form of his short United career behind the front two. The experiment, however, has not been a success. Di Maria was in Zurich last week where he was named in Fifpro's 2014 World XI. In midfield. There is another message for Van Gaal there - and this time it came from 20,000 players across the globe rather than his own fans. The Argentina international (right) was more at ease in the second half when he was deployed in midfield . PHIL JONES - CORNER TAKER EXTRAORDINAIRE . When United won a corner at Loftus Road you may have expected Wayne Rooney, for years the designated taker, to ping it over. Or perhaps one of the many creative talents Van Gaal has at his disposal. Di Maria, maybe, or even Mata. Step forward Philip Anthony Jones. The sight of the burly defender trotting over to the corner flag triggered a Twitter meltdown. If football matches took on the format of US TV show Friends, this would be forever remembered as The One Where Jones Took a Corner. Defender Phil Jones lines up a corner during Manchester United's 2-0 win at Loftus Road on Saturday . So what does it tell us? Van Gaal is always searching for that surprise element, for that extra 0.5 per cent. Think back to the World Cup and his penalty shootout benching of Jasper Cillessen in favour of Tim Krul. Some of the responses may have been an over-reaction. At the 2010 World Cup a study found goals from corners came at a rate of one in 70. That said, this may have been a short-lived experiment. The move to have centre back Jones (right) deliver set-pieces was unfamiliar one by Van Gaal . THE FALCAO CONUNDRUM . The writing appeared to be on the wall ahead of United's trip to London for £6m loan man Radamel Falcao. After an outburst at a lack of opportunities from the player's agent, Van Gaal had reiterated that Falcao still had to prove himself. However, injury to Robin van Persie gave the Colombian targetman another chance to do just that. Another scoreless afternoon took his record to three goals in 14 appearances and had some writing the former £50m man off. Radamel Falcao (centre) endured a frustrating afternoon at QPR - kept out by goalkeeper Rob Green . They should not. Falcao was twice denied by superb stops from Rob Green, the kind of saves that would make headlines had the brilliant David de Gea pulled them off. In the second half he appeared to miss a sitter from five yards out but on closer inspection a last-ditch touch from Steven Caulker took the chance away from him. Van Gaal may well have been pleased by the reaction. Falcao's movement was superb and an on another day he may well have walked away with two goals. It has not gone as well as expected, but there is still time for the big man to give his manager reasons to activate that £43m buyout clause. The Colombia international reacts late after Steven Caulker's (centre) touch prevents him from scoring . Young striker James Wilson (right) came off the bench to score United's second against QPR . THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE . The injuries that have left medical staff at Carrington wondering what they did wrong in a previous life have hurt United the most in defence. Who would have thought that Michael Carrick would be a standout performer at the back? Or that youngsters Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair would be thrust into the spotlight? United summer signing Marcos Rojo (left) has been in and out of the team due to injuries . Then there is the loss of form to the likes of Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans. This was supposed to be the year they stepped forward to fill the void left by the departures of old heads such as Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra and Rio Ferdinand. They have not and some would say that Van Gaal should have seen that coming. Despite the £156m spent in the summer, reinforcements at the back are desperately needed. The uncertainty in defence has seen composed midfielder Michael Carrick used there at times . SAY WHAT!? David Moyes did himself no favours during his short stint down Sir Matt Busby Way when he came out with some bizarre comments at press conferences. After a numbing 3-0 home defeat at the hands of bitter rivals Liverpool he explained: 'I could see why we were champions today'. Ten days later, after City had repeated the Merseysiders' trick, he was at it again, claiming United should aspire to be at their cross-town rivals level. Oh dear. At times Van Gaal also seems to have been struck by a case of foot in mouth. You can put his 'Queens Park Raisins' comment down to his accent - but that comical slip of the tongue has not been the only thing lost in translation. He was at it as early as August when he said that a 4-0 Capital One Cup thumping at League One MK Dons had 'not shocked' him. David Moyes was sacked as United boss in April - despite a similar start at Old Trafford as Van Gaal . And as recently as last weekend, after his side failed to register a shot on target in a 1-0 home defeat by Southampton, Van Gaal moaned that United had 'dominated' the game and branded the worthy visitors 'lucky'. Insiders at United say the manager casts a keen eye over press coverage and insists that he sees all player appearance requests. A veteran of dealing with the media, he knows what damage a slip of the tongue can do - and that makes comments like those above even more baffling.

"Former Manchester United right-back Gary Neville is 'concerned' Louis van Gaal's stuttering side will fall behind Liverpool in the race for Champions League qualification. The race for a top four finish in the Premier League is extremely tight as only four points separate Arsenal in third and Tottenham placed in seventh.

'I wasn't as concerned three or four weeks ago as they were around eight points behind and I thought with the Europa League commitments that would be too much for them. Now Liverpool are within a short distance of United I am concerned.' Fellow Sky pundit and Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher now backs Brendan Rodgers' side to reach the prestigious top four: . Manchester United players can't hide their frustration having conceded twice at Swansea on Saturday . Philippe Coutinho's screamer put Liverpool on the way to a vital 2-0 win against Southampton . 'I said for the last few weeks I didn't think Liverpool would get top four because of FA Cup and Europe commitments,' said Carragher. 'I did also say I thought United would reach the top four but I don't know if their bad form people are talking about is just how United play at the moment under Louis van Gaal.' Carragher added: 'They've been on a great run but the fact that Liverpool have been coming into great form, a lot will be decided on the game at Anfield (March 22) and I'd have to fancy Liverpool on current form.

"The wait has ended. It took 21 minutes of this game and 561 in the grander scheme of Premier League football but, finally, Wayne Rooney had a shot on goal. It trickled to Lukasz Fabianski and it was neither effective nor impressive, but the point is that you can’t score if you don’t shoot and it’s not always easy to shoot if you’re hidden in midfield. This was Rooney playing up front for the first time in the Premier League since Southampton away on December 8. Roy Hodgson will have been pleased. Radamel Falcao smiles as he warms up before kick off despite being dropped to the bench against Swansea . Wayne Rooney was played in his more favoured striking role during the defeat to Swansea on Saturday . Ander Herrera celebrates with Rooney after the Spaniard opened the scoring against Swansea at the Liberty . Radamel Falcao? Less so. He sat there on the bench, barely speaking but surely thinking. The experiment with the Colombian has been a curious one. The process of recovery from the sort of knee injury that interrupted his career should not be underestimated. But who could have expected his time at Manchester United to have been so disappointing? Is there still patience in a striker who was once so brilliantly efficient but now has to prove he is more than damaged goods? Manchester United's Falcao walks off after being substituted during the FA Cup fifth round tie with Preston . A frustrated Falcao reacts to yet another missed chance during the game against Queens Park Rabger . He cannot argue that he has lacked chances. He started the previous three games – two in the League and against Preston in the FA Cup, alongside Rooney, who scored – and did not make a dent. He was substituted against Preston after an hour. It’s the latest in a line of numbers that simply do not add up for him. The headline figures are so well-repeated they are almost wired to the sub-conscious - a £6million loan fee, wages of £265,000. It is impossible for most to thrive against such vast numbers. But players of his calibre are supposed to. At the very least they do better. But four goals in 19 games – it is not good enough. And that is why he was on the bench. Falcao speaks with referee Kevin Friend during the Premier League match against Burnley . It will be fascinating to see what happens next. Certainly, it looks hard to see United taking their option to sign the Colombia permanently for £43.2million in the summer. Monaco claim there is serious alternative interest, with or without United at the bargaining table. Their vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said this week: ‘I am not worried for Falcao, he is a world-class striker. If Manchester United decide not to take up the option at the end of the season, we have interest from other great clubs.’ For United, the conundrum still exists, not only of how to find form from this striker, but what to do if they can’t. Falcao  in action with John Welsh of Preston North End during the FA Cup Fifth Round match at Deepdale . This performance was frequently poor. Rooney is good enough to be versatile – a quality that rarely gets the merit it deserves. But he is best as a front man. Did his place up front spark an improvement? No. The team was poor and Rooney was only a shade above the team’s average. But where Falcao so often darts and disappears, Rooney still carries the aura of a threat. He looks for the ball, he does not hide. When his feet won’t dance, his mind does not give up. That is worth something. It wasn’t worth much in this game. And United deserved no better. But whatever way Louis van Gaal looks to solve the problems of this side, it appears increasingly unlikely that Falcao will be the answer.

"Some of America’s most significant landmarks are under threat from climate change, and could be fundamentally damaged in the near future, according to a new study. Sites as celebrated as the Statue of Liberty in New York and Kennedy Space Center in Florida are among the places identified as being in danger from unpredictable weather patterns. Great icons, but for how long? The Statue of Liberty and Kennedy Space Center are at risk from rising waters . The survey, ‘National Landmarks At Risk’, has been conducted by Massachusetts-based research group the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). It lists 30 'endangered' historic attractions in 15 US different states. The 30 locations have been included because, according to the report’s authors, ‘the science behind the risks they face is robust, and because together they shine a spotlight on the different kinds of climate impacts affecting the United States’ cultural heritage.’ New York's most famous monument, the Statue of Liberty, is, the study suggests, under threat from rising sea levels. The report points to the example of Hurricane Sandy, which, in 2012, caused Liberty Island (where the Statue stands) to be swamped with water – resulting in considerable damage and the closing of the site for several months. Ellis Island was similarly hit. At the sea's edge: Kennedy Space Center's location so near to the Atlantic could be a source of problems . The report worries that Sandy was not an isolated incident, but the start of a trend. ‘There is evidence that Sandy gained strength from unusually warm upper-ocean temperatures in the North Atlantic,’ it states. ‘These temperatures are expected to continue rising with global warming.’ The Kennedy Space Center, at Cape Canaveral on the east coast of Florida, is also deemed to be in the path of troublesome tides. ‘The launch pad is very close to the ocean and is vulnerable to the dangers of rapidly rising seas and storm surge,’ the survey argues. The same situation could spark problems a little to the north on Florida’s Atlantic flank – where St Augustine is America’s oldest city, dating back to Spanish settlement in 1565. A slice of Spanish heritage: The Castillo de San Marcos in St Augustine is under threat from rising sea levels . Here, the Castillo de San Marcos, a 17th century fort, perches right on the waterline. Alaska: Cape Krusenstern National Monument and Kivalina; Bering Land Bridge National Monument and ShishmarefCalifornia: Groveland; César E.

Founded in 1670, and situated on the edge of the ocean, the city is home to numerous historic structures of irreplaceable value. The report advises that ‘the city’s longtime struggle with flooding is expected to worsen over the coming decades as global warming continues to increase the pace of sea level rise, and causes the heaviest rainfall events to dump more water than in decades past.’ And the danger from climate change is not restricted to the eastern seaboard, according to the authors of the study. The high terrain of Colorado may be immune to sea surges – but other factors could reputedly wreak havoc in the mountainous state. For . example, Mesa Verde National Park – a hotspot of indigenous heritage . near Durango, where a cluster of cliff dwellings dates back 4500 years – . is at risk from wild fires. Two . such blazes caused enormous damage in 2000, destroying 52,000 acres of . the national park – and the likelihood of further conflagrations is . considered high. Charleston has been a fixture in South Carolina since 1670 - but its coastal location is a cause for concern . ‘For the past 50 years,’ the report says, ‘the temperatures in the Mesa Verde area have been rising, particularly during the summer, at a much faster rate than they did over the preceding century. ‘In the Southwest overall, it has been warmer since 1950 than any period of comparable length in at least 600 years. ‘Rising temperatures add to the region’s natural wildfire risk and increase the likelihood that when fires do occur, they will be larger and even more devastating.’ And even remote Alaska is not out of the reach of damaging weather patterns. On fire: The structures at Mesa Verde National Park date back 4500 years - but fire damaged the area in 2000 . Cape Krusenstern National Monument – where archaeological sites pinned to the history of the Inupiat, the native Alaskans, date back over 4,000 years – is singled out as a cause for concern due to the fragmentation of this pristine section of shoreline. ‘Coastal erosion is washing away irreplaceable archaeological artefacts at particularly vulnerable coastal locations,’ the report posits.","Rising tides and global warming threaten key US sites, research argues .

"Aston Villa have announced a £3.9million loss after tax for the year ending May 31, 2014 - down from £51.8million for the previous year. The reduction was mainly due to a £33.2million increase in turnover to £116.9million and a £12.9million reduction in operating expenses to £121.7million. The increase in turnover was largely down to the new Barclays Premier League broadcasting agreements but the club's commercial and sponsorship revenues also grew. Tim Sherwood took over from Paul Lambert as Aston Villa boss as he tries to save them from relegation . Robin Russell, chief financial officer, told the club's official website: 'We are very pleased to be able to report improved results after a period of heavy financial losses.

"Wily: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne . The only thing we have to fear is fear itself’ was the famous exhortation delivered to the American people by Franklin D. Roosevelt when he became US President in 1933. His opponent in the preceding election, the hapless Herbert Hoover, had spent much of the campaign insisting that the only real problem with the economy was a lack of confidence. Of course, FDR’s catchphrase and Hoover’s analysis actually amounted to saying the same thing in different ways. But Roosevelt went on to become the longest-serving President yet and Hoover is regarded as one of the great failures of US politics. George Osborne seems to have learnt directly from the Roosevelt playbook. Every word of his Autumn Statement was laced with tactical electoral calculations and a determination to limit Labour’s room for manoeuvre to virtually zero. In many areas, the Chancellor has stolen the Opposition’s clothes and is daring them to criticise him for putting them on. An objective assessment of the Coalition’s strategy would point to the stark failure to reduce the vast budget deficit. This now appears to be stuck, for the time being at about £90 billion – meaning that the Government is overspending by around £1,500 for every man, woman and child in Britain, every year. The Government’s declared intention was to eliminate this deficit by the time of the next General Election. Osborne has missed that target by several country miles. Tax receipts have been lower than expected. And despite all the sound and fury about ‘the age of austerity’, overall government spending is down by only a fraction in real terms. IN normal circumstances, you might think that the governing party would expect to be hounded from office in the upcoming Election. Osborne is having none of such talk. Instead, he is displaying the hide of a rhino and the cunning of a fox. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls will point across the Dispatch Box and rage about how the deficit is far greater than the Tories promised. But the unspoken truth is that the Coalition have long since abandoned their plan to get spending under control. Instead, they have basically adopted the much slower, much less ambitious target proposed by the Labour Party at the last Election – to close off the deficit in about ten years rather than in only five. Sure, the deficit is much higher than Osborne initially planned – but isn’t this just what the Opposition wanted? Scroll down for video . They insisted that the more responsible plan was to get the deficit to come down gradually, not rapidly. That is exactly what is happening. So what are the Labour Party complaining about exactly? I am not so cynical as to suggest that the Chancellor has deliberately failed to eliminate the Government’s overspend on target. But he appears to have concluded that such a failure may actually give him an extra ace up his sleeve. If state expenditure were more tightly under control, voters might accept that the Conservatives’ work had been completed and they could now afford to put in place a Labour-led government to go on a spending spree. But Osborne’s plea is that his task is only half-done and you simply can’t trust Labour to complete it. This is why the Tory mantra of the need for a ‘long-term economic plan’ is the centrepiece of their campaign. Machiavelli set out his theories in 1513's The Prince . Changes in stamp duty were the most dramatic tax change unveiled by the Chancellor last week. But even here the motivation seems to be to set a clever political trap for his opponents. Ending the absurd cliff-edge effects of the previous system was a very good move in principle. But the devil was in the detail. The political thinking of Osborne was most definitely in the detail too. Properties worth more than £2 million will see a dramatic rise in stamp duty. This is likely to mean that large London properties become harder to sell or fall in value. It also makes imposing a mansion tax on top of this is now even harder to justify. In essence, Osborne has introduced a ‘mansion purchase tax’. For Labour to demand a further tax on top of this for owning a so-called mansion, in addition to buying one, now looks even more like the narrow-minded politics of envy. The Government is still raising and spending far too much money. Our absurdly complex tax rulebook gets even longer and more complicated every time the Chancellor makes a statement. Those of us who want dramatic economic reform will feel the Coalition has been rather unambitious. But observers of raw electoral tactics might consider Osborne something of a genius. Indeed, had the master of the dark political arts, Machiavelli, been present last Wednesday, it is likely that he would have been the first to rise to his feet and applaud.","The vast budget deficit appears to be stuck at £90 billion for the time being .
This means the Government is overspending by £1,500 for every person .

"With Monday night’s FA Cup tie between Preston North End and Manchester United live on the BBC, it might be best if the first challenge involving Kevin Davies and Marouane Fellaini takes place after the 9pm watershed. The reputation of both precedes them; Davies committing more fouls than any other player in Premier League history and ‘Elbows’ Fellaini leaving a trail of victims over the past seven years in England. At nearly 38, Davies has reached the age where he feels free to say what he thinks. In the case of Fellaini, that is not very much. Preston North End striker Kevin Davies is preparing to face Manchester United in the FA Cup on Monday . The veteran striker trains at Springfields ahead of Monday night's visit of Manchester United . Davies celebrates after scoring his 150th career goal against Coventry last weekend . ‘He caught me under the eye last time we played and it popped up like a balloon. I would liked to have given him the benefit of the doubt but it was a bit naughty. ‘I know it was intentional,’ says Davies, relishing the prospect of meeting him again. The clash came at a Bolton-Everton game in 2011. ‘He was screening me at a goal-kick. David Moyes always put an extra player in front of me and, as the kick came in, Fellaini caught me as I went up to jump. He didn’t jump, his arm shot up instead. There was no apology. Davies is relishing coming up against old foe Marouane Fellaini (left) again . ‘Away fans have a pop at me for my style but if I know I have caught someone I will go over and say sorry. There are going to be collisions when you jump to make challenges. But in more than 800 games I have never intentionally hurt someone.’ Fellaini’s size and power were used by Louis van Gaal to see off another lower league side, Cambridge United, in the last round, so it would be no surprise if the Belgian was drafted in again to try to sort out Preston, particularly with Robin van Persie nursing a knock, Radamel Falcao struggling in front of goal, James Wilson untried and Wayne Rooney being used in midfield. Smarter and more sensitive than his battering-ram image would suggest, Davies is enjoying being centre-stage again. When Bolton decided not to renew his contract in 2013, many wondered if it was the end of the road for the veteran, who spent two decades at Chesterfield, Southampton, Blackburn, Millwall and, finally, Wanderers. Instead, Preston manager Simon Grayson and chairman Peter Ridsdale bombarded him with calls and texts, even during their summer holidays. ‘They made me feel wanted which was important,’ says Davies. ‘You have to dream in football and here we are, about to face the biggest club in Europe. And Manchester United have been significant in his career. Davies was a 20-year-old hotshot with Southampton when he first played against them, scoring the winner past Peter Schmeichel but also sustaining an injury he believes may have cost him 50 England caps. ‘It was my first season in the Premier League, he says. ‘I was full of confidence and playing without fear — like Harry Kane is now. Davies scores against Manchester United in 1997 before an injury that blighted his England career . The former Bolton striker has committed more fouls than any other player in Premier League history . Davies celebrates victory for Bolton over Birmingham in the FA Cup sixth round in 2011 . ‘I scored early — my 12th of the season. Then Denis Irwin and myself had a collision by the halfway line. It wasn’t malicious but I ended up with ankle ligament damage. By the final whistle, I was already in hospital for a scan. It had a lot of repercussions. I came back too early and my ankle went again at Liverpool and I missed my chance of going to the 1998 World Cup. ‘I do think about it. I was playing so well at the time, in the England Under-21s. Without that tackle, I could have got in the full squad and ended up with 50 caps. I still think I’m a better footballer than Emile Heskey (who won 62 caps).’ Eighteen years later, Davies’s right ankle is still heavily swollen and is the subject of curiosity from his current colleagues. Instead of going to France 98 as an understudy for Alan Shearer, Davies had to wait until he was 33 before making his only England appearance, in a Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro at Wembley. He came on as a substitute for Peter Crouch to partner Wayne Rooney, United’s captain against him tomorrow. ‘I was pumped up so I started shouting, “Come on Wazza, let’s get this going”,’ he recalls. ‘He looked bemused but I needed his help to try and stay in the team!’ Unfortunately for Davies, the game finished 0-0 and he did not win a second cap. But compensation arrived in a fantastic club career, particularly at Bolton, where he is regarded as their greatest forward since Nat Lofthouse. United memories come tumbling out. His Bolton debut ended up in a 4-0 defeat at Old Trafford. ‘Cristiano Ronaldo made his first appearance in the same game,’ he says. ‘I’d never heard of him — but it didn’t take long to find out.’ Davies made his first and only appearance for England at 33 in a Euro qualifier against Montenegro . The 37-year-old will be counting on all of his experience to cause a massive upset in the FA Cup . The well-travelled striker has no intention of hanging up his boots just yet . There was also the embarrassment of being spotted on camera after a game asking for a signed shirt from Rooney. ‘It was for my son Lucas,’ he says. ‘My youngest one, Leo, will be a mascot tomorrow. He’s five and I did ask him if he’d prefer to walk out with me or Wayne! He had to think about it but he did say me.’ Professionally, Davies is in a good place. He scored his 150th career goal at Coventry last weekend, got a bloodied nose and two assists at Chesterfield on Tuesday and has proved a good mentor for Preston striker Joe Garner, who has 14 goals already this season. But three months ago, Davies was sure this would be his last season as a player. Preston’s Cup run and promotion push, however, have reinvigorated him. ‘I want to carry on,’ he says. ‘I’m playing, I’m contributing, I haven’t put on any weight and my joints aren’t hurting. If Preston want to keep me, fantastic. If they don’t, hopefully other offers come in.’","Manchester United face Preston North End in the FA Cup fifth round .

The Posh are very lucky to have such a dedicated Chairman and I am sure he will have success again. Finally, and most importantly, thank you to the brilliant Posh fans who have been there all the way. The days we had at Hereford, Colchester, Old Trafford and Wembley will be etched on all our minds as some of the greatest Posh moments and I am extremely proud to have been part of that. The support from the fans during my last game at MK Dons was outstanding, the defiance they showed in the midst of being beaten by our greatest rivals tells its own story. I would like to wish Peterborough United the very best of luck for the future and thanks again for having me.","Darren Ferguson left Peterborough after more than eight years in charge .

Lieutenant Joe P Kennedy, the brother of John F Kennedy, had been at the controls of an American bomber flying over Blythburgh in Suffolk in August 1944 after taking off from RAF Fersfield. The navy pilot had been on a top secret mission named Operation Anvil, which aimed to target German forces in northern France. But the aircraft, packed with 21,000lbs of explosives blew up killing all on board and the remains of the crew were never found. Lieutenant Kennedy's death hit the family hard, particularly his father Joe Kennedy Senior, who was said to have been grooming him to be the first Irish Catholic U.S. president. After his death, the former American ambassador to the UK, then started pinning his hopes on his second son John, who eventually became the 35th president of the United States in January 1961. No memorial or has ever been put up in the village and there is no grave for the former pilot and now local military groups are calling for a simple tribute. Huby Fairfield, curator at Norfolk and Suffolk Aviation Musuem at Flixton told the Times: 'If someone doesn't do something soon he will be forgotten. 'He gave his life for his country and ours - he didn't have to take part in the operation, he volunteered.' It is thought that the crash had been caused by a lack of electrical shielding and Lieutenant Kennedy was posthumously awarded the the Navy Cross, the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal. Joe Kennedy, right, pictured in his naval uniform alongside his younger brother John, who would go on to become the 35th president of the United States . It is also understood that JFK later visited the crash site of where his brother died. The crash was the first of a series of tragedies in the Kennedy clan's history dubbed the 'Kennedy curse'. In 1948, Kathleen Kennedy was killed in an air crash and in 1963, John F. Kennedy, who was president at the time was assassinated leaving the nation bereft. Just six months later in June 1964, a plane carrying JFK's youngest brother Senator Edward 'Ted' Kennedy crashed, killing the pilot and a political aide. Joe Kennedy, right, had been groomed to become president by his father Joseph Senior. After his death Mr Kennedy then pinned his presidential hopes on his younger son, John, left . The senator was pulled from the wreckage and spent weeks recovering from a broken back, punctured lung and internal bleeding. On June 6, 1968, Senator Robert F Kennedy, Robert Jr's father, was assassinated by a shooter in LA following his victory in the Californian presidential primary. Then in 1999, John F. Kennedy Jr, the little boy known as John-John who symbolised a nation's mourning as he stood at his father's coffin in Arlington Cemetery, was killed when a small plane he was flying crashed into the Atlantic, close to the family's Martha's Vineyard compound. His wife Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and his sister-in-law Lauren Bessette were also killed in the crash.","Lieutenant Joe P Kennedy was killed in a plane crash in August 1944 .

"Samsung has revealed it hopes computers sewn into clothing could help take on Google’s Glass and Apple’s much-rumoured iWatch. The electronics giant said it is ‘investing heavily’ in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health. ‘Eventually you won’t even know you’re wearing the device, it could be the fabric in your clothing, your glasses or your watch,’ Samsung’s Chief Strategy Officer, Young Sogn, told the Mobilebeat conference in San Francisco. The official Galaxy Gear looks similar to this 2009 concept of a Samsung smart watch, designed by Joseph Loetiko. The firm's mobile bosses confirmed in March it was working on a watch and the company's executive vice president confirmed the Galaxy Gear name in August . ‘It will monitor your health, connect to the cloud, identify you, pay for things and replace credit cards.’ The firm is currently believed to be developing a range of wearable computers, including a watch. ‘In three or four years, the number of people wearing computers will increase dramatically,’ Mr Sogn said. He believes that by 2020 the technology will be widely available. Samsung has previously admitted it is developing a watch and a recent trademark filing suggested that Samsung's version would be called 'Gear'. Samsung will battle Apple’s much-rumoured iWatch, and Google’s Glass wearable computer. Developers say the technology is beginning to become acceptable. ‘I think we're starting to see devices that people actually want to wear, and we’ve seen a dramatic shift in how much sensors costs,’ said Jef Holove of Basis Point, a firm developing a computer watch. Apple is believed to have 100 people working on its iWatch, according to recent rumours, but is hiring new members because the existing team have been unable to solve issues with the design and engineering. Here is MacUser magazine's mock-up of what the iWatch could look like . Samsung confirmed it was developing a watch to take on Apple's rumoured iWatch in March. The Korean giant let its plans slip . during an interview - setting the scene for the arch-rivals to do battle . in yet another market. Experts . believe both technology giant's watches will link to mobile phones and . offer largely similar functions, such as the ability to show emails and . download mini apps. 'We’ve been preparing the watch . product for so long,' Lee Young Hee, executive vice president of . Samsung’s mobile business, told Bloomberg during an interview in Seoul. 'We are working very hard to get ready for it. 'We are preparing products for the future, and the watch is definitely one of them. 'The issue here is who will first commercialize it so consumers can use it meaningfully,' The Samsung device will perform many of the tasks of a smartphone, a source told Reuters earlier this year, without giving further details. The source declined to be identified because Samsung did not want to reveal to the public any information about its new product line at this time. Samsung announced earlier this year it was  'investing heavily' in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health. Another of Samsung's watch concepts, pictured, shows a solid wooden band, and the watch face can be simply slipped out and put in a pocket when running . However, an earlier concept developed by by designer . Joseph Loetiko shows a watch than can be removed from its wristband when . running or to answer a call, for example. Shares . in both Samsung and Apple have taken a hit as the world's top two . mobile device manufacturers keep underwhelming consumers with their . latest smartphone models. Samsung . shares dropped nearly 5 percent, or around $10 billion, in just two . trading sessions after it launched its Galaxy S smartphone in March, partly hit by concerns that its flagship product lacks the . 'wow factor' and may not live up to expectations. The Galaxy S4, unwrapped to much fanfare in New York to challenge Apple's iPhone on its home turf, offered some incremental evolutionary improvements, but media reports have since suggested these features may not be sufficient to excite buyers in an industry that lives and dies by innovation. The global watch industry is expected to generate . more than $60 billion in sales this year, and rather like the mobile phone market, firms are expected to try and 'lock' consumers into their own ecosystem of apps and other downloads. Samsung's watch concept can even be taken out of its strap to answer a call . 'The . race is on to redesign the mobile phone into something that you wear,' said Marshal Cohen, an analyst at NPD Group in Port Washington, New . York. 'We’re going to see formidable competition coming from many . different directions -- from device makers, accessory makers, even . fashion designers.' Samsung became the world’s largest smartphone maker last year, overtaking Apple. Samsung had 29 percent of global smartphone unit shipments in the fourth quarter, compared with 21 percent for Apple. Experts believe the new watches could kickstart the mobile phone market, in the same way that the tablet market exploded when Apple introduced the iPad.","Samsung said it is working on wearable computers but did not confirm the existence of its rumoured watch .

"Mark Hateley and Glenn Hoddle followed their former manager’s career closely after he left Monaco to go to Japan and then on to England, and have been fascinated to watch him adapt to changing circumstances at Arsenal. Over lunch in Monaco, the former team-mates discussed Wenger’s evolution over the years, and whether this is the year he can finally end his quest for a Champions League triumph. MARK HATELEY: When he went to Japan I thought: ‘What’s he doing?’ His credentials were good, he would probably have got a really decent team in Europe. GLENN HODDLE: Spurs fans won’t like me saying it, but I was England manager when he came to England and David Dein was on the committee. He phoned me about seven times. David was saying: ‘I’m the only one on the board who wants him. No one else has ever heard of him.’ And I said: ‘Go and get him. Wherever he goes he’ll be successful.’ Arsene Wenger won Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France with Monaco before heading to Japan's J-League . In his 18-month stint at Nagoya Grampus Eight, Wenger won the Emperor's Cup before joining Arsenal . The Prince and his players: Glenn Hoddle and Mark Hateley return to Monaco 27 years after they won the title there . If Arsene Wenger wins the Champions League I don't think Tottenham fans will ever forgive me... I told Arsenal to sign him, says Hoddle . MH: He can be a stubborn man. That’s an understatement, wouldn’t you say? But he’s had to adapt. I think he’s been impatient because of the change over from Highbury to the Emirates. He’s probably as frustrated as the fans and he’s not had the ability to replace people with really top players. He’s had to work in a different way. GH: For me, he built a really good team on the back of the England back five and with Dennis Bergkamp and brought in some really good players like Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit. But when they made the move to the new stadium, he had to be spot on in his transfers and get four out of five players right whenever he bought. That never materialised and that’s what held him back. MH: Can he win the Champions League? It depends how long he wants to go on for. I think Arsenal have improved this year and I think they are a better side going forward. It’s working out the areas and how long it will take him to fix those areas, which are goalkeeper and defence. That’s the question. Wenger took Mark Hateley (left) and Glenn Hoddle to the Principality and enjoyed instant success . Wenger joined Arsenal in 1996 and success instantly came to the Frenchman in north London . GH: The best I’ve seen them play for four or five years was at Manchester City in January. I’ve never seen an Arsene team defend like that against a top team. They always seem to think they can take them on. ‘We’re better than you technically.’ Even against Barcelona. I find myself saying: ‘No, you’ve got to be tight.’ One thing they have is pace to break with players like Alexis Sanchez. They used it perfectly at City. If they’re ever going to learn how to play in the Champions League and certain games away from home, that was the moment. MH: I think they had the same experience at Borussia Dortmund last year, when they won 1-0. But I didn’t think they learnt as much from that as they did against City. GH: If they get through someone’s going to get Porto or Basel in the quarters. Going forward they’re better than Chelsea, better than City. But for me they have to defend like they did against City. Alexis Sanchez has added extra  pace to Arsenal and the Chilean will be key to their European hopes . Arsenal defended resolutely in the 2-0 win at Manchester City and must recreate that form in Europe . MH: We were always defensively solid at Monaco. He thought we had enough firepower in midfield and up front. But he trusted a lot in centre-halves Remy Vogel and Patrick Battiston. One was a real stopper and the other could read the game like nobody else. That is a massive joker to have in your pocket if you want to play expansive football: a really smart centre half who sees the game very quickly. GH: He’s always had a good spine and I’m not sure he has a good spine at the moment. If you put Nemanja Matic into his team, it would be transformed. And he’s not an out-and-out defensive midfielder... just a good player. If Arsenal get a player like him and a keeper, they have the firepower. MH: Is he convinced by his goalkeeper? GH: No, I wouldn’t think so. But I think they’ll have more than enough to win over the two legs.","Wenger took Glenn Hoddle and Mark Hateley to Monaco, who play Arsenal in the Champions League this week, in 1987 .

"Chelsea have announced The Yokohama Rubber Company as their new official shirt partner in a near £40million-a-year agreement which vindicates owner Roman Abramovich holding out for this mega deal. The five-year contract is the second highest kit endorsement ever signed by an English club – only behind Manchester United’s £53m agreement with Chevrolot – and is more than double the annual value of Chelsea’s 10-year partnership with Samsung, which expires at the end of the season. Chelsea had a £25m offer from Turkish Airlines on the table for months , but demanding Abramovich wanted a lot more. The Yokohama contract leapfrogs Chelsea above Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City in the shirt sponsorship table as well as helping with UEFA financial fair play rules.

It is also a notable triumph for Chelsea’s commercial chief Christian Purslow , the former Liverpool managing director, brought in last October after the departure of Ron Gourlay to re-structure Chelsea’s commercial department and find that big-money shirt sponsor. Purslow’s first move was to bring in outside agency HTH, formed by two ex-Manchester United commercial executives, to help in the hunt which has reaped huge rewards. Yokohama, who manufacture tyres, also sponsor NBA teams Boston Celtic and the San Antonio Spurs. Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck said: ‘It is an absolute pleasure to welcome Yokohama as our new Official Shirt Partner and we look forward to a successful relationship with them. The deal with The Yokohama Rubber Company will begin at the start of the 2015/16 season . The new lucrative endorsement is double the amount of the clubs current sponsors Samsung . ‘Chelsea and Yokohama are a perfect fit. Both are global organisations with a focus on performance and innovation, as well as having huge ambition and an unwavering culture of success. ‘We believe that Yokohama will play a key role in helping us drive our global expansion in international markets such as the US, where they have operated with distinction for many years. Also, of course, Chelsea having such an esteemed and historic Japanese company as our partner enables us to accelerate our development in their home market too. ‘We are also looking forward to working with Yokohama on our community projects around the world through the Chelsea Foundation, when together we can use the power of sport as a force for good. ‘I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to Samsung, with whom we have had a successful and rewarding relationship since 2005.

"Jose Mourinho learned a lot in Paris. Not on Tuesday night, necessarily, but a year ago. It was in this fixture in the previous campaign that this Chelsea team began to take shape. David Luiz made a mistake that got Paris Saint-Germain back into the game; Petr Cech was unconvincing in goal. Mourinho corrected both of those perceived flaws in the summer and on Tuesday night those changes paid off. Thibaut Courtois, who has taken Cech’s place as first choice goalkeeper, was quite outstanding and kept Chelsea in the match. Luiz, sold to PSG for £50million, appeared to lose Branislav Ivanovic for Chelsea’s goal. His extraordinary fee made the signings of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas possible and one imagines they will have greater influence on the outcome when these teams reconvene on March 11. Branislav Ivanovic slides on his knees after scoring the opening goal of the last 16 Champions League clash . Serbia international Ivanovic wheels away in celebration after scoring his fifth goal of the season . Paris Saint-Germain forward Edinson Cavani (right) celebrates after cancelling out Ivanovic's first-half opener . Cavani looks to the sky after scoring past Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois in the 54th minute . PSG (4-3-3): Sirigu 6.5; Van der Wiel 6, Marquinhos 5.5, Thiago Silva 6, Maxwell 6; Verratti 6.5; David Luiz 6.5; Matuidi 6.5; Lavezzi 6.5 (Pastore 81), Ibrahimovic 6.5; Cavani 7 . Subs not used: Douchez, Camara, Bahebeck, Digne, Rabiot, Kimpembe . Goal: Cavani 54 . Booked: Van der Wiel, Verratti . CHELSEA (4-2-3-1): Courtois 7.5; Ivanovic 6, Cahill 5.5, Terry 7, Azpilicueta 6.5; Ramires 6.5, Matic 7; Willian 6 (Cuadrado 79), Fabregas 7 (Oscar 83), Hazard 6; Diego Costa 6 (Remy 81) Subs not used: Cech, Filipe Luis, Zouma, Drogba . Goal: Ivanovic 36 . Booked: Ivanovic, Fabregas . Referee: Cuneyt Cakir 6 . Costa and Fabregas were both recovering from spells out of the team and were below par. In three weeks’ time it may be a different story. It will need to be because while this was a job well done, nobody should think a draw and an away goal amount to a guarantee for Chelsea against the champions of France. It needed Courtois to be at his very best, and Chelsea to weather a second-half onslaught in which PSG found a fresh level of menace, before the sides could shake hands, honours even. By then, Chelsea were more than acquainted with the danger posed in that second leg. Edinson Cavani’s 54th-minute equaliser was not the half of it. PSG ran out 3-1 winners here last year and could have done so again had Courtois, and others, not been at the top of their game. This PSG side cannot be underestimated, no matter what the history books say about the record of French teams in England. Having lost heavily a year ago, a 1-1 draw is to be respected. Yet an away goal at Stamford Bridge will make for a very tense night, and Laurent Blanc’s team are more than capable of it. Cavani was a constant threat and while Zlatan Ibrahimovic has never scored against a Mourinho defence, he caused enough problems to suggest the continuation of that run cannot be presumed. He should have won the tie deep in added time when a cross by Blaise Matuidi found him at the far post. His header was directed into the dirt and reared up to force the final intervention from Courtois, tipping it around for a corner. There were other saves, equally spectacular. He had earlier kept PSG at bay with an outstanding low stop after Ibrahimovic had broken free of his guards. The ball came out to Ezequiel Lavezzi but this time Cesar Azpilicueta came to the rescue, making excellent ground to clear his line. PSG were certainly a different proposition after half-time. It had not been the most thrilling opening 45 minutes, in all truthfulness. In the 11th minute, a cross from Cavani was headed powerfully goalwards by Matuidi, but parried with both hands by Courtois. From the next attacking phase, Matuidi crossed to Ibrahimovic, whose header was again kept out by the Belgian. Chelsea then regrouped and it was not until the 33rd minute that Paris came close again. On this occasion it was a desperately poor touch by Ramires that conceded possession and set up a PSG counter-attack. Azpilicueta took no chances offering up the corner and, from it, Lavezzi’s delivery was met by Cavani at the near post, Courtois’ stunning reflexes equal to the challenge again. The Parc des Princes bristled with anticipation yet it is in Chelsea’s nature to prick balloons and four minutes later PSG were behind. Ivanovic receives a hug from Chelsea team-mate Nemanja Matic after putting his side in the lead . Ivanovic rises above PSG's defence to give his side the lead in the 36th minute . It was a goal remarkable for doing entirely without forwards, wide men or even hard-running midfielders. A set-piece had broken down but not left the danger zone and John Terry sprinted out to the left to recover the loose ball. He whipped in an early cross, flicked on by his central defensive partner Cahill and falling to right back Branislav Ivanovic, who lost Luiz. As is his style in important games, Ivanovic seized the moment and directed a deft header past goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu. It was very clinical, very Chelsea. They had to defend much the same way, as Paris upped the tempo after half-time. Mourinho will be upset at the goal, though, which came after a Matuidi cross was poorly read by Cahill, pulled out of position, allowing Cavani a free header from his favourite place on the edge of the six-yard box. It was the one occasion on the night when Courtois was rendered powerless. For Luiz, playing his first game against his former club, the match was a mixed bag. Deployed in midfield in place of the injured Thiago Motta, he had a dust-up with Costa, took one from Fabregas, gave plenty back, will be disappointed with the goal, but pleased with his growing influence on PSG’s build-up play after half-time. For a defender, he has an excellent range of passing, but not always the best sense of danger. One imagines Mourinho will still feel he got the best of that £50m transaction. David Luiz watches on as former Chelsea team-mate Ivanovic heads towards goal . PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu was unable to stop Ivanovic's header from hitting the back of the net . This may go down as the earliest parking of a bus in the history of European football, close to two hours prior to kick-off when Chelsea’s vehicle managed to get stuck in the Parc des Prince tunnel and was abandoned. Mourinho stomped off, face like thunder, and sent out a team in that image. This was a growl of a performance at times, brooding, occasionally irritable, but resolute. Not that PSG were wholly different. They recognised Eden Hazard as the danger and swarmed around him, committing fouls. Costa copped it, too. The striker, as is his instinct, met fire with fire, leaving a foot in here and there and bristling with physical defiance as PSG sought to close him down. Fabregas was hit hard and took his frustration out on Luiz. He had got away with a verbal warning and then Costa intervened, pulling Luiz’s hair on the sly and needlessly upping the ante just at the moment Chelsea should have been beating a respectful retreat. The professionals all love that spiky attitude but in this of all competitions, Costa’s grumbles and rumbles could return to haunt his club. If referee Cuneyt Cakir from Turkey had seen it, there could have been damaging repercussions. Still, all’s well that ends well.

"The daughter of an oil magnate and his ex-wife who just slammed a court's ruling saying that the $1billion payout she is set to receive in her divorce is 'inappropriate' and 'not fair' was married in a very private and secretive ceremony in the middle of her parents contentious trial. Jane Hamm, whose mother Sue Ann Arnall just received the second highest divorce settlement in United States history from her husband, and Jane's father, Harold Hamm, wed Thomas Lerum at the Grand Del Mar resort and hotel in San Diego, California. And shockingly, the ceremony happened on October 4, as Miss Arnall and Mr. Hamm were in the middle of their 10 week trial over her divorce settlement. Scroll down for videos . They do: Jane Hamm tied the knot with Thomas Lerum in the middle of a highly contentious divorce trial between her parents Harold Hamm and Sue Ann Arnall . Private affair: The ceremony took place on October 4 and was very hush hush, with no coverage and few photos, such as this one of the two sharing their first dance . Appealing: Miss Arnall has filed an appeal less than a month after she was awarded $1billion in her divorce from ex-husband, saying she is worth much more . The  event was so hush hush that photos are few and far between and there was never any media or society coverage of the nuptials. It is uncertain if both Mr. Hamm and Miss Arnall attended their daughter's wedding, though mother and daughter were in conversation on Twitter in the days following as Miss Arnall checked in with her daughter following the wedding, making it appear that the mother of the bride was in attendance for the big day. The attractive, young newlyweds, who got engaged in November 2013, live in California where Jane works for the Republican Party of Los Angeles County according to her Facebook. They honeymooned at the pricey and private Rosewood Mayakoba resort in Playa del Carmen, Mexico.

Getaway: The newlyweds honeymooned at the pricey and private Rosewood Mayakoba resort in Playa del Carmen, Mexico . Miss Arnall and Mr. Hamm also have a second daughter, Hilary, who attends Dartmouth College. Miss Arnall has appealed the ruling made last month in an Oklahoma City, Oklahoma courtroom, citing 78 alleged errors and missteps that caused a judge to grossly undervalue her stake in one of America's greatest oil fortunes. The oil fortune she refers to is that of Continental Resources, the company founded by her ex-husband Harold Hamm in 1967, who himself is worth $9billion. The couple never signed a prenuptial agreement. Pay up: Mr. Hamm and his ex-wife did not have a pre-nup, meaning she is entitled to half the assets earned during their marriage . Real estate portfolio: Miss Arnall also picked up three properties in the divorce, including this home in Enid, Oklahoma . This as Miss Arnall has taken ownership of the Oak Ridge Ranch in Carmel, California, a property purchased by the couple in 2011 for $14.7million, along with the couple's two of their Oklahoma properties, as per the court's ruling. Mr. Hamm will take their $750,000 home in Branson, Missouri and a $300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in Major County, Oklahoma. As for the appeal, Miss Arnall made it clear just days after the November 10 ruling that officially made her a billionaire that she believed the marital wealth she was entitled to had been grossly undervalued. The only spouse to ever score a bigger settlement in the United States was Jocelyn Wildenstein, who reportedly received $2.5billion after splitting with her businessman and art dealer husband Alec in 1999. Relaxed living: The Enid home has been valued at $800,000 and was one of three the couple owned in Oklahoma . All good?: Miss Arnell's appeal does not say anything about the property she was awarded in the divorce . Miss Arnell stated that she felt that the decision by Judge Howard Haralson to allow lawyers for both her husband and for Continental Resources to be involved in the proceedings was 'inappropriate' in that it allowed them to 'double team' her. The crux of the argument though comes down to how much money the company and Mr. Hamm made beginning in 1988, the year he and Miss Arnall were married. During the trial it was argued that Continental’s growth stemmed mostly from passive factors, such as rising oil prices, and, under Oklahoma law, only the 'active' portion of wealth accrued during marriage in previously acquired assets is subject to division. Miss Arnall’s lawyers contend however that Judge Haralson miscalculated what was due to her by attributing only a small portion of a $14billion rise in the value of Mr. Hamm's Continental shares during the marriage - 6 percent. 'As Sue Ann has stated previously, 6 percent is not a fair proportion of the wealth the couple accumulated during their marriage, and she trusts that a more equitable division of the marital estate will result from this appeal,' her legal team said in a statement. The Mansion: Miss Arnell also got the couple's second Oklahoma home located in Nichols Hill and worth $4.6million . Big growth: During the course of their marriage, Mr. Hamm's company's worth jumped from $50million to $20billion . Miss Arnall, who worked as a lawyer for Continental when she and Mr. Hamm married, and went on to take a series of executive roles at the company, also claims that Judge Haralson undervalued her own contributions to the couple’s wealth. Most estimates have stated that Continental Resources was worth around $50million in 1988 when the couple married, which is just a drop in the well when compared to the $20billion behemoth it is today. A behemoth that Mr. Hamm has a 68 percent stake in, a stake he lost none of in the divorce as it was determined to be 'separate property.' All this, combined with lingering timeline questions presented by Miss Arnall that question whether strategic moves that ultimately yielded giant profits for the company happened before or after the couple's 1988 wedding, will likely cause this case to drag on for as long as two more years. And there's somehow more. That aforementioned $9billion fortune of Mr. Hamm's was in fact a $20billion fortune as recently as August, with the oil baron forced to watch over half his worth slip away due to a drop in the price of crude oil. Started from the bottom: Mr. Hamm was born one of 13 children to a sharecropper . Working his way up:  He pumped gas when he was 20 and slowly saved up his money to drill his first well . Filing for divorce in March 2013, Miss Arnall alleged in court papers that her husband was having an affair, citing that as the reason for termination of the marriage. Mr. Hamm had over the course of their marriage grown to become one of the richest men in the world, a far cry from his youth and a true embodiment of the American dream. Born one of 13 children to a sharecropper, Mr. Hamm worked his way up, picking cotton as a child, pumping gas and fixing cars by the time he was 20 and eventually saving up enough money to drill his first well. And while Mr. Hamm, who was previously married and has three children from that union, is no fan of the spotlight, he has not exactly shunned it over the past few years. In 2012, Mr. Hamm became a big part of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign when he was appointed energy adviser, a gesture he thanked the politician for by donating $985,000 to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future. Mr. Hamm also hosted a fundraiser at his $4.6 million Nichols Hills, Oklahoma mansion for the Republican candidate, which raised more than $2million. It is worth noting that the Nichols Hill mansion is no longer Mr. Hamm's but, along with a $800,000 home in Enid, Oklahoma, the property of Miss Arnall. Big score: In 2012, Mr. Hamm was one of the select few named to the Time 100, an event he attended with his wife . Friends in high places: 2012 was also the year Mr. Hamm became an adviser for the Romney campaign . It was also in early 2012 that Mr. Hamm earned the biggest accolade of his life when he was named to the Time 100 for that year. He and his wife attended the ceremony together that April in New York that also honored, among others, Marco Rubio, Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, President Barack Obama and Rihanna. The two posed on the red carpet together, smiling for the cameras with their arms around one another, looking happy and excited. Miss Arnall would file for divorce less than a year later.","Jane Hamm, the oldest daughter of Harold Hamm and his ex-wife Sue Ann Arnall was married in October at the Grand Del Mar resort in San Diego .

"Manchester United starlet Andreas Pereira has been linked with a move to Juventus after refusing to commit his long-term future to the club. The 19-year-old, who has been tipped to follow Paul Pogba to the Juventus Stadium, made his Manchester United debut in their embarrassing 4-0 defeat by MK Dons in August - but has not made another first team appearance since. Here, Sportsmail tells you everything you need to know about the Brazilian starlet. Andreas Pereira looks set to leave Manchester United at the end of the season after rejecting a new deal . I've never heard of him . Chances are, unless you're an avid viewer of MUTV or regular visitor to United's Under 21 matches you won't have. He's a Belgium-born Brazilian winger/attacking midfielder who has made just one appearance for the senior team. That came on that miserable night in the land of the concrete cows when United had their rumps spanked 4-0 by MK Dons. The fate of those who pulled on a red shirt that evening is well documented. Pereira has not been seen in the first-team squad since. Pereira's only first team appearance came against MK Dons back in August 2014 . Victor Valdes, Joel Castro, Anderson, Pereira, Jesse Lingard and Saidy Janko  after an Under 21 game . Is he good? Ander Herrera would seem to think so. Only this week the recently-restored midfielder singled out Pereira for praise. 'I didn't know how good the academy is here,' the Spaniard gushed. 'Adnan Januzaj and Andreas Pereira are young players for Manchester United that are going to be very important players for many years.' Like Herrera, Pereira is not the biggest but has quick feet a keen eye for a pass and clips in an accurate cross. He is also a sharp cookie and can speak Spanish and French as well as Portuguese and English. Despite his tender years Pereira is known as something of a dressing room translator. Pereira poses in the United dressing room alongside 'my friend' Radamel Falcao . Posing with his 'idol', Pereira shared this picture of himself with Cristiano Ronaldo . So he's going to be a United great? That's the thing. Pereira's contract is up at the end of the season and there is a giant Paul Pogba-like shadow looming large. Pereira enjoys a kickabout with his father, Marcos, a former professional footballer in Belgium . Paul Pogba? Yes. Italian giants Juventus are rumoured to be sniffing around in a bid to tempt the youngster to Turin. We have seen this before. In 2012, angered at a lack of first-team opportunities (sound familiar?), Frenchman Pogba risked the wrath of Fergie and made the switch to Italy. He has not looked back and is now a regular for the Grand Old Lady and his national side. This summer bids are expected to flood in and there is even talk of £80million offers from the likes of Arsenal to bring him back to the Premier League. He is the one that got away. The youngster has been urged to join Juventus by the Italians' midfield star Paul Pogba (right) Is Pereira aware of this? He is - and is even thought to have broken bread with the enfant terrible who dared to stand up to Fergie. Earlier this week he told Tuttosport that he had spoken with Pogba 'many times'. 'He is a good friend and he told me that I would be well served in moving to Turin,' he added. Yikes. And it is not just Juve - Pereira claims his agent is currently evaluating a number of offers, with Paris St Germain also thought to have expressed an interest. Pogba skips past Borussia Dortmund's Oliver Kirch in the Champions League on Tuesday night . Would he be a big loss? Time will tell. As we know, Louis van Gaal is not the biggest fan of width and Pereira likes to head for the flanks. The 19-year-old can justifiably claim that one appearance in Milton Keynes does not represent an opportunity to showcase his talents and it would come as no surprise if he followed in Pogba's footsteps. Fergie saw enough back in 2011 to personally persuade Pereira that his future was in Manchester and he wasn't a bad judge of a player, was he? Pogba was a promising player at Old Trafford but rejected a new contract and left the club in 2012 .","Andreas Pereira has been linked with a summer move to Juventus .

"Arsenal are exploring numerous options to help fans get home from their FA Cup quarter-final after TV schedulers announced their glamour tie against Manchester United will be on a Monday night. The Gunners will take on Louis van Gaal’s side at Old Trafford on Monday March 9, which is set to cause travel problems for the away Arsenal fans, with an evening kick-off time of 7.45pm. All four FA Cup quarter-finals will be broadcast live on TV, with the BBC and BT Sport sharing the ties. Olivier Giroud scored a brace as Arsenal knocked out Middlesbrough in the FA Cup fifth-round on Sunday . ‘In the wake of this announcement, the club is exploring a number of options to help our travelling supporters get back to London afterwards,’ said a statement on Arsenal’s website. ‘No return trains are currently timetabled and we will let supporters know the proposed travel plans as soon as possible.’ The Old Trafford FA Cup tie is set to finish at just after 9.30pm, meaning Arsenal fans would miss the final train from Manchester Piccadilly to London Euston at 9.15pm. In order to make that train fans would have to leave the ground well before full-time or would face a 199 mile drive back to London (The Emirates Stadium), which on average takes four hours. In addition even if fans did leave early and catch the 9.15pm train, they could miss the last Underground trains on certain tube lines in London. Wayne Rooney leaps into the air to celebrate his spot-kick as Manchester United beat Preston on Monday . Arsenal Supporters' Trust spokesman Tim Payton said: ‘One of the magic things of the FA Cup is the large away fan allocation but the Football Association are damaging their own competition. They are sullying the brand of the cup. ‘The football authorities need to explain why with four quarter-finals we can’t play two on Saturday and two on Sunday. This is another example of broadcasters and their money dictating to the inconvenience of fans. ‘Broadcasters should remember, without fans at the ground there would be no atmosphere for them to show.’ Arsenal Supporters' Trust are demanding that the club and the FA help to cut their costs. Payton added: ’We are calling on the FA and Arsenal to subsidise travel to the game and have reasonably-priced match tickets. ‘We are already working with other Arsenal fan groups on the issue of broadcasted games. With £5billion about to flow into football it really is time that fans are put first.’ Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez closes down Middlesbrough's George Friend in the FA Cup fifth-round . The quarter-final action begins at 12.45pm on Saturday 7 March with Bradford City taking on Reading, live on BT Sport. Later that day West Brom make a quick trip to Villa Park to take on Tim Sherwood’s Aston Villa which will be broadcast by the BBC. On Sunday March 8, with an evening kick-off of 4pm, BT Sport will take their cameras to Anfield for Blackburn’s visit to Liverpool. Finally, the mouth-watering prospect of Manchester United against Arsenal will conclude the quarter-final action, before the winners get set for semi-final ties at Wembley.","The BBC will broadcast the Old Trafford tie on Monday March 9 .

"Have you ever wondered if Louis van Gaal is actually bothered? I’m not for one second suggesting he doesn’t care about his work, or that he isn’t trying. He is a professional, anyone with even the slightest knowledge of his career will know that. But throw forward to summer 2015. Imagine that Manchester United finished outside the top four and didn’t achieve the target of making it into the Champions League next season. He might be sacked, but there is a chance Van Gaal might still be  at United. Either way, he will be the subject of fierce, and understandable, criticism for his failure to lift United into the top four. Louis van Gaal (centre) hangs his head as Manchester United slip to a 2-1 defeat at Swansea City . Captain Wayne Rooney (second right) and his team-mates looked sick after Swansea's second goal . My own view is that if he makes it in to the top four, fine. If he doesn’t then he has failed in his first season at United, even if they lift the FA Cup. But I can’t believe Van Gaal will lose sleep, because his reputation is totally intact whatever happens under him at Old Trafford. His place among the greats is already assured. He has won titles in three different countries with four different clubs. His Champions League-winning Ajax team in 1995 was stunning. They knew their jobs, they were organised to the point of boring efficiency, but with the sparkling creativity of Marc Overmars on one wing, Finidi George on the other and the sublime Jari Litmanen at his peak in the fantasy role. That team was the perfect mix of function and flair; it’s a team that will go down in football history as one of the very best. Critics might say they underachieved, but that wasn’t a failing of Van Gaal. It was thanks mainly to the emergence and effects of the Bosman ruling, which saw Ajax unable to keep those players together. Van Gaal lifts the Champions League in 1995 after Ajax's improbable victory over AC Milan . Van Gaal's Ajax side lifted club football's most prestigious trophy with a blend of flair and efficiency . One of his spells with the Dutch national side was a disaster, the other saw them finish third in the world. In Brazil, he even managed to win a penalty shootout (the Dutch are as fearful of these things as the English) with an innovative substitution (throwing on Tim Krul at the death) boosting his reputation hugely. He then lost one in the semi-final. So he’s not the greatest, but Van Gaal is certainly one of the greats. If you’re still not convinced, then I refer to you the work of the man named coach of the century by FIFA in 1999. In his brilliant book Teambuilding: The Road To Success, Rinus Michels names several 'top-notch coaches' to whom the 'evolution of the game of football can be attributed to. These coaches developed team tactical innovations which improved the performance level of their teams.' Michels added: 'Due to the success of these coaches other coaches plunged into these new styles of play.' Michels then lists these coaches: the Brazilian legend Mario Zagallo; Argentine pragmatist Helenio Herrera – the catenaccio king, successful at three European giants but notably at Inter Milan; Sir Alf Ramsey and his wingless wonders developing the 4-4-2 system with England’s World Cup winners in 1966; Michels himself (he wasn’t modest, understandably so given his record) for bringing Total Football to the table; Franz Beckenbauer’s World Cup-winning 3-5-2 with marauding full backs; Johan Cruyff who created history at Barcelona with his 3-4-3 designed to control midfield and therefore control the game; and then last on the chronological list, Van Gaal, who further developed Cruyff’s ideas. Legendary coach Rinus Michels is held aloft by his players after Holland's Euro 88 success . The book was published in 2001, Michels died in 2005, so we can only guess who might be added to the list: possibly Jose Mourinho, surely Pep Guardiola. Even so, for Van Gaal to be included on the original list is surely evidence of how much he is respected within global coaching circles. He’s been at that level for a long time. Of course some players hated him, Rivaldo was particularly scathing when he left Barcelona. But then you only have to look at the number of quality players who have followed him to a new club to realise as many, probably more, loved working under him. Journalists have fallen out with him in the past – the brilliant Dutch football journalist Hugo Borst was close to Van Gaal but they fell out. Borst’s book on the United boss, O, Louis, is one of the best I’ve read in the past few months. Van Gaal coached Pep Guardiola (left) while at Barcelona . I don’t know Van Gaal personally but professionally I’ve always found him charming and engaging. However, I am under no illusions, this situation could change at any moment. So with United still trying to recover from losing a brilliant manager and an efficient chief executive in the summer of 2013, Van Gaal knows he may succeed or he may fail. He obviously wants to get it right, but if he doesn’t, he may choose to retire in his mid-60s, safe in the knowledge that his reputation as one of the great coaches in the history of football is intact. Meanwhile, some bang average ex-footballers on English television will still be trying to tell us all that Van Gaal doesn’t know what he’s doing. One wonders if these former 'Premier League greats' have even heard of Rinus Michels.","Manchester United currently fourth in Premier League table .
Louis van Gaal tasked with achieving top-four finish in his first season .
United a point clear of fifth but Van Gaal won't lose sleep if they miss out .
Dutchman has won four titles in three countries and a Champions League .
Rinus Michels named him among the best ever coaches ."
"FA Cup giant killers Bradford are set to be snubbed by the BBC for a second time after opting against showing their quarter-final tie against Reading live. The corporation came in for criticism after it chose to air Aston Villa's fifth round tie with Leicester rather than the League One side's  2-0 win against Premier League opposition Sunderland at Valley Parade on Sunday. And despite that decision causing such a stir, which led to Bradford supporters chanting 'are you watching BBC' and goalscorer Jon Stead insisting the game 'should have been on TV' during his post-match interview, the BBC are risking further backlash by ignoring the club once more, according to the Telegraph's Ben Rumsby. Billy Clarke (centre) fires Bradford ahead against Sunderland as they set up FA Cup quarter-final . Jon Stead (right) seals the tie with a neat finish to complete the FA Cup fifth round giant killing . The BBC had first and third pick of the last-eight ties and understandably plumped for Manchester United's clash with Arsenal at Old Trafford as first choice. BT Sport, who are sharing FA Cup coverage with the BBC, opted to show Liverpool against Blackburn as their first pick, and the BBC have controversially ignored Bradford's match in favour of the Midlands derby between Aston Villa and West Brom. Match of the Day Two presenter Mark Chapman on Sunday night moved to clarify why the BBC had not shown Bradford's win over Sunderland. 'I do have an answer on that subject,' the presenter said. 'And it comes from the BBC football management who say the following: ""They had to pick their live games before the replays were played in the fourth round and therefore couldn’t be sure who Bradford would be at home to. If they had been allowed to wait they would have chosen it"".' Mark Chapman said that  the BBC had to choose the live games before Bradford's opponents were known . Stead joked during his post-match interview that the tie against Sunderland should have been shown on TV . Gary Lineker and Mark Chapman were subject to a cheeky tweet from Bradford  following their FA Cup win . Sunderland needed a replay to beat Championship side Fulham in the fourth round and the BBC had to select the live games before the tie was decided, with the corporation instead opting to show the all Premier League clash between Aston Villa and Leicester. Gary Lineker had earlier claimed the BBC would have screened Bradford's  fifth-round clash had their opponents been known prior to the fourth-round replays. The BBC later released a statement explaining how the selection process for the FA Cup ties works. The TV match selections for the 5th round of the FA Cup caused a bit of a reaction yesterday, so I wanted to use this post to explain in a bit more detail how the selection process works. You still might not agree with our picks, particularly if you're from Bradford, but hopefully you'll see there's a bit of logic to what we try to do. As Gary Lineker mentioned yesterday, the hardest thing is that both the BBC and BT have to make our selections before the outcome of replays. That's the only reason why Phil Parkinson's side didn't get a live match this time round. We had to weigh up the options and given Sunderland's recent form, thought it was a realistic possibility of the match being League One against a Championship side. In this case it wouldn't have been much of a shock whatever the result and the winners would be guaranteed a live Quarter-Final, as Reading have done by progressing at Derby. If Bradford definitely had a home tie against Premier League opposition we certainly would have chosen to have the match live on BBC One. That has been a big part of our policy so far, showing AFC Wimbledon, Cambridge, Bristol City and tonight Preston, all looking to overcome opposition from the top flight. As the game unfolded yesterday at Valley Parade, we shared the frustration of fans and would have loved to have been broadcasting the match live. It's everything the FA Cup and our new comprehensive coverage is about. We are speaking to the FA about whether we can change this in the future, but understand it's tricky for them. Clubs understandably want to get plans for ticketing, policing and fans in place without waiting for 10 days for TV companies to confirm their selections. But we hope there's a middle ground where we can get a little more flexibility to ensure we have as much chance as possible of capturing cup classics like yesterday. Of course a lot of things are easy in hindsight. We have been really pleased with most of our picks so far and really fortunate to get some proper cup shocks. Warrington from the eighth tier overcoming Exeter City, Blyth Spartans winning in dramatic fashion at Hartlepool, AFC Wimbledon running Liverpool close and Cambridge holding Manchester United under the Abbey Stadium lights. It's also great to see the difference the TV money can make to these clubs, as well as placing them in the national spotlight with over 7 million viewers tuning in. Our audience research also suggests that fans want to enjoy a mix of these David vs. Goliath matches and games involving Premier League sides. For those who can't afford subscription to sports channels, it's been great to be able to see live international stars like Alexis Sanchez, Angel Di Maria, Steven Gerrard, Ron Vlaar and Alex Song, all as part of the licence fee. While the Aston Villa vs. Leicester game wasn't everyone's cup of tea, it was a hotly contested Midlands derby with both clubs picking full strength sides and produced a cracking second half watched by over 4 million. Of course, we would have loved to have been live at Chelsea in the 4th round and Bradford in the 5th, but the good news for fans is that even when a game isn't shown live there's always comprehensive Match of the Day highlights available. There's a lot more extra coverage devoted to the FA Cup on the BBC, with lots of additional content and different ways to enjoy it. After the 4th round, 26 million people had watched the coverage on the BBC, that's 8 million more than on terrestrial TV this time last season. It's not all about viewing figures and ratings, but it's pleasing to be able to bring coverage of the world's most loved cup competition to such a wide audience. Despite some of the criticism coming out of Bradford, a lot of thought goes into the matches we pick, and I hope the selections outlined above show we are particularly keen to showcase clubs outside the Premier League. I'm a Bristol Rovers fan myself so know all too well what the cup can mean to those outside the elite. When we sit down tomorrow morning to pick our two matches for the Quarter-Final we will take all I've discussed into consideration, but the good news is that all four matches will be live on TV. That means Bradford's incredible heroics over the last five rounds have guaranteed them a money-spinning Quarter-Final game and boy do Bantams fans deserve it!","Bradford City were drawn against Reading in the FA Cup quarter-final .

"Late night comedian Bill Maher has controversially described Michael Brown a 'thug' that didn't deserve to be shot and rubbished claims he was a 'gentle giant'. Weighing in on the conflict in Ferguson, Missouri, he urged people on both sides to 'look at the facts'. 'I'm sorry, but Michael Brown's people say he is a gentle giant,' he told viewers of HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher on Friday night. 'Well, we saw that video of when he was in that 7-Eleven. No, he wasn't a gentle giant. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Conflict: Michael Brown's death at the hands of police officer Darren Wilson (right) has ruptured the city . 'He was committing a robbery and he pushed that guy. 'He was acting like a thug, not like a gentle giant. He certainly didn't deserve to be shot for it.' His words come as a grand jury nears its conclusion over whether police officer Darren Wilson violated Michael Brown's civil rights by shooting him dead. Protests sparked by the incident on August 9 are still ongoing in the city ruptured by racial divides. Maher also took aim at people taking sides rather than objectively judging the situation. Controversial: Maher pointed to footage of Brown 'acting like a thug in 7-Eleven' as evidence for his view . 'Taking sides': He said people on both sides are ignoring the crucial facts of the matter dating back to August 9 . Questions: He also questioned why police officers are siding with 'a plain murderer' like Darren Wilson . Support: Dr Cornel West, a prominent member of anti-police protests in Ferguson, agreed with Maher . 'You know what else I find disturbing is that everybody in America just sides with their own people and doesn't look at the facts,' he said. 'The cops, I saw on the news a couple of weeks ago, were wearing bracelets or something that said, ""I am Darren Wilson"". Why do you want to throw your lot in with this plain murderer?' Nodding in agreement, one of his guests Dr Cornel West, a prominent figure in the protests against Ferguson police, said: 'Michael Brown was a human being, he had flaws like all of us, he didn't deserve to be shot.' The rant followed one from outgoing US Attorney General Eric Holder, who is 'exasperated' by the numerous leaks of information coming from the secret tribunal. Shooting: Darren Wilson is pictured standing over the body of Michael Brown after he shot him six times . Outrage: The shooting sparked mass outrage in Ferguson, Missouri, with citizens calling on Wilson to resign . Underlying tensions: It has unearthed deep divides in Ferguson between the black community and white police . Holder's legacy as attorney general, a position he has held since the start of the Obama administration, has been largely shaped by his vocal advocacy for racial justice. But unrest in the St Louis city between the majority Caucasian police force and African American community shows no signs of dying down. The outbursts have been exacerbated by leaks from the grand jury. Last week, leaked information indicated that Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, was acting in self-defense. 'It appears that people are somehow trying to shape public opinion,' Holder said. In addition to the criminal investigation into Wilson's actions, the Justice Department is also conducting a civil investigation into the patterns and practices of the Ferguson Police Department.","Late night comedian discussed Ferguson conflict with Dr Cornel West .

"The Queen is set to lose funding worth millions of pounds a year thanks to a republican snub by Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP government. In a move that threatens an explosive cross-border row, Scottish Ministers have signalled they will refuse to contribute to the costs of running the Royal Family. A deal to hand new devolved powers to Scotland after September’s referendum on independence will effectively rob the Royals of more than £2 million in cash a year. Scroll down for video . A republican snub by the Scottish government of Nicola Sturgeon (left)  to contribute to the running costs of the Royal Family will take out over £2million pounds a year from the Queen's (pictured right) Royal purse . The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the SNP is planning to reap the financial benefits of the new deal – while refusing to hand across the money to fund the Monarchy. With the first formal meeting between new First Minister Ms Sturgeon and the Queen just three days away, the move threatens to provoke a major rift between the Scottish Government and the Royal Family. Ms Sturgeon’s calculated snub will also strain the fraught relationship between the governments in London and Edinburgh. Labour said the First Minister’s refusal to pay Scotland’s share for the Royal Family showed the SNP’s ‘narrow’ view of the world, while the Tories accused the nationalists of deliberately trying to ‘undermine’ Scotland’s strong links with the Monarchy. Ms Sturgeon has a history as a strong anti-Royalist, having boycotted a visit by the Queen to the Scottish Parliament in 2003 and also deliberately making her oath of allegiance in the Scottish Parliament to the sovereignty of the people, not the Monarch, when she was elected in 1999. After the SNP lost the referendum on independence in September, David Cameron asked Lord Smith of Kelvin to draw up a list – with cross-party approval – of powers that should be devolved from Westminster to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will take control of the property and land in Scotland, under new powers devolved to them under the Smith Commission report, including sites such as Tobermory on the Isle of Mull (pictured) When the Smith Commission’s report was published last month, it transferred control to the Scottish Parliament of all the Scottish assets of the Crown Estate. This means the Scottish Government will take control of the property and land in Scotland previously owned on behalf of the British state, as well as control of Scotland’s coastline, including mineral and fishing rights and the revenue from offshore wind farms. However, the move also directly affects the Queen’s income, because the Crown Estate plays a vital role in funding the Royal Family. Other assets belonging to the Crown Estate transferred to the Scottish Parliament, which were previously owned on behalf of the British state, include Dowsing offshore wind farm in the North Sea (pictured) The Crown Estate, throughout the whole of the UK, makes about £240 million profit every year. At the moment, these profits are handed to the Treasury. The Royal Family receives a ‘sovereign grant’ equivalent to 15 per cent of the profits. Currently, this agreement means the Royals receive about £36 million a year. The Smith Commission report said the ‘management of the Crown Estate’s economic assets in Scotland and the revenue generated by those assets’ should be transferred to the control of the Scottish Parliament. Scotland will also be given control of its coastline, including mineral and fishing rights, under new powers devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Here an angler fishes for salmon at the River Dee, Aberdeenshire . As a result, the profits of the residual Crown Estate in England and Wales will shrink – as will the 15 per cent share given to the Queen. When the profits from the Crown Estate’s assets in Scotland are taken away, the residual Crown Estate will lose £14 million a year – and the Queen will lose about £2.1 million annually. Instead of going to the Treasury, the cash from Scotland will go straight into Scottish Government coffers. Crucially Lord Smith’s report made it clear that a new deal would have to be put in place to ensure the Queen’s existing funding remained in place. He stated: ‘Responsibility for financing the sovereign grant will need to reflect this revised settlement for the Crown Estate.’ However, Ms Sturgeon has apparently decided that she will not be sending any Scottish Crown Estate money south to make up the shortfall – and expects the Treasury to pick up the tab from general taxation. A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: ‘The level of funding the Queen receives from the Treasury under the sovereign grant is set by reference to 15 per cent of the Crown Estate’s profits and does not come from Crown Estate profits themselves. 'With 71 per cent of taxes paid in Scotland continuing to be controlled by the Treasury, Scotland will continue to make the same contribution to the Monarchy through general taxes.’ Publicly, UK Government Ministers would only say yesterday that they expected the Crown Estate in Scotland to continue to play some part in funding the Royal Family. A spokesman for the Scotland Office said: ‘Officials from the Treasury and Crown Estate will work with the Palace to determine exactly how funding will work in the new Scottish Crown Estate.’ But privately, it is understood that senior Ministers in Downing Street and the Treasury are very unhappy with Ms Sturgeon’s approach. They believe that Ms Sturgeon’s dogmatic and unilateral approach has undermined much of the trust built up through the Smith Commission process. A spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party said: ‘The fact the SNP are saying they’ll make no contribution from their future Crown Estate income illustrates their narrow view of the world. ‘It should make for an interesting conversation when Nicola Sturgeon has her first audience with the Queen next week.’ Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw added: ‘Despite all their assurances about the future of the Monarchy in Scotland, it seems SNP Ministers intend to grab all the income from the Crown Estates at the first opportunity.’ A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said: ‘Implementation of the Smith Commission’s findings, including those related to Crown Estate assets in Scotland, are a matter for the two governments and parliaments.’","Ministers signal they won't contribute to cost of running the Royal Family .

"He may be having a difficult season on the pitch, but on the table Robin van Persie is the master of Manchester United - or at the very least he's  better than Antonio Valencia. The Red Devils teams were in Table Football action against each other during some downtime after training, and it was the Dutchman who came out on top. Van Persie netted for 'match point', before  finishing off his Ecuadorian counterpart just moments later. It was a clinical showing from the 31-year-old, who displayed a level of finishing prowess that's been sorely missing  at times this season in the human-sized version of his game. Van Persie has managed  10 goals in 25 appearances in all competitions so far this campaign, a creditable tally, but one that doesn't quite live up to his recent excellent standards. His opponent Valencia, meanwhile, has failed to find the back of the net in 21 games this season, and hasn't scored for United since they beat Swansea in the Premier League last January. Van Persie missed out through injury as Louis van Gaal's side came from behind to beat Preston 3-1 in the FA Cup on Monday night, but is expected to return for their trip to the Swans on Saturday. It will be a game where United's boss will want  revenge, after Garry Monk's side soured his first competitive game in charge at Old Trafford by winning 2-1 on the opening day of the season.

"AFL star Lance 'Buddy' Franklin has sold his Melbourne home for a generous $1.73 million after settling into Sydney and his new role with the Sydney Swans. The 27-year-old made a profit of $95,000 from the November sale of the four-bedroom house at 55 Hodder Street in Brighton East according to the settlement details revealed this week, Property Observer reports. The former Hawthorn Hawks player purchased the modern two-storey house on a 678 square metre block for $1,635,000 back in 2010, with his recent sale reflecting an annual price gain of under 1.5 per cent. Lance 'Buddy' Franklin has sold his Melbourne home for $1.73 million in November, settlement papers recently revealed . The Sydney Swans star is currently living with his model girlfriend Jesinta Campbell at Bondi in Sydney's east . The 27-year-old made a profit of $95,000 from the November sale of the four-bedroom house . The sale took place prior to a scheduled auction just over a month after hitting the market, Nick Johnstone from Nick Johnstone Real Estate told Daily Mail Australia. Franklin ended his nine-year association with Hawthorn last year when he penned a near $1 million-a-year deal to play for Sydney on a nine-year contract. Although there is no record of any Sydney property purchases under the star's name, he's understood to be living at Bondi in Sydney's east with girlfriend Jesinta Campbell. Franklin has been the driving force behind Sydney's premiership bid this year and polled just four votes shy of a maiden Brownlow Medal. Having already claimed the Coleman Medal and All-Australian selection, Franklin was one of several favourites to win AFL's top prize. A kids' retreat  and resort-style indoor-outdoor living are is centred around a pool . Buddy Franklin has been the driving force behind Sydney's 2014 premiership bid and is one of the club's highest paid players .

Franklin has been the driving force behind Sydney's premiership bid this year and polled just four votes shy of a maiden Brownlow Medal . Mr Johnstone said the property was 'a substantial four-bedroom home with a pool and a theatre room'. Franklin's luxury home is decked out with three generous living zones, four bedrooms and resort-style indoor/outdoor living centred around a pool. It even has its own cinema and a gourmet kitchen with butler's pantry. Mr Johnstone said Franklin originally lived in the house but turned it into a rental property at the end of 2013, when he signed with the Swans and relocated to Sydney. 'He has signed a nine-year contract with the Swans and he's living in Sydney now,' Mr Johnstone said. Born in Perth, Franklin was picked by Hawthorn as the No.5 draft in the 2004 national draft. He played in the 2013 AFL grand final, in which Hawthorn defeated Fremantle, and in Hawthorn's 2008 premiership-winning side against Geelong. Franklin's  move to Sydney was reportedly signed and sealed well before the 2013 grand final win - but was only made public days after. The full-forward expressed his desire to move to Sydney and a deal was stitched up and kept tight lipped during Hawthorn's premiership campaign. An Al fresco kitchen and decking adds to the home's luxury-style living . The plus $1.7 million sale reflects an annual price gain of under 1.5 per cent . There is a dedicated cinema room, a large casual living area and a serene sitting room with pebble gas fireplace . The home has three generous living zones,  four bedrooms and a study . The club kept the deal under wraps for fear that if it was leaked it might disrupt the club's preparations for the flag. His loyal girlfriend of one year, model Jesinta, was by his side to attend the special Sydney Swans Brownlow awards held in Sydney in November. The Swans held their own Sydney-based ceremony so that the players could continue to train ahead of the Saturday's grand final.

"Critique: Fertility expert Lord Robert Winston attacks Tories for allowing MP's promoting homeopathy on health committee . Leading scientist Robert Winston has mounted an outspoken attack on a Tory MP’s ‘lunatic’ support for homeopathy. The celebrated fertility expert and Labour peer said that he ‘could not believe’ that Bosworth MP David Tredinnick was allowed to sit on the Commons Health Committee despite believing in the alternative therapy. Homeopathy operates on the principle that like cures like. Mr Tredinnick – who last year called on the Commons to congratulate a farmer for mixing homeopathic remedies with his flock’s feed – also believes that the moon influences the accident rate, and once charged the taxpayer more than £755 for special astrology software. But in an interview with Total Politics magazine, Lord Winston said: ‘I cannot believe that David Tredinnick is on that committee. 'Let me say firmly: I think his views are lunatic. ‘He is absolutely able to stand for Parliament and to represent a constituency, but views which have no basis in fact... you know it wouldn’t be so different from having an errant racist on an immigration committee. It’s barmy.’ In the interview, Lord Winston also criticises what he describes as MPs’ ‘worrying lack of expertise in life’. Last night, Mr Tredinnick stood by his views. He said: ‘I have a lot of respect for Lord Winston as he has done a lot of good work over the years. ‘But some scientists refuse to accept the principles of homeopathy despite the fact that homeopath doctors have been regulated by an Act of Parliament since 1950. ‘I have used it and I know it works, and it is used across the world.’ Mr Tredinnick has previously defended his views by insisting: ‘I wasn’t sent to Parliament to say what everybody else is saying.’ The British Medical Association has, in the past, derided homeopathy as ‘witchcraft’ . Tory MP Andrew Percy, who also serves on the health committee, rebuked Lord Winston for attacking Mr Tredinnick. 'Lunatic': Conservative MP David Tredinnick, who is on the health committee, advocates homeopathy and also believes that the moon influences the accident rate . He said: ‘Whatever you might think about David’s views on alternative medicine, it’s not for an unelected Labour peer to tell someone who was elected by the voters what they should think.’ Mr Percy described Lord Winston’s language as ‘offensive’, adding: ‘There are a lot of people up and down the country who rely on alternative medicines whether it’s homeopathy or something else.’ It emerged earlier this year that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has ordered a review in the medical effectiveness of homeopathy. He asked the Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies to look at three studies, funded by the homeopathy industry, which found the controversial treatments could help fight disease. But Labour said Mr Hunt should not have wasted NHS time and money on the issue. Sources close to the Health Secretary denied he believed in the practice, while Dame Sally reportedly said none of the studies were robust. A source close to Mr Hunt stressed that the Health Secretary ‘does not believe in homeopathy or support it, but some people want to use it and that’s up to them’.","Lord Robert Winston criticise government's support for homeopathy .

"In the days long before David Beckham was a Manchester United icon, England captain and a global megastar, he was a scrawny, unproven 19-year-old earning four hundred quid a week in the Third Division. Back in February 1995, Sir Alex Ferguson decided the teenager, who had just one first-team outing under his belt, needed to prove his mettle in a man's game. So the young Becks was loaned out to Preston North End for a month to gain the necessary experience and show what he could do with that magic right foot. David Beckham's contract for his loan spell at Preston North End in February and March 1995. The Manchester United teenager was sent to Deepdale to gain experience and earned £400 a week . Beckham, then 19, shows off those famous ball control skills upon arrival at Preston in February 1995 . Beckham pictured at a UNICEF press conference in London this week . And, co-inciding with United's FA Cup fifth round tie at Deepdale this week, the precise details of Beckham's spell there have been revealed. Paul Bradley, Preston's stadium manager, said Beckham's loan contract is still hanging on the wall of his office at the ground and is a rather unique souvenir of where it all began for the world famous player. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'David Beckham played down here on loan and I have his contract on my office wall. I was told to get rid of it by a former chairman, but I was sensible enough to keep it.' The official Football Association document shows that Beckham will play for Preston between February 28 and March 27, 1995 and will be paid the princely sum of £400 a week. Beckham went on to win pretty much every major trophy in the game, including the Champions League in 1999 . Beckham played 115 times for England, many as captain, and scored 17 goals for his country . Becks also won the Premier League title on six occasions with Manchester United . But Becks was also in line to receive an additional £50 for every first team appearance made, plus all his accommodation costs and expenses were to be covered. In the end, he played in five league fixtures and scored twice, both in spectacular circumstances. One was directly from a corner and the other was one of those trademark free-kicks. After a month, he returned to Old Trafford, broke into the first team and, well, the rest is history. But to think that Beckham didn't fancy the idea of a loan move. 'I was shocked,' he wrote wrote in his autobiography My World. 'I thought it was a sign that the club was trying to get rid of a player.' It took some reassurance from Ferguson to persuade Beckham that the temporary change of scene would forward his career. How right he was.","David Beckham spent a month on loan at Preston North End in 1995 .

"Working mothers who are earning six-figure salaries may be denied access to the Abbott government's much-vaunted paid parental leave (PPL) scheme as it looks to review the policy over the summer. The revelation comes as a new poll shows the Coalition continues to trail behind the Opposition on a two-party preferred basis. On Sunday, Mr Abbott fronted media after mounting speculation he would dump the policy that would see women earning up to $150,000 receiving six months' pay - a scheme he touted in the lead up to last year's election. Scroll down for video . Working mothers will reportedly be denied access to the Abbott government's paid parental leave scheme . Mr Abbott said in the coming months he and his colleagues would be looking at the Productivity Commission's report into childcare to deliver a more 'holistic' scheme. 'We will be better targeting our parental leave scheme so that we can not only deliver [one] that really helps out families but we can deliver a more available and more affordable childcare,' he told reporters. Mr Abbott would not be drawn into a discussion about whether or not there would be an adjustment to the threshold for the scheme but did say it would still include superannuation and advantage small business who will benefit for the first time from a policy like this. 'This is our time to get it right, this is our time to do the right thing by the families of Australia and to do it in a way which is fair, which is reasonable, and particularly helps small business,' he said. Tony Abbott is so keen to get his paid parental leave scheme into law he's bowed to voter pressure and is working on a plan that will deny it to women earning more than $150,000 a year . The government's proposed scheme provides working mums with six months leave on full pay and super . As it stands right now, Mr Abbott's scheme - which is to be funded by a 1.5 per cent impost on big business - would see the current payout cap of $50,000 lowered, a new means test and the redirection of money to childcare. This means those who use carers working in the family home, such as nannies and family daycare workers, would be eligible for the 50 per cent rebate. 'More affordable childcare helps with the cost of living; and flexibility and accessibility in the system will make life so much easier for many families,' Mr Abbott told the Sunday Telegraph on Saturday. Recommendations from the Productivity Commission to redirect funds from the PPL into childcare are believed to be behind the prime minister's change of heart - together with the need to win over a hostile Senate. The existing parental leave scheme, introduced by Labor, offers 18 weeks pay at minimum wage and does not include superannuation. The government's proposed scheme provides working mothers with six months leave on full pay and includes super. Prime minister believes the combination of PPL and affordable childcare could get more women into workforce . The policy back flip comes as a new Galaxy poll shows the Coalition has experienced a four-point drop in popularity since October, the Sunday Telegraph reported. Labor is ten points ahead of the government based on a two-party preferred basis on 55 per cent. It comes more than a week after Health Minister Peter Dutton confirmed the government was abandoning another key budget policy, the $7 general practitioner co-payment. Last Friday, Mr Dutton told the ABC the government was looking at 'different options', but he would not say what these were. He added: 'We are determined to send a price signal to make Medicare sustainable.' But it is not just opposition from rival parties that the government faces in relation to the controversial co-payment. It has also been criticised by Coalition backbenchers. Queensland senator Ian McDonald previously said he would not throw his support behind the policy. 'I don't think this scheme is the right way to go and I have advised both Mr Dutton and Mr Abbott about that and indicated that if this proposal comes forward I would be opposing it,' he said.","Working mothers will reportedly be denied access to paid parental leave .

"An American photographer held hostage by Syrian rebels for seven months has told of his horrors in dealing with the FBI after he managed to escape. Still recovering: Matthew Schrier, 36, was held by Syrian rebels with al-Qaeda links for seven months . Matthew Schrier, from Syosset, New York, was captured by Jabhat al-Nusra, a militant group aligned with al-Qaeda, as he traveled in Syria in December 2012. He was taken to a compound near Aleppo and locked up before escaping from a gap in a basement window on July 29 last year, he said. Now the 36-year-old has revealed the shocking treatment he suffered by during and after his ordeal because of the FBI - including being forced to reimburse the State Department the $1,605 they paid for Schrier's flight home. In a new interview with McClatchy DC, Schrier said the FBI waited six months to contact his family to let them know he had been captured. He previously said that the rebels had emailed his parents pretending to be him and assuring them he was fine. With his parents none the wiser, Schrier's captors were able to drain his bank account of $17,000. The next time the FBI calls me will be the first time,' said Schrier's father, Jeffrey, outside Fort Lauderdale, Florida, told McClatchy. 'I thank God my son was able to escape, because if he was waiting for the government to spring him he would still be waiting in that hellhole.' Once Schrier was back in the US, it was a matter of weeks before he recieved the bill for his airfare. He says that a psychiatrist assigned to help him with the experience and his return cancelled five times in the first two months. He was put up in a hotel for one month after his return, but after that time the FBI suggested he go to a homeless shelter. Held: Schrier says that he was beaten, electrocuted and robbed by the rebels after they kidnapped him in December 2012. He since claims to have been treated terribly by the FBI . Locked up: The compound where Schier was kept was near Aleppo, where a Free Syrian Army fighter is pictured above . Schrier waited five months to receive a new ID and Social Security number, after his cards were stolen, copied and used multiple times. 'It is like a scam. I don't understand what they do, victims services,' Schrier told McClatchy. 'The FBI has made it impossible for me to recover.' Before he fled, Schrier said he was beaten with a metal cable across his feet and given electrical shocks. Schrier was one of several Westerners in rebel-held territory since the civil war began. He said he was traveling without a commission from a media organization and had attempted to leave Aleppo by taxi on December 31. But the vehicle was stopped and he was taken by the rebels. Schrier was also whipped with cable on the soles of his feet while his knees were wedged in a car tire, and he was questioned by men speaking fluent English whom he guessed were Canadian. Schrier's mother grew worried about getting no word from her son and reported him missing to the State Department on January 31 - exactly one month after he was taken. Alone: The New York man was working as a freelance photographer when he was taken on December 31, 2012 . Schrier's mother did not realize at first that he was just one of several Americans being held hostage in Syria, McClatchy reported. Upon learning of it, she discovered there were missing-persons posters for other hostages but not one for her son. Schrier said when she contacted the FBI to asked why this was, they quickly put a poster up online. Schrier eventually slipped from a gap in a basement window early on July 29, he said, leaving behind his cellmate. Schrier said he was able to stand on his cellmate's back and unravel a wire mesh covering a window. Just before dawn, he wriggled out but the cellmate got stuck. Schrier said he walked to a road and flagged a car. Rebels: Schrier was held by Jabhat al-Nusra; a member is seen riding a motorcycle in Deir al-ZorRead . He was able to get a ride to the Turkey border, where he was helped by American officials. The White House told McClatchy that they would not comment on Schrier's new claims. The FBI released a statement over the interview. 'When an American is detained illegally overseas, the FBI's top priority is ensuring the safe return of that individual,' the statement said. 'To that end the FBI provides support services to victims and their families, to include help in meeting short-term exigent needs, and shares information about their loved ones that is timely and appropriate.' Earlier this month the Obama administration said it was reviewing the way government agencies handle hostages and their families after three American hostages were beheaded in Syria.","Matthew Schrier was working as a freelance photographer when he was captured by al-Qaeda-linked rebels last December 2012 .

"Two points dropped at home to relegation threatened Burnley and midfield keystone Nemanja Matic banned for three games and, surprise, surprise, it is all down to the decisions which went against Chelsea. 'Minute 30, minute 33, minute 43 and minute 69,' was pretty much all Jose Mourinho wanted to say after the game, pointing everyone towards incidents which might have twice produced a red card for Ashley Barnes and twice earned the home team a penalty. He had a point. Barnes was certainly fortunate to get away with the tackle on Matic, which sparked a retaliatory shove which earned the Serb a red card which will rule him out of the Capital One Cup final and Barclays Premier League games against West Ham and Southampton. Ben Mee rises above the Chelsea defence to equalise for Burnley against Premier League leaders Chelsea at Stamford Bridge . Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois can only watch in vain as Mee's header beats the Belgium international . Mee wheels away in celebration after finding the target with a header to level proceedings at Stamford bridge with 10 minutes left . Jose Mourinho tried to keep it cryptic at his post-match press conference, but you didn’t need to be a super sleuth to work out the four incidents that had so enraged the Chelsea manager. So let us enlighten you on the flashpoints... 30 minutes — Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up in anger when he realises no action is being taken. Verdict: Should have been a free-kick and could have been a yellow card. for Barnes. 33 minutes — Ivanovic fires a shot at goal but Michael Kightly diverts it with an outstretched arm, as he turns his back to goal. Martin Atkinson waves play on. Verdict: Should have been a Chelsea penalty. 43 minutes — Diego Costa tumbles to the ground after Burnley captain Jason Shackell leans into him with an oustretched arm. Atkinson waves play on. Verdict: Could have been a Chelsea penalty but would have been very soft. 69 minutes — Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic’s left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over violently. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand. Verdict:Shocking tackle merited a red card for Barnes and a Chelsea free-kick. With his side leading the Chelsea midfielder is given his marching orders from referee Martin Atkinson in the 70th minute of the match . Barnes also got away with a first-half challenge on the airborne Branislav Ivanovic, which might have been punished but wasn't with anything more than a free-kick to Chelsea. The penalty claims might have gone Mourinho's way on another day but still his team must shoulder the blame. They cannot hide behind the campaign imagined by their manager. Chelsea were rattled by the loss of Matic, 11 minutes from time, and appeared to be still seething at the injustice of it all when Barnes was allowed to turn, in Matic territory, on the edge of the penalty area, and unleash a low drive which was turned wide by Thibaut Courtois. From the corner, taken as Gary Cahill was prepared to come on as a substitute, Ben Mee climbed above Ramires to head Kieran Trippier's cross into the net and equalise. If the referee lost his focus and made mistakes, then so did Mourinho's players. Cahill returned to the bench and Didier Drogba came on instead. The flash of temper from Matic was most out of character and understandable when you see replays of the high challenge by Barnes, well above the ankle, but he must know you cannot react by sprinting 10 yards and throwing him to the floor. Ivanovic, still aggrieved from his skirmish with Barnes, could not help getting involved and was booked for trying to stop Martin Atkinson brandishing his red card. Chelsea (4-2-3-1): Courtois 6; Ivanovic 6.5, Zouma 6, Terry 6.5, Luis 6 (Drogba 85); Fabregas 5.5, Matic 6; Cuadrado 6.5 (Willian 63, 5), Oscar 5 (Ramires 72, 6), Hazard 8; Costa 5 .

Courtois smashes his hand against the crossbar in frustration after Chelsea throw away their lead against Burnley . Nemanja Matic reacts to a challenge from Ashley Barnes which earns him a straight red card in the 70th minute . John Terry seemed to be the coolest head. If there were others, Chelsea might have defended their 1-0 lead and would not be lamenting Burnley's fighting spirit and two lost points. And to think it had all started so well for Chelsea. Five days after his vital 'away goal' in Paris, Ivanovic struck with a goal made by Eden Hazard, and featuring Juan Cuadrado, the Colombian making only his second start but who seems to have struck an instant chemistry with those around him. Cuadrado forced an early save from Tom Heaton with a header and his pass launched Hazard into the penalty box, where the Belgian jinked to his right, skipped past three defenders, had the vision to spot Ivanovic and cut a cross short to his feet. Matic is given his marching orders by referee Martin Atkinson and is now set to miss the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham . John Terry and Kurt Zouma restrain a furious Matic after he shown the red card for reacting to Ashley Barnes' horror tackle . Perhaps Mourinho's complaints about the tackles Hazard has been enduring had an effect on Burnley's defenders as they failed to get close to him. Ivanovic tucked the chance away at the near post, his third goal of the month, his sixth of the season and his 31st for the club. Not bad for a defender, although there have been times this season when the thundering right-back is more of an attacker. He was on the rampage once again before half-time to unleash a fierce drive which crashed into Michael Kightly's arm as the Burnley winger turned his back on the ball. This was the first of Mourinho's phantom penalties. On another day it would have been given. Kightly's arm was extended away from his body and the ball had travelled some distance towards him, albeit at incredible speed. Ivanovic was unimpressed, especially as this was only three minutes after he had been booted from behind by Barnes. The other phantom penalty came two minutes before half-time when Jason Shackell seemed to give Diego Costa a nudge from behind as the striker wriggled free. Costa exaggerated his tumble to the turf and was appalled when referee Martin Atkinson played on. Branislav Ivanovic turns the ball past Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton to give Chelsea the lead at Stamford Bridge . Costa and Atkinson have history from the first leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final at Liverpool. Heaton saved from Oscar soon after conceding, but the visitors readjusted and there were flashes of encouragement for Sean Dyche before half-time, underlining how far his team have come since they were swept away by Chelsea at Turf Moor on the opening day of the campaign. Barnes caught a volley sweetly from the edge of the penalty box but it was too near the goalkeeper, Shackell headed over when free at a corner. Courtois beat away a deflected effort from Barnes after the break, but Chelsea slowly regained control, creating a cluster of second-half chances with Hazard influential. Matic almost smuggled in a second from a messy corner and Costa released by Hazard had a left-footer saved. Chelsea's top scorer then beat the ground with his fist as he came within inches of reaching crosses from either full-back. Then the red card rocked the home team. Without Matic, they are not the same team, losing the midfield balance, which will concern Mourinho as he looks at the next three games. Matic's dismissal is unlikely to be overturned as Barnes' provocation is not sufficient enough as a defence. The Burnley forward however could face an FA charge for his part in the incident. Mee levelled from the corner to earn the point Dyche thought his battling team deserved, and they might have had more. As Chelsea pressed forward in search of a late winner, Danny Ings broke clear in the fourth minute of stoppage time and almost won it for Burnley.

"New Delhi played host to a mass marriage ceremony today at a local temple in the old quarters. Twelve brides and grooms from impoverished families gathered together to tie the knot in a joint ceremony organised by social groups to help those who aren't able to afford the traditionally lavish marriage events. If undertaken on their own, such an event could set each family back hundreds of thousands of Indian rupees. A female relative congratulates a bride as she sits with other women waiting for their grooms to arrive at a mass wedding in New Delhi . Indian couples perform colourful rituals during the mass ceremony which featured 12 couples from underprivileged backgrounds . A groom arrives with this eyes masked. In India the groom’s face is kept hidden before the wedding to protect him from the evil eye . Photo call: Eleven of the couples who took part in the marriage ceremony line up on steps to have their photograph taken . Group weddings are not uncommon and a sensible economic decision in many cases to dramatically reduce the cost for the venue, decorations and officiants. Even the celebrations afterwards are a collective affair. Three years ago India had a collective wedding ceremony involving 3,600 couples - many the children of poor farmers - including Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Muslims and Adivasi.

Indian brides and grooms festooned with jewels wait during a mass-marriage ceremony at a local temple in the old quarters of New Delhi . A couple eats a meal before the formal ceremony. The groom has a garland of paper money strung around his neck, usually a customary gift . Brides arrive for the marriage ceremony together in full regalia. Indian brides traditionally wear auspicious colours, nose rings and bangles . A Hindu  wedding ceremony is called vivaah sanskar. Ceremonies are colourful affairs and celebrations may extend for several days . In the past aid groups in the country has organised weddings for nomadic tribeswoman to prevent them from becoming prostitutes. Officials in India are well aware of the pressure placed on poor families to put on garish ceremonies and meet spiralling dowry demands. Even taxi drivers, who earn a relatively meagre salary, can spend as much as £10,000 on their family wedding. The brides wait to welcome their grooms before the ceremony. Ceremonies, rituals and formalities differ between regions and cultures . Local customs says that new brides are forbidden from doing any housework as long as the colour of the bridal mehndi remains on her hands . Brides wear a saree or a lehenga (depending on the region in India) and red is considered to be the most auspicious colour in among Hindus . Relatives of a groom dance as the Barat or marriage procession passes through a street before the event gets underway . Indian brides apply henna or mehndi to her hands and feet before the wedding. The belief is that the deeper the final colour the more she will be loved by her husband or, some say, her mother‐in‐law . Earlier this month saw the government consider new means to curb how much low income groups can spend on the big day, including food and gifts. Recommendations on restrictions on spending came from India’s Dowry Prevention Act. The recommendations followed a UN report identifying India as one of the world’s most dangerous place to be born a girl. An Indian couple performs rituals inside a temple during the marriage event. At the end of the ceremony a groom will  sprinkle red powder (kumkum) in a parting in the bride's hair. This, and a red bindi, signifies a married woman.

"David de Gea is closing in on a new long-term Manchester United contract after Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti made clear he is happy with his goalkeeping options. Real have been closely monitoring De Gea's progress at Old Trafford, his outstanding displays for Louis van Gaal's side alerting the Spanish giants. United have made clear their intention to sign the keeper to an improved contract, but Madrid's interest had created a potentially alarming stumbling block towards fresh terms. Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea has less than 18 months left on his Old Trafford contract . Legendary keeper Peter Schmeichel recognises the importance of getting De Gea to sign on at United . However, Ancelotti has informed intermediaries he is happy with Iker Casillas and Keylor Navas and that a move for De Gea is now not a priority for Real. The news comes as a huge boost to United's hopes of extending the 24-year-old's contract, which currently expires at the end of next season. Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel says a new contract for De Gea would send an important message as the Old Trafford club look to get back to the top. De Gea makes yet another of the string of brilliant saves he has produced in the Premier League this season . Schmeichel, who won five Premier League titles, three FA Cups and one Champions League title with United, says the club must tie the stopper down to show their rivals at home and abroad that they mean business after a difficult 18 months following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. 'It's very important the club's best players sign new contracts to send a signal,' Schmeichel told Sky Sports. 'It shows that they believe in the Manchester United project and believe the club will go back not only to the top of the Premier League but also European football.'","Real Madrid have been monitoring David de Gea's progress .

"Detectives are investigating claims that former Conservative Home Secretary William Whitelaw ordered police to drop an investigation into a VIP paedophile ring. Whitelaw allegedly told a senior Metropolitan Police boss to quash a year-long investigation into a gang accused of abusing 40 children, the youngest of whom was six. The alleged intervention came in 1980 after a newspaper revealed the country’s chief prosecutor was considering 350 offences against the gang, including allegations it ‘obtained young boys for politicians, prominent lawyers and film stars’. Scroll down for video . Whitelaw pictured with Margaret Thatcher in 1964. A journalist has now claimed Whitelaw told a Metropolitan Police boss in 1980 to quash a year-long investigation into a gang accused of abusing 40 children . The report, published on July 7 that year in the Evening News – a daily London newspaper – revealed police had passed evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and that up to 12 men could face trial for procuring boys and sexual assault. Jeff Edwards, the journalist who wrote the story, claims that just days after it was published he was summoned by police to an interview and threatened with prosecution under the Official Secrets Act. Mr Edwards also claims his source, a serving police officer, was disciplined and fined six months’ wages for leaking the story. He also says he was told by his police source that Whitelaw called a senior police boss and told him to halt the inquiry. Mr Edwards said: ‘My source told me the Home Secretary had spoken to a senior Met Police boss and demanded action was taken to make sure nothing more was printed about the affair and that the investigation be dropped.’ The Mail on Sunday can reveal Mr Edwards has spoken to senior detectives working on the Met’s Operation Midland about the incident, but the Met would not confirm this. Midland was set up last month to investigate sensational claims that boys were murdered and abused by Conservative politicians at parties held in Dolphin Square, an upmarket block of flats close to Westminster popular with MPs, in the 1980s. Mr Edwards said he had been invited to give a statement to detectives in the next few weeks and hopes to give evidence to the upcoming Home Office inquiry into historic sexual abuse. Last night, campaigning MP Simon Danczuk described the allegations as ‘a breakthrough’ in the Westminster child abuse scandal and suggested it was strong evidence there was a paedophile network operating at the heart of the Establishment. The article, unearthed by The Mail on Sunday from newspaper archives, provides a fresh line of inquiry for police probing claims a paedophile network with links to Westminster. Reporter Jeff Edwards (pictured) was threatened with prosecution under the Official Secrets Act after he wrote a story about the 1980 investigation . It revealed six officers in a special unit were conducting the operation from Arbour Square police station in East London. Police had taken statements from 40 youngsters, it said, and established the gang had links between London and Liverpool. It said 12 children in Liverpool from schools for the ‘educationally subnormal’ had given police information. Mr Edwards told The Mail on Sunday his police contact, an experienced detective sergeant who was part of the Arbour Square team, told him when the story broke it ‘caused an eruption at the top in Scotland Yard’. ‘My friend told me the anti-corruption squad, then known as A10, had been told to carry out an urgent investigation about how this matter had got in the press,’ he said. ‘He told me he had been threatened with demotion. Within a day or two I was summoned to the anti-corruption branch HQ at Tintagel House in Vauxhall [South London]. At the end of the interview, which went on for two hours, I was told I could be in breach of the Official Secrets Act and the matter would be formally reported to the DPP to consider whether I should be prosecuted.’ Mr Edwards, who is president of the Crime Reporters Association and was chief crime correspondent on The Mirror, said he heard nothing more from police or the DPP. The Mail on Sunday asked Scotland Yard whether Mr Edwards’s police source, who is now in his 80s and in a care home, was disciplined. It refused to answer questions and claimed it was ‘unable to pursue such historical inquiries’. The Crown Prosecution Service said there was not enough information in Mr Edwards’s article to search DPP records. Viscount Whitelaw, who was Deputy Prime Minister in Margaret Thatcher’s government from 1979 to 1988, died in 1999. Mr Edwards’s claims come amid a flurry of allegations politicians were involved in a VIP paedophile ring. Operation Midland was started after a man came forward to say he witnessed a Tory MP murder a boy at a party. The man also claimed that a different Tory MP watched as a boy was sexually abused. The Met’s Operation Fernbridge is looking into claims that politicians, lawyers and pop stars abused children at the Elm Guest House in Barnes, South-West London, in the 1980s. Police have confirmed disgraced former Liberal Democrat MP Sir Cyril Smith was a visitor and this year The Mail on Sunday interviewed a boy he abused. Last night, Mr Danczuk said: ‘This is the strongest evidence yet that there was a paedophile network operating at the heart of the Establishment. The fact we now know hundreds of child abuse offences linked to politicians and other prominent people were being examined by the DPP is a breakthrough. ‘That Cabinet Ministers and police helped shut this investigation down through collusion and cover-up is something the Government’s child sex abuse inquiry must look at.’","Detectives investigating claim that Whitelaw ordered police to drop inquiry .

"Diego Costa is determined to maintain the physical style which made him one of Europe's most feared centre-forwards but he admits the memory of Emre Can and the three-match ban is playing on his mind. Costa agrees with Jose Mourinho, who claimed his 17-goal top-scorer was off the pace due to the suspension imposed retrospectively by the Football Association for the stamp on Liverpool's Can. Chelsea's Spain international striker is without a goal since mid-January and without a cup goal this season as he prepares for his first Wembley appearance, in the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Diego Costa is defiant that he will not change his physical approach despite falling foul of referees . The Chelsea striker was handed a retrospective three-game ban for stamping on Liverpool's Emre Can . Costa has already picked up 10 cautions in all competitions during his debut season at Stamford Bridge . Costa and Martin Skrtel go head to head during Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final defeat of Liverpool . 'When I was at my best, I had that suspension and I still don't know why it happened,' said Costa. 'I'm running a little bit behind, trying to do my best, working hard and hopefully I'll be 100 per cent. 'The truth is I didn't even know how many games it was since I scored. It doesn't worry me. What worries me is to be in the best physical form to score goals. 'I know now that I have to be a little bit more careful, because it's not the same when I do something as it is when someone else does it. 'Something I do is talked about much more than another player. I have to be extra careful but I'm never going to change the way I play. That's what got me here. That's the way I play.' Tottenham's former Sevilla centre half Federico Fazio understands the aggressive nature of Costa's game. The pair clashed in Spain and will meet again at Wembley. 'I don't have a problem with any defenders,' said the Chelsea striker. 'I've always played against great defenders. Fazio is great. It's going to be a very good duel and I'm hoping to be on the winning side.' Costa agrees with manager Jose Mourinho that he is yet to find his best form following suspension . The Spain international has not scored since netting a brace against Swansea on January 17 . The Brazil-born striker slams the ground after being denied a penalty in the controversial draw with Burnley . Costa will resume his rivalry with Federico Fazio when Chelsea face Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final . Spurs won 5-3 when the teams met at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day, although Costa preferred to recall a 3-0 Chelsea win from earlier in the season at Stamford Bridge. 'There's no revenge or anything like that, just a final and we want to win,' Costa said. 'It's an important game whatever way you look at it. Never mind the opposition. We all know we have the quality to win. 'What gives it more importance is it's my first final at the club. So I will go in with the mentality and have the motivation to come away with the trophy. It's a historic stadium which has hosted games and players of great prestige. It's going to be my first game there and I'm hoping to do my best. It's important to play on great stages like this. 'I joined a club like Chelsea to win titles. As we say, finals are not to play them, they are to win them. I'm hoping I can get my first title with Chelsea. It will be a beautiful experience.' His last final did not go to plan. Atletico were beaten 4-1 after extra time by Real Madrid in the Champions League final in Lisbon and Costa limped off in the ninth minute with a recurrence of a hamstring problem. Harry Kane scores as Tottenham pulled off a shock 5-3 victory in their last match with Chelsea . Didier Drogba celebrates scoring against Tottenham in the 3-0 win at Stamford Bridge . Costa's last appearance in a  final saw him hobble off after nine minutes into the 2014 Champions League final . Chelsea, however, will have their lucky Wembley mascot in the squad. Didier Drogba is expected to start on the bench but he has an incredible record at the national stadium, with eight goals since it reopened. His only Wembley defeat was against Spurs in the League Cup final, in 2008. He is Chelsea's all-time leading scorer in major cup finals, with nine goals. 'We all know who I lost against, aarrgghh,' groaned Drogba. 'It was a difficult one to take because I had just returned from the Africa Cup of Nations and it was only my second game back. But Wembley has been good to me. That's the way I prefer to describe it. 'I have had lots of good days at Wembley, so many good memories. It is not easy to pick one goal or one match. Maybe I would say my free-kick against Portsmouth (in the 2010 FA Cup final victory) because we had so many chances but did not score until that went in.'

Dimitar Berbatov celebrates scoring as Tottenham beat Chelsea 2-1 on the last time the two met in the League Cup final in 2008 . Drogba won the FA Cup on his last Wembley appearance in 2012, having beaten Spurs in the semi-final. He is back after two years in China and Turkey and is learning the art of the cameo substitute, having started nine and come on in 21 games this season. 'Even if you do not start it is hard to lose a final because you are part of the team,' said the Ivorian. 'Just put me there on the pitch and you'll see what it means to me. Even if I'm on the pitch for two minutes, I will try to do it. This season has been quite a new experience for me and I'm trying to adapt. My body is not used to making a difference in a short space of time. But if I can bring some luck to the team, then why not?'","Chelsea face Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday .

"The traditional Christmas tree, bristling with pine needles and heavy with baubles, is coming under threat from a new demand for slimmed-down ‘size zero’ models made from little more than twigs. British families are increasingly decorating their living rooms with the stark, minimalist designs in a trend said to be inspired by bleak TV ‘Scandi-dramas’ such as The Killing and Borgen. Traditional pines such as the Norway Spruce are being challenged by the fake, leafless wintry skeletons, which tend to come adorned with twinkling LED lights, leaving no room for tinsel, crackers or an angel on the top. Scroll down for video . M&S range: This minimalist design being sold in Marks & Spencer fits in with the new 'size zero' tree trend . TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp, known for her love of chintz, will tackle the new Nordic trend in her Channel 4 show Kirstie’s Handmade Christmas on Tuesday. She somewhat reluctantly confirmed to The Mail on Sunday that the ‘Christmas twig’ will be big this year. ‘There’s a lot of naked trees this year; it’s definitely a trend,’ she said. ‘It’s more confident, more alternative and design-led. It’s not just a case of putting up a tree, shoving some tinsel on it and putting up some decorations. ‘If you’re having a minimalist twig thing then you put very small, very delicate decorations on it. One of the reasons the Scandinavian decorations look so beautiful is because they’re so understated. Those “Scandi” trees do work with just a few decorations.’ Skeleton trees: Both leafless Christmas tree designs are being sold by retailers John Lewis this year . Scandinavian design is traditionally minimal, functional and simple. David Mitchell, the Christmas tree expert for Wyevale garden centres, also spotted the trend, saying: ‘The Ikea generation like clean lines. That’s coming through with Christmas trees as well.’ Major retailers including Tesco, Marks & Spencer, Next, B&Q and Argos are all selling several types of artificial twig tree, as our pictures show. Influence: TV ‘Scandi-dramas’ such as The Killing and Borgen, where minimalist Scandinavian style is on show, are thought to be encouraging the sale of these fake trees. Left, Tesco tree and right, range from Next . John Lewis has no fewer than 16 on offer as part of its ‘Copenhagen’ Christmas range. Its pre-lit paper birch tree, the 8ft version of which costs an eye-watering £125, is a bestseller, according to a spokesman. The store is also selling pine scent sticks, so customers don’t miss out on the aroma. Ms Allsopp admitted a twig tree would not be taking centre stage in her household this Christmas. ‘There’d be a bit of a mutiny if we didn’t have something huge and bushy and glittery,’ the 43-year-old said. ‘But there’s nothing sad about a twig. You can do all sorts of things with them. I wouldn’t have a fake one, though. There’s no need.’","More British families are now decorating  with stark, minimalist designs .

"Police have launched a murder investigation after a teenager was stabbed to death on an east London street. The 15-year-old boy was walking with friends along Bethnal Green Road in Tower Hamlets, when he was attacked last night at around 11pm. He was left with serious stab wounds to his stomach and was taken by ambulance to an east London hospital in a critical condition. Officers from the Metropolitan Police scour the scene close to where the 15-year-old boy was stabbed to death on Bethnal Green Road in Tower Hamlets .

"Monday night's grand jury decision to not indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson over the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, led to riots in the Missouri city. Although Michael Brown's family, President Barack Obama, and authorities called for peaceful protests, the Ferguson was soon out of control. The riots saw a return to the looting, fires and property damages which took place on a smaller scale in August, immediately after the shooting of Brown. Scroll down for video . Damage done: Two buildings still smoulder after the riots that ravaged Ferguson, Missouri overnight . Before: A satellite image taken by Google in September 2012 show the buildings intact . As the sun rose on Tuesday, the cityscape of Ferguson looked worlds away from satellite and Google Street View snaps taken just months earlier. Pictures from yesterday in comparison with images from before, tracked down byThe Wall Street Journal, show the damage done. Last night, tens of thousands of people in more than 170 cities across America - including Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles, among others - were demonstrating against the long-awaited verdict. However, despite the St. Louis grand jury decision, federal investigations into the shooting of Michael Brown continue the US Attorney General said on Monday. The Justice Department will continue to pursue two investigations, one into potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson when he shot dead  unarmed Brown in August this year, and one into the practices of the Ferguson Police force.

Distraught: The manager of the Little Caesar's said he understood the protesters were angry but added: 'Speaking your mind - that’s America. You are supposed to be able to protest peacefully and make your point. But this...' More destruction: The arson frenzy also hit South Florissant Street, about a mile away. This branch of Little Casear's was burned out . Et tu: The neighboring antique shop to the Little Caesar's was also destroyed in the orgy of violence which hit Ferguson . Long way back: A woman stops to take a picture using her phone of the damage done . Still intact: The local Clean World Laundromat was still standing on Monday morning . Residents on the streets told MailOnline that the wreckage to Ferguson was so bad that it looked like ‘Ferganistan’. Another said that it ‘looked like Iraq’. Almost every building along South Florissant Street, where the Ferguson police station is located, had been ransacked or vandalised. Tony Koenig and his brother Ray, 38 and 40, had taken the day off from working as school groundskeepers to help rebuild a Mexican restaurant run by a friend. Tony said: ‘I have lived in Ferguson for 38 years and I have never seen anything like this. They just want street justice and they don’t care about how they get it. ‘This young generation. I cannot understand why they do what they do. The parents are to blame. When me and my brother grew up both our parents worked and we were raised knowing how to show respect, and that doesn’t happen these days. ‘We’ve had a hard enough time paying our mortgages after the economy went down. We don’t need this’. Their friend Drew Canaday, who was also helping them, lives in the street next to South Florissant and said that it was ‘like a war’ the night before.

Today property manager Terri Willits witnessed the destruction . Crime scene: Much of West Florissant was under police guard today and described by officers as an active crime scene . He said: ‘These young people are so used to instant gratification, they want stuff now. They are too immature to understand that stuff takes time. ‘Especially something this big. It takes dialogue and not everyone will be happy but that’s compromise. ‘These people don’t want to wait. That what today’s society has come to, not just here in Ferguson - this is America, this is the world.’ Further up South Florissant a Little Caesar’s pizza restaurant had been burned to the ground, as had the antiques store next to it. The manager of the restaurant, who declined to give his name for fear of reprisals, said that 12 people had now been put out of work and did not know if the owners would rebuild. The manager said that the store was destroyed by a tornado three years earlier and they did build it back but it cost ‘a lot of money’. He said: ‘Most of the people here have families and they are very worried about what will come next for them. ‘I’m proud to work here and started as the dishwasher and worked my way up. I had a motorcycle accident and had my foot amputated and they were good enough to give me a job, . The manger, a widower with two children in their 20s, said that he was in principle on the side of the protesters but that this was ‘too far’.

"There's nothing like the presence of some Nazis to ruin a perfectly good party. On Tuesday night, the comedian Russell Brand was thrown out of GQ magazine’s Men of the Year Awards after-show for making jibes about the event’s sponsor, Hugo Boss, and the fashion company’s historic links to the Nazi party. While on stage, Brand told the gathered celebrities and politicians, ‘If anyone knows a bit about history and fashion, you know it was Hugo Boss who made uniforms for the Nazis.’ He then added, with less than subtle irony, ‘But they looked f***ing fantastic, let’s face it, while they were killing people on the basis of their religion and sexuality.’ But it has emerged that Brand himself is not averse to a spot of the designer's sharp tailoring - having apparently been snapped wearing a jacket by the German fashion firm in February. Scroll down for video of Brand's on-stage comments . It has emerged that Brand himself is not averse to a spot of the Hugo Boss's sharp tailoring - having apparently been snapped wearing a jacket by the German fashion firm in February . Dark past: The firm founded by Hugo Boss made uniforms for the Nazi Party . Shortly afterwards, Brand was kicked out by the magazine’s editor, Dylan Jones. According to the comedian’s Twitter feed, the two men exchanged angry words, with Jones saying, ‘What you did was very offensive to Hugo Boss.’ Brand replied, ‘What Hugo Boss did was very offensive to the Jews.’ Although Hugo Boss has made no public comment, its executives are doubtless furious, not least because the £250,000 spent sponsoring the event seems to have bought nothing but another round of bad publicity about the company’s past. Of course, Brand’s claim is not new — such stories about the fashion label’s murky past have been doing the rounds for years. Hugo Boss. After the war he was punished as a Nazi supporter. He died in 1948 . But the connection between Hugo Boss and the Nazis has been peddled so often, and with so many variations, that the true story is almost completely obscured. Brand’s outburst this week provides  a perfect opportunity to set the  record straight. The first myth to torpedo is that Hugo Boss designed the smart black uniforms for the dreaded SS. Although it is tempting to suppose that the evil glamour of these outfits must have been the product of a fashion designer, there is no truth to it at all. In fact, the uniforms evolved from earlier Prussian styles. The designs continued to evolve with modifications from the foundation of the SS in 1925 to its disintegration two decades later. The infamous black uniform itself came into being in 1932 and is said to have been designed by an artist and senior SS officer called Karl Diebitsch, who worked with a graphic designer called Walter Heck. Neither man worked for Hugo Boss. So, if Russell Brand was implying, as I infer from his remarks, that Hugo Boss created the Nazi uniforms, he is plain wrong. Perhaps Brand meant that Boss simply manufactured them. In which case he’s right. But there’s more to it than that. To answer the question fully, it is vital to know a little more about Hugo Boss himself. Boss was born in 1885, to parents who owned a lingerie and linen shop in the small town of Metzingen, 20 miles south of Stuttgart. After serving in World War I, Boss established his own clothes factory in 1924, which produced traditional outfits. It was certainly not designing couture, and its clothes, such as raincoats and sportswear, were functional. Among one of Boss’s earliest clients was a textiles distributor called Rudolf Born, which commissioned Hugo Boss to produce some brown shirts for an organisation called the ‘National Socialist Party’, later, to become better known as the Nazis. Style: Hugo Boss is now a global fashion powerhouse . By the late Twenties, the growing Nazi Party had become a good client. And when the Party supplied Hugo Boss (as it did other manufacturers) the production templates for its uniforms, it appears that Boss did not see the relationship in anything but commercial terms. After all, Boss produced uniforms for many organisations, including the police and the postal service, and the apparently apolitical Boss was happy to make clothes for whoever paid their bills. However, on April 1, 1931, Boss took a step that would see his name — and brand — forever associated with Nazism. He joined the Nazi Party and was given the relatively low membership number of 508,889. Boss’s reasons for becoming a Nazi comparatively early were twofold. First, as a businessman, it made commercial sense, as it made it easier for Boss to win contracts from the Nazis who were increasingly coming to dominate every aspect of German life. Second, Boss believed that Hitler was the only man who could lift Germany out of its economic doldrums. Such a businesslike attitude was not exceptional. There were certainly better men who refused to do business with the Party, but though Boss was happy to sign contracts with them, he was not a rabid Nazi. He was simply a pragmatist. Dubious: Boss became a Nazi  as it made it easier for him to win contracts . Partly thanks to his membership of the party, the Nazis were good to Boss. By 1933, he was able to advertise that he made clothes not only for the SS, but also for the Hitler Youth and the Brownshirts — the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party. Then in 1938, business skyrocketed when Boss won contracts to make army uniforms. By 1940, the company was turning over some 1,000,000 Reichsmarks, compared to 200,000 Reichsmarks in 1936. However, it was still far from being a major manufacturer. In 1940, Boss was employing some 250 workers, which made it a small to medium-sized firm. Like many, Boss found it hard to find employees during the war, and this is where the story does turn truly dark. Brand was kicked out of the awards after making the comments about Hugo Boss's links to the Nazis . Unable to fill roles, the company found itself employing forced workers from the occupied countries. During the course of the war, Boss used 140 such labourers and for a period of around eight months from October 1940, the workforce was swelled by 40 French prisoners-of-war. Although Boss’s factory was not part of a concentration camp — and his labourers were not prisoners — the conditions were dreadful. One former Boss labourer, a 17-year-old Pole called Jan Kondak, was forced to work in the factory from 1942 to 1945. He recalls the hygiene being very poor. ‘In the barracks there were lice and fleas.’ He describes the food as insufficient given the hours they had to work. During air raids, the workforce was not allowed into shelters, but had to stay in the factory. Another labourer, Elzbieta Kubala-Bem, recalls being rounded up the Gestapo from her town in Poland in April 1940, and forced to work at Boss at the age of 19. She remembers the medical facilities as woeful. ‘There was no special treatment for children and pregnant women,’ she says, ‘and there was no way to visit a doctor. If we had a disease, we had to treat ourselves.’ The most poignant story is that of a Polish woman called Josefa Gisterek, who was sent to work at Boss in October 1941. In December, Josefa fled back home to help her father raise her siblings, but she was captured by the Gestapo and sent to Auschwitz and Buchenwald, where she was dreadfully beaten. However, when Hugo Boss found out where she was, he used his contacts in the Nazi party to get her returned to Metzingen. Although his motivation for trying to save her isn’t clear, he did seem to feel some responsibility for his workforce. But when she returned, the factory foreman worked her mercilessly, and she had a breakdown. Josefa was finally given three months’ leave, and allowed to see a doctor, but on 5 July 1943, she gassed herself with an oven. Boss then did an almost unprecedented thing: he paid for the funeral expenses, as well as travel costs for her family to attend. Though this was a noble gesture, it would have been more decent and caring for Boss to have ensured his forced labourers were treated more humanely in the first place. Still, by the standards of some employers, Boss did treat his labourers reasonably well — and paid them somewhat less meanly. After the war, Boss was ‘de-nazified’. He was classified as an active supporter of Nazism, was fined 100,000 marks, and was stripped of the right to vote and run a business. However, Boss appealed, and he was eventually classified as a ‘follower’, a lesser category, which meant that he was not regarded as an active promoter of Nazism. Boss died in 1948, but his business has lived on, albeit still stained by its association with Nazism. In 1999, the company finally agreed to contribute to a fund that compensated former forced labourers. The true story of Hugo Boss, his firm and its relationship with the Nazis, is rather less straightforward than Russell Brand would have it. He certainly did not design the SS uniforms, though he did produce them. It is, however, shameful that Boss, like so many other manufacturers, used forced labourers from occupied countries. Ultimately, Boss was not an evil man, but he did not do enough to stop evil happening. That is an important distinction and may not be one appreciated by a man as unsubtle as Russell Brand.","Brand was thrown out of GQ magazine’s Men of the Year Awards after-show .

"Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke has rejoined with his teammates in training, just days after the funeral of his 'little brother' Phillip Hughes. Clarke looks set to play in the upcoming four-Test series against India, joining the team as they started their preparations on Friday night and running laps at Adelaide Oval on Saturday morning. Tuesday marks not only the opening day of the series, but the first time Hughes' team mates will play after their beloved friend was felled at the Sydney Cricket Ground, on day one of a Sheffield Shield round between South Australia and New South Wales. Scroll down for video . Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke has rejoined training with his teammates . Clarke told mourners during his emotional eulogy at Hughes' funeral, 'we must play on', advice that the captain seems to have taken to heart and encouraged his team with. Brad Haddin, Australian Test wicket keeper, said that Clarke seemed confident and looked to be committed to playing in Tuesday's match. 'Michael had a good hit today, he's going to back up this afternoon and be involved in our session,'[ Haddin told The ABC. 'I haven't thought about it (captaining Australia in the absence of Clarke) to be honest,' he said. 'All signs are that he is going in the right direction and we're like everyone else, we want Michael out there.' Sean Abbott will sit out this weekend's round of club fixtures as Sydney club cricket returns for the first time since Phillip Hughes' death. The 22-year-old bowler plays for Sydney University in grade cricket but will miss the next set of fixtures along with his New South Wales team-mate Mitchell Starc. Abbott bowled the bouncer to Hughes at the Sydney Cricket Ground during a Sheffield Shield game that proved fatal.

Clarke joins his teammates in training at Adelaide Oval on Saturday morning . Clarke joins with David Warner (right) walking laps during an Australian nets session . According to his state side, Abbott alone will decide whether he wants to return to first class cricket at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday. Abbott has drawn sympathy from the global cricketing community, though former players and pundits have cast doubts on his ability to play at the highest level again. New South Wales chief executive Andrew Jones said it would be Abbott's call if he wanted to play against Queensland, as it would be for the team mates who witnessed batsman Hughes' sickening injury. The full impact of Hughes' shock death, after he was fatally struck by a bouncer, on not only the Australian cricket team but also on the game is yet to be seen. On Friday, the team banded together for training as they hit the nets, and there was laughter, can-can lines and even the odd bouncer. Australia coach Darren Lehmann reaffirmed that players will be given time to decide whether they're mentally up to playing at Adelaide Oval on Tuesday. But the early signs suggest the fear of mass withdrawals was unfounded. The Australian cricket coach, affectionately known as 'Boof', is confident that the boys are back in business. 'I reckon you'll get a pretty good indication of how they're going today,' Lehmann said prior to training. '(The squad is) getting on with what we do well and that's play cricket.' Clarke told mourners during his emotional eulogy at Hughes' funeral, 'we must play on', advice that the captain seems to have taken to heart and encouraged his team with . 'Michael had a good hit today, he's going to back up this afternoon and be involved in our session,' said Australian wicket keeper Brad Haddin . The Australian cricketers showed incredible good humour, partaking in routine hijinks and questionable dance moves as players warmed up at a suburban oval on the fringes of the Adelaide CBD. Kick-ups came first, with the standard debate over who was at fault when the soccer ball hit the ground. It was only days earlier that the nation watched a clip at Phillip Hughes' funeral, broadcast on national television, which showed archive footage of the talented youngster playing the very same game alongside his team mates. Fielding drills were next, the four fast bowlers breaking away to one group. They laughed with Peter Siddle when the Victorian overshot the mark with his return, the ball skidding along the car park and bumping a vehicle. Then came the serious business. David Warner was among the first batsmen to shuffle into the nets. Sean Abbott will sit out this weekend's round of club fixtures as Sydney club cricket returns for the first time since Phillip Hughes' death . Just two days before, the Australian cricket team had farewelled their mate, Phillip Hughes.

Tributes to Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes are displayed on the pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground . Siddle, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Johnson looked to regain rhythm in a centre-wicket session. Even then, spirits remained remarkably high. Chief selector Rod Marsh helped set the tone. Marsh grabbed a baseball mitt and reprised his wicketkeeping days for a short time before being replaced by fielding coach Greg Blewett. Both Marsh and Blewett understandably struggled to read the pacemen's deliveries. The bouncer slowly came into fashion, although Johnson bowled a fuller length for most of the session. 'I reckon you'll get a pretty good indication of how they're going today,' Australian coach Darren Lehmann (right) said. 'The squad (left) is getting on with what we do well and that's play cricket' Phillip Hughes shock death was caused by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match at the SCG, which caused 'catastrophic' injuries when he was struck in the head on November 25 . The players were photographed playing 'kick-ups'. At his Wednesday funeral, Phillip Hughes was shown in archive footage playing the same game as he laughed with his team mates . Hazlewood fired one in that flew over Shaun Marsh's head, but it was Siddle that truly stepped up. He sent down a terrific short ball, Marsh quickly ducking under. Chris Rogers was not so lucky, a rising delivery from Siddle inflicting some serious pain when it thumped his body. It was remarkably normal. Five days of Test cricket is obviously a significantly different proposition to a run in the park.","Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke has rejoined training with his teammates for the first time since the death of player Phillip Hughes .

"Juventus playmaker Andrea Pirlo believes Paul Pogba's development would be best served if he stayed in Turin, where he could have a team built around him.

"George Harrison  and John Lennon (pictured in 1964) received thousands in foreign payments . Unlawful cash payments made to members of The Beatles were covered up by the Treasury, according to Government papers published for the first time today. Thousands of pounds were transferred from the US to George Harrison and John Lennon in 1973, in breach of strict foreign exchange controls in force in Britain at the time. But lawyers acting for the Government decided against referring the case to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The forgiving stance is ironic given The Beatles’ tirade against the Treasury in their song Taxman, written and sung by Harrison on the Revolver album. The payments were made via companies, including the Abkco record label, set up by American businessman Allen Klein, who managed The Beatles’ finances after the death of Brian Epstein in 1967 until the band’s break-up in 1970. Files obtained by this newspaper under Freedom of Information laws show that Treasury and Bank of England officials spent the best part of a year investigating the payments, which included ‘loans’ of £30,000 and $10,000 (approximately £4,000 at the time) to Lennon and Harrison. A payment of £300,387 on behalf of Harrison was also being examined. Officials were alarmed to discover that neither Klein nor the two stars had contacted the Bank of England to get permission for the transfers, which were made in 1973. Their failure to disclose the payments was a breach of the Exchange Control Act of 1947, which strictly controlled the flow of capital in and out of Britain. In a letter dated December 5, 1974, an official in the Treasury Solicitor’s Department told the Bank of England that it should tell solicitors acting for Lennon and Harrison that a decision had been taken not to involve the DPP. But the same official insisted that the Treasury’s role in the matter should be kept a secret. He wrote: ‘In all the circumstances it has been decided not to refer this case to the DPP. I suggest that you say something on the following lines: It has been decided that no action will be taken in respect of any exchange control infringements that have been revealed in the correspondence. ‘I should, perhaps, emphasise that it is important that the above phraseology is used and that no attribution is made as to who actually made the decision, ie you should not say the Treasury.’ In an earlier letter to the Treasury Solicitor, another official urged a speedy solution. He wrote: ‘A great deal of work has been put into the formulation of an agreement to sort the mess out.’ The Beatles pictured in 1964. Documents obtained by this newspaper revealed two of the band's members avoided legal action from the Treasury's lawyers despite being given thousands in foreign payments . In a letter dated November 22, 1973, solicitors acting on behalf of Harrison and Lennon conceded that the payments breached currency regulations. But the lawyers insisted that the two men had received the money in good faith. After the Beatles split, Klein continued to work with Lennon and Harrison and in 1971 he helped the latter put together the Concert for Bangladesh in support of Unicef’s work in that country. Klein was jailed in 1979 for two months for tax evasion after it was discovered he defrauded both the concert and Unicef. He died in 2009. Lennon’s decision to ask Klein to manage the Beatles’ financial affairs was one of the reasons why the band broke up. Paul McCartney did not believe he was the right man for the job. In an interview with Jonathan Ross which was broadcast last night, Sir Paul said: ‘We got to a point where we got really crappy over business... for years I thought, “Oh, me and John, bitter rivals” and all this stuff.’","Musicians received thousands of pounds in foreign payments from the US .

"Mashudur Choudhury, the first Briton to be prosecuted for joining ISIS, has today been jailed for four years for preparing acts of terrorism . A youth club leader who was described as 'living a Walter Mitty lifestyle' and is the first Briton to be prosecuted for travelling to Syria to join ISIS has been jailed for four years. Father-of-two Mashudur Choudhury, 31, is the only one of a group of six young men from Portsmouth to have returned after joining the brutal terror group. All but one of those who stayed has since been killed in the fighting - but Choudhury was apparently sent back after failing the selection process. Sentencing him at Kingston Crown Court, Judge Paul Dodgson said Choudhury had encouraged a large number of other young men to follow in his footsteps. Speaking at Kingston Crown Court in South West London, the judge said: 'Whatever the motivation, anybody who prepares to fight for a political or ideological cause in another country must be in no doubt that they commit a serious offence. 'I have no doubt that when you embarked on this trip you and your companions hoped that your actions would encourage others to take the same journey. 'That has indeed occurred with the disastrous consequences we, and so many young men's families, now live with.' The judge said that Choudhury had been 'living a lie' having cultivated an image of himself as a 'teacher or scholar' and projected an image to the younger members of the group of 'being some sort of elder who could advise and guide them.' Scroll down for video . 'I believe in your imagination you saw yourself as some sort of leader and potential hero,' the judge said, before adding that when Choudhury got to the camp 'you were either deemed unsuitable or that when your fantasises collided with the harsh realities of the fighting in Syria, you lost the will to remain there.' The judge said that while Choudhury was not the leader of the group, 'There is no doubt in my mind that you, as the older man, encouraged them to remain committed to their plan and in due course you were even suggesting routes for them.' Mashudur Choudhury (circled left)  pictured at Gatwick airport before his journey to Syria in October 2013 . He said that Choudhury even had an 'absurd' plan to move his wife and two young children to Syria, but his wife thought it was 'barmy'. The Muslim community in Portsmouth blamed Choudhury, a father of two young children who ran a local youth group, for encouraging the others to leave and alerted the police. Choudhury was arrested when he returned to Gatwick after 18 days abroad in October last year and at first claimed he had been doing aid work. When he eventually admitted that he had met fighters, he said he was made to do the cooking and washing and had to sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to children. But during the trial even his own barrister said he was 'soaked in lies' as it emerged  that he had been living a Walter Mitty lifestyle. He had lied to his wife about having cancer, borrowed more than £35,000 from relatives for treatment and spent the money on prostitutes and foreign holidays. He was found guilty in May of preparing acts of terrorism but there was a delay in sentencing pending a decision on another case from the Court of Appeal. During the two-week trial at Kingston Crown Court jurors heard that Choudhury travelled to Syria (pictured) on October 8 last year with a group of younger men from their home town of Portsmouth . On October 8 last year, Choudhury's friend, Hamidur Rahman, a worker in Primark in Portsmouth, made a booking for himself and four others to fly from London Gatwick to Antalya, Turkey. CCTV at Fratton Station in Portsmouth showed Rahman along with Mamunur Roshid and Assad Uzzaman boarding a train at 4.34am. Choudhury set off by car to secretly join them at Gatwick airport where they checked into flight TCX1712 along with a fifth man, Mehdi Hassan, who had arrived by train separately. They were heading to Syria to meet up with Ifitkhar Jaman, who had become something of a social media celebrity after Tweeting about the 'five star jihad' and appearing on BBC Newsnight. Jaman was the first of the group to be killed in fighting in December last year. Hamidur was killed in August, and Roshid and Hassan were killed in a US airstrike on Kobane in October, leaving only Uzzaman alive. It not believed any of them died fighting the forces of the Assad regime. Choudhury lied to his family and told them he had cancer - and then spent the money they gave him for treatment on holidays abroad and prostitutes . Choudhury had proposed calling the group the 'Britani Brigade Bangladeshi Bad Boys' – until one of them pointed out the title was too long. Their departure prompted anger at Choudhury from his local mosque and an anonymous letter was sent to Hampshire police, sources say. In Portsmouth, Choudhury ran the Muslim Youth Project and worked as a racial awareness officer for the city council where he was asked to run part of the local Prevent programme to counter violent extremism. He lasted less than two years in the job and then gave it up to buy a café near his local mosque in Portsmouth, borrowing £17,000 from his wife's sister, but the business failed. Despite his financial difficulties Choudhury bought a £17,000 Audi A6 on hire purchase and made three trips to Marrakesh in Morocco with friends, telling his wife he was on a business trip. He set himself up as a 'life coach' claiming he had 'trained and coached Muslim and non-Muslim professionals on personal development' and giving false examples of his work. As part of the pretence, he set up a company called UnlimitedU Success Limited and wrote a blog explaining how Islam had helped him overcome cancer. He also used Twitter to encourage young Muslims to move to a Muslim country and fight jihad. His activity even involved setting up a false Twitter account so that he could re-Tweet messages that backed his views. Alison Morgan, prosecuting, said Choudhury was 'leaving the shame of the life he had behind him to fight and become a martyr and make something of himself.' Police were able to access Choudary's Twitter and WhatsApp internet messages which exposed his wife's annoyance at his desire to go and fight abroad. In one message his wife told him: 'Your treatment of me, I just want to die. I hate your attitude. May you die. I hate you…You want to die in battlefield, go die. I really mean it, just go. I'll be relieved at last.' In May 2010, Choudhury's wife, who worked for Portsmouth City Council as a tenancy support officer, came home from work to find him lying in bed. 'She came upstairs and pulled the duvet off and I had been emotional at the time, I had been crying, at that time, I don't know what came into my head, but I told my wife I was diagnosed with cancer.' His wife's mother had died a few days earlier from cancer. Choudhury (circled) used Twitter to encourage young Muslims to move to a Muslim country and fight jihad . Muhammad Hamidur Rahman (pictured left)  and Ifthekar Jaman (right) both from Portsmouth, were part of Choudhury's group who travelled to Syria in October last year to fight for ISIS - both died in the fighting . 'She burst into tears. I tried to calm her down and say, 'I'm fine, nothing's going to happen, I'm taking treatment,' he said. He had heard about a treatment in Singapore and added: 'I told my wife I wanted to go to Singapore. I just had a lot of pressure building up inside of me and I wanted to get away, I felt a failure in regards to the business.' Choudhury borrowed £8,000 from his wife's sister and another £27,000 from his own family and friends to pay for three trips to Singapore, texting back home with updates about fake operations. In Singapore, he claimed he went to a hospital for an appointment but never returned for tests and spent most of his time in Starbucks. When he arrived back in Britain, he told his wife he had an 'internal operation, one that wouldn't leave a scar.' He posed as a businessman called Ali Montana in Singapore and spent hundreds of pounds seeking 'female company.' On his return to Portsmouth he sent a series of explicit emails to an escort agency 'arranging sexual services,' Kingston Crown Court heard. Choudhury said he was 'utterly ashamed and embarrassed. I degraded myself to a level I never thought I would go.' Last October four friends were planning to emmigrate to Syria 'to help people and give aid,' Choudhury said. He said he thought it was a 'noble thing' and eventually decided to join them. Choudhury said he 'just wanted to get away' and have a 'fresh start, a clean slate' and to 'start a new life.' 'That's why I wanted to go to Syria,' he said. 'To leave behind the lies and deceit and the debts.' Sentencing him at Kingston Crown Court (pictured) Judge Paul Dodgson said Choudhury had encouraged a large number of other young men to follow in his footsteps in joining ISIS but was 'living a lie' But in a series of Tweets on September 16 and 17, he wrote: 'Leaving wife & kids behind for Jihad feesabilillah [in the cause of Allah] becomes easy if the belief of Akhirah [hereafter] is sincerely accepted…All my life I strived to be something, someone, but isn't being a Muslim something, someone. 'Isn't being a Muslim the best thing ever?... The life of this world is nothing but a sweet poison that quenches the thirst of desire and drags the ungrateful soul deeper into Hell!' Choudhury's wife only found out about his lies when the trial opened. She gave evidence for the defence, saying: 'These messages, he's absolutely barmy, he's gone mad, he says things like this out of the blue, it's ridiculous, ridiculous...It p***es me off so much.' The judge said that Choudhury's wife, Toslima Akhtar, 34, 'would have a lot to forgive' but Hossein Zahir, defending, said the relationship was 'strained but maybe now on the mend.' Ifitkhar Jaman's two brothers Tuhin, 26, and Mustakim, 23 face charges of trying to travel to Syria for terrorism.","Youth club leader is the first Briton to be prosecuted for travelling to Syria .

"West Ham and Tottenham are set to lock horns in the summer pursuit of Everton striker Romelu Lukaku. Lukaku hinted strongly last week that he was ready to quit Goodison Park just one season after his £28million summer move from Chelsea. He even suggested he would like to return to the Blues. That won't happen. Romelu Lukaku could leave Goodison Park with Tottenham and West Ham suitors for the Belgian striker . Enner Valencia (right) made waves at the World Cup and has continued to turn heads in the Premier League . Chelsea are instead interested in West Ham's Enner Valencia. And if Valencia quits Upton Park the Hammers will be in the market for Lukaku and could afford his £30m fee with wages at around £60,000 a week. Spurs have lined up West Brom's Saido Berahino but if Lukaku is up for grabs then they would change their tact and take on the Hammers. Atletico Madrid and Juventus are two other possible destinations. Liverpool will subtly try and convince Danny Ings that they are the club for him when he leaves Burnley as a free agent this summer. Ings is able to talk to foreign clubs and it has been reported that he has flown out for talks with Real Sociedad. Sociedad boss David Moyes is hoping to secure 22-year-old Ings on a pre-contract worth £60,000-a-week and a significant signing on fee. Liverpool are capable of rewarding him well too but they can't officially approach the player until the summer unless they strike a deal with Burnley which would involve some form of fee. Liverpool will try to convince Danny Ings to head to Anfield at the end of the season . Louis van Gaal has insisted that Angel di Maria is part of Manchester United's future. But it is understood the Argentine is ready to quit Old Trafford this summer and move to PSG despite being recently quoted that he is 'happy' at United. PSG are the club Di Maria wanted to join last summer when he was off loaded by Real Madrid. But complications with regard to FFP regulations prevented the French club completing a £55 million deal. Angel di Maria's spell at Manchester United has been an indifferent one and PSG are rumoured to be keen . The French club had targeted Chelsea's Eden Hazard for this summer. The Belgian recently signed a new five-and-a-half-year deal with the Blues and PSG will move in for Di Maria who has not settled into the United team. United now look as though they will not take up their option to sign Radamel Falcao, on loan from Monaco, on a permanent deal. Falcao could return to the south of France although there is a possibility of a trade with PSG to bring Uruguayan front man Edinson Cavani to Old Trafford. Eden Hazard put pen to paper on a new deal to keep him at Chelsea for the foreseeable future . Tim Sherwood turned down the offer of managing QPR last week to pave the way for succeeding Paul Lambert as Aston Villa boss. Villa confirmed the Sherwood deal on Saturday after sacking Lambert. It had appeared Sherwood was a shoo-in to replace Harry Redknapp at Rangers and talks had taken place. But Sherwood had some reservations given the potential financial punishments from the Football League the club could face if they are relegated, plus the risk of a decaying squad. Tim Sherwood is the new Aston Villa manager after he turned down QPR's advances . Paul Lambert was sacked from his position as the manager of Aston Villa on Wednesday . There was also the issue of seemingly being seen as part of a 'consipiracy' to oust Redknapp given Sherwood's close relationship with QPR's director of football Les Ferdinand, both of whom worked under Redknapp at Tottenham. And as soon as the Villa job became vacant Sherwood, who despite only a short stint as Tottenham boss has suddenly become managerial 'hot property', saw a better route to establish himself in football management. Despite woeful recent form Villa have a far stronger squad than Rangers and Sherwood is confident he can steer the club out of the relegation zone. It is understood Glenn Hoddle, who quit as QPR coach when Redknapp resigned, could work as a part-time assistant with Sherwood at Villa Park. Meanwhile Chris Ramsey, who has been given the Rangers job until the end of the season, believes he can do the job on a permanent basis, but that will only happen if he steers QPR to survival. Ramsey though has been told he still has a long-term role at the club . Chris Ramsey, known throughout the game as a fine coach, has the chance to keep the Hoops up . I am hearing... West Brom, who missed out on Carlton Cole on transfer deadline day, will move for the West Ham striker again this summer. But if Bournemouth secure promotion they will also chase Cole, who suddenly has a role to play again with the Hammers given that Andy Carroll is out of action for the rest of the season. The Baggies are also keen on West Ham's Matt Jarvis. Carlton Cole (right) exploded with rage at Sam Allaryce after missing out on a move to West Brom . I am also hearing... Tottenham, in a bid for long-term stability and success have already tied Harry Kane and Ryan Mason down to new, lucrative contracts, and expect to secure the services of 20-year-old Algerian midfielder Nabil Bentalab soon. Nabil Bentaleb has been a regular for Mauricio Pochettino's exciting Tottenham side . BTW . It was great to catch up with Trevor Brooking last week. Sir Trev was guest of honour in Collier Row, Romford at a dinner held by Chabad Lubavitch Centres, a fine Jewish charity which works across the board in north east London and Essex communities to help those people who have lose their way in the world due to addictions and family issues. As ever tales of yore had guests transfixed during a Q&A. I had to ask Trevor which goal was his favourite, the one for England vs Hungary which  ensured qualification for the 1982 World Cup, a solo winner in West Ham's epic 3-1 Cup Winners' Cup semi final win over Eintracht Frankfurt or his headed winner in the 1980 FA Cup final. Not surprisingly he plumped for the latter even though I tried to convince him about the goal against Frankfurt, which was a classic game in the mud which you no longer see. Trevor Brooking celebrates with his West Ham team-mates after scoring in the 1980 FA Cup final . Trevor was pretty open in some of his answers but understandably was coy about the real reason from his departure as The FA's technical director. My understanding was that after 10 years he got rather fed up of making suggestions based on football reasons, and eventually saw the commercial imperative take priority and a new breed of clip board coaches take over at the core of the FA coaching staff. In the latest restructuring at Wembley HQ there is a man called Dan Ashworth who never played the game professionally but who is in charge of the FA's Elite Development based at St. George',s a role which effectively rendered Brooking's position redundant. No doubt Ashworth's sports science CV ticks all the right boxes but when there are so many ex-pros with coaching credentials AND streetwise savvy it still seems a strange appointment. Certainly the workings of this new department would seem in need of urgent scrutiny given that on Friday night England's Under 17s (full of PL academy players) lost 7-0… yes seven… to Holland in a tournament in the Algarve. Sir Trevor (left) now occupies the role of director of football development in England . iSay . Premier League supremo Richard Scudamore was right when he said football clubs are not charities. But they are a massive part of their local communities. And he should remember in hard times local communities have usually clubbed together, dug deep into their pockets, to bail out clubs in financial crisis and offered their own form of charity to save clubs from going to the wall. It's not just smaller professional or non-League clubs where this happens. So while at the moment the plight of Hereford might not seem of consequence to the people at the top of the game (but it should) let's not forget that one of the Premier League's fat cat's Chelsea had to set up the 'Save the Bridge Fund' to keep it afloat in the Eighties and Nineties. Indeed as a consequence of that the commendable Chelsea Supporters Trust still has an influential voice at the club. The Premier League will continue to be shown on Sky Sports and BT Sport until 2019 in a £5.136bn deal . And they, along with other similar groups, will argue that following the massive increase in TV rights revenues announced by the Premier League last week the time has come for top clubs not just to freeze ticket prices but reduce them. The fact prices have become so high means that the 'normal working man' and many youngsters just haven't been able to afford to attend. They have in effect become the TV customers rather than in-stadia supporters. But the game is in danger of losing a generation of fans who are used to turning up at matches and down the line grounds with empty seats is not good for business. Not so much in terms of revenue but creating the event and making the atmosphere that makes the Premier League so attractive to TV at home and abroad. So cutting prices would not be an act of a charity but an investment in the long-term future of the game or in PL parlance the 'product.' Richard Scudamore agreed a huge television deal and said that Premier League clubs are not charities . iBet . It's getting to that time when people will start talking about who should be the PFA Player of the Year. It would seem to me Sky Bet are calling it right at the moment with Cesc Fabregas 3-1 fav. Eden Hazard and Alex Sanchez are 11-2, Diego Costa is is 4-1 and Sergio Aguero is 11-2.","Romelu Lukaku has hinted he is willing to leave Goodison Park .

Diego Costa will make his Chelsea return following his three-game domestic ban . Key match stats (supplied by Opta) This is the second time that PSG and Chelsea meet in the knockout stages of the Champions League. Last year, the Blues edged out the Parisians on away goals in the quarter finals. They also met in the group stages in 2004/05, with Chelsea winning 3-0 at the Parc des Princes and both sides playing out a goalless draw at Stamford Bridge. PSG have failed to score in three of their four encounters with Chelsea. PSG have reached the knockout stages of the Champions League for the third consecutive season, their best ever run. They were eventually knocked out in the quarter finals in the last two campaigns. PSG have only lost one of their last eight Champions League knockout games (W4 D3), it was against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in April 2014 (0-2). PSG are unbeaten in their last 32 home games in European competition (W22 D10), longest ever run for a French club. Their last defeat was against Hapoel Tel Aviv in the group stages of the UEFA Cup back in November 2006. PSG have also never failed to score in their last 18 home games in European competition. BATE Borisov were the last team to keep a clean sheet at the Parc des Princes, in February 2011. Seventy per cent of PSG’s goals in the Champions League this season have come in the opening and closing 15 minutes of games (7 out of 10). Chelsea have reached the knockout stages of the Champions League for the 11th time in the last 12 seasons. Chelsea are one of three teams still unbeaten in this season’s Champions League, alongside Porto and Real Madrid. Chelsea scored more goals than any other team in this season’s Champions League group stages (17). 47% of them came from set-pieces (8 out of 17), the highest ratio among the 16 teams left in the competition. Edinson Cavani has scored five goals in six Champions League games this season. Four of his five games in the knockout stages of the Champions League have been against Chelsea (with Napoli and PSG) – he was knocked out both times. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has scored seven goals in 33 Champions League knockout games. Didier Drogba has scored five goals in seven competitive games against PSG (with Guingamp, Marseille and Chelsea), including a brace at the Parc des Princes in his only Champions League game played on Parisian soil back in September 2004. Eden Hazard has completed the most dribbles in the Champions League this season (38), ahead of Lionel Messi (37). José Mourinho has only lost one of his 15 Champions League games against French clubs (W11 D3). It was at the Parc des Princes against Paris SG last season (1-3). Coincidentally, his first ever Champions League game as Chelsea manager came at the Parc des Princes in September 2004 (3-0 win v PSG).","Chelsea travel to PSG for Champions League last-16 first leg clash .

"Branislav Ivanovic has amazingly escaped an FA charge following his violent confrontation with Everton midfielder James McCarthy. The Chelsea defender dodged a ban despite TV footage showing Ivanovic wrapping his arm around McCarthy’s throat and choking him. It also appeared to show Ivanovic move his head in the direction of McCarthy. But a three-man panel of former referees decided Ivanovic’s behaviour was not worthy of a red card, meaning he has escaped retrospective action and a possible three-match suspension. VIDEO: Scroll down for video of the Branislav Ivanovic/James McCarthy incident . The FA investigated Branislav Ivanovic's altercation with James McCarthy but have not charged the defender . Ivanovic (third right) appears to aim a headbutt in the direction of McCarthy on Wednesday . McCarthy looks round as Ivanovic grapples him with both arms as tempers fray at Stamford Bridge . The incident took place during a melee in the closing stages of Chelsea's 1-0 win against Everton . The decision is a victory for Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, who has complained of a campaign against the Premier League leaders ever since striker Diego Costa was hit with a three-match retrospective ban for a stamp on Liverpool’s Emre Can. The FA also looked into suggestions that Ivanovic had bitten McCarthy on the shoulder during the incident, a claim the Serb vehemently denies. But after discussions with Everton on Thursday, the FA decided there were no grounds to take that allegation further. But both clubs have been charged with failing to control their players after the clash that marred Chelsea’s 1-0 win. And despite the escape for Ivanovic, Chelsea are believed to be unhappy at being charged at all. Everton boss Roberto Martinez said Ivanovic should have been sent off but the FA have chosen to take a lenient approach, as they did when Leicester boss Nigel Pearson went unpunished for putting his hands round the neck of Crystal Palace’s James McArthur last Saturday. Ivanovic looks towards McCarthy as the melee takes place in the background on Wednesday evening . Ivanovic throws his head towards McCarthy but escaped punishment on the night at Stamford Bridge . In a statement on their website the FA confirmed: ‘Branislav Ivanovic will not face any further action in relation to an incident involving Everton’s James McCarthy. ‘All three panel members must agree it is a sending-off offence. The panel did not believe the conduct was worthy of a dismissal.’ On the charge in relation to failing to control their players, an FA statement read: ‘Both Chelsea and Everton have been charged for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion. Both clubs have until 6pm on February 17 to respond to the charge.’ Tempers flared towards the end of the match as players from both sides confront each other . Ivanovic also clashes with Everton's John Stones in the closing stages of the Premier League match . Ivanovic (left) is embraced by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho after the final whistle on Wednesday . Martin Keown – I think he's just about going to get away with this, there's not enough in it in terms of making contact with his head. He'll get away with it for me. Steve McManaman: I don't think it was worth a red card, Jon Moss, the referee didn't see the incident - it's up to the law makers now. Robbie Savage: I've seen a lot worse but can you grab someone around the throat and do that? If the referee sees the movement towards McCarthy it's a red for me. Michael Owen: It's a yellow for me - nothing more. Phil Neville: It's not clear cut enough for the FA to ban him for three games, for me. It's not good what's he done granted, but I don't think the FA will take action.","Branislav Ivanovic cleared of retrospective disciplinary action from the FA .

"It appears Mamadou Sakho is a man of many talents following his latest hint at another career move after he hangs up his football boots. After last week's attempts at making the France RBS 6 Nations squad, against Tottenham and then in training, the defender then tried his hand at painting and decorating for two charities. However, the 25-year-old has literally tried his hands at becoming a physio after giving Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard an apparent rub down at the club's training ground on Tuesday afternoon. Mamadou Sakho resorted to desperate measures to try and halt Tottenham's Mousa Dembele last week .

He instead chose Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin - the Anglican vicar who also holds the roles of Speaker’s chaplain to the House of Commons, priest vicar at Westminster Abbey and chaplain to the Queen - as his guest. She has previously been tipped as a leading candidate to become a bishop if the Church of England allows women to reach the highest rank of its clergy. Matt Dawson was clearly trying to score brownie points as a son  - so took along his mother Lois. And Mum was clearly also the word for Justine Greening, the Conservative MP, who sat next to her mother Julia.

"Nigel Farage was last night accused of recruiting ‘toffs for the top’ of Ukip after a candidate in a key target seat expressed fury that he had been ousted in favour of a star of the TV programme Gogglebox. Andrew Michael, a wealthy, retired hotelier who features on the Channel 4 programme, has been parachuted in as Mr Farage’s candidate in Hastings and Rye, where the sitting Tory MP holds a wafer-thin majority. Now the deposed candidate has given vent to his anger in a leaked email to local party members in which he condemns Ukip’s policy of recruiting defecting Tory MPs and celebrities. Ralph Atkinson calls on Ukip members to bombard Mr Farage with complaints about his treatment, and claims that his party boasts ‘standards of democracy lower than the unelected European Commission’. Scroll down for video . First choice: Andrew Michael, a wealthy, retired hotelier who features on the Channel 4 programme alongside his family (above), has been parachuted in as Mr Farage’s candidate in Hastings and Rye . The row has blown up just days before Mr Farage will be seen in an alcohol-fuelled encounter with two other stars of the hit show, in which viewers watch people watching television. Steph and Dom Parker have been filmed knocking back glasses of wine and champagne with Mr Farage for a TV special which ends with the Ukip leader falling over, smashing a glass and having to borrow a pair of his host’s trousers. Row: Ralph Atkinson claims that he was kicked out in favour of Mr Michael. He has vented his anger in an email to local Ukip party members . Mr Michael, 55 – whose Gogglebox appearances with his wife Carolyne and two of their four children have included discussions about whether Ukip is racist – was selected for the seat last week shortly after Mr Atkinson was removed in a coup which he says was orchestrated by the party’s head office. In the email, seen by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Atkinson complains that he has ‘apparently been removed as Hastings & Rye Prospective Parliamentary Candidate’, and says sarcastically, in reference to the recent by-election victories of ex-Tories Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless: ‘Obviously potential candidates who have defected from the Conservatives will be preferred to long-term party members. This is in line with party policy which is to recruit more ‘‘toffs for the top’’ in order to win votes from the disenfranchised working-class voters, who exist in great numbers here’. Mr Atkinson, a former Ukip spokesman on immigration, adds: ‘Any person wishing to complain in a civilised fashion about this situation should send to [he gives Mr Farage’s private email address].’ Hastings, which is held by Tory MP Amber Rudd with a majority over Labour of under 2,000, is number 54 on Ukip’s ‘hitlist’ of Conservative-held seats. Mr Michael is filmed for Gogglebox at his £1.5 million house, which, far from being in the Hastings constituency, is in Brighton. In one recent edition, Mr Michael, who is of Greek-Cypriot origin, discussed the alleged racism of Ukip’s ‘calypso’ song with his family. At one point his children laugh sarcastically: ‘Wouldn’t want anyone thinking Ukip is racist.’ And in another episode, Mr Michael’s wife Carolyne says: ‘That Mark Reckless is not exactly very charismatic is he?’ After Mr Michael agrees, she adds: ‘I think if you were a donkey and you had the Ukip rosette on, they would vote for you.’ Favoured: Mr Atkinson says, in reference to ex-Tories like Douglas Carswell (right with Mr Farage): ‘Potential candidates who have defected from the Conservatives will be preferred to long-term party members.' Last week it was revealed that more than a dozen party activists had resigned amid complaints that Mr Farage and his ‘undemocratic cabal’ had stopped long-serving Ukip members from standing as MPs in winnable seats. Last night, a Ukip spokesman said: ‘It is Ukip policy that candidates in target seats are verified by the NEC. In the case of Hastings, it was felt the candidate was not suitable. ‘Nobody was preferred by the party. Hastings has now selected Mr Michael. This has nothing to do with Mr Farage’s filming with the Gogglebox team, which took place months ago and was unrelated.’","Gogglebox's Andrew Michael chosen as Hastings and Rye Ukip candidate .

"South Australian senator Penny Wong said it would have been impossible to keep the good news under wraps after telling her three-year-old daughter Alexandra she'll soon have a little brother or sister. The Labor senator and partner Sophie Allouache have announced they're expecting their second child in April, to the delight of their first born. 'Like all families we had to think about whether we tell the toddler because she’s notorious – she doesn’t know what a secret is,' Sen Wong told The Advertiser in Adelaide. 'But we decided to tell her because we thought it was important she knew.' Finance Minister Penny Wong (right) and partner Sophie Allouache in Canberra . And apparently, the excited Alexandra has been telling the world. 'At the Labor convention she sat reading The Gruffalo to a baby over and over again … I came over and asked how it was going and a friend said ‘it’s all really good but she’s just told everyone Mummy’s got a baby in her tummy,' said Ms Wong.

Sen Wong says the pair are lucky to have her own mother and Allouache's family for support in raising their family.  But she concedes that juggling motherhood with her demanding political career can be challenging. 'I think we’ve still got so far to go as a society as to how we balance work and family,' she said. That question of balance is expected to be back on the political agenda before long with the Abbott government announcing it will be reviewing childcare funding and its controversial paid parental leave scheme early next year.

"A string of rare and freakish fish have surfaced from Australian seas of late. In the wake of the Goblin shark in New South Wales and the frill-shark in Victoria, another rare and peculiar fish has been stumbled upon in South Australia. On Monday afternoon, a Riverland fisherman was taken aback when he netted a bony bream with two mouths. Scroll down for video . The South Australian fisherman uncovered the double mouthed bream on Monday . Gary Warrick said: ‘the two mouths are actually joined together. The top one opens and closes while the bottom one stays closed' Garry Warrick, a professional fisherman from Barmera, told Daily Mail Australia he had never seen anything like it in 30 years of working in the area. ‘It was very unusual. I have been fishing here for 30 years, and I have come across a few deformed fish, but never anything quite like this.’ ‘The two mouths are actually joined together. The top one opens and closes while the bottom one stays closed. It’s amazing it was alive.’ He said he once caught a fish that had a dolphin shaped head. Warrick usually stores the deformed fish away for fertiliser, but this time he put it in the freezer and took some images which his wife uploaded online. A group of fishermen got quite a shock when this pulled a terrifying prehistoric shark, known as the frill shark, from the water near Lakes Entrance in Victoria's east . Another extremely rare shark species, the goblin shark, was also recently caught off the coast of New South Wales to the amazement of local fishermen . In January, a group of fishermen pulled a terrifying prehistoric shark from the water near Lakes Entrance in Victoria's. The eel looking creature, known as a frilled shark, was dubbed for its six pairs of frill-like gills along with its dorsal fins, similar to the predatory fish. Earlier this month, an extremely rare species of shark considered a 'living dinosaur' was uncovered off the coast of New South Wales to the bewilderment of local fishermen. The species, known as a goblin shark, are incredibly elusive as they typically reside in waters near the ocean floor at around 1,200 metres deep. The creature was captured in a net by two fishermen, just 609 metres below the water's surface near Green Cape off the South Coast of New South Wales.","A south Australian fisherman discovered the rare double mouthed bream .

"Protesters in Ferguson have been threatening to rape the wives of front line police and kill their children during the latest clashes, the wife of one officer has claimed. The unnamed woman said that her husband has been 'screamed at' as he faced off with the angry crowds amid heightened tensions in the suburb of St Louis, Missouri. She told Fox 2 News that they threatened a home invasion in an apparent attempt to provoke the officers. The wife claimed the protesters said: 'We're going to go to your house.

A demonstrator holds up a sign reading 'We will not be silent' A grand jury is expected to decide whether Officer Darren Wilson (left) will be charged in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown (right) The allegations comes after many police officers' families in Ferguson, Missouri, were reported to be in hiding or running from town amid death and assault threats. One police wife told KTVI that she's received threats over the phone and she's been paranoid for her and her young daughter's safety ever since. 'Did they follow me here?' she told the station. 'Did I do a good enough job after work today of taking different routes, on my way home?' St Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman alluded to the abuse in his latest press release on the three arrests made on Thursday night. He wrote that 'several vocal and defiant protesters arrived chanting derogatory phrases'. They also made 'insulting personal verbal attacks on officers', he said. Tensions are rising in Ferguson as a grand jury decides whether to charge white Officer Darren Wilson in the August shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, 18. In one recent message, a caller says: 'Would you rather hear me coming out, coming out and robbing your house? And it would be like, it'd just be like silence man, you couldn't hear nothing.' 'It's very frightening,' said the police wife, who asked to not be identified. 'Most people who have a family member who's a police officer are very proud of what they do.' She added: 'This is real and people actually do know how to find us and they do want to harm us.' The police wife says some officers' relatives have been leaving town to protect themselves — but she plans on staying. 'I'm very worried about what's going to happen to the citizens and what's going to happen to the businesses and what's going to happen to the police officers,' she told KTVI.

Our streets!' and 'Killer cops have got to go!' Officers in helmets and shields were deployed after a commander told protesters not to block traffic. Brief scuffles broke out and at least one woman and a man were handcuffed and taken away. Police did not confirm an official tally. The Chicago Tribune reported at least six were arrested. The August 9 killing of Brown triggered weeks of sometimes violent protests demanding Wilson be indicted. Tensions continued on Thursday and required police in riot gear to keep the peace (pictured) Wilson's camp has said he feels 'confident' he won't be charged by the grand jury and is working with city officials to negotiate his resignation from the Ferguson Police Department. Jeff Roorda, business manager for the St. Louis Police Officers' Association, said he met Thursday with Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, who has remained secluded from the public eye since the shooting. 'It's fair to say that neither he nor his defense team expect an indictment,' Roorda said. Meanwhile, Wilson may announce as early as Friday his plans to resign from the force, as a way of protecting fellow officers and easing pressures in the wake of the shooting.

"For years they have been a source of joy for youngsters playing in their gardens. But now safety experts have called for a crackdown on trampolines – because they cause too many injuries. Officials say only one child at a time should use the devices in a bid to cut the number of people requiring hospital treatment after crashing into each other or falling awkwardly. New figures show trampolines account for nearly 50 per cent of A&E admissions for injuries in the home among those aged under 14. Scroll down for video . Heading for a fall: The chance of injury increases if there is more than one child on the trampoline (file image) Shockingly, more youngsters are likely to end up in hospital after using one of the bouncy toys than skateboarding, rollerblading or playing football at home. ‘If you have a lot of people on the trampoline and they crash into each other you can get concussions and some nasty fractures,’ said Errol Taylor, of the Royal Society For The Prevention Of Accidents (RoSPA), which compiled the statistics. ‘We also know if you have a safety net, parents tend to get complacent about safety and that’s when you get more horseplay and serious incidents.’ RoSPA compiled detailed records from A&E departments in Oxfordshire over 15 months to get a snapshot of how people suffer injuries. Two-thirds of the 64,000 patients treated were hurt in the home. Of sports injuries at home, 54.9 per cent of girls and 38 per cent of boys were injured by playing on a trampoline. Mr Taylor warned that children suffered the worst injuries while bouncing on the trampoline at the same time as an adult, adding: ‘When the adult has bounced and the trampoline is going back up and rising as the little one is coming down it’s as if they’ve just jumped out of a first floor window.’ Shocking: More youngsters are likely to end up in hospital after using one of the bouncy toys than skateboarding, rollerblading or playing football at home (file image) Sales of trampolines – which often cost less than £100 – have soared to more than one million in the UK in recent years. Doctors in America have called for them to be banned due to the number of casualties there. However, RoSPA does not want to see that happen in the UK and is instead working with manufacturers on new safety measures. ‘We want people to continue to have fun but in as safe a way as possible,’ said Mr Taylor. ‘One of the things we are exploring is if we could have a target in the sweet spot of the trampoline which makes it clear you can only really have one person on it. As soon as you have two people you are going to get children crashing into each other or one being thrown off.’","More youngsters end up in hospital after trampolining than skateboarding .

"Council workers accidentally scrubbed a work of modern art off a gallery window - because they thought it was graffiti. Contemporary artist Carrie Reichardt painted a black anarchy symbol on the outside of the Ink-d Gallery in Brighton, East Sussex, where an exhibition of her work is being held. But Brighton and Hove City Council workers, mistaking the artwork for graffiti, washed the work off overnight, infuriating Ms Reichardt. Carrie Reichardt's black anarchy sign (pictured) was scrubbed off a gallery window overnight by council workers who mistook it for graffiti . Ms Reichardt returned to Ink_d gallery in Brighton, where her work is on display, to repaint the sign in red, five times as big . The furious painter said Brighton was a liberal place but the actions of the council was 'more something you would expect in Nazi Germany' The artist, who describes herself as a 'renegade potter and craftivist', has since re-painted the anarchy sign on the window of Ink_d gallery in Brighton - this time in red and five-times bigger. She said: 'I was really shocked. I did not think it was legal for councils to remove things on private property. 'Brighton tends to present itself as this liberal place, but this is quite fascist. 'When you go around removing a symbol because you don't like it - that is more something you would expect in Nazi Germany.' Curator and director of the gallery Dan Vaughan trawled through CCTV to work out how the work, which was painted on the window two weeks earlier, had disappeared. Mr Vaughan said he is considering taking legal action against the local authority. 'This is a well-established contemporary artist and they have damaged a piece of art,' he said. 'I am now looking at options about how to take this forward. The owner of Ink_d gallery, where Ms Reichardt's work is on display, says he is considering taking legal action against the council . Brighton and Hove City Council have apologised for removing the artwork and are investigating further . 'This happened to us back in 2007 but we were assured by the cleaners it would never happen again - I just can't believe it. 'I want the council to tell me what I can and can't put on my window. I don't know what they deem offensive but I need to know so this doesn't happen again. 'This is an art gallery, a place where you are supposed to be able to express things.' In 2007, the council scrubbed off work by artist James Cauty, who had scrawled 'Portslade Massif' across the window and wall of Ink_d to advertise his exhibition. A spokeswoman for Brighton and Hove City Council said the graffiti team was not aware it was a piece of art and removed it by mistake. She said it would 'investigate further to try to avoid similar instances in the future'.

"As the only practising female Spitfire pilot in the world, Carolyn Grace is much in demand. During the summer months, she spends every weekend taking part in aerobatic displays across the country. But looking after her classic fighter plane is an expensive business, so Carolyn has put her six-bedroom home, The Cangle in Halstead, Essex, on the market for £1.25 million to ensure its future is safe. ‘The Spitfire costs about £5,000 an hour to fly and we fly it 70 hours a year,’ she explains. ‘The engine overhaul alone costs £120,000 and has to be carried out every four or so years. You have to keep on top of the maintenance. We need to free up funds. It’s about preserving it for the next generation.’ Saving the plane: Carolyn Grace has put her six-bedroom home, The Cangle in Halstead, Essex, on the market for £1.25 million to ensure the future for her Spitfire fighter aircraft is safe . Although more than 20,000 Spitfires were produced shortly before, during and after the Second World War, the ‘Grace Spitfire’ is one of only a handful to survive today. And it is all the more special as it was the first Allied plane to shoot down an enemy aircraft above the Normandy beaches on D-Day. Carolyn’s passion for the plane stems from her late husband Nick, who bought the aircraft, which required a full rebuild, from a Scottish museum in 1979. A design engineer and pilot, Nick set about painstakingly restoring it at St Merryn airfield in Cornwall, a process that took more than five years. Once the rebuild was finished, the couple moved to West Sussex because the Spitfire needed to be in a more central location to keep down flight times to and from various shows. Highflyer: Carolyn Grace, the world's only female spitfire pilot, standing next to her engine in her workshop . They found a 100-acre field near Horsham that was perfect, built a workshop/hangar on the site, and also applied for planning permission to build a house. But tragedy struck before their dreams could be realised when Nick was killed in a car accident in 1988, just three years after getting the Spitfire airborne again. Carolyn moved with the couple’s young children – Olivia, then five, and Richard, then four – to the family’s current home, and also transported the Spitfire to Duxford airfield near Cambridge. Although she was already a qualified pilot, she took the intrepid decision to train as a Spitfire pilot, to the shock of many. She is the first woman to have done so since the women of the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) service in the Second World War. Although The Cangle has nine acres, that is not a large enough area to keep the Spitfire. However, the property does have an enormous double-height workshop in the grounds, where the aircraft’s engine is currently awaiting an overhaul. Although she is from Australia, Carolyn knew this patch of Essex well before she moved there as her aunt and uncle lived locally, while she and Nick were married in 1975 in the nearby village of Great Bardfield. Expensive hobby: It cost Mrs Grace about £5,000 an hour to fly her Spitfire, and as she flies it it 70 hours a year, she needs to 'free up funds' (stock image) ‘It’s an idyllic spot – we’re less than two miles from Halstead but very secluded because our grounds form a horseshoe around the house, and there’s woodland beyond that. ‘I knew as I drove up the lane that I wanted to buy this house. I grew up on a farm so I was brought up on the land – I like the idea of not having neighbours,’ she says. The Cangle’s sense of history also appealed. Built in the 1550s, it is packed with original features. An earlier structure on the site was mentioned in the Domesday Book. The house itself was in a poor condition when Carolyn and the children moved in, so she set about installing a new kitchen and knocking down old farm buildings. Carolyn, 62, spends every weekend from May to September flying at events, including displays at outdoor concerts. ‘You have to fly the Spitfire wholeheartedly,’ she says. ‘The minute you feel you’re not on top of it, you should stop.’ Selling the house will be a wrench, she admits. ‘We have a lot of memories here. I’ll miss the seclusion and the wildlife – stoats in the garden and ducks that come back to our pond every year. But we have always moved with the Spitfire. It has been the priority from the time Nick first brought it home. It is good to know we are continuing to base our lives around ensuring its future.’ beresfordsgroup.co.uk .","Carolyn Grace is the only female Spitfire pilot in Britain today .

It comes after the Crown Prosecution Service decided to drop their prosecution against Dr Sivaraman and instead referring her to the General Medical Council. Following the decision, Miss Hubert, aged 21, from Brighton, instructed solicitors to bring a private prosecution. She is said to have sought expert legal and medical opinion, with some medical professionals offering to give evidence in court. The private prosecution was heard at Manchester Magistrates Court, pictured, after the CPS decided not to pursue the case . Miss Hubert was represented by prosecutor Michael Phillips during yesterday's hearing and it was heard by District Judge Khalid Qureshi. Dr Sivaraman, wearing a white coat, purple blazer and patterned blouse, did not appear in the dock but sat in the public seating area at the back of the courtroom. Represented by defence Jonathan Barnard, she did not speak but stood only to hear details of the date of the next hearing. The case was committed to Manchester Crown Court for a preliminary hearing and it will next be heard at Manchester Crown Square on January 15 next year. Although almost all criminal cases in England and Wales are brought to court by the Crown Prosecution Service, any individual or group with evidence that a crime has been committed can present evidence to a court to initiate a private prosecution.

At one stage it looked likely that the house could be taken off the market for $3.9 million, but a last minute buyer secured the hot property for $4.1 million . According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the buyer was a local man who drove past the house every day and had been waiting for his chance to get his hands on the property. Selling agent Martin Farah told the newspaper that the massive 720-square metre block, which is at the highest point in the suburb, attracted the buyer due to the vast amount of land available. 'He wanted his family to have a big block of land so they are planning to move in and do the big renovation down the track,' Mr Farah said.

"Two Little Boys, by convicted paedophile Rolf Harris, was included in a Radio Times Christmas number one poll . Radio Times chiefs have come under fire for including a Rolf Harris song in a poll to find the nation's favourite Christmas number one. The convicted paedophile's 1969 hit Two Little Boys, which topped the charts for six weeks, was withdrawn from the magazine's online vote after bosses admitted their mistake. Readers had demanded the removal of the song, as victims called for a boycott of 84-year-old Harris' works. Tonya Lee, who was abused by Harris when she was 15, told The Sun: 'I absolutely support the removal of Rolf's songs, art, TV shows or anything that he has been involved in. 'I would let any organisation know that using any of this is supporting a paedophile and supporting his disgusting behaviour. 'If any companies support Rolf or those of his ilk, I encourage the public to take a stand and boycott the product or publication.' The Radio Times poll, launched on November 28, included the likes of Boney M's Mary's Boy Child, Do They Know It's Christmas by Band Aid and Slade's Merry Xmas Everybody. It is not known if the song, about two boys who grow up to fight in a war, received any votes. Among the festive chart-toppers was the song by Harris, who was jailed for five years and nine months earlier this year for 12 indecent assaults against four girls - including one aged just eight - between 1968 and 1986. Two Little Boys, which was re-recorded in 2008 to mark the 90th anniversary of the end of the First World War, was Harris' only UK number one and was Margaret Thatcher's favourite song. He gave an impromptu live a cappella performance of the song at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012 while Stevie Wonder's band was preparing. Lenny Henry was booed by the crowd for cutting Harris' second verse short. Radio Times admitted the song was included by mistake. A spokesman said: 'We thought it was inappropriate to include a recently convicted sex offender on the list.' Harris is serving a prison sentence of five years and nine months for 12 indecent assaults against four girls, including one aged just eight, between 1968 and 1986 .","Song by paedophile Rolf Harris included in Radio Times Christmas poll .

"Popular senator Nick Xenophon is now looking to broaden his appeal by copying Clive Palmer and launching his own political party to field candidates at the next Federal election. The South Australian Independent is reportedly in discussions with some high-profile candidates to stand alongside him for the Senate. His party is set to be called the Nick Xenophon Team, or NXT. He said his reason for forming the party was because of the lack of trust the public had in politicians today in Australia. Senator Nick Xenophon is launching his own political party .

"Accused: Emmanuel Okubote, 22, (pictured) allegedly took  pregnant Colette Brown and her boyfriend Tabare Garcia hostage after his cannabis factory in Thamesmead, south east London was burgled . A thug wearing an electronic tag kidnapped a pregnant woman and her boyfriend, throttled her until she passed out and punched her in the stomach in a row over a £40,000 cannabis theft, a court heard today. Emmanuel Okubote is accused of taking six-and-a-half months pregnant Colette Brown and her boyfriend Tabare Garcia hostage after his cannabis factory in Thamesmead, south east London was burgled. The Old Bailey was told Okubote and his accomplice, Shane De Silva, had accused Mr Garcia of involvement in the theft, ordering the couple into cars before subjecting them to the terrifying ordeal. The jury was told told Okubote had grabbed Miss Brown around her neck and choked her until she passed out after telling her she was going to die. Okubote, 22, also allegedly held a gun to the neck of Mr Garcia and burned him with a lighter while demanding he hand over £40,000, claiming the father-to-be had stolen from him. Okubote, known by the street name ‘Sylar’, eventually released Miss Brown before going home at 9pm to comply with the conditions of his electronic tag, while his associates kept Mr Garcia prisoner, the jury heard. He then returned to issue more threats to Mr Garcia the following morning, refusing to release him until he was given the money, it is claimed. The hostage was released a few hours later when an armed police officer found him being held prisoner in a car by Okubote’s accomplice Shane De Silva, jurors were told. De Silva has admitted his involvement in the kidnapping, while Okubote denies the charges and is now standing trial. John Causer, prosecuting, told the court that the dispute centred around a flat in Thamesmead. Miss Brown, whose baby has since been born, had moved out of the property in late 2013 after falling pregnant, and De Silva had offered to redecorate it for free. But over the next three months it was turned into a ‘hydroponics factory’ growing cannabis using specialised equipment, it is claimed. On 15 March this year police were called to the flat after a neighbour spotted a ladder leaning next to a window, but it had already been cleaned out. That evening, Okubote contacted De Silva and arrangements were made to meet Miss Brown in Sydenham, the court heard. Mr Causer said: ‘It had become known the cannabis was taken and efforts were made to find out why.’ Okubote allegedly ordered Miss Brown into his silver VW Golf and drove her to a property in Catford, before demanding she hand over her phone. De Silva then called Mr Garcia and told him that ‘stuff had gone missing’, before picking him up from his mother’s house. Mr Causer told jurors: ‘You will have to assess how much Mr Garcia did or didn’t know about what was going on. He says he knew what was being talked about but himself had nothing to do with it.’ The prosecutor said that De Silva, who was armed with a gun, punched Mr Garcia several times and demanded: ‘Where’s the weed and the money?’ Dispute: The dispute centred on a flat in this block in Thamesmead, south east London. The court was told it had been turned into a cannabis factory, which was later burgled . While De Silva and Mr Garcia were driving to Catford, Okubote told Miss Brown that her boyfriend had stolen from him, and she was going to die. ‘He said he didn’t care that she was six-and-a-half months pregnant,’ said Mr Causer. ‘He twice throttled her, telling her she was going to die and “Why don’t you die?” ‘The second time she passed out from the effects of what he did to her and when she came round he twice punched her in the stomach knowing she was pregnant.’ Miss Brown then heard another car arrive and the sound of Mr Garcia screaming in pain, the court heard. Okubote got out and went over to Mr Garcia to tell him: ‘I have just run into your girlfriend. I know 100 per cent it was you and I will kill you.’ He held a gun to Mr Garcia’s neck and burned him with a lighter before pistol-whipping him, the court heard. Mr Causer said: ‘Okubote was demanding £40,000 from Tabare Garcia and making threats to him, saying “I am a sick b****** I will burn you from your head to your toes, I will rape your children and make you watch it, you f***** with the wrong person"".' At around 9pm Miss Brown was released at Nunhead railway station and Okubote returned home to his flat in Evan Cook Close, Peckham, southeast London, the court heard. Mr Causer said: ‘Emmanuel Okubote was subject to a tag at the time and he needed to be at home in order to comply with the conditions. ‘The records show that he arrived at home at 9.18pm and remained at that address until at least 7am.’ The Old Bailey was told Okubote had told Mr Garcia that he was going to kill him, before holding a gun to his neck, burning him with a lighter and pistol-whipping him . Jurors were told that De Silva then drove to Kitto Road in Nunhead and ordered Mr Garcia to raise £10,000. The next day, it is alleged that Okubote arrived at around midday and threatened to keep Mr Garcia prisoner until he was given the money. Mr Garcia was released at 12.38pm when an armed police officer noticed a blue Peugeot in Fern Court and arrested De Silva. Three days later Okubote was arrested by armed police at his flat at 4.30pm on 19 March. Both Okubote and De Silva made no comment in police interview but Okubote claimed in a prepared statement that he did not assault Miss Brown. He said: ‘I would never assault a woman and I most certainly would not assault a pregnant woman. I do believe Colette has made these allegations to avoid any offences she has committed coming to light. I also deny any assault on Tabare Garcia.’ Okubote, of  Catford, southeast London, denies two counts of conspiracy to kidnap, two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison, one count of conspiracy to blackmail and one of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Emmanuel Okubote accused of taking Collette Brown and boyfriend hostage .

"Sir Paul McCartney has spoken of his shock when he heard John Lennon had been murdered and valled his killer Mark Chapman the 'the jerk of all jerks'. The legendary singer described the moment he heard his former band mate had been been shot dead in New York in December 1980 on last night's episode of The Jonathan Ross Show. In a heartfelt interview, he admitted his only solace was that the pair had managed to heal the rift that formed after The Beatles split in 1970 and were 'good friends'. Scroll down for video . Speaking on The Jonathan Ross Show last night, Sir Paul McCartney called John Lennon's killer the 'jerk of all jerks' He said: 'I was at home and I got a phone call. It was early in the morning, I was in the country and I just got a phone call and it was like - I think it was like that for everyone. 'It was just so horrific, you couldn't take it in and I couldn't take it in and I just for days you just couldn't think that he was gone. 'It was just a huge shock, then I had to tell Linda (Sir Paul's late wife) and the kids and it was very difficult. It was very difficult for everyone.' He added: 'That was, like, a really big shock, I think, in most people's lives. A bit like Kennedy - there were certain moments like that.' Sir Paul held back tears as he said the worst thing for him about the murderer was he had no real motivation for his actions. He said: 'For me it was just so sad that I wasn't going to see him (Lennon) again and we weren't going to hang. 'The phrase kept coming in my head 'the jerk of all jerks'. Chapman, pictured in his original mugshot, shot Lennon dead outside the Dakota apartment building on Manhattan's Upper West Side on December 8, 1980 . Sir Paul, pictured with Lennon in June 1963, said his only solace was the pair had managed to heal the rift that formed after The Beatles split in 1980 . 'It was just like 'this is just a jerk, this is not even a guy politically motivated, it's just some total random thing.' Speaking about the rifts in the band that led to its collapse, Sir Paul said it was all down to 'business'. 'We got to a point where we got really crappy over business,' he explained. 'To me that rubbed off on me and for years I thought 'oh me and John, bitter rivals' and all this stuff. ' However, he described himself as being 'very lucky' the two men had managed to get over their differences before Lennon's death. He said that fighting each other eventually became 'boring' and they started to talk again. Both their partners had recently given birth and they bonded over 'normal stuff' such as being new fathers and about recipes for making bread. 'I'm so glad because it would have been the worst thing in the world to have this great relationship that then soured and he gets killed, so there was some solace in the fact that we got back together. 'We were good friends. 'The story about the break-up, it's true but it's not the main bit, the main bit was the affection.' Sir Paul, who appeared on the show alongside Sherlock star Martin Freeman, right, told Jonathan Ross, above, the moment he heard his friend had been killed was 'just so horrific' Earlier this year, Chapman, pictured left in 2012, boasted about the media attention he continues to receive from shooting Lennon, pictured right in August 1980, and added he is still approached for interviews .","Sir Paul admitted only solace was that he and John were 'good friends'

"It may seem like a terrifying weapon from the not-too-distant future but a German inventor says his new laser Gatling gun can only be used for popping balloons. Patrick Priebe's fully-functional laser gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers. Mr Priebe said although it is only strong . enough to burst balloons, the 8.5 pound weapon is still not suitable to . be used outside. Scroll down for video . Earlier this year, Mr Priebe built a laser weapon, inspired by the Gatling gun. The gun (pictured) is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers . The 8.5 pound weapon was invented by German Patrick Priebe who specialises in lasers . The inventor said, although it is only strong enough to pop balloons, it is still too dangerous to be used outside . He told CNET: 'It's too dangerous for outside use. So, no, it's strictly for display only.' A demonstration of the weapon carrying . out a 'balloon massacre' has been watched hundreds of thousands of times . online this week alone. The video shows the rapid fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall. The inventor is obviously fearful his designs will fall into the wrong hands as he states on his website: 'No plans, no schematics, no blueprints'. Eight AA batteries power the laser motor and the gun's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun. As the barrel spins, the lasers - powered by lithium-ion batteries - are shot out. Gatling . guns were invented by Richard Gatling in the 19th century and first . used by the Union forces during the American Civil War. The laser weapon is a taken on the iconic Gatling gun invented by Richard Gatling in the 1860s . A video showing the laser gun bursting balloons has been watched hundreds of thousands of times . As the barrel spins, the lasers - powered by lithium-ion batteries - are shot out . The laser Gatling gun is powered by normal AA batteries and lithium-ion batteries . They were a forerunner to the machine gun and allowed people to fire 200 rounds per minute. Mr Priebe's futuristic version is not the first laser weapon he has invented. He became an internet hit earlier this year when he created a fully-functional Iron Man Gauntlet, complete with lasers on the palm and forearm.

"A leading Tory MP has called on Boris Johnson to investigate claims that Scotland Yard officers have abused their position by trying to shut down newspaper investigations into Ukip. Zac Goldsmith made the demand after a former Ukip official received a harassment warning for talking to The Mail on Sunday about her claims an alleged ‘former mistress’ of Ukip leader Nigel Farage had fabricated a sexual assault case against a fellow Tory MP. Police are investigating Jasna Badzak’s allegation that Annabelle Fuller falsely accused Andrew Bridgen of inappropriately touching her at his Westminster flat in 2011. Leading Tory MP Zac Goldsmith has called on Boris Johnson to investigate claims that Scotland Yard officers have abused their position by trying to shut down newspaper investigations into Ukip . The call for an investigation comes as Rupert Murdoch launches legal action against Scotland Yard for 'hacking' thousands of journalists emails. The MP for North West Leicestershire, who denied wrong-doing, was arrested but no charges were brought. Ms Badzak, 43, who used to work as a Ukip press officer, says she has given the police details of messages she exchanged with Ms Fuller about the incident. But when this newspaper spoke to Ms Badzak last month about a new development in the case – that detectives were planning to question Mr Farage after establishing that Ms Fuller had made phone calls to the Ukip leader on the evening she was in Mr Bridgen’s flat – Ms Badzak was warned off. Ms Badzak was issued with a ‘Prevention of Harassment’ letter by a Met officer, Detective Sergeant Gordon McKay, on the grounds the conversation had led to Ms Fuller being ‘subjected to numerous phone calls and emails’. The Mail on Sunday sent three emails to Ms Fuller prior to printing our story to clarify the details. When asked what she had said on the phone to Mr Farage on the night in question, Ms Fuller replied: ‘Are you now a police officer?’ Ex-party spin doctor Ms Fuller, 32, was described as Farage’s ‘former mistress’ under Parliamentary privilege in Strasbourg earlier this year by Nikki Sinclaire, a former Ukip MEP. Mr Farage and Ms Fuller strongly deny an affair and Ms Fuller has since stopped working for the party. Police are investigating Jasna Badzak’s allegation that Annabelle Fuller falsely accused Andrew Bridgen, pictured above with his wife Jackie, inappropriately touched her at his Westminster flat in 2011 . Mr Goldsmith, the MP for Richmond Park, who wrote to Mr Johnson on Thursday about the case – as the Mayor he has ultimate oversight of Scotland Yard – said he was concerned by claims officers could have been abusing their office. On Friday, former Tory MP Louise Mensch submitted two criminal complaints about the alleged conduct of officers. Her move came after she learned that another serving officer at the Met had warned two reporters – who had contacted Ukip MEP Gerard Batten to ask about his alleged links to far-Right organisations – against publishing articles ‘deemed to be untruthful and concerning’. Last night a friend of Mr Bridgen said: ‘Andrew was approached by the police as a result of new information provided by Jasna Badzak regarding false allegations made about him by Annabelle Fuller in June 2011. Andrew is extremely concerned by the pace of the investigation into Ms Fuller’s apparent perverting the course of justice.’ Ms Fuller said: ‘I reported Jasna Badzak to the police over her continued harassment of me which started when she made false allegations about me.’ Ms Mensch said: ‘It seems to be an abuse of the criminal law to prevent citizens talking to journalists.’ The row has come amid growing concern over the use of police surveillance powers against journalists. A report published last week by the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said the laws were not ‘fit for purpose’ and should be overhauled. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘On November 1, police received an allegation of harassment. On November 15, a 43-year-old woman was issued with a 1st Instance Harassment Warning.’ News UK claims police 'hacking' of journalists emails was 'revenge' bid . Rupert Murdoch is suing Scotland Yard for ‘hacking’ into thousands of journalists’ emails – in what was last night dubbed as ‘revenge’ for the phone-hacking scandal. The Metropolitan Police has arrested dozens of reporters working for the tycoon’s newspapers over plotting to listen in to celebrities’ voicemail messages, making payments to public officials and other crimes, with seven convicted this year. But in an ironic twist, News UK is now taking Scotland Yard to court, claiming damages for breach of confidentiality. The company, previously known as News International, says the Met kept and searched through an archive of journalists’ emails dating back to 2004 – many of which may have contained sensitive information. Rupert Murdoch is suing Scotland Yard for ‘hacking’ into thousands of journalists’ emails – in what was last night dubbed as ‘revenge’ for the phone-hacking scandal. News UK voluntarily handed over emails to police as part of the probe into phone-hacking at the News of the World, in 2011. It had a policy of deleting old emails automatically after a set period of time, although computer experts were able to find information dating back to around 2004 on 64 storage tapes. News UK says police accessed the data from this without agreement. Murdoch’s lawyers want the data – still kept by Scotland Yard – to be returned, as well as damages for ‘breach of confidence’ by the Met. A lawyer involved in the phone-hacking trials said last night: ‘It sounds like there is an element of Murdoch’s revenge about this.’ Both parties declined to comment on the civil case.","A Former Ukip official received a harassment warning for talking to MoS .

"Ryan Watson and his sister Emma saved their mother's life when she collapsed by calmly phoning for an ambulance and putting her in the recovery position. Debbie, 27, who suffers from epilepsy, was battling a sickness bug when she fell unconscious and had a seizure in their home in Thornley, County Durham. Seven-year-old Ryan called 999 and told his sister, five, to put their mother in the recovery position. Quick-thinking Ryan, seven, and Emma, five, saved their mother Debbie's life when she collapsed and suffered an epileptic fit . Paramedics told Debbie that she would not be here if it was not for her quick-thinking kids, who were given bravery awards for their actions from the North East Ambulance Service. The mother-of-two said: 'I'm just so proud of them, they did amazing. 'When I talk about it I shake, I just can't believe what they've done.' Their father Jonny, who is a first responder, had taught them to call 999 if their mother was ever unwell. Paramedics told Debbie, who was battling a bug when she fell unconscious, that she wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her children . She added: 'I had a sickness bug and I couldn't keep my medication down. 'I felt quite ill but I went to pick the kids up from school. Ryan and Emma, pictured with call-taker Michelle Watson, top left, and paramedic Nigel Jones, top right, have been given bravery awards for saving their mother Debbie, centre . 'I managed to get into the house but then I must have had a fit and fell unconscious. 'There were only me and the kids in the house, they've never seen me like that before. 'Ryan was on the phone and he was telling Emma what to do. They already had me in the recovery position before the paramedics got here.' Debbie was taken to the University Hospital of North Durham but has now been released. She added: 'Jonny has always told them to call 999 if I was to ever unwell. 'They always asked 'how would we know?' and we used to say I would look like I was asleep. 'It shows they've always listened. I can't thank them enough.' Nigel Jones, patient support clinician, said: 'I thought Ryan was fantastic, he was a little superstar. And his sister was also calm. 'Their parents should be very proud of them both.' A North East Ambulance Service spokesperson added: 'We would like to congratulate Ryan and Emma on their quick-thinking actions, and for remaining calm when they must have been very frightened. 'We would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to our call operator Michelle Watson and patient support clinician Nigel Jones for the way they handled the call.' The main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures or fits but there are many different types, depending on the area of the brain affected. These can occur when a person is awake or asleep. Doctors classify seizures by how much of the brain is affected. Partial (or focal) seizures affect a small part of the brain and generalised seizures affect most or all of the brain. Some seizures are unclassified because they fit neither category. If you see someone having a seizure, there are some simple steps you can take to help. If the person is suffering from convulsions, wait until they stop and then put them into the recovery position until they have recovered. It is not usually necessary to call an ambulance after a seizure, but you should call 999 if: the seizure has not stopped after five minutes, the person has more than one seizure without recovering in between, you know it is the person's first seizure, the person is injured, has breathing problems, or needs emergency medical attention for any other reason or if the person’s behaviour after a seizure is unsafe. A seizure that lasts longer than 30 minutes or a series of seizures where the person does not regain consciousness in between is called Status epilepticus. This is a medical emergency and requires treatment as soon as possible. You can be trained to treat status epilepticus if you care for someone with epilepsy, but if you haven't had any training, it is important to call 999 for an ambulance immediately if you suspect status epilepticus.

"Ordeal: Rosemary Fadle appeared at two sensational trials over the past few weeks . It has been an extraordinarily painful and harrowing week for Rosemary Fadle. She had the satisfaction of seeing Jimmy Savile’s partner in crime Ray Teret – who raped her when she was an innocent 15-year-old – convicted for numerous offences for which he is likely to spend the rest of his life in jail. Then, in a bizarre coincidence, days after giving evidence against Teret she flew to Paris to face the ‘nightmare’ of appearing as a witness in the high-profile trial of businessman Ian Griffin for the murder of his wealthy Polish girlfriend Kinga Legg. Bizarrely, the two sensational trials both reached a verdict on Friday with Griffin, like Teret, found guilty. Waiving her right to anonymity and speaking about her ordeal for the first time, Rosemary, 61, said: ‘Friday was a simply incredible because both the trials finished on the same day. It was an amazing coincidence. ‘I had got back from France the day before and to be watching the news with both these trials involving myself leading the broadcasts was unreal. ‘Obviously I was delighted that Teret was convicted and that included his offences against me. ‘I just wish my evidence had made a difference to Ian Griffin.’ The verdict in Paris disappointed her as she was there as a witness for the defence, and gave a damning character reference against Kinga Legg, who had once been part of her social set in the North West nightclub scene. Rosemary added: ‘It has been the most stressful time of my life and I have found it very difficult to sleep with the knowledge of what I had to do. ‘Now I feel exhausted but very proud for having helped to put Ray Teret behind bars. ‘I just hope that now other women will feel confident enough to come forward and report the abuse they suffered at his hands.’ Rosemary said it is the Teret trial that will haunt her. She revealed she was left particularly distraught because she had to face up to the memory of introducing a 12-year-old friend to Teret, who was then raped by him while she was in the same room. Scroll down for video . ‘It is something I will never be able to forget,’ she said. ‘I saw that particular victim in the lead up to his trial and I apologised for what had happened all those years ago. She just said that it had stolen her childhood from her and that she had tried to forget it. ‘She didn’t want to dig up the past and there must be hundreds of young girls in the same position. ‘Ray was a very cunning paedophile. He would do what he wanted to do and just act like nothing had happened. He even befriended my parents and would drop me off in his Bentley when it was time for me to go home. ‘We were so naive. I wouldn’t have known how to tell my parents. Because I did not have the experience of screaming and pushing him off me, I did not realise I had been raped.’ Partners in crime: Disgraced DJ and TV presenter Jimmy Savile and his chauffeur Ray Teret (right) soak up the sun in the 1970s . Charity event: Kinga (second from the left) and Rosemary (second right) pictured together at a party . Such was Rosemary’s level of naivety that when Teret latched on to her mention of a 12-year-old friend she thought nothing of introducing them. ‘I had mentioned her to him and he had encouraged me to bring her round,’ she said. ‘We were all lying down on his bed with Ray in the middle. Then he said to my friend, “This is not going to hurt”, and got on top of her. ‘I just lay there frozen to the spot while they had sex. When he finished he just started chatting away about his DJ-ing. It was as though nothing had happened.’ Rosemary was a pupil at Norris Road School in Sale, Manchester, in the summer of 1968 when she first encountered Teret, then 27, who had made his name as a DJ on the pirate station Radio Caroline. She said: ‘He lived with three other young DJs on the ground floor of a three-storey townhouse in Sale. My older sister happened to be renting the top floor and I would often go round to see her after school. If my sister wasn’t in, Ray would invite me into his flat to wait for her. He had the largest room in the house – on the ground floor with a big bay window. There were pictures of him with the Beatles on the wall and in the middle of the room was a kingsize bed. ‘I suppose I was flattered by the attention and it wasn’t until the third occasion that anything happened. ‘He told me to lie down on the bed and said he was not going to hurt me. He came and lay on top of me. Before I really knew what was happening he was having sex with me. ‘There was no tenderness. It was just clinical. Over the seven years he abused me, he never kissed me. He would just have sex, pass me a tissue and then start talking like nothing had happened. ‘Had I ended up running out of his house I might have thought of myself as a victim but he was very clever. He would always keep me there for an extra hour. He told me how lucky I was that I had lost my virginity to him rather than to another man who might have hurt me.’ Ray Teret (left) and businessman Ian Griffin (right) arriving art court in Manchester and Paris respectively . Last week Teret, 73, who used to be known by the nickname ‘Ugli’, was convicted of 18 offences against 11 separate victims aged 13 to 15. The offences were committed between 1962 to 1978 and the court heard that while some victims had been able to get on with their lives, others were ‘very significantly damaged’. A few years after the abuse had begun, Rosemary began dating Teret’s housemate and fellow DJ Mel Scholes. Ray wasn’t bothered about me seeing Mel because he had so many schoolgirls visiting him at that time,’ she said. ‘But if Mel and I fell out or he was in the house with me alone then he would force himself on to me again.’ At the time, Teret provided DJs for some of the North West’s most popular night spots. He was also very close to Savile, acting as his chauffeur on occasions. Rosemary said: ‘I met Savile once. Ray and Mel had moved to a big detached house that we called Teret Towers. I was lying on the floor reading a book when Savile came in. ‘He saw me and began to flirt. I remember he put his foot on my back and said he was going to walk on me. Ray gave him a glare and Mel took me out of there. ‘The strain of what was happening at Teret Towers put paid to my relationship with Mel. I couldn’t understand why he and the other DJs could not stop Ray from seducing so many schoolgirls.’ Living in the North West meant that throughout her life she would occasionally bump into Teret in a bar, a club or at the shops. Rosemary, who has five children from two different relationships, said: ‘We would usually say hello and nothing more. ‘On one occasion I saw him when I was shopping with my ten-year-old daughter who was a particularly pretty little girl. ‘Ray immediately started asking who she was and looking for an introduction. I rushed her away from him. It made me feel sick.’ Rosemary went on to be a successful businesswoman running bars and nightclubs in the North West, and was delighted when the death of Jimmy Savile triggered a re-examination of historical sex abuse. The Hotel Bristol in Paris where the Polish millionairess was found murdered by her boyfriend . To help secure Teret’s conviction she gave three video-recorded interviews to detectives but then also went to Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court to give evidence. ‘I had no screen,’ she said, ‘and Ray was intimidating me throughout my evidence but I was determined that justice should be done. ‘Ray was just a few feet away from me and he spent the entire time making eye contact with me, nodding and shaking his head. It was truly terrifying. ‘I held it together really well. I stood for the whole time clinging on to a rail and the only time I cried was when I had to recall going to see a counsellor when I was 50 years old. ‘That brought it home to me just how this man had ruined my life.’ It was just days after giving evidence against Teret that Rosemary was called to be a witness in the case of Ian Griffin. Rosemary said she had become involved after pictures of her and Kinga emerged and she was contacted by Griffin’s distraught mother, Janet. ‘She asked me what I knew of Kinga and how I could help,’ said Rosemary. ‘Well, I knew Kinga from 2002 when she was dating a friend of mine called Harry Gaynon. Kinga admitted to me that she had a problem with drink which made her violent. On one occasion I saw her slap Harry across the face at a party and on another occasion she left him badly scarred. ‘No one deserves what she went through but I thought it was important that the French court knew what she could be like.’ Griffin was found guilty and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. Rosemary said: ‘I was very surprised that he received such a long sentence.’ She described the Paris trial as ‘a complete nightmare’. ‘I was shown to a waiting room which was full of Kinga’s friends and family and I felt awful knowing that my testimony was going to upset them all. ‘It was very uncomfortable but having been contacted by Ian’s mother I felt duty-bound to say what I knew about Kinga’s behaviour in relationships and her problem controlling her temper when drunk.’","Rosemary Fadle gave evidence at two sensational trials in the past week .

"Natascha Kampusch, abducted on her way home from school in 1998, released a book called 3,096 Days - based on her time in captivity . A rogue policeman who attempted to obtain a DNA sample from a young girl to prove that she was the daughter of kidnap victim Natascha Kampusch has been jailed for ten months. The Viennese officer was carrying out an illegal investigation in an attempt to expose a theory behind the notorious Austrian abduction - that there was more than one abuser involved. In 2011 and 2012, he went into a primary school in Modling, Lower Austria, to try to get the DNA sample. He wanted to prove not only that the young girl was the daughter of Ms Kampusch, but that she had been sexually abused by accomplices of Ms Kampusch's abductor, Wolfgang Priklopil. After being found guilty of an abuse of office, the suspended 63-year-old police officer must now serve a ten-month prison sentence,The Local reports. His case is closely connected to the retired president of Austria’s Supreme Court, Johann Rzeszut, who last year was part of a commission charged with investigating official negligence in the Kampusch case. Mr Rzeszut said that he found 27 inconsistencies and omissions in the case and claimed that police ignored several vital pieces of evidence. It is alleged that the influential former judge is the one who first persuaded the jailed police officer to look into the case - asking him to find proof that Priklopil had not acted alone. Wolfgang Priklopil (left) abducted and abused Natascha Kampusch (pictured right after her escape in 2006) Natascha Kampusch was 10 years old when she was taken by Wolfgang Priklopil while on her way home from school in 1998. Priklopil carved a secret, sound-proof cellar beneath his home in a suburb of Vienna in which to keep her captive for eight years. Long considered the victim of a paedophile who had murdered her, Miss Kampusch finally escaped in August 2006. When Priklopil realised she had got out of the house, he killed himself by lying down in front of an oncoming train. Since then, the case has been shrouded in mystery. In 2010, a leading policeman, Oberst Franz Kroell, was assigned to investigate the possibility that Priklopil did not act alone. Pictured above - the sound-proof room that Natascha Kampusch was kept in during her eight years in captivity . Six months after the probe ended, and after concluding that it was unlikely Priklopil did act alone, he was found shot dead on the terrace of his home in Graz. At first his death was labelled as suicide, but last year Austrian authorities suggested he may have been murdered. The controversy sparked an independent investigation into the death and the original handling of the Kampusch case -  led by Johann Rzeszut - the man said to have hired the rogue policeman just jailed.","Policeman wanted to prove abductor, Wolfgang Priklopil, had help .

"Dispute: The row centred on garlic from China . Britain has been forced to hand over £15 million to the European Union to settle a bizarre dispute over garlic. Brussels demanded the sum because it ruled that the UK did not charge enough duty on shipments of garlic from China. Judges at Europe’s top court said the British taxman should have classed the imported garlic as fresh rather than frozen, and so charged a higher tariff. Last night critics mockingly dubbed the charge a Dracula Tax, because of garlic’s fabled anti-vampire powers, and said the case illustrated the power of EU institutions and the way they increasingly get the better of Britain. Just last week, The Mail on Sunday revealed that the European Commission is taking the Government to court to make it easier for migrants to get benefits by scrapping restrictions on who can claim child benefit and tax credits. Judges at the Luxembourg court have also overruled Britain’s objections to a cap on bankers’ bonuses, in what is seen as a damaging blow to the City. Tory Sir Bill Cash, a leading Eurosceptic MP who chairs the European Scrutiny Committee, said last night: ‘This £15 million is a lot of money by any standards, but what I call the Dracula Tax is just yet another example of what is now becoming an endemic problem. ‘We are increasingly losing cases in the court – it’s a natural consequence us our being boxed into a European legal framework that is not dependent on policy. I think this case is petty but it also highlights what we are up against.’ He believes Parliament needs to pass a new law that would enable Ministers to bypass the demands of the European court as well as human rights legislation. The garlic case took almost a decade to be resolved. It began when the European Anti-Fraud Office inspected ‘imports of fresh garlic originating in China’ and concluded that the authorities in Britain had made ‘obvious administrative errors’. Investigators claimed Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) staff had not been checking whether the garlic coming into Britain was fresh or frozen, and simply charged the lower rate of duty applied to frozen vegetables when the cargo was fresh. Eventually the European Commission told the UK to pay it just over £20 million for underpayment of duty on imports of garlic between January 2005 and December 2006. Britain refused to pay up, claiming there was nothing owed, and was taken to court. The dispute came after Britain did not know whether it was paying for frozen or fresh imported garlic . HMRC said it originally believed the garlic, which was stored at -3C, counted as completely frozen but later scientific evidence suggested otherwise. The agreements with the Chinese food companies concerned could not be changed retrospectively, so the extra duty could not be collected later. HMRC has now paid £15 million as it was allowed to keep a quarter of the bill to cover the costs of collection. A spokesman for HMRC said last night: ‘We were naturally disappointed with the judgment. ‘The Commission’s case relied heavily on facts regarding the freezing point of garlic which came to light subsequently and which we did not know at the time the classification rulings were issued.’","Brussels demanded Britain pay the sum for garlic shipped from China .

"Thousands of Russell Hobbs irons have been recalled after reports that some burst into flames and injured customers. The company has withdrawn 15 different models and advised anyone affected to stop using their iron immediately. But it was revealed that the company was first made aware of the danger 18 months ago and only decided to recall the affected products after an expose by BBC's Watchdog programme. Scroll down for video . Russell Hobbs recalled 15 models, including this SteamGlide iron, after a BBC Watchdog probe, but it was revealed the company was first made aware of the fault 18 months ago . Karen Givens, of Southport, Merseyside, suffered burns and an electric shock when her SuperGlide steam iron blew up. Her husband Bill told The Mirror he is considering taking legal action, adding: 'It's unbelievable that a company of this size didn't recall the irons as soon as they knew about the problem over a year ago.' But managing director Tim Wright defended the decision and said: 'I would like to apologise to the people that have been injured by one of these irons. 'This absolutely was not our intention and we work very hard as a brand to ensure that we bring products to market that are fit for purpose.' A statement on the Russell Hobbs website says: 'As part of our ongoing quality monitoring program, we've identified an issue with a small number of our irons, that may carry a risk that the flex may fail. 'If you do have an affected iron, please stop using it immediately.' The Russell Hobbs website warns: 'If you do have an affected iron, please stop using it immediately' Angry customers posted pictures to the Russell Hobbs Facebook page including complainants who say their iron caught fire while they were using it. Rebecca Scurr wrote: 'Just want to warn people of potential danger my husband was ironing today when it caught fire and burnt him. 'Lucky he quickly threw it to the floor (damaging our kitchen floor) could of been a lot worse'. She later added that customer services had been 'fantastic' in handling her complaint. Another customer, Clare Joanna, posted a picture to the Facebook page of her injured hand after using the iron in August. She wrote: 'Today when using the Russel Hobbs Steam Glide iron it suddenly sparked and has burnt my hand badly. 'The electrical burn is incredibly painful and I would not want anyone else to go through this.' The model number is located on a label the underside of the heel of the iron. Those that are affected are: 18651, 18742, 19220, 19221, 18743, 19840, 18720, 15081, 19222, 19400, 20260, 18741, 20280, 20550-10, 20560-10. Jonathan Wells told BBC programme Watchdog that his iron failed in June this year. He said: 'I realised from the pain in my hand that came straight after it that the iron had caught fire somehow and burned my hand. 'The pain was getting so bad I had to go into the kitchen and run it under the cold tap for probably about an hour.' Russell Hobbs have apologised to customers for any inconvenience caused and are offering a replacement or refund. Mr Wright added the flex in question is no longer being used. He said: 'When the problems, however isolated, with the particular flex that was being used in a few batches of our irons became apparent, we started working with Trading Standards to monitor the situation. 'We take our responsibilities as a manufacturer very seriously and customer safety is always our first priority, and it is because of these factors that we decided to issue the product recall.' A company spokesman said: 'The company's primary concern is, as ever, for the safety of their consumers. Russell Hobbs has always taken their responsibilities as a manufacturer extremely seriously. 'The decision to recall these products has been taken with the utmost consideration for the public.' Russell Hobbs say customers with one of these models should also check the batch code, which is written at the bottom of the label. They say: 'If it starts with 045 through to 365 and ends with 12 or starts with 001 through to 195 and ends with 13, then you have an affected iron.' Affected customers are advised to call Russell Hobbs's customer service department on 0800 307 7616 or, from a mobile, 0333 103 9663.","Company recalled models and told people to stop using irons immediately .

"Pep Guardiola’s managerial office in the Allianz Arena last April was a despondent place. ‘I got it wrong, man, I got it totally wrong,’ Guardiola is heard to say. ‘It’s a monumental f*** up, a total mess. The biggest f*** up of my career.’ It is the night of the 4-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final and the intensity of Guardiola’s self-castigation is an indication of what was at stake. In that room with Guardiola are his assistants, Domenec Torrent, Carles Planchart and Manuel Estiarte but, as Marti Perarnau puts it in his book, ‘Pep Confidential’, they are there to keep Guardiola company and give him moral support rather than to offer any serious analysis. Last season's semi-final thrashing at the hands of Real Madrid was a chastening moment for Pep Guardiola, who knows he will not satisfy his bosses until he delivers Bayern Munich another European Cup . Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates scoring the third of Real Madrid's four goals away to Bayern Munich last season . Gareth Bale was also instrumental in the seismic semi-final result at the Allianz Arena . The meeting goes on until well after midnight, with more of the same from Guardiola. Tactically he had failed, a victim of his own chronic indecision. In the immediate aftermath of first leg of the semi-final, a 1-0 defeat at the Bernabeu, Guardiola had fixed on a 3-4-3 formation for the return leg. ‘Don’t let me change my mind!’ he joked with his assistants. He did so, twice: first to a 4-2-3-1 and then, after speaking to the players, who were keen on all-out attack, to 4-2-4. For Carlo Ancelotti, an excellent coach, whose teams play attractive football but who ultimately was schooled in Serie A, it was all too easy. Real Madrid simply picked Bayern off at set pieces and on the counter-attack. And Guardiola was made to look an idiot, which in a five-year managerial career is unique. Carlo Ancelotti's game plan was executed to perfection as Bayern were picked off on the break . Ronaldo adds further misery with a low free-kick to put Real four goals ahead in the second leg last season . BARCELONA . La Liga 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11 . Copa del Rey 2008-09, 2011-12 . Supercopa de Espana 2009, 2010, 2011 . Champions League 2008-09, 2010-11 . UEFA Super Cup 2009, 2011 . FIFA Club World Cup 2009, 2011 . BAYERN MUNICH . Bundesliga 2013-14 . DFB-Pokal 2013-14 . UEFA Super Cup 2013 . FIFA Club World Cup 2013 . Guardiola’s team should progress against Shakhtar, who don’t even have a home, their city currently being destroyed by civil war and their stadium literally caught in the cross-fire. But after that it begins to become interesting for Guardiola. His reaction to last season’s defeat suggests that he knows that whatever he does at Bayern Munich, if he fails to win the Champions League he will be judged a failure. It may seem ridiculous, as he could easily win a hat-trick of league titles in his three years at the club and last year he won the Double. The problem with the Bundesliga is that any manager who doesn’t win the title with Bayern at present should really resign in shame. It didn't need Saturday's 8-0 win over Hamburg, once Bayern's principal rivals, to tell us that. The figures give the game away. Bayern’s turnover is £365million; their nearest rival, Borussia Dortmund, currently mired in a relegation battle, earn £195m. Bayern last lifted the European Cup in 2013, beating Borussia Dortmund in the final at Wembley . That occasion provided the perfect send off for Jupp Heynckes, whom Guardiola succeeded that summer . Manager Ottmar Hitzfeld lifts the famous trophy after Bayern's triumph over Valencia in the 2001 final . 1974 Beat Atletico Madrid 4-0 in a replay after 1-1 draw . Manager: Udo Lattek . 1975 Beat Leeds United 2-0 . Manager: Dettmar Cramer . 1976 Beat Saint-Etienne 1-0 . Manager: Dettmar Cramer . 2001 Beat Valencia 5-4 on penalties after 1-1 draw . Manager: Ottmar Hitzfeld . 2013 Beat Borussia Dortmund 2-1 . Manager: Jupp Heynckes . When it comes to the sponsors lining up to fund the clubs, the difference is even starker. Who wants to be associated with second-best and second-biggest? So Bayern earn £195 million a year in commercial income to Dortmund’s £92m. And Dortmund of course dwarf the rest of the Bundesliga. It is the corollary of Champions League: what makes Europe’s competition so strong, has emasculated domestic leagues beyond recognition. Jose Mourinho isn't always right but he was on Monday when he goaded Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern, saying their task was simpler in Europe because they could be so dominant at home – unlike in England. ‘In Germany, for Bayern, it’s a promenade,’ said Mourinho. It is why even winning a treble of two domestic cups and the league title won’t save Laurent Blanc at PSG at the end of the season. Winning the Champions League and securing global recognition is what it’s all about now whether you work for Johnny-come-lately Qatari owners or for Karl-Heinz Rummenigge at the world’s most-traditional football club. Pep Guardiola arrives at the Arena Lviv ahead of a training session before Bayern's tie with Shakhtar . The Bayern coach is singularly focused on delivering another European Cup to the Allianz Arena . Bayern and Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer arrives at the Arena Lviv ahead of the last 16, first leg tie . Arjen Robben will be a major weapon if Bayern are to achieve their Champions League aspirations this year . The last 16 tie with Shakhtar Donetsk is being stages 750 miles west in Lviv after the Donbass Arena was shelled by pro-Russian separatists who currently control the city . Of course there are upsides to the problem. It provides us with the greatest football competition in terms of quality, superior to the World Cup in that regard and with more genuine contenders. And it has become the measure of true greatness among coaches. That’s why Mourinho’s words were aimed as much at his Spanish nemesis Guardiola as at Blanc and PSG. Mourinho is, of course, one of only five coaches to have won the Champions League with more than one team. Ironically, Guardiola’s predecessor at Bayern, Jupp Heynckes, is one of the others. Guardiola has won the trophy twice – impressive at 44 - but he is not yet on that list. It was almost as if Mourinho wished to remind him that it is Heynckes’ achievement of the treble which he requires if he wishes to demonstrate his credentials now. And given the level of Guardiola’s self castigation in the aftermath of that Real Madrid defeat last year, you suspect that the Bayern coach believes it too. Jose Mourinho - who has won the trophy at two clubs - aimed a barb indirectly at nemesis Pep Guardiola . Arjen Robben (centre) celebrates one of Bayern's eight goals in their thumping of Hamburg on Saturday . Bayern's superiority over the rest of the Bundesliga is plain for all to see .

"The  mother who was found dead this week in the Avon Gorge feared her baby daughter would be taken away from her, it has been claimed. Charlotte Bevan, 30, was 'closely monitored' during her pregnancy and had reportedly been referred to social workers on three occasions in the run-up to her baby Zanni Tiana being born. A source said it caused the new mother - who was believed to be suffering from depression, schizophrenia and severe sleep deprivation when she left the hospital - to develop fears that her newborn child would be taken into care. Her family believe Miss Bevan had also stopped taking medication so that she could breastfeed when her child arrived. Charlotte Bevan, 30, who was found dead on Wednesday in the Avon Gorge, had been referred to social services three times and feared her baby would be taken away from her, it has been claimed . The new mother was captured on CCTV looking down at her daughter Zaani Tiana while she walked past at least three staff members who were crowded around a vending machine . The charity walker then walked out of hospital with her newborn baby daughter on Tuesday. She had apparently developed a fear that her child would be taken away from her . Miss Bevan was found dead at the foot of the gorge on Wednesday. Her four-day-old baby was found dead on a cliff face hours later. A source told the Sun: 'Charlotte was closely monitored throughout her pregnancy and had three referalls from midwives. But she was clearly distraught by the time she left the hospital.' Miss Bevan was seen on CCTV walking out of the maternity ward at St Michael's Hospital, Bristol, holding her four-day-old baby. The footage shows her walking past at least four nurses without being stopped on Tuesday night. A walker spotted her slippers and a baby's blanket on the cliff's edge close to the Clifton Suspension Bridge and yesterday police found her daughter's body nearby. Bristol City Council could not be reached for comment today. But it said earlier that it anticipated the Safeguarding Adults Board and Children Board would launch a serious case review into the case. People from Bristol and also outside of the city have left flowers at the gorge where the mother and child died - but her friends want to know why she was able to 'just walk out' of hospital . Messages from people who knew and loved Charlotte have also been left in close to the Clifton Suspension Bridge . This graphic shows the relative locations of the hospital, Miss Bevan's home, and the Clifton bridge . The hospital has also launched an investigation. A spokesman admitted that patients in the maternity ward are free to come and go as they please, prompting calls for greater monitoring of new mothers – especially those with a known history of mental illness. Miss Bevan had walked 1.5miles to the picturesque Avon Gorge, just five minutes away from the home she shared with her partner and Zaani's father, Pascal Malbrouck, in the upmarket Clifton Village. Neigbours revealed yesterday how she was planning a party to celebrate Christmas and the birth of her daughter. Jonathan Hurford, 54, who lived close to their flat in Clifton, Bristol, said: 'She was always such a bubbly and happy character. That's why it's such a shock to us and the other neighbours that this terrible thing should have happened. Miss Bevan (pictured left with partner Pascal Malbrouck and right in the late stages of her pregnancy) had reportedly stopped taking her medication so she could breastfeed when her baby arrive . Mr Malbrouck, who is originally from French territory Reunion in the Indian Ocean, and Miss Bevan were planning to hold a Christmas party to celebrate the new arrival . The young mother (pictured left and right with Mr Malbrouck) was believed to have been suffering from depression, schizophrenia and severe sleep deprivation when she walked out of the hospital . 'She was actually organising a Christmas event to celebrate Christmas and her baby arriving and we were going to have a drink. 'She was instigating a community initiative for Christmas which makes it all the more poignant that she's not around not to enjoy it'. The new mother had been educated at the elite Wells Cathedral music school near Bristol. Family and friends said she had first suffered with depression following the sudden death of her father in 2000 from a brain tumour. Posts on her Facebook profile revealed that she had been 'hearing voices' and needed 'love and support'. Earlier this week, Miss Bevan's mother Rachel Fortune, 59, paid tribute to her 'beautiful daughter and granddaughter' who are now 'at peace'. Police confirmed on Thursday that the body found at the bottom of the Avon Gorge was Miss Bevan . Flowers and messages of condolence have been left close to the spot where the mother and daughter died . The steep gorge, spanned by the Clifton Suspension Bridge, runs for ten miles from the Bristol Channel into Somerset . In a statement, she also thanked 'all the hospital staff at St Michael's and the mental healthcare team, past and present'. Mr Malbrouck, 37, who saw his girlfriend and baby half an hour before they left the hospital, said Miss Bevan had been badly sleep-deprived, but happy. He said he could not think why she would disappear. A spokesperson for University Hospitals Bristol Trust said yesterday that it 'will be conducting a thorough review of the care Charlotte and her baby received to see if there was anything we could have done' to prevent their 'tragic and unexplained' deaths. They added that pregnant women were screened for new and existing mental health problems and were assessed for increased risk of perinatal mental ill health. Officers slowly descended into the Avon Gorge searching for the baby while a sniffer dog team worked below . A member of the public found some items believed to Miss Bevan at the top of the gorge and then called the police, who spent the day trying to find the baby . Steep drop: The Avon Gorge runs for ten miles from the sea, through Bristol and into Somerset . Investigation: Police gathered under the Clifton Suspension Bridge in the Avon Gorge on Wednesday night after finding Miss Bevan's body . Avon and Somerset Police found the body using a helicopter fitted with a search light . 'Women who are identified as potentially being at risk have consultant-led care, involvement of appropriate mental health teams as necessary and involvement of their GP,' she said. 'We cannot stop any mother leaving unless there are legal restrictions on her movements'. The spokesperson added that Ms Bevan was expected to be discharged from the unit a few days after her disappearance and said staff had 'no indication' that she planned to leave early. Yesterday, Bristol City Council said it anticipated Bristol Safeguarding Adults Board and Bristol Safeguarding Children Board would launch a serious case review into the case. 'This is a truly tragic incident and our deepest sympathies are with all of Charlotte's family and friends,' said John Readman, strategic director for people at the council. Clothing: Miss Bevan was seen walking through the hospital and appeared to be wearing just a pair of leggings and a jumper . Miss Bevan was seen calmly pushing open the door and walks into the lobby with her little girl in her arms . The new mother has no coat and no socks, with just a thin pair of hospital slippers on her feet . After strolling  past what looks like a reception desk, she leaves the hospital through two sets of automatic doors and steps onto the street outside . Miss Bevan had been at St Michael's Hospital in Bristol when she walked out with her young daughter . The hospital said it is launching an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Miss Bevan's leaving the maternity ward . 'We fully anticipate an independent Serious Case Review, which would look closely at the circumstances of this case and the role of all agencies involved, including health, mental health and social services. 'Its findings would be published once complete.' Rachael Dobson of the charity PANDAS – the Pre- and Post-Natal Depression Advice Service – added: 'All this should have been preventable. 'It's a concern that someone has been able to leave the ward unnoticed without having to tell someone where they are going.' Psychologist Dr Margaret Oates, who runs a unit for mothers with mental health difficulties in London, said Miss Bevan may have been suffering postpartum psychosis – the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms following childbirth. 'This is much more severe than postnatal depression and requires anyone suffering from it to have a very close eye kept on them,' she said. 'Those with mental health problems previously are at far greater risk of developing it.'","Charlotte Bevan, from Bristol, was 'closely monitored' during pregnancy .

"More than 1,000 alleged paedophiles have been arrested in Britain in the past 12 months thanks to new high-tech cyber tracking methods, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The wave of arrests is unprecedented – more than five times the 2012-13 figure of 192 – and shows how remote access to abusers’ use of the internet by silent automated search ‘bots’ appears to be turning the war against internet paedophilia. Over the same period, more than 1,300 children at risk of abuse have been ‘rescued’ through the same methods, and given police protection or placed in care – another huge increase on the 569 total from the previous year. This graphic shows the fight against paedophiles is global - with agencies in the U.S. and Britain working together . This newspaper was last week given exclusive access to CEOP, the body formerly known as the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, which since October last year has come under the command of the National Crime Agency (NCA). The figures above relate its own operations and do not include arrests made by local police forces. CEOP’s director Johnny Gwynne said the key to success is the use of clues in abusive images harvested from the internet to mount investigations into the perpetrators of real-world ‘contact abuse’ of children. He said: ‘We are dealing with the real world, but it just so happens that the evidence for almost all our investigations starts in the digital world. When we see images of children being abused, we are always looking for the real victim and the real perpetrator.’ Mr Gwynne, a former senior police officer in Scotland, added that when someone was found to have shared or downloaded images that indicated a sexual interest in children, that ‘is a strong indicator that you have a predisposition that represents a risk’. Explaining CEOP’s role in safeguarding possible victims, he said officers establish whether a person with such interests has children of their own, or is in frequent contact with them. A grandfather, found to have been abusing his grandson, was among those caught using CEOP information . ‘If you’re arrested for possessing indecent images, and you have two kids, they could be removed from your home, or you could be, even if there’s no evidence you’ve abused them,’ he explained. CEOP’s success will be trumpeted by the Prime Minister at an international child abuse summit this week. David Cameron will stress the importance of international co-operation, and the introduction of new software which is starting to penetrate paedophiles’ last online refuge – the so-called ‘dark web’. Mr Cameron will also disclose details of the new Child Abuse Image Database. This will enable police and other investigators to co-ordinate inquiries more closely, and to establish whether a seized image has come to light before. Mr Gwynne said: ‘Previously, you could have had detectives in Northumbria and Thames Valley working on the same image seized from different individuals, without realising it. That duplication will now be eliminated.’ The NCA has 141 staff devoted to child protection but they work closely with other sections of the Agency, especially those dealing with cyber and organised crime. It co-ordinates closely with Britain’s 45 local police forces, security and intelligence services, sister agencies in 40 countries, and NCA officers stationed abroad. A second offender was caught blackmailing a girl to perform sexual acts over a webcam after she alerted CEOP using its new 'Click CEOP' button . As well as law enforcement, CEOP includes a strong educational component. It works with teachers and social workers to warn children of the risks of abuse. In the past year, said Mr Gwynne, 3.4 million children have received educational material, and have become aware of the ‘Click CEOP’ button now embedded in many websites – a means for children to contact CEOP staff around the clock. At CEOP’s core, however, is the development of intelligence from the internet. Mr Gwynne said: ‘It used to be the case that unless a victim came forward and spoke up, we were blind. Now digital images give us a starting point. We are looking for the real world, contact offence. The digital offence gets us through the door.’ Estimates of the proportion of men who both view online images and commit contact abuse vary wildly: between 16 and more than 60 per cent. But is evident there is an enormous overlap. At the same time, Mr Gwynne pointed out, contact offences might well start online. ‘Often a paedophile will groom his victim using the internet, then arrange to meet.’ One critical source of information is NCMEC, the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which sends CEOP about 1,200 tip-offs every month gleaned from the vast web servers based in America. Two children were put under police protection after CEOP discovered a man was going to sell viewings of him raping a child . NCMEC gets its information from automated search tools, which identify known abusive images by their digital fingerprints and paedophile ‘chat’ through keywords. NCMEC looks for IP (internet protocol) addresses, which will reveal whether a suspected paedophile is based in Britain. Until now, like professional criminals, some paedophiles have tried to conceal their locations by using the ‘dark web’ – software that hides IP addresses by routing internet communications through numerous ‘front’ addresses in many different countries. Understandably, Mr Gwynne and his colleagues are cagey about the methods they use to penetrate this secrecy. But sources say they are making rapid progress. An NCA spokeswoman said that while it was proud of the 1,000 arrests this year, the rise ought to be treated with caution as 700 of them had stemmed from a single inquiry called Operation Notarise. It is likely that the number of arrests will fall next year. But she added: ‘Offenders need to know that the internet is not a safe anonymous space for accessing indecent images. They leave a digital footprint – and we will find it.’","More than 1,000 alleged paedophiles arrested in Britain in past 12 months .

"The BBC's new robotic camera system was introduced to cut costs, but exasperated news presenters continue to pay the price - to the amusement of viewers. Problems arose after their introduction when the broadcaster moved to its new London headquarters in Broadcasting House as part of a £1billion revamp last year - and now it is feared the issue could get worse when a new computer system is launched. And viewers who caught the antics of the remotely-controlled robot cameras switching away from presenters reporting live or moving in the wrong direction have posted them online. Scroll down for video . BBC News presenter Martine Croxall was reporting live last month when the camera failed to focus on her . Glitches mean the cameras, which are attached to robotic heads and pedestals, and were aimed to eliminate the need for operators, can malfunction leading to exasperation from news presenters . One presenter plagued more often than most is Martine Croxall, who told viewers recently that she must be 'jinxed' after handling at least five incidents, with two in the same week. Last month, she calmly told viewers during an evening bulletin after the camera failed to focus on where she stood: 'I'm just going to move back to the main set. I know this has happened before. 'If I sidle in you can pretend you haven't noticed.' On a programme airing just a week later,  the camera swung away from her again, leading her to declare: 'Do you know I swear I'm jinxed. What am I gonna do?' Unsure of the camera's intentions, she says 'I'm going to stay where I am', she said as the camera zoomed back. 'I'll stay here.' Having endured five such incidents, Ms Croxall said: 'If I sidle in you can pretend you haven't noticed' She added: 'I'm just going to move back to the main set. I know this has happened before' The camera complications have become common enough that some choose to ignore them while others have attempted to fix problems themselves. In May last year, BBC business presenter Aaron Heslehurst told viewers you have 'gotta love these robotic cameras' before reach out in an attempt to switch the camera round. After being reprimanded, by producers, he said: 'They're worried I'm going to touch the cameras. I'm not touching your precious robots!' And Jane Hill was reporting live last year when the camera suddenly swung away and began focusing on random parts of the studio. A week later, it happened again, leading her to declare: 'Do you know I swear I'm jinxed. What am I gonna do?' She apologised, adding: 'Clearly not meant to be doing that' The robot cameras - which are ordinary broadcast cameras fixed to robotic heads and pedestals - are considered ideal for productions where the same smooth shot is needed to be repeated many times in the same programme and were supposed to eliminate the need to for operators. But glitches mean they sometimes malfunction. The Guardian reported that there are concerns the glitches may become even more frequent when BBC News replaces its computer system with a new one in the next two years. It is called the Electronic News Production System (ENPS) and this system communicates with a programme called Mosart which controls the cameras. The current ENPS and its replacement are set to run together for a period. A source told the newspaper: 'They are due to run together for some time. 'But bearing in mind the problems that happen with cameras already no one is quite sure what will happen when Mosart has to work with the old and a new system.' A BBC spokesperson said: 'The BBC is undertaking a procurement for a Newsroom Computer System under the Public Contracts Regulations (2006), having advertised in the Official Journal of the EU, reference 2013/S 174-300782. 'The BBC is not able to comment further on this procurement until the completion of that process. 'This is because the BBC must not do anything that might adversely affect that ongoing process, and due to commercial confidentiality.'","Robotic cameras were introduced to cut costs as part of £1billion revamp .

"European Union cash is set to be used to fund a ‘holiday camp’ for migrants in Calais in a scheme that was last night condemned as being an ‘encouragement’ for the many thousands desperate to enter the UK illegally. The new day centre for migrants is being built on a former children’s summer camp, next to Calais port, where hundreds of illegals try to board lorries each day in the hope of stowing away to Britain. The French government has demanded a £3 million grant from the EU, which would include money that ultimately comes from British taxpayers. Scroll down for video . Walk in the park: The former activity centre has slides and football pitches. The 'holiday camp' has been slammed by critics who say it is an encouragement for thousands of migrants . But critics of the plan have already compared the new centre to the notorious Sangatte camp, which was closed down in 2002 amid claims that it attracted thousands of migrants who wanted to enter Britain illegally. Michael Ellis, the Tory MP for Northampton North who sits on the influential Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘I think there is a danger that these sorts of facilities will be seen as an encouragement to migrants, whereas the French should be doing everything to disincentivise or discourage migrants from coming to Calais and creating problems for the British and for the town itself.’ The new permanent day centre is spread over about 12 acres of parkland and comes with two football pitches. It has almost a dozen park benches and there is a children’s slide and swings. French officials say that the new centre will be up and running by the middle of this month or by the beginning of January at the latest. It will have kitchens that will serve about 700 meals per day. There will be four halls where up to 400 migrants will be able to sit to stay warm. There are an estimated 2,500 migrants in Calais, from troubled countries including Eritrea, Sudan and Libya in Africa and the war-torn states of Syria and Afghanistan. The migrants, many of whom have smartphones, will be able to charge their mobiles at power points, helping them to surf the internet on their devices. The day centre will come with hot showers and toilet facilities, and a nurse to treat minor ailments and injuries. Critics warned the developments could encourage more people to flock to the area to try to access Europe . The French Government has asked for £3million from an EU grant to cope with swelling numbers of migrants . It is also believed that there will be an office in the complex which will be manned by officers from the UK Border Force. They will be there to inform the migrants of the ‘realities’ of entering Britain, in an apparent effort to dissuade them. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘I don’t think it’s a good idea. What will be created is a new Sangatte which will be a magnet for different sorts of migrants. Lorry-drivers have slammed the French government for building a new night shelter for migrants near the port of Calais. The camp - open only when the temperature falls below -5C - will accommodate 2,000 migrants in a converted 4,000sq ft warehouse. Driver Bertoni Domenigo, 45, from Brescia, Italy, who caught eight Vietnamese migrants in his lorry last week said: 'For us, the problem will get worse.' 'People traffickers will advertise this day centre as another reason to come to Calais to go to Britain. This day centre will definitely attract more migrants to Calais.’ French officials have said that the new complex will also contain dozens of cubicles which vulnerable migrants such as women and children will be able to sleep in and use as accommodation. The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, announced the plans to build the migrant centre in Calais in October, saying it will cost around £4.3 million to run each year. This weekend the EU revealed that the French government made an application for ‘emergency assistance’ from the EU’s Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) for £3.3 million. As Britain also pays towards the AMIF, British taxpayers will be part-funding the centre in Calais, when it is granted. French authorities have also built a camp next to a route used by lorry jumpers stowing away in vehicles . An EU spokesman said: ‘The assistance will cover basic services (drinking water, showers, toilets, daily meals, electricity, social and legal counselling) in a day centre for irregular immigrants near Calais.’ The remainder of the required £4.3 million will be provided by France’s interior ministry. Philippe Mignonet, deputy mayor of Calais, said: ‘We get blamed for doing something, and we get blamed for doing nothing. The new centre will not make Calais more appealing for illegal migrants – the appeal lies in England, in your benefit system and your illegal jobs market.’","French government has demanded £3million grant from the EU for camp .

"Three sets of twins were born in a 24-hour period at the same New York hospital, breaking all records for twin delivery at the maternity in the same day. The six babies — all healthy and happy — were born between Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning at Hudson Valley Hospital Center in Cortland. The first pair, Viggo and Cormac, were born to parents Leeah and Brodie Hoyer on Tuesday afternoon. 'We are very fortunate,' said Leeah Hoyer, whose husband is an instructor at the US Military Academy at West Point, to The Journal News. The proud parents pose for pictures with Viggo and Cormac (left), born to Leeah and Brodie Hoyer and girls Avery and Savanah (right), born to Jacqueline and Kieran Miller of Cortland Manor, New York . The third set of twins, Dulce Maria and Luisa Guadalupe, were born a bit prematurely but are doing well. Here parents Marie and Herbert Martinez and watch over them at the maternity's intensive care unit . Viggo was born at 2:15pm and weighed 6 pounds, 7 ounces. His twin Carmac arrived nine minutes later weighing 6 pounds, 6 ounces. They join big sister Lorna, who will turn 2-years-old later this month. Then on Wednesday morning came the second set of twins: baby girls Avery and Savanah, born one minute apart to parents Jacqueline and Kieran Miller, of Cortland Manor. '[I’m] definitely nervous, but very excited that they’re here,' Jacqueline Miller told NBC New York. The new mom says this has been been 'an emotional rollercoaster' but the parents are 'thrilled'and can't wait to take their baby girls home. 'Everything is ready for them,' Kieran Miller told the Daily Voice. 'It's just amazing.' Added Jacqueline Miller: 'We are thrilled to be new parents. We are excited for their next adventures.' Parents Kieran and Jacqueline hold their new daughters, Avery and Savanah, a few hours before taking them home from the Hudson Valley Hospital Center . The third set of twins arrived a few hours later on Wednesday to Marie Giron and Herbert Martinez of Peekskill. Dulce Maria was born weighing 4 pounds, 7 ounces. Her twin, Luisa Guadalupe, came into the world a minute later at 4 pounds, 8 ounces. The girls were born prematurely but are doing well. 'I'm so happy. This is my year. It's very exciting,' gushed proud dad Herbert Martinez to the Daily Voice. Twin girls Dulce Maria and Luisa Guadalupe were born prematurely but are doing well at the hospital intensive care unit . Herbert and Marie Martinez are the parents of twin girls Dulce Maria and Luisa Guadalupe, who were born weighting 4 pounds 7 ounces and 4 pounds 8 ounces, respectively . Herbert Martinez said his new daughters are his Christmas present. They join older siblings Daisy, 6, and Flavio, 4. 'Daisy is so happy, but Flavio wanted two boys,' Herbert Martinez told the Daily Voice. Staff at the Hudson Valley Hospital Center were even more surprised because another set of twins had just been born there a week prior, also shattering the record for most twin births in a week there. Parents Stephanie and Steven Cangialosi, of Peekskill, welcomed girls Amanda and Emma on Nov. 26. Girls Emma Rose and Amanda Grace were born to Peekskill couple Stephanie and Cangialosi on Nov. 26.  Their birth brings to four the number of sets of twins that were born at the Cortland hospital in the same week . 'To have three that came within a 24-hour time span, that’s really unusual and I think caught everybody by surprise,' OBGYN physician Megan Pierce told NBC New York. In total, the hospital has received seven set of twins this year, including the four in the past week. 'I don't know what happened with the moon,' Herbert Martinez quipped to the Journal News.","Maternity staff at Hudson Valley Hospital Center in Cortland, New York, delivered six babies between Tuesday and Wednesday .

"Cleared: Dennis Meighan pictured today . An Antique firearms collector sensationally revealed yesterday that he was hired to murder the male model who claimed he had an affair with former Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe. But in an interview with The Mail on Sunday, Dennis Meighan, now 68, said his involvement in the most sensational political scandal in a generation was later covered up. Until now, it was known only that Meighan supplied the gun used in an alleged attempt on former stable boy Norman Scott’s life. He says he was offered £13,500 – about £140,000 today – by a representative of Thorpe to kill Scott who, at the time, was ‘telling anyone who would listen’ he was in a relationship with the politician. After initially agreeing to carry out the murder, Meighan changed his mind. He confessed his role in the affair to police in 1975 but was shocked when they later gave him a prepared statement to sign. ‘It was half as long as my original statement and all the references to Thorpe had been removed,’ says Meighan. ‘It also cleared me completely. It was a cover-up, no question, but it suited me fine.’ It meant Meighan never had to give evidence when Thorpe and three others went on trial at the Old Bailey in 1979, accused of conspiring to murder Scott. All were acquitted and Thorpe, who died last week aged 85, always fiercely denied Scott’s claims of a gay affair. The scandal, however, ended his career. Meighan received numerous calls from journalists after his name was linked to the case. ‘I turned down all the initial requests but finally I arranged to speak to one reporter who said he would come to see me,’ he said. ‘I put the phone down, walked ten paces across the room and then it rang again. ‘A man with a Welsh accent said, “You can still be nicked, boyo”. The line then went dead. ‘It was clear my phone was bugged. I cancelled the meeting.’ Some weeks earlier Meighan had been contacted by old school friend Andrew Newton, who asked if he could supply him with a gun. ‘He knew I had a collection of antique firearms and knew I could get hold of a working gun.’ They arranged to meet at an Italian restaurant in Shepherd’s Bush, West London, and Newton brought along a man who ‘introduced himself as a representative of Jeremy Thorpe’. The shamed Liberal Leader: Jeremy Thorpe was involved in the most sensation political scandal of a generation . His Gay Lover: Norman Scott, was at the time, telling people he was in a relationship with the politician . The Would-be Assassin: Dennis Meighan pictured in the mid-seventies was offered £13,500 by representatives of Thorpe to murder Scott . The Innocent Victim: Scott's dog Rinka was shot dead after the former model was lured out to Dartmoor . Meighan said: ‘They spoke about Scott, said he was a horrible piece of work, and how he was squealing and being a nuisance and had to be silenced. I didn’t believe it at first but eventually they convinced me. They wanted me to get rid of him and offered me £13,500. ‘That was a lot of money then and I agreed. I don’t know why I said yes and I really don’t know if I’d have gone through with it.’ At the time Meighan was in his late 20s with a reputation in West London as a ‘tough guy’. He said: ‘I got in fights and did a bit of thieving, but nothing heavy. I’d never killed anyone before.’ A few days later he went to the pub where Scott was living near Barnstaple, Devon. ‘I went to have a look more than anything, but the gun was in the car. As soon as I opened my mouth and everyone heard my London accent they turned and looked at me. Scott had been saying London gangsters were after him. I knew then I wouldn’t be able to get away with it so I drove back to London. ‘I told Newton I was pulling out and he panicked because he was going to have to do it himself.’ On October 23, 1975, Newton lured Scott out to Dartmoor by pretending to be a minder hired to protect him from a hitman. After shooting Scott’s dog Rinka, Newton then allegedly tried to shoot Scott, only for the gun to jam. ‘Newton was arrested and I was visited by three policemen, at least that’s what they said they were,’ said Meighan. ‘They knew about me from Newton so I admitted it all in a statement. ‘I thought they’d nick me but they just said they’d be in touch. Then I got a call saying I needed to go to Brentford police station where I would be given an envelope containing a statement. He said if I liked it I should sign it and go. I couldn’t believe it.’","Dennis Meighan, 68, revealed he was hired to murder Norman Scott .

"Sir Peter Fahy, the chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, said police should not be left to decide what is acceptable free speech . Britain could be pushed towards a 'police state' in which officers are turned into Orwellian 'thought police' in the battle against extremism, one of the country's top cops has warned. Sir Peter Fahy, the chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, said police should not be left to decide what is acceptable free speech as the threat of severe terrorist attack intensifies. Instead politicians, academics and others in civil society should have to decide when radical Islam veers into extremism and when anti-gay or anti-women's rights sentiments cross the line. The vice-chair of the police's terrorism committee warned that unless this happened, it would be decided by 'securocrats' including the security service and police chiefs. 'If these issues [defining extremism] are left to securocrats then there is a danger of a drift to a police state,' he told The Guardian. 'I am a securocrat, it's people like me, in the security services, people with a narrow responsibility for counter-terrorism. It is better for that to be defined by wider society and not securocrats. 'There is a danger of us being turned into a thought police. This securocrat says we do not want to be in the space of policing thought or police defining what is extremism.' He called on universities and colleges to improve the way they identify extremist speakers on campuses to prevent vulnerable girls leaving the country to become Jihadi brides. 'The police service does not want to be in school or on university campuses controlling thought,' he said. 'But the best way to avoid this is for such institutions to have procedures to know the messages which are being promoted and for student bodies to have policies on whether preaching hatred towards homosexuality, allowing segregated meetings or advocating violent action overseas is acceptable or not.' This comes as police were accused of misusing controversial anti-terror powers to spy on journalists' phone records in a damning report by MPs. Members of the Home Affairs Select Committee claim 'lamentably' poor records were kept of those who were targeted using the snooping legislation – making the process appear 'secretive and disorganised'. He warned that Britain could be pushed towards a 'police state' in which officers are turned into Orwellian 'thought police' in the battle against extremism . They said using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) to unmask whistleblowers who help reporters made it 'not fit for purpose'. Police and the security sources obtained communications records under the controversial legislation at a rate of about 10,000 a week. Sir Peter gave the example of a protest earlier this year outside a shop selling Israeli products in Manchester, which attracted both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrators. 'It is better for others in society to have that debate and not to have public order commanders decide that on the street, outside a shop,' he said.","Sir Peter Fahy said officers could be turned into Orwellian 'thought police'

"A U.S. citizen quarantined in Ghana suspected of having Ebola has tested negative for the deadly disease. The Ministry of Health said preliminary tests undertaken by the Noguchi Memorial Research Institute proved negative. It said the American, who has not been named, had previously visited Guinea and Sierra Leone - countries where Ebola has killed hundreds. He arrived in Ghana and went to the Nyaho clinic in Accra with a fever. He was then quarantined along with the doctor and two nurses who treated him, Citi News reports. Deadly toll: More than 450 people have died in an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that has raged since February . The deadly virus has plagued some of Africa's most vulnerable natures, like Sierra Leone (pictured). Health workers in Kenema carry the body of an Ebola victim on June 25 . According to Joy News, the Head of Disease Surveillance at the Ghana Health Service said the American had tested 'tentatively negative' and that more tests will be carried out to confirm the negative result. Badu Sarkodie said: 'What it means is that whatever they [scientists who tested blood samples of the suspect victims] have done is not complete and there is the need for follow up tests.' Tests were being conducted at Noguchi Memorial Institute of Medical Research in Accra. It urged the public to remain calm. Health officials have called for regional action to halt the world's deadliest outbreak of the disease, which has spread across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, killing at least 467 people since February. Ebola causes fever, vomiting, bleeding and diarrhea and kills up to 90 percent of those it infects. Highly contagious, it is transmitted through contact with blood or other fluids. A previous suspected Ebola case in Ghana tested negative in April. Ebola originates from fruit bats, though it is thought to be passed to humans after they eat bush meat .","More than 450 people have been killed by Ebola, which is 90% lethal .

"Veteran striker Dimitar Berbatov will use all his insider knowledge to help his Monaco teammates 'do their homework' on Arsenal and get his unfancied team into the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Monaco were viewed as one of the weaker seeds having scored just four goals during the group stages as they edged into the last 16 ahead of Bayer Leverkusen. However, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, set to face his old club, claims the tie is very much '50/50', despite the Gunners' good recent form. Dimitar Berbatov controls the ball during Monaco's training session ahead of the  match against Arsenal . Berbatov knows Arsenal well from his time in the Barclays Premier League with Tottenham, Manchester United and Fulham. The 34-year-old, who left to join Monaco in January 2014, fully understands the challenge which awaits the Ligue 1 side, but is confident they can progress. 'We know it is going to be a difficult game and we will be the underdogs, but we came for a good result, have prepared well and hopefully we can achieve it,' said Berbatov, who played against Arsenal in seven north London derbies for Spurs between 2006 and 2008, as well as scoring a brace for Fulham in the 3-3 draw at the Emirates Stadium in November 2012. Berbatov knows Arsenal well from his time in the Premier League with Tottenham, Man United and Fulham . 'I spent a couple of years here and have told my team-mates this will be a tough game. 'Being back here is great for me, playing in this stadium. 'I have had some good moments here, scored a couple of goals, and also had some bad moments. 'It is nothing new to me. I know the games, I watch them on TV, Arsenal are playing very well. 'They are a team who work a lot of passes, try to play the combinations, football the way it should be played. They play on the counter with quick players and very technical. Berbatov is given a quick reminder of how chilly England is as he trains with his Monaco team-mates . Berbatov has scored seven goals for Monaco this season and feels settled in the principality . 'Maybe this will be new for some of my team-mates, but I have explained to them that it will be difficult, so they need to do their homework, and our coach will prepare us for the game. 'Hopefully we can do what we came here to do.' Berbatov has scored seven goals for Monaco this season and feels settled in the principality. 'I don't think (that I have changed my game) otherwise it is not going to be me,' Berbatov said. Fabinho shares a joke with team-mates Berbatov and Aymen Abdennour during a Monaco training session . Monaco duo Layvin Kurzawa and Joao Moutinho have a laugh ahead of their battle with Arsenal . 'I play the way I play, you probably know I have never been the quickest player around, but always try to be quick in my mind. 'When you get a bit older, you gain more experience and you try to put it to good use, to help yourself in different ways and also the young players. 'My job is to help my team-mates and my team, with my goals, my assists and advice to the young players because in our team we have a lot and they have a great future ahead of them.' Berbatov added: 'You win together and lose together as a team, if we can play as a team tomorrow, not like individuals, then we have a chance.' Moutinho controls the ball during a training session ahead of the  Champions League encounter . Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim sees no reason why his side should not be confident of rising to the challenge. 'Clearly a number of teams were hoping to draw Monaco, but it does not mean that we have less ambition going into this game,' said the Portuguese coach, whose side beat Arsenal in the pre-season Emirates Cup. 'We managed to qualify top of our group, and although we do not start this game as favourites, that should not stop us playing as we have. 'We will try to be solid and not allow Arsenal's midfield and key attacking players to unbalance us.'

"More than 600,000 people have fled villages in the Philippines as the country braces itself for Typhoon Haiyan - which is only hours away from the country's eastern coast. The military has gone on full alert today as the powerful storm, named Hagupit which means 'smash' in Filipino, is expected to hit later this afternoon. The area is still haunted by Typhoon Haiyan's massive devastation in November 2013, which claimed the lives of more than 7,000 people. While it is not expected to reach Haiyan's unprecedented strengths, forecasters said its maximum sustained winds of 109mph and gusts of 130 mph were strong enough to set off deadly storm surges and landslides and cause heavy damage to communities and agriculture.

'We're on red alert, so the entire armed forces is being mobilized for this typhoon,' Gen. Gregorio Pio Catapang, head of the Philippines' 120,000-strong military, told a news conference after discussing last-minute preparations. Army troops deployed to supermarkets and major roads in provinces in the typhoon's path to prevent looting and chaos and clear debris, all of which slowed the government's response last year, Catapang said. With a whirling band of rain clouds spanning 373 miles, Hagupit has gained speed and was moving westward at 10mph, according to forecasters. In the central city of Tacloban, where Haiyan's storm surges killed thousands of people and leveled villages, news of the approaching typhoon rekindled painful memories.

Social welfare secretary Corazon Soliman said: 'Over 100,000 families are already in evacuation centers. Multiply it by five (people a family), that's 500,000.' Mayor of Manila Joseph Estrada added: 'We have alerted the people of Manila and we're ready. These typhoons change direction all the time.' More than 2,000 people were left stranded in the city as ports closed across the nation. Some Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific flights in the south of the nation were shut as the storm closed in. 'I'm scared,' said Haiyan survivor Jojo Moro. 'I'm praying to God not to let another disaster strike us again. We haven't recovered from the first.'

Villagers abandoned houses on the coast as clouds began to form over eastern areas of the Philippines, with residents heading to safer areas inland . A U.N. humanitarian agency spokesman, Denis McClean, said in Geneva that it was one of the largest peacetime evacuations in Philippine history. It also was reminiscent of the evacuation of 1 million people along India's coastline before Cyclone Phailin hit in October 2013. Nearly 100 domestic flights have been canceled and inter-island ferry services suspended, stranding thousands of people. 'We've not heard of villagers resisting to be evacuated,' regional disaster-response director Blanche Gobenciong said. 'Their trauma is still so fresh.' In Tacloban, residents stacked sandbags to block floodwaters. One McDonald's restaurant was closed and boarded up to prevent a repetition of Haiyan's deluge, which shattered glass panes and doors of business establishments, allowing looting to take place. Disaster preparations widened after two agencies tracking the typhoon closely — the U.S. military's Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii and the Philippine weather agency — predicted different directions for Hagupit. The U.S. agency said Hagupit may veer northwest after coming inland and sweep past the southern edge of Manila, the capital city of more than 12 million people. The Philippine agency, known by its acronym PAGASA, projected a more southern path. Forecasts show the typhoon is expected to travel across central Philippines, with some suggesting it could veer north towards Manila .

An elderly woman sits while other family members gather their belongings as they arrive at a stadium to seek refuge . Dr Steven Godby, expert in natural hazards at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'No other country is struck by as many tropical cyclones each year as the Philippines. 'For these storms to form, warm sea surface temperatures of at least 26C are needed and these conditions are found in the western parts of the main ocean basins, away from cold water currents. 'Isolated island groups like the Philippines are particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones.' Hundreds of people still living in tents following Haiyan, known as Yolanda in the Philippines, were among the first to be relocated to safe zones in Tacloban, which has run out of hotel rooms as wealthier families booked ahead for the weekend. Rita Villadolid, a 39-year-old taking refuge inside a stadium, said: 'We've learned our lesson from Yolanda. Everyone here is gripped with fear.' Disaster response official Blanche Gobenciong said nearly 12,000 residents in Tacloban, where entire settlements were wiped out by the storm, have so far been moved from high-risk villages to emergency shelters. She said: 'We've not heard of villagers resisting to be evacuated. Their trauma is still so fresh. 'We have a zero-casualty target. Just one loss of life will really sadden us all and make us wonder what went wrong.' International relief teams are already positioned in the Philippines, ready for the worst. Kevin Noone, executive director of International Medical Corps UK, which has workers on the ground prepared for the storm, said: 'Coming just one year after Typhoon Haiyan, this storm has the potential to cause widespread damage and human suffering. Our teams are on the ground and prepared for whatever the next 48 hours has in store for the people of the Philippines.' The typhoon was downgraded to a category 4 today, a level below a 'super typhoon', with hopes it may weaken to winds of around 108mph by the time it strikes tomorrow.

"Disgraced: Commander Sarah West, 42, has left the Navy with a resettlement package after serving less than half of her 12-month notice period . A disgraced female Royal Navy captain, removed from her ship amid claims of a sexual relationship with a male officer, has been granted early retirement and a pay-off estimated to be worth tens of thousands of pounds. Commander Sarah West – who was found to have broken strict codes of social conduct while serving as captain of HMS Portland – has left the Navy with a resettlement package after serving less than half of her 12-month notice period. Defence sources confirmed last night that the 42-year-old, who was paid up to £79,524 a year, has served her last day after persuading top brass to grant her a quick release from her terms of service. In July, she was flown back to Britain from the Caribbean amid claims of an affair with her third-in-command, newly married Lieutenant Commander Richard Gray, 37. At the time the 5,000-ton frigate was conducting anti-narcotics patrols around the West Indies. While military police questioned the ship’s crew about claims of an alleged affair, Commander West went on annual leave for ‘personal reasons’. She later transferred to a desk job at Fleet Headquarters in Hampshire. During the investigation, both denied claims they had an affair. Even so, Commander West was found to have breached rules which forbid relationships that could undermine the operational effectiveness of a ship or a naval unit. Naval sources confirmed these rules can be broken even without an affair taking place. In 2012, Commander West, from Grimsby, became the first female captain of a major warship in the Navy’s 500-year history. At the time she gave an interview describing how being at sea has made it difficult to maintain a relationship. She married pilot Andrew Whitlum in 1998 but they later separated. She said: ‘Lots of women in the services have challenging roles. There are drawbacks, though. Years at sea probably explains why I’m single. But every person in the military makes sacrifices.’ Commander West will be entitled to 11 weeks’ paid holiday and additional financial help while she finds a new job and settles into civilian life. Lieutenant Commander Gray remains in service and is understood still to be with his wife Melissa, an engineer from Bristol.

She is the first female captain of a major warship in the Navy’s 500-year history . Last night, Susan Morgan, the longest-serving female officer in Navy history, who retired in 2012 after 34 years’ service, said: ‘It is a great shame Commander West is leaving as she was highly regarded and very popular among her colleagues. She blazed a trail for women in the Navy.’ Commander West’s mother Gillian refused to comment. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘It is not the policy to make public any individual personnel matters; it would be inappropriate to comment.","Commander Sarah West, 42, took charge of HMS Portland in May 2012 .

"A detective who told a 12-year-old boy to ‘do it with someone your own age next time’ after he confessed to raping a girl aged five has taken early retirement. The Mail on Sunday revealed last month how the girl’s parents felt badly let down by Essex Police because the boy received only a youth caution. An investigation by this newspaper discovered that Detective Constable Paul Alabaster and DC Tracy Bainbridge had recorded the boy admitting the offence but did not report him for the offence to social services. Shocking: The five-year-old victim was raped by the 12-year-old son of a neighbour (file image) Instead, DC Alabaster issued the extraordinary piece of ‘advice’ to the youngster. The officers also neglected to collect fingerprints, photographs, DNA or other forensic evidence. Both were disciplined but returned to their duties with Essex Police’s Child Abuse Investigation Team. The MoS understands that DC Alabaster is in his early 50s and more than four years short of his 30-year term of service, after which officers can retire on full pensions. Last night the girl’s father said: ‘We are relieved that Alabaster is no longer in a position where he can fail other child victims.’ But he said that police failings had not been addressed and the family had been denied justice. The victim, now eight, was so distressed at how she was sidelined that she wrote a letter to each of the child abuse officers involved (with original spelling mistakes) Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Detective Constable Paul Alabaster has stepped down, it is understood .

"A game warden has captured amazing footage of two deer with their antlers trapped around a pole. Warden Michael McCall was on patrol in Comal County, Texas, when he spotted the distressed animals who appeared to have become entangled in some rope. The white tailed deer then became caught either side of a metal pole and could not free themselves. The warden decided to film the scene as he attempted to free the animals as, although the deer are common in the area, the predicament was quite unique. Mr McCall approaches in his car and can be seen trying to figure out how to get close enough to free the deer without accidentally being gored by them. Eventually, the warden decides to sit on the hood of his car and lean down to saw through the rope while staying out of harm's way. Warden Michael McCall was on patrol in Comal County when he found the two bucks . The agitated deer were seen tugging at the rope entangled around their antlers . Mr McCall said he gets called out to at least a few incidents a week involving animals at Comal County. But the chance to help out gives him great job satisfaction. He explains: ' It is law enforcement off the pavement; Texans helping Texans in conservation enforcement since 1895.' Mr McCall  cut the animals free without putting himself in danger by balancing on the hood of his truck . Mr McCall says he became a Game Warden to 'help that which has no voice of its own, our cultural and natural resources'. Luckily for the rescuer, the deer seem to pleased to be free of the rope attaching their antlers that they sprint off at the end of the video without even a glance back.","Distressed deer became entangled around pole by some rope .

"Jailed publicist Max Clifford is being sued by former Royal butler Paul Burrell over claims that he secretly faxed a confidential letter to a newspaper containing private information about the Queen. The High Court writ was served on Clifford in his cell at Littlehey Prison, Cambridgeshire, where he is serving an eight-year jail sentence for indecently assaulting eight women and girls in the 1970s and 1980s. Burrell went to Clifford for help in 2001 when he was at the centre of a media storm after being accused of stealing hundreds of Princess Diana’s possessions. Former Royal butler Paul Burrell, above with the late Princess Diana, is suing disgraced publicist Max Clifford . At Clifford’s request, he wrote a six-page letter setting out his relationship with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, including details of personal gifts he had received from the Royals and the Queen’s interest in the birth of his first son. Later, on legal advice, Burrell decided not to use Clifford’s services. But an angry Clifford faxed the letter to Rebekah Brooks, then editor of the now defunct News of the World, it is claimed. The NotW did not publish its details. Along with information about Burrell’s relationship with the Royals, the letter also detailed ‘a serious accident’ he suffered while in the US with the Queen and the medical treatment she arranged for him. The High Court writ was served on Clifford in his cell at Littlehey Prison, Cambridgeshire, where he is serving an eight-year jail sentence for indecently assaulting eight women and girls in the 1970s and 1980s . Other ‘inherently private’ material included ‘the Queen’s interest in the birth’ of Burrell’s son and details of gifts she gave him. Burrell is seeking damages of up to £50,000 and an injunction banning Clifford from using or publishing any private information about him. Legal experts believe that if successful, the claim could lead to other public figures seeking similar gagging orders. In the past, Clifford, now 71, cast himself as the custodian of hundreds of celebrity secrets, claiming most of his work involved keeping stories out of newspapers. The writ says Burrell, 56, suffered ‘substantial distress as a result of the misuse of his private information’. However in a statement, Clifford said it was an ‘affront to common sense’ to suggest Burrell felt able to claim the information was confidential when ‘he has sold stories to newspapers… and has even written a book about his dealings with the Royal Family’. According to the writ, Burrell first went to Clifford wanting to ‘stem the torrent of adverse publicity’ following his arrest after allegations that £6 million worth of Diana’s possessions went missing from her Kensington Palace apartments. The PR guru was alleged to have told Burrell that his role was to protect people, but to do that he needed to know everything about them, and kept all his clients’ secrets in a safe. Burrell duly gave him the letter. But Clifford, Burrell claims, became extremely angry when he terminated his relationship with him in spring 2002 following a warning by his criminal defence team. Burrell accuses Clifford of faxing the letter to Ms Brooks at 11.58am on November 2, 2002 – the morning after the butler was cleared of theft at the Old Bailey after it was revealed the Queen had come forward with crucial evidence. He claims this was a breach of confidentiality and adds that he had previously ignored an offer of £450,000 from the paper for his story. In the book, A Royal Duty, Burrell describes how he fell down stairs and ruptured a disc during a trip to Kentucky. An ambulance took him to a nearby hospital which had ‘already set aside a Royal suite for an emergency’ in line with procedure for Royal visits. ‘It was the first time a crippled Royal servant had slept in the Queen’s bed,’ he wrote.","A High Court writ was served on Clifford in his cell at Littlehey Prison .

"One of the world's most wanted Nazis who sent more than 140,000 European Jews to the gas chambers was secretly employed by Syria as an agent of terror, declassified US files show. Alois Brunner, the right-hand man of leading Holocaust architect Adolf Eichmann, is believed to have served as an adviser to then President Hafez al-Assad. Secret CIA documents have revealed he gave advice about torture techniques to the regime and instructed Kurdish separatists on how to stage attacks in Turkey. One of the world's most wanted Nazis, Alois Brunner, is believed to have served as an adviser to then President Hafez al-Assad . French investigators believe he fled to Syria in 1954, where he was protected by successive regimes, but they lost track of him in 1992 in Damascus. When questioned, former President Assad, who led Syria from 1971 to 2000, denied knowing the Nazi war criminal. William L Eagleton, the US ambassador to Damascus wrote to the US Secretary of State George Schultz in 1984 saying: 'Brunner is known to be protected in Syria by armed guards, presumably from the Syrian intelligence services.' 'In the past, our source [in the West German embassy] said Brunner has done work on behalf of the Syrian intelligence services in training Kurdish guerrillas who operate from Syria against Turkey.' Brunner has frequently been described as the 'right hand man' of Adolf Eichmann, pictured during his trial in Israel in 1962, the architect of the Holocaust . The Nazi war criminal sent more than 140,000 European Jews to the gas chambers before fleeing . Efraim Zuroff, director of Nazi hunting group the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, reported that Brunner died four years ago at the age of 98. 'He was a sadist; a fanatical Nazi,' said Mr Zuroff. 'He told a German magazine in 1985: ""My only regret is that I didn't murder more Jews"".' But French lawyer Serge Klarsfeld has disputed these claims, saying he would not have survived that long because of ill health. 'We know that in 1992, he was taken out of his apartment in an ambulance. He was in very bad health at that time so I don't see him having lived until 2010,' he told AFP. In 1988 the West German foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, raised Brunner with President Assad, who denied knowing of him. 'Damascus is too embarrassed to admit his presence and has a perverse sense of pride which would prohibit turning the former Nazi over to any western authority, since this would be perceived locally as giving in to Israeli pressures,' the US embassy recorded. Brunner's file ends with an erroneous report that he died in 1961 after opening a letter bomb. It was the year that Eichmann was put on trial after being captured by Mossad and requests to Syria to provide Brunner as a witness were ignored. Syria has repeatedly denied harbouring the war criminal, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in his absence by a French court in 2001. Born in Austria in 1912, Brunner rose in rank within the SS and worked as the assistant of Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann was 'the brains' behind the Holocaust and Hitler's Final Solution. Eichmann also fled after the war, but was captured in Argentina by Mossad, the Israeli secret service, tried in Israel and executed in 1962.","Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner sent 140,000  Jews to the gas chambers .

"Stephen Ward’s terror that he would be destroyed by the Establishment for his role in the Profumo scandal is revealed in his own words in newly released papers. The high-society figure, who introduced Minister of War John Profumo to Christine Keeler, a former topless model, made the comments in previously unseen, 50-year-old police statements. Their publication follows a 14-month Freedom of Information battle between this newspaper and the Metropolitan Police Service. Stephen Ward pictured in 1963 with Christine Keeler, who he introduced to Minister of War John Profumo . The 1963 scandal threatened to bring down the Government of the day. Profumo was exposed as having lied to Parliament about his affair with Keeler, and it was also reported that she had slept with Soviet military attaché Eugene Ivanov – a link that potentially compromised national security. Ward feared reprisals by the ruling Conservative Party. On April 26, 1963, he said: ‘I could bring down the Government, but I won’t do that. I think the Conservative Party are trying to get me, they will if they can to save themselves.’ The papers will reinforce fears that Ward was a scapegoat for the scandal, and that his subsequent conviction for living off the immoral earnings of Keeler – whom he had introduced to Profumo in 1961 – and Mandy Rice-Davies was a miscarriage of justice. The papers reveal how Ward, a successful osteopath, was initially happy to co-operate with police, but then began to fear the effect of the scandal on his life. On June 4, 1963, he told officers: ‘I entreat you to deal with this matter as quickly as possible as the strain is bringing me near to a nervous breakdown.’ In the same interview, Ward casts doubt on the strength of the case against him: ‘It is ridiculous to say I have received money for introducing girls to men. Ward being escorted from court by police at the height of the Profumo scandal. He later took an overdose of sleeping tablets and was convicted while in a coma, from which he never awoke . The political scandal revealed Minister of War John Profumo (left) to have been having an affair with Christine Keeler (right) ‘Of course I always had pretty girls around me. I also took them to parties and introduced them to other men, but if this was followed up by them, and the men gave them presents, surely I cannot be blamed for that?’ Ward was put on trial, but took an overdose of sleeping tablets shortly after the prosecution’s summing-up. He was convicted while he lay in a coma, from which he never awoke. On June 5, 1963, Profumo resigned from the Government, three months after telling Parliament rumours of his affair with Keeler were untrue. The Criminal Cases Review Commission is considering an application by Geoffrey Robertson QC to have Ward’s conviction overturned.","Documents show Stephen Ward feared he would be ruined by the Tories .

"Brendan Rodgers gambled by resting seven of the team - including Steven Gerrard and Raheem Sterling - that lost to Newcastle on the weekend. Despite this Liverpool pushed the European champions all the way and the two teams were only separated by a Karim Benzema first-half effort. Here, Sportsmail's Dominic King gives his verdict on how the players performed at the Bernabeu on Tuesday. Karim Benzema celebrates opening the scoring for Real Madrid against Liverpool on Tuesday . Real Madrid (4-2-2-2) Iker Casillas - 6 . A veteran of these occasions, his biggest issue was staying warm on a freezing night. Alvaro Arbeloa - 7 . No surprises from the former Liverpool man; got through his work quietly and efficiently. Raphael Varane - 6.5 . Didn’t need to engage his top gear to keep Fabio Borini and Co at arms length. Raphael Varane (left) goes shoulder to shoulder with Lazar Markovic . Sergio Ramos - 6.5 . Back to fitness. Largely untroubled but booked for one rash tackle on Adam Lallana. Marcelo - 8 . Magnificent cross created the opening goal for Karim Benzema; never under threat defensively. Toni Kroos - 7.5 . A player who makes the game at the highest level look easy. Always had time and space. Luka Modric - 7 . Never wasted a pass but, then again, was never put under extreme pressure. Luka Modric (right) shields the ball away from the onrushing Lucas Leiva . Isco - 7 . Not even first choice when Gareth Bale is fit. Keeps play effortlessly ticking over. James Rodriguez - 7 . In any other team, he would be the superstar. Wasn’t as impressive as he was at Anfield though. Cristiano Ronaldo - 6.5 . Skirted around the edges of the game apart from a couple of shots. Not the night for a record breaker. Cristiano Ronaldo has a shot at goal but the Portuguese superstar had a quiet night by his high standards . Karim Benzema - 8.5 . The best out-and-out striker in world football at present; took his goal clinically. Subs .

Can’t lose his place after this. Kolo Toure (left) was a surprise starter but put in a composed performance at the back for Liverpool . Alberto Moreno - 7.5 . Liverpool’s best summer signing continues to make a positive impression; lots of energy, looks a proper player. Lucas Leiva - 7 . Diligent in the middle, made his tackles and used the ball simply when he had it. Emre Can - 6 . Yet to show why Liverpool were so delighted to complete his signing. Game passed him by. Adam Lallana - 7 . Took time to get into the game but impressed in the second half and came closest to scoring. Adam Lallana (right) grew into the game the longer it went on . Joe Allen - 7 . Dispossessed Ronaldo early on with a good tackle and got better from there, a terrier scampering after possession. Lazar Markovic - 5 .

"A gang who posed as detectives and used fake search warrants to raid pensioners' homes, confiscating their life savings, have been jailed for more than 15 years. The burglars, led by Paul Momat, dressed and acted like police officers so they could gain entry to elderly people's houses, even kidnapping one victim to try to get more cash from her parents. One of the four crooks' vulnerable victims was an elderly woman who had suffered a stroke, with the criminals walking away with her £25,000 savings. Paul Momat (left) instructed gang members Gareth Carey (right), Carl Hudson (below, left) and Simon Lancaster (below, right) as they posed as detectives with fake search warrants so they could steal the life savings of elderly people and stroke victims . Momat was jailed for six years, Carey for five years, Hudson (left) for four years. Lancaster (right) will be sentenced later this week after all four pleaded guilty . Brazen criminals Carl Hudson, Gareth Carey and Simon Lancaster arrived at pensioners' homes wearing suits and holding forged search warrants, saying they were there to confiscate cash. The gang targeted specific individuals around Tyneside in a sophisticated plot which saw the three henchmen pretend to be detectives while Momat told them what to do over the phone, Newcastle Crown Court heard. The men, who had somehow gained access to confidential personal records, fooled the 68-year-old stroke victim, from Gateshead, by telling her they knew her son was a serving police officer. Speaking of the burglary on July 12, 2012, prosecutor James Adkin said:  'They fooled her into thinking they were the police and they had specialist knowledge about her family. 'They made references to her son being a police officer, which he is. One had a clipboard and knew the names of both of her sons. 'They said they were CID and showed her what they said was a search warrant. They worried her by making reference to a fine or prison if they found money.' Two weeks later, they went to a home in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and tried to pull the same trick. The man of the house asked to see their ID and one of them tipped a folder to show a search warrant. The householder was suspicious and the gang left. In August that year they arrived at the home of a retired jeweller with a search warrant. After realising the home had CCTV, one of the gang called Momat, who ordered them to seize the camera's hard drive and leave empty-handed. In January last year, the crooks kidnapped a woman from Gateshead in an attempt to steal more money from her elderly parents, of whom one had suffered a stroke. The gang, all from South Shields, took £25,000 from an elderly woman who had suffered a stroke in one of their burglaries in Tyneside, Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard . Carey put on a fake Scottish accent and told the woman and her husband that he had a search warrant. After the gang seized £4,500, the vulnerable woman was told to go with the 'officers' to her parents' home, which the gang knew was nearby. However, the bumbling crooks' Volvo ran out of fuel on the way, forcing them to walk the rest of the journey. The elderly couple, aged 78 and 75, were startled by the visitors and shocked when they said they had a search warrant. No further money was taken. Momat, Hudson, Carey and Lancaster all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burglary. Hudson, Carey and Lancaster also admitted kidnap. All four men also pleaded guilty conspiracy to steal by tricking a workman into handing over thousands by pretending they were detectives. They told the victim, from Scotland, that they had catalytic convertors for sale and he arrived in South Shields to meet them. One of them had a belt with handcuffs on and they seized the man's van, £7,500 cash and his phone, telling him he would be locked up if he didn't comply. Sentencing the four men from South Shields at Newcastle Crown Court, Judge Brian Forster QC said: 'Any right-thinking member of the community who reads about this case will be shocked by the blatant disregard of the feelings of others. 'The case involved a system where entry was obtained by a pretence of being police officers. 'The victims have been left shocked and in some cases, have lost all of their savings. 'People who prey on the elderly commit serious offences. The court has a clear duty to deter offending in which people prey on vulnerable people and furthermore when they impersonate police officers.' Momat, 27, who has since been convicted of conspiring to rob a businessman at gunpoint and is serving an eight-year sentence, has been jailed for an extra six years. He is also serving a further four-month sentence for using a mobile phone behind bars. Hudson, 26 was sentenced to four years in prison and Carey, 26, was jailed for five years. Lancaster, 23, will be sentenced next week.","Gang posed as detectives and used fake search warrants to raid homes .

"A new scathing report has unearthed shocking statistics about student maths teachers.

He tested the maths ability of all of his 125 students, including 40 students in the third year of their bachelor of education degree. The 125 students had enrolled in a graduate diploma of education at Griffith University, which only accepts students who have already completed a bachelor degree.

Of the 165 students tested, just about half of them could convert 5.48km into metres. More than half of the student teachers who took the test could not answer the simple question: 'If the total cost of three tickets is $5.64, how much will 10 tickets cost?'. 17% of the students ran in to trouble converting 6kg into grams and only 16% were able to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. More than half of the student teachers who took the test could not answer the simple question: 'If the total cost of three tickets is $5.64, how much will 10 tickets cost?'

In another worrying find, one in three students were capable of finding the areas of rectangles and triangles. Speaking to The Weekend Australian, Dr Norton vented his frustration over the results, claiming his students should have mastered the ability to answer all these questions by the end of primary school. 17% of the students ran in to trouble converting 6kg into grams and only 16% were able to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit . 'Every year I test my students and they've got th understanding of a Year 7 or Yaer 8 kid,' 'They struggle with fractions and proportional reasoning and anything to do with algebra,' 'They should have mastered this by the end of primary school,' he said.

"British teenager Ali Kalantar, 19, known as Ali al-Farsi, has reportedly been killed in Iraq fighting for the Islamic State . Twin sisters who fled Britain to join the Islamic State terror group in Syria have lost their jihadi fighter husbands in battle. Zahra and Salma Halane, 16, from Manchester, left their family almost a year ago to join IS in its stronghold of Raqqa. They married two young IS jihadis about two months ago, according to their own postings on social media. Zahra wed a British jihadi called Ali Kalantar, 19, from Coventry, and Salma married a young Afghan. Both men were killed in the same battle last week, according to tweets Zahra sent yesterday. She said: ‘May Allah swt accept my husband @AliAlfarsiii who got his shahadah [martyrdom] in Iraq. Two days ago.’ She then tweeted that her twin’s husband had been killed at ‘the same time’. When The Mail on Sunday contacted Ibrahim Halane, 52, the taxi driver father of the girls, he said: ‘I haven’t heard of this. I am not talking to a newspaper, thank you.’ Kalantar, who was said to have been 'brainwashed' by a local imam in less than one month, left the UK in March while studying for his A-levels. He left Coventry with two friends, including 18-year-old Mohammed Hadi, who has since been dubbed Osama Bin Bieber due to his youthful looks. His death takes the toll of Britons killed fighting in Iraq and Syria to 32. Since leaving the UK, Kalantar has been vocal on his Twitter account @AliAlFarsiii. His bio reads: 'You only die once so why dont you make it martyr?' Kalantar also previously used the now suspended Twitter handle @KafirsNightmare, on which he posted photos of Syrian children dressed in military uniform, holding his AK-47. Last month, he had written on his Twitter: 'Why don't these suger coated mozlems understand that Islam was also spread by sword not flowers & perfumes?' And in an earlier post, he added: 'Jihad is the cure for all diseases #FACT'. On his Facebook page, Kalantar had also described how he had no intention of returning to the UK, despite members of his family travelling to Turkey to try and find him. He wrote: 'Just to proof (sic) how much I want to come back to US, soon you would see a video of me burning my passport which has less value then my toilet tissue paper'. Earlier this year, Kalantar's father, who is of Afghan origin, described how he believed his son had been radicalised by an imam at a small mosque who sent him 'down this road'. The teenager - who had previously wanted to be a model - had only been attending the mosque for a month before being 'brainwashed' to fight overseas, his family said. Rahim Kalantar told the BBC that he worried about his son 'every minute' and that his grief is 'limitless'. Kalantar's wife was said to be Zahra Halane (left), one of the so-called 'terror twins' who left Manchester in June this year to join fight in Syria . Kalantar (pictured left) left his home in Coventry in March this year alongside two friends, including Abu Yahya al-Kurdy (right) The teenager (left) had previously wanted to be a model and was due to study computer science at Coventry University. The families of both teenagers claim they were radicalised at the local mosque . Ali was taking his A-levels and planning to study computer science at Coventry University when he left home in March with Rashid Amani and Mohammed Hadi. He was 18 at the time. According to his father, he asked for his passport for university paperwork and borrowed £1,000 to buy a computer. Infact, he used the money to buy a plane ticket and left for Syria. Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at the Institute Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, said Kalantar travelled from Coventry, via Birmingham and Frankfurt, before reaching Turkey. He then crossed over the Turkish-Syrian border and joined fighters in Aleppo. Police were alerted to the boys' disappearance just minutes after the flight took off, but, by then, it was too late. Ali's sister - who did not want to be named - previously told the Coventry Telegraph: 'One day he decided to go and was soon going to prayers five times a day. 'He changed, but we never dreamed he was being radicalised. The imam groomed him, that's the word to describe it. 'Apparently he was constantly telling these boys that they should go overseas to fight jihad.' His death has not been independently verified. His family could not be contacted. The news was announced on Twitter by Kalatar's wife in Syria, known as Umm Jafar al-Britaniyah . His wife, also a British national, later posted this photo on Twitter in memory of her husband . Kalantar's family came to the UK from Afghanistan in 2005 and settled in Coventry, living in a three-bedroom detached home. The news of his death was announced on Twitter by his wife in Syria. Soon after, another user warned her about spreading the information online. She later removed the tweets and set her profile to private. Zahra and Salma Halane had 28 GCSEs between them and were planning to become doctors, having just finished their first year of sixth-form college. They were said to have been radicalised over the internet. Their father Ibrahim and mother Khadra travelled to the region to try to bring them home, but without success. The couple have 10 children and their 21-year-old son Ahmed is said to be fighting with Al Shabaab, a militant group in Somalia. Mr Maher said Salma Halane also lost her husband in battle on the same day as Kalantar was killed. Meanwhile, Mohammed Hadi has posted pictures of himself in desert combat gear armed with twin pistols, saying that he was fighting with ISIS. According to Hadi's mother, he had no means of paying for transport to the Syrian border with his £14 per week pocket money - and she believes religious leaders may have funded his journey . Speaking about reports of Kalantar's death, an FCO spokesperson said: 'We are aware of social media reports of the death of a British national in Iraq. 'The difficulty of collecting information in a conflict zone, in particular when individuals have often deliberately chosen to disguise their intentions and their identity, means that HMG has no means of reliably assembling this information.' In the last three years, more than 500 radicalised Britons are believed to have headed out to Syria, where Islamist groups are fighting President Bashar Assad's forces. But it is believed some of those who signed up to fight have now contacted authorities in Britain saying they have had enough of the war-zone and want to return home.

"The mother of an 18-month-old girl who suffered second degree burns from touching a metal plate surrounding a tree outside a public swimming pool  was told 'this is not the first time it's happened'. Corrine Withers says when she informed the City of Sydney about her daughter Zali's accident in Prince Alfred Park at Surry Hills  she was told the council had known about the hazard for months. Three weeks after the incident, as Sydney starts to swelter through summer, the dangerous metal bases around nine palm trees at a cafe near the pool - including the one on which Zali was severely burned - are still there. Adorable: Zali Thomas suffered terrible burns when she touched a hot metal plate in Prince Alfred Park at Surry Hills. Zali Thomas suffered second degree burns when she touched a hot metal plate surrounding a tree outside Prince Alfred Park at Surry Hills on November 14. 'She let out a blood-curdling scream.' Zali's mother Corrine Withers said her daughter screamed in agony when she touched a hot metal plate in a Surry Hills park. Ms Withers took Zali to the park with a friend and her friend's two young sons on November 14, a Friday afternoon when temperatures in the city topped 30 degrees Celcius. The children had been playing near the entrance to the park's pool when Zali wandered a short distance about 1pm. 'I followed her but she tripped and put her hands down to save herself,' Ms Withers told Daily Mail Australia. Zali placed her right hand on a metal plate surrounding the base of a palm tree. 'She let out a blood-curdling scream,' the 34-year-old said. 'I knew she was badly hurt, but at that stage I had no idea why. After I picked her up, she started shaking and wiping her hand on me. 'When I looked at her hand, the whole palm and finger tips looked as if they had melted instantly. 'I rushed her into the pool where a lifeguard and first aid officer assisted immediately. We ran her hand under cold water for what seemed like a while.' Zali was screaming in pain. 'At this point, [the lifeguard] advised me that ""this is not the first time its happened"",' Ms Withers said. Ms Withers' friend rushed the mother and daughter to Sydney Children's Hospital at Randwick where Zali was given pain relief and treated for second degree burns. Ms Withers had to take Zali back to the hospital about 7.30pm after Zali pulled off the bandaging on her wounds. Her daughter was given more pain relief.

Zali Thomas burned her hand when she touched one of the plates around another tree on November 14. The metal plate surrounding a palm tree at Prince Alfred Park on which Zali Thomas burned her hand on November 14. 'They said the burns would need to be ""de-roofed"" as the blisters had already filled with too much fluid,' Ms Withers said. 'So they then drained and cut the blisters off leaving raw, burned skin. An extremely painful experience yet again.' To ensure her burns healed properly, her hand was wrapped in an uncomfortable splint which bent her palm backwards. Ms Withers, from Redfern, emailed Lord Mayor Clover Moore's office three days later, on November 17, expressing concern another child could be injured on one of the metal plates in the park. When she followed up that email with a telephone call to Cr Moore's office during her lunch break the same day, Ms Withers was told the Lord Mayor was 'very concerned'. In a voicemail left later that day, a council staffer member told Ms Withers the City knew of the hazard presented by the metal plates and had been trying to fix the problem 'for months'. 'Staff have been working on some solutions for some time and unfortunately everything seems to be heating up in the warm weather,' the staff member said. The next day, Ms Withers took Zali back to Sydney Children's Hospital where the toddler's hand was cleaned and re-dressed. The splint she had been forced to wear remained on her hand for more than two weeks. 'When I looked at her hand, the whole palm and finger tips looked as if they had melted instantly.' Corrine Withers says her daughter Zali's hand blistered immediately upon her touching a metal plate surrounding a tree in Prince Alfred Park at Surry Hills. Little Zali Thomas suffered second degree burns when she touched a hot metal plate surrounding a palm tree in Prince Alfred Park, Surry Hills, on November 14. Burn victim Zali Thomas had to be taken back to Sydney Children's Hospital on the night of November 14 after she pulled off the bandages covering wounds sustained by touching a hot metal plate outside the pool in Prince Alfred Park at Surry Hills. Toddler Zali Thomas had to have her hand bent backwards and put into a splint to ensure her burns healed properly. Zali Thomas suffered terrible burns to her right hand when she touched a hot metal plate surrounding a tree in Prince Alfred Park at Surry Hills. A week after Zali's accident, on November 21, Ms Withers received a personal email from Cr Moore, headed 'Injury, Prince Alfred Park'. 'Dear Corrine,' Cr Moore wrote. 'I am sorry to hear about your daughter’s injury while playing at Prince Alfred Park. I appreciate how distressing this must be for you both. 'I asked City staff to investigate and update me as a matter of urgency. City staff have removed the metal tree base on which your daughter burnt her hand and replaced it with bark. 'Over the next week, staff will remove all other metal bases and replace them with an alternative heat resistant material. 'Please accept my best wishes for your daughter’s full and fast recovery.' The metal base council staff removed from one of the trees in the 7.5 hectare park was not the one on which Zali burned her hand. Zali Thomas had to  have her hand bent backwards in a splint after suffering burns when she touched a hot metal plate surrounding a tree in Prince Alfred Park at Surry Hills. Lord Mayor Clover Moore assured Corrine Withers on November 21 the metal base on which her daughter Zali burnt her hand a week earlier had since been removed. It was still there on December 5. A week later, on November 28, Ms Withers received another email from council stating the metal bases would be removed and replaced with 'water porous paving' on December 8 and 9, almost a month after Zali was burned. Until then, 'staff are speaking with the cafe operator about carefully placing the fencing, umbrellas and tables so as to “block” access to the metal bases' the email said. A low fence surrounds the trees but part of one of the 63cm wide plates was still outside that fence when Daily Mail Australia visited the park on Friday. Ms Withers said: 'If kids are inside, they are going to be hurt'. Ms Withers said the colour and matt finish of the plates almost matched the surrounding surface, disguising the danger of the metal once it heated up. 'There is no way you would have thought that was metal,' she said. 'Looking back at those photos (of Zali's injuries) breaks my heart my every time. She didn't know pain like that. She'd never been burned before. Little Zali Thomas is recovering from the burns she suffered when she touched a harmless-looking metal plate around a tree in Prince Alfred Park at Surry Hills. The metal plate on which little Zali Thomas burned her hand on November 14. In an email to Zali's mother Corrine on November 21, Lord Mayor Clover Moore incorrectly wrote that the plate had been removed and replaced with bark.

One of the trees outside the cafe in Prince Alfred Park where Zali Thomas was burned on November 14. This picture was taken on December 5. Ms Withers said her priority in raising the issue was to prevent another child being burned. 'I was absolutely heartbroken to see my little girl in so much pain,' she said. 'Later I felt guilty, like I had somehow failed her. Maybe I should have felt these bases first? Or stopped her from going near them? 'Then I was angry. Why were these things there at a children's playground? I don't want any other littler person getting hurt. 'It seems like they're in no hurry. This happened three weeks ago and they're still there.' The plates have been in place since 2011, a City of Sydney spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'The City has removed metal tree root guards from the base of 20 palm trees around the Prince Alfred Park Pool and cafe following concerns they were becoming too hot,' the spokesman said. 'The roots have been covered with mulch or rubber while purpose-made root guards are fabricated.' The pool at Prince Alfred Park, which has won architectural and design awards, was opened in May last year after a troubled $9 million redevelopment that began in October 2009. The opening was delayed so long that for the first six months of its operation, users were able to use the facilities for free.

"A passenger plane had a near miss with a drone as it landed at Heathrow, in the first such incident recorded at Britain’s biggest airport. The incident involved an Airbus A320, which can carry up to 180 passengers, and was rated by investigators as among the most serious near-collisions. The aircraft was at just 700ft at 2.16pm on July 22 when the pilot saw the drone, which had not shown up on air traffic control radar. Scroll down for video . Close call: A passenger plane had a near miss with a drone as it landed at Heathrow on July 22, in the first such incident recorded at Britain’s biggest airport. Above, planes queue to take off at the airport . He reported the sighting and an inquiry was launched by the UK Airprox Board, which investigates all reported near-misses. Investigators, however, were unable to identify it. It comes amid concern over the threat to aircraft from domestic drones flown by amateurs. In May the pilot of a 74-seat ATR 72 reported a quadcopter drone within 80ft of his aircraft at about 1,500ft as he was approaching Southend Airport. The official report into the incident at Heathrow is due to be published on Friday, but Ukab has initially recorded the incident rating as A – the highest of its five categories – in which serious risk of collision has existed. Airport: The official report into the incident at London Heathrow (pictured) is due to be published on Friday, but the UK Airprox Board has initially recorded the incident rating as A – the highest of its five categories . The revelation comes as it was revealed there was concern over domestic drones flown by amateurs threatening aircraft - especially as they are given as Christmas presents. Drones cost from just £35 to £3,350 - and sales have jumped from the normal level of around 2,000 a month thanks to extra demand ahead of December 25, according to The Sunday Times. Electronics retailer Maplin said drones were one of its biggest current sellers, while hundreds of different drones made by at least 15 manufacturers can be purchased from Amazon. Last month, a conference on unmanned aerial systems in London heard that police were worried about injuries and other problems on Boxing Day when amateur ‘pilots’ try out their new drones. Drones (file pictured) cost from £35 to £3,350 - and sales have jumped from the normal level of around 2,000 a month thanks to extra pre-Christmas demand. It is unknown what type of drone was involved in the incident . The Airbus A320 is commonly used by European airlines. Earlier this year airline pilots' association Balpa demanded better protection for the public against the risks of drones. It wants drones, officially known as Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (Rpas), which share airspace with passenger and freight airliners, to meet the same safety standards as piloted aircraft. It includes only being flown by operators with pilot-equivalent training. Balpa general secretary Jim McAuslan said: ‘The UK should become a ""safe drone zone"" so we can make the most of the major business and leisure opportunities offered by remotely piloted aircraft, while protecting passengers, pilots and residents. ‘The technology is developing quickly and we could see remote aircraft the same size as a Boeing 737 being operated commercially in our skies within ten years.’ Research carried out by intelligence experts for the University of Birmingham Policy Commission Report published in October warned of the misuse of drones. The commission called for ‘urgent’ measures to safeguard British airspace to cope with civil and commercial use, which is expected to be more widespread by 2035. The report said the ‘hazards presented by inadvertent or accidental misuse of Rpas, or the consequences of their malfunctioning are becoming better understood’. It added that small commercial aircraft, including for taking photographs, are already ‘clearly being flown’ and often in breach of the rules, the commission found.","The incident was rated as among the most serious near-collisions .

"Britain's anti-spy agency is to snoop through office emails in a bid to preempt disgruntled employees threatening the nation's security by going rogue. The Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) has turned its attention to 'insider' threats within companies - meaning staff gossip and gripes could now be checked for hidden agendas. The shocking revelation means unusual language or uncharacteristic tones adopted in emails to colleagues could be interpreted as sign that the sender is undermining the UK's security. Threat to nation: Britain's anti-spy agency is to snoop through office emails in a bid to preempt disgruntled employees threatening the nation's security by going rogue . GCHQ, the British intelligence organisation which unmasks spies, is sponsoring research at Lancaster University using 'behavioural analysis' to identify rogue employees, The Sunday Times reports. The university is currently advertising the three and a half year PhD post financed by GCHQ - and paying £22,000 a year. The university said: 'The research will investigate the use of techniques from the field of natural language processing to detect the early indicators of an insider threat within an organisation's unstructured internal data.' This means that the person they hire will study email correspondences among employees who have become disgruntled and who may have an axe to grind. GCHQ, the British intelligence organisation which unmasks spies, is based in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, above. The £1.1billion electronic spy centre (above) has been nicknamed The Doughnut . Paul Taylor, professor of psychology at the university, said: 'Instead of ending their email with 'see ya!' they might suddenly offer you 'kind regards'. 'These changes are important and could hint at a disgruntled employee about to go rogue.' The university say they will be using advanced techniques to predict anomalous behavior among staff. Paul Taylor, professor of psychology at Lancaster University, said changes in the tone of emails 'could hint at a disgruntled employee about to go rogue' The aim is to prevent a recurrence of spies such as Guy Burgess and Kim Philby - who were insiders whose behaviour became noticeably out of character. The revelation comes shortly after a judgement which ruled that GCHQ's mass surveillance programmes were found to be lawful - despite protests from privacy campaigners. Human rights groups Liberty, Privacy International and Amnesty brought a legal challenge against GCHQ following disclosures made by American NSA (National Security Agency) whistleblower Edward Snowden about mass surveillance programmes known as Prism and Tempora. They argued that GCHQ's methods breached article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the right to privacy, as well as article 10, which protects freedom of expression. In a written judgment, a panel of IPT judges said: 'We have been able to satisfy ourselves that as of today there is no contravention of articles 8 and 10 by reference to those systems. 'We have left open for further argument the question as to whether prior hereto there has been a breach.' Amnesty immediately said it would appeal the decision at the European Court of Human Rights - there is no domestic right of appeal. Amnesty UK's legal advisor, Rachel Logan, said: 'The Government's entire defence has amounted to 'trust us' and now the tribunal has said the same. 'Since we only know about the scale of such surveillance thanks to Snowden, and given that 'national security' has been recklessly bandied around, 'trust us' isn't enough. The Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) has turned its attention to 'insider' threats within companies - meaning staff gossip and gripes could now be checked for hidden agendas . 'We will now appeal to Strasbourg, who might not be as inclined to put their trust in the UK Government given what we know so far.' James Welch, legal director for Liberty, which also intends to appeal to the ECHR, said: 'So a secretive court thinks that secret safeguards shown to it in secret are an adequate protection of our privacy. 'The IPT cannot grasp why so many of us are deeply troubled about GCHQ's Tempora operation - a seemingly unfettered power to rifle through our online communications.'","Anti-spy agency has turned attention to 'insider' threats within companies .

"Princess Beatrice, the first woman in line to the throne, may be among the victims of the Sony cyber-attack. The 26-year-old eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson was working at Sony Pictures in London when hackers breached the company's computer network. During the hack last Monday, sensitive medical files, email exchanges, pay details and other private information about staff were stolen. Princess Beatrice, who is the sixth in line to the throne, took up an internship at Sony Pictures at the beginning of the year. Scroll down for video . Princess Beatrice, pictured at this summer's Epsom Derby, may be among the victims of the Sony cyber attack . Beatrice has been working as an intern at Sony Pictures since the beginning of the year after quitting her job at an investment capital firm and following a period travelling around the globe with her boyfriend . Although Beatrice has an HRH title she does not receive taxpayers' money. She does however undertake royal engagements on behalf of her grandmother the Queen from time to time, as she is keen to do her public service. She quit her job at investment capital firm Cabot Square Capital near Marble Arch last Summer and then travelled the world with her boyfriend Dave Clark. She was spotted aboard the yacht of billionaire steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal in St Barts and also went to Aspen, America's chicest ski resort. Since returning to London, she has been working at the Sony Pictures Television at its London headquarters in Golden Square. A spokesman for the princess told MailOnline that Princess Beatrice 'continues to work in the business sector'. The Times has reported that she remains employed by Sony Pictures. Stars who have allegedly been hacked include actor Sylvester Stallone, best known for playing Rocky Balboa . Cars enter Sony Pictures Entertainment headquarters in Culver City, California. The company is still conducting an internal investigation on the hack . The hacking group calling itself Guardians of Peace began its attack last Monday, putting almost every one of the film studio's computers out of action. Some reports said some computers of Sony employees displayed a picture of a skeleton, threatening to release large amounts of data from the company. The latest revelations suggest that 47,000 Social Security numbers have been leaked. This allegedly includes stars such as  director Judd Apatow and actors Rebel Wilson and Sylvester Stallone. The leaked numbers belong to both past and current employees. Sony workers saw a message appear on computer screens saying 'Hacked by #GOP' - understood to be the initials of a group called Guardians of Peace which has been linked to North Korea . This comes in the wake of the salaries of Michael Lynton, the CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment and Amy Pascal, the co-chairman of the company, being published. Both were revealed to be making a $3million annual salary. The hackers also uploaded five yet-to-be-released films to file-sharing websites, including the Brad Pitt film Fury, still in cinemas, and Annie, the much-anticipated remake set for a December 19 release. The early leak of films is considered, by the film industry, to have a devastating effect on the potential success of a title. The company has been trying to take the videos off the internet with cease-and-desist orders. The files infiltrated by the hackers included a script for an unreleased pilot written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan as well as 'email exchanges with employees regarding specific medical treatments they are undergoing, while one disciplinary letter details a manager's romantic relationship and business travel history with a subordinate.' The leaked information even includes an email about the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive. Pay information for more than 31,000 employees at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, a financial firm hired by Sony, were taken in the hack as well. Seth Rogen took home $8.4million working on The Interview, compared to the $6.5million his co-star James Franco made (left), according to information revealed in the recent cyber attack on Sony . Sources close to the internal investigation of the hack at Sony say they believe a North Korean group is behind the attack. Officials in North Korea previously threatened action . The suggested motivation for a hack from North Korea, commentators said, had been the country's anger at an upcoming Sony film, The Interview. In the film, set for release at Christmas, Seth Rogen and James Franco play two reporters who have been granted an audience with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The CIA then enlists the pair to assassinate him. North Korea said the film was 'the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as a war action'. The country's UN envoy Ja Song-Nam said there would be a 'merciless response' if the film was not cancelled. However, the diplomat quoted by Voice of America - who asked to remain anonymous - dismissed reports his country had been involved in the attack on Sony. 'Linking [North Korea] to the Sony hacking is another fabrication targeting the country,' he told the broadcaster. 'My country publicly declared that it would follow international norms banning hacking and piracy.' Earlier this week, a separate North Korean official gave a more ambiguous response, saying: 'Wait and see,' in response to a question about the attack. Sony has yet to officially name North Korea as the source of the cyber attack, but sources close to the internal investigation spoke out yesterday to say they believe a group known as DarkSeoul is to blame.","Princess Beatrice took up an internship at Sony Pictures earlier this year .

"Ram raiders stole all of the Red Bull Formula One team's trophies in a twilight raid on their Milton Keynes factory, but many of them are thought to be worthless replicas. Six men used a 4x4 and a Mercedes to drive through the building's main entrance, stealing more than 60 trophies, but a source close to the team revealed that many of them were made of plastic and of no value. This means that the thieves, who will not be able to sell the trophies, will also be unable to melt them down to flog off as scrap metal. One of the trophies that may have been stolen, a second place trophy Mark Webber won at the Brazilian Grand Prix, was made of recycled plastic. Scroll down for video . Sebastian Vettel stands in front of the Red Bull trophy cabinet at their factory in Milton Keynes. All of the awards were stolen in a ram raid on Friday, but many of them are thought to be worthless replicas . A picture taken at the scene shows the damage left by a 4x4 which smashed through the entrance of the factory . Red Bull won the Constructors'  Championships from 2010 to 2013, while Sebastian Vettel won the drivers' championship for each of the four years. However the ram raiders, who used vehicles with foreign number plates, failed to get away with these prestigious trophies too as they had been passed on to this season's title winners Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton. Despite many of the trophies being of little material value, team principal Christian Horner said staff were 'absolutely devastated' by the break-in on Friday night, which had taken 'years of hard work to accumulate'. He said: 'The break-in caused significant damage and was very upsetting for our night officers who were on duty at the time. 'The offenders took items that not only did not belong to them, but which represented the efforts of a group of dedicated, hard-working individuals. 'Beyond the aggressive nature of this break-in, we are perplexed why anyone would take these trophies. The value to the team is of course extraordinarily high due to the sheer hard work and effort that went into winning each and every one. 'But their intrinsic value is low; they would be of little benefit to those outside of the team and, in addition to that, many of the trophies on display were replicas.' Six men used a 4x4 and a Mercedes, both with foreign number plates, to drive through the front entrance of the building . Vettel and former team mate Mark Webber won a combined 43 races while they were at Red Bull from 2010-2013, with Daniel Ricciardo adding three more wins to the team's total this season . The team won 43 races over the four-year period, receiving a trophy for each victory, as well as four constructors' trophies. Former Red Bull drivers Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber also won separate trophies for finishing on the podium, as well as Vettel's four championships, but it not known whether they were kept in the Milton Keynes factory or if replicas were kept instead. Daniel Ricciardo also won three races for Red Bull this season. Horner added: 'The actions of these men mean it's likely that we will have to make our site less accessible in the future, which will be unfair on the hundreds of fans that travel to visit our factory each year to see our trophies and our Formula One car. 'We would like to appeal to anyone who knows any information on the whereabouts of these trophies or the offenders involved to contact Thames Valley Police.' The Austrian team won the Constructors' Championships from 2010 to 2013, while Sebastian Vettel won the drivers' championship for each of the four years . The team won 43 races over the four-year period, receiving a trophy for each victory, as well as the four constructors' trophies . Vettel (pictured on podium) won the 2013 Drivers' Championship after taking victory in the Indian Grand Prix . Police said they were called at 1.30am this morning following the robbery and that staff were not harmed. A Thames Valley police spokesman said: 'Two cars were involved. A silver 4x4 which was used to drive through the entrance and a further dark coloured, black or dark blue Mercedes estate car. Both are believed to have foreign number plates. 'There is no description of the offenders available at this time, although they are all believed to be men, wearing dark clothing.' Red Bull entered Formula One in 2005 after owner Dietrich Mateschitz bought the now-defunct Jaguar F1 team. They won their first World Championship points in the team's first race as British driver David Coulthard took fourth place at the Australian Grand Prix. Coulthard won Red Bull's first podium in the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix, the same year that their sister team Toro Rosso entered the sport. Surprisingly, Toro Rosso, the junior team, won a race before Red Bull, with 21-year-old Sebastian Vettel becoming the youngest driver to take a victory after storming to the chequered flag in Monza, Italy. After Vettel's move to Red Bull, the team rose through the ranks, eventually taking the constructors' title in 2010 after they benefited from a change in regulations. Vettel and team mate Mark Webber continued to dominate the sport, with the German winning the next three titles. The pair's relationship became strained as Red Bull appeared to back the four-time champion over Webber, with the Australian quitting the sport at the end of 2013 to take up endurance racing with Porsche. Vettel was joined at the team by Daniel Ricciardo, previously of Toro Rosso, who won three races and looked the better driver throughout the 2014 season - which was dominated by Mercedes. Russian driver Daniil Kvyat, who drove for Toro Rosso this season, will replace Vettel for the 2015 season when the German joins Ferrari.","Ram raiders smashed into Red Bull F1 team's factory, stealing 60 trophies .

The Swedish striker was caught up in the power struggle between pair while he was at Ajax - where Van Gaal was technical director with Koeman manager of the Eredivisie club.

"Lindsey Vonn put the 22 hardest months of her career behind her with a 60th World Cup victory in a downhill at Lake Louise on Saturday and said she had always believed in her ability to come back. The victory was her first in nearly two years. 'I've never had that sort of setback like I've had the last two years,' said the American. 'I always believed in myself to come back but I never really knew until today. And today I'm finally back at the top. ... It's an amazing day.' A broken shin and two knee operations were not enough to spoil Vonn's class and she could not have chosen a better place to return than Lake Louise, where she clinched her 15th victory at the resort.

It only took her a dress rehearsal in Friday's first downhill, in which she finished eighth, to find her marks. 'Every day's gotten a little bit better here. I'm finally back when I'm confident and pushing my limits,' she said. 'I haven't had that until today. It's finally where it should be.' While warning not to expect too much just yet, the four-times World Cup champion is now only two victories short of Austria's Annemarie Moser-Proell's record of 62 World Cup wins.

"Stewards were forced to close the world's best-known racetrack - after vandals painted this 30ft penis on the tarmac. Hundreds of Brits head to the Nurburgring in Germany each week to test their skills on the 12.9 mile racetrack. But those who made the 800-mile plus round trip to the track on Sunday were left waiting after a juvenile yet admittedly hilarious group painted the epic phallus on the course. Admit you laughed: Unidentified vandals painted an enormous penis onto the iconic Nurburgring racetrack in Germany . Fearing the humungous appendage could distract drivers, a specialist team was called into paint over it . Officials feared the 'artwork' could put the high-speed motorists off their game so a specialist team spent 90 minutes treating the graffiti before re-opening the track to the public. Sam Preston, from Bristol, made the trip to the course on Sunday when the incident happened. He said: 'Me and a friend drove down from the UK to the 'Ring for a weekend of driving. 'The weather was perfect, meaning a lot of cars were queuing for a 10am opening time. Drivers waiting to use the track thought the graffiti was amusing. The officials did not see it the same way .

"Amir Khan has warned Kell Brook and his promoter Eddie Hearn that they will have to play second fiddle if there is to be another Battle of Britain at Wembley Stadium. Khan, in Las Vegas preparing for Saturday's clash of former world champions with American Devon Alexander, will only agree to fight Brook 'on my terms.' Brook, who is recovering from being stabbed in the leg while on holiday, is a potential fall back opponent for Khan next year if Floyd Mayweather continues to renege on his promise of giving Bolton's favourite son the mega-fight of his dreams. Amir Khan is preparing for his fight with Devon Alexander in Las Vegas next week . But Khan is angered by Hearn going public with an offer of $5million (£3.2m) and will not concede Brook the thick end of the purse which usually goes to a defending world champion. He says: 'I respect Kell for winning his title but the fact is that I would be the main draw if we fight and he will have to accept that.' Of Hearn, who staged the biggest fight in modern British boxing when Carl Froch knocked out George Groves in front of an 80,000 crowd at Wembley earlier this year, Khan says: 'Who is he to tell me how much he will give me to fight Kell?' Kell Brook won the world title in the summer but was stabbed in the leg while on holiday . Brook celebrates with his world title after beating Shawn Porter in California . Brook has long been seeking a showdown with Khan, who says: 'That fight could happen but only under the complete control of Khan Promotions, on my terms and conditions. We will choose where and when it takes place and I will decide how much I am paid. I dictate my purse for my big fights. 'It was disrespectful of Hearn to say what my purse would be. I will only fight Brook if it makes financial sense, if the public genuinely want it and if a fight for me with Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao doesn't materialise.' Khan is hoping to make such an emphatic statement against Alexander on his first top-of-the-bill appearance at the fabled MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas that Mayweather will finally be forced to fight him. The Money man, who is widely regarded as the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world., failed to make good on a promise to fight Khan this year. Khan pulled out of a world welterweight title challenge to Alexander a year ago on the understanding that he would meet Mayweather in May. Since then Alexander has lost the title and Saturday's fight is one neither man can afford to lose. Khan, who twice lost his own world titles, acknowledges: 'I can't afford to make another mistake but although I'm still young in boxing terms I'm now older and wiser.' The prize of a mega-millions challenge to Mayweather is again tantalisingly close for Khan and he says: 'I need to make a statement against Alexander which mobilises the public in America to put pressure on him to fight me.' Khan remains keen to fight Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao in 2015 . There is a sense in the US that Khan would be the only viable alternative for Mayweather if he continues to prevaricate about meeting Pacquao in what would be the richest fight of all time., . The world has been waiting years for that and Khan says: 'It would be great for boxing for those two to fight each other but obviously it would upset my plans. I've been waiting a long time for Floyd.' He also suspects that Mayweather is wary, saying: 'A lot of people over here, including my Hall of Fame promoter Oscar De La Hoya, are saying that my speed would give Mayweather a lot of problems and that I could be the first boxer to defeat him. Khan beat Luis Collazo on points in his last fight back in May . 'I want the biggest fights and would also be happy to box Pacquiao but to be honest I think Mayweather would be an easier fight for me style wise.' Then he reassures his army of fans: 'Don't worry. I'm not looking past Alexander. I'm excited about boxing at the MGM and there are giant posters all over the Vegas Strip to remind me of how big this fight is in its own right.'

Children are receiving ‘inadequate and meagre’ music classes despite tens of millions of pounds being lavished on improving lessons, according to the schools watchdog. Ofsted said pupils are ‘poorly taught’ with many never introduced to classical music and primary pupils assumed ‘with no good reason’ to be unready to learn musical theory. School leaders were also found to be over-optimistic about the quality of teaching provided by staff.The government is spending £171 million on a three-year programme to raising standards following a damning review of music education in England in 2011. Must improve: The report emphasised the need for schools to drive up the quality of their music provision and to introduce young children to the value of classical music . This is spearheaded by 123 ‘music hubs’ - local authority music services or groups of professional music organisations which organise lessons.

None were able to show how they were providing good value for money. The report said: ‘We must expect greater impact on music education for all pupils in schools.’ Recommendations included Arts Council England, which allocates the funding, to take ‘rapid action’ to improve the situation.

A spokesman said: ‘The report identifies a number of issues regarding the quality of music teaching in schools. ‘We agree schools need to do more to drive up the quality of their music provision and to listen to and take advantage of the expertise which is being made available to them through hubs.’ Michael Cladingbowl, director of schools policy at Ofsted, said: ‘Music is a demanding academic discipline, developed through exciting practical musical activity. ‘However, the vast majority of the schools visited shied away from teaching pupils about fundamental aspects of music as they thought it too difficult. ‘All children, not just the privileged few, should enjoy a good music education. ‘Music hubs were created with this very aim, so it is concerning that the hubs visited for this survey could not show how their work in schools achieves this or how they provide value for money.’","The government is spending £171 million .

"The build-up to England midfielder Karen Carney's possible 100th cap has been soured by a ruling that she told an opponent to 'f*** off back to Spain'. The Birmingham City player was suspended for a domestic match last month and fined after being found guilty of misconduct for using abusive and/or insulting words towards an opposing player. Now the Football Association has published the full written reasons for the verdict of its regulatory commission, which held a disciplinary hearing on October 14. Karen Carney (pictured 2009) is set to win her 100th international cap when England play Germany on Sunday . A 17-page document reveals that Carney, during a Women's Super League match against Bristol Academy in July, was found to have told Natalia Pablos Sanchon, a Spaniard, to 'f*** off back to Spain'. The incident occurred as the pair were involved in a series of exchanges late in the match. Carney contended that she said, 'Go back to Spain' but in bringing the charge the FA noted that even those words could still be construed as insulting on grounds of nationality. There was no suggestion the words were considered racist. After obtaining witness statements the commission ruled, on the balance of probabilities, that Carney had used the expletive in her remark. Carney celebrates her second goal during the friendly between England and Sweden in August . But it did acknowledge there were 'significant' mitigating factors which meant her subsequent ban was for one match, rather than the mandatory two it would have been had the referee heard the comment. Carney was also fined £450 and asked to attend an education course. The publication of the written reasons comes just days before Carney, who has 99 England caps, hopes to reach her century of international appearances against Germany at Wembley. The England women's side's first match at the national stadium is a record 55,000 sell-out.","The incident happened during a Women's Super League match in July .

"It was a dying request of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill that there should always be a marmalade cat called Jock living a 'comfortable' life at his former home. But yesterday, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the war hero's death, it emerged that the latest incumbent is banned from large parts of Chartwell in Kent because of his claws. Curators are concerned Jock IV could do 'untold damage to irreplaceable objects' in the dining room, study and bedroom  – where the original cat would have once had free rein. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Winston Churchill (statue left) requested that there should always be a marmalade cat called Jock living a 'comfortable' life at his former home, pictured is Jock VI . 'It is purely because of his claws,' said Katherine Barnett the curator of an exhibition at Chartwell, where Churchill lived for 40 years. The original marmalade tom was given to Churchill on his 88th birthday by Sir John 'Jock' Colville, one of his private secretaries, and the wartime leader named him after his friend. He ensured the cat lived a life of luxury and it was so spoilt that family meals would not start until Jock had taken his place on the dining table. Jock is even reported to have been on the wartime prime minister's bed when he died in London in January 1965. But it has emerged that the latest incumbent is banned from large parts of Chartwell in Kent because of his claws . The original marmalade tom was given to Churchill on his 88th birthday by Sir John 'Jock' Colville, one of his private secretaries . His beloved animal passed away nine years later and is now buried in the pet cemetery at Chartwell. Churchill and his family left instructions that the subsequent Jocks should be the same as the original - ginger, with a white bib and paws. The National Trust, which was left the property by the Churchill family in 1966, has always honoured the request and welcomed Jock VI, a seven-month-old rescue kitten, in March this year. Jock VI, or Malley as he was previously known, was rescued by Croydon Animal Samaritans before being adopted by Chartwell house.

Jock VI, or Malley as he was previously known, was rescued by Croydon Animal Samaritans before being adopted by Chartwell house, pictured left with Katherine Barnett . He is said to enjoy eating tuna, taking afternoon naps and lounging on Persian rugs - but is not so keen on bright lights, being left alone or listening to opera. The primary role of a Chartwell cat is to interact with visitors and roam the estate's extensive grounds, according to the National Trust. Churchill's affection and patience for cats was clearly visible to those around him during his time at Chartwell, according to Fred Glueckstein, writing for The Churchill Centre. Speaking at the 1987 International Churchill conference, his secretary Grace Hamblin said: 'He loved cats. He always had a cat, if not two.' The primary role of a Chartwell cat is to interact with visitors and roam the estate's extensive grounds, according to the National Trust. The trust says the 'job' involves: . And the role would suit cats that are: . Ms Hamblin recalled that the politician had once greeted one of the house's cats with 'Good morning' - before shooing the animal away with some papers when the cat remained silent and still. He later asked her to put a card in the window saying 'if Cat cares to come home, all is forgiven'. She added: 'Cat did come home several days later with a wire round his neck. Given cream and the best salmon and so on.' Churchill adopted a number of cats during his leadership - two of which were a large tabby named Mickey and a marmalade tom called Tango. During one amusing incident, the prime . minister was reportedly speaking on the telephone to the Lord . Chancellor when Mickey started playing with the telephone cord. Churchill . shouted 'Get off the line, you fool!' - before realizing his mistake . and turning back to the Lord Chancellor, saying: 'Not you!' Britain marked the 50th anniversary of Churchill's death today. He was the prime minister through the war years of 1940 to 1945, and again in peacetime from 1951 to 1955. Prime Minister David Cameron led tributes, describing Churchill as the country's 'greatest ever prime minister' in a video tribute in which he called on people to share their favourite Churchill quotations on social media. 'Churchill was our greatest ever prime minister and we owe him everything. In May 1940 that crucial decision to fight on against Hitler saved our country and arguably saved the world.' 'I think this year we should also all remember the many great things that he said.' Cameron quoted from Churchill's 'we shall never surrender' speech. 'My favourite quotation from Churchill is the one he made shortly after that momentous decision in May 1940: 'We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. 'We shall fight them on the beaches, we shall fight them on the landing grounds, we shall fight them on the streets and in our fields, we shall fight them in the hills. We shall never surrender'.'

"Primary school children can't cope with cutlery when eating school dinners meaning much of their lunch ends up in the bin, a headteacher has claimed. Keira Ainsworth said the introduction of free school meals for all pupils is causing a huge amount of waste because children are used to nibbling at finger food in front of the television rather than eating at a table. She explained that she and staff at Maids Moreton C of E School in Buckingham are forced to cut up food for more than 50 pupils aged four to eight who are unable to properly use knives and forks.

Ms Ainsworth told The Times: 'We were shocked to discover that children did not know how to use a knife and fork and by the time the two supervisors had cut up 50 roast dinners, the lunches had gone cold. 'The school bursar and myself now cut up the food every day to make sure that it is served hot, acting as two rather overpaid dinner ladies.' She added: 'Modern children are unfamiliar with traditional hot puddings such as apple crumble and custard, and bakewell tart, so much of the food goes in the bin.' Headteacher Keira Ainsworth says staff at Maids Moreton C of E school have to cut up food for the children . The universal school meals project was launched by Nick Clegg at the start of the academic year in 2014 aiming to provide a healthy lunch for all pupils in state-funded schools. Miss Ainsworth said the £1billion scheme was not funded well enough. She explained that as a small school, Maids Moreton received approximately £18,000 but estimated annual costs, including staff, paying suppliers and running an industrial dishwasher, will cost around £32,000. A nearby school was forced to convert its library into a kitchen and another put off the planned purchase of iPads to fund the costs of a new kitchen. In October, David Laws, the Minister of State for Schools said the government was making an additional £20million of capital funding available for projects aimed at enhancing kitchen and dining facilities.","Staff at Maids Moreton C of E School can't cope with cutlery, says head .

"Arsenal and Tottenham have imposed stadium bans on ‘selfie sticks’ — the extendable poles used to assist the taking of a self-portrait with a camera or phone. Spurs acted after receiving a complaint from a supporter claiming their view had been obstructed by a fan operating a ‘selfie stick’. But the north London clubs have included them on the list of banned items on public safety grounds, because they could be used as weapons. A Tottenham fan is caught on television brandishing a selfie stick while celebrating a goal . A fan uses a selfie stick to take a self portrait outside of Southampton's stadium . They are an inexpensive version of what was once called a monopod. The difference with selfie sticks is that they’re specifically designed to be held at arm’s length to fit the photographer into the frame, and they usually — but not always — come with a mechanism to remotely trigger the shutter. This brings them into line with most of the Barclays Premier League. Although some clubs actually sell branded versions in their club shops, only Everton and Swansea have not moved to ban them. ‘Unfortunately, we can confirm that selfie sticks are banned on match days at Emirates Stadium,’ said an Arsenal spokesman. ‘The club’s ground regulations prohibit any object that could be used as a weapon or could compromise public safety.’ The items are easily concealed because they are pocket-sized until they are extended but many fans have become annoyed by their increasing use within grounds. At Tottenham, a spokesman said: ‘The decision has been taken following complaints from our supporters on the grounds of safety.’ A fan uses the extension to hold up his camera phone during a Chelsea game .","Tottenham and Arsenal have banned selfie sticks from their grounds .

"They had chosen one of the most public arenas to air to the world the bitter row which had torn their marriage apart. But now, after the best part of a week, multi-millionaire Ben Goldsmith and his wife Kate Rothschild appear to regret using Twitter to launch a series of extraordinary personal attacks upon each other. Today, the pair called a truce on their marriage dispute by deleting the damaging snipes from the social networking site. High-flyers: Jay Electronica posted a picture on Twitter of Kate Rothschild accompanying him on a helicopter ride to a Jay Z and Kanye West concert last month. Kate and her estranged husband Ben Goldsmith today confirmed they are to divorce . Outburst: Kate Rothschild took to twitter to attack her critics, telling them to 'get on with fixing' their own lives . The couple later put out a statement . confirming their marriage was over and declaring their intentions to . make no further public comment. The . Rothschild heiress first indicated her change of heart late last night . and turned her attention away from her husband, instead using the site . to lash out at her critics. She . posted a message which read: ‘All of you should go home . and question whether you are really in a position to judge and condemn . and then get on with fixing your own lives.’ Their relationship troubles had blown up . into a full-scale Twitter war – with both sides launching . attacks on each other on the social networking site. But today they both deleted their public messages in what appears to be an attempt to calm mounting tensions. The Goldsmiths also put out a joint statement through a PR company. It said: ‘We are both deeply saddened that our marriage has ended after nine years. ‘It is a matter of regret to us that, at a time when our emotions and . those of our friends have run high, things have been said in public . which should have been kept private. We accept our full share of . responsibility for this. ‘Contrary to what has been publicly stated, neither of us anticipates . any major issues of contention to arise in the divorce, in which the . interests of our children will come first. ‘There will be no further comment, either directly or indirectly, from us on any aspect of our family’s private life.’ Heading for divorce: Ben with Kate, who he has branded 'appalling' over her . relationship with a rapper . Until last night, Mrs Goldsmith has only made comments on her marriage split through a spokesman. But she then took to the social . networking site to post a series of extraordinary tweets in response to . those made by her husband on the same site. She also appeared to draw their three . young children into the ugly battle when she uploaded a photograph of . them being returned to her by private jet with the caption ‘Plane . relief’. The posts came hours after . Eton-educated financier Mr Goldsmith branded his wife ‘appalling’ over . her relationship with Jay Electronica, 35, a US rapper she has been managing . in her role as a music producer. The musician, whose real name is Timothy Elpadaro Thedford, was in a five year relationship with Grammy-award winning singer-songwriter Erykah Badu, with whom he has a child. But it is understood they are no longer together. He had recently posted a picture of Mrs Goldsmith accompanying him on a private helicopter to a Jay-Z and Kanye West concert. Star: Jay Electronica, left with his ex . girlfriend Erykah Badu, with whom he has a child, and performing on . stage during The Big Chill Festival, last year, right, alongside . Hollywood actress Lucy Liu in the band Bullitts . Row: Kate Rothschild had tweeted that hip-hop star Jay Electronica, pictured, had 'saved her life' after her husband branded her 'appalling' for her relationship with the musician . In the 14 messages posted in quick . succession she said the rapper had ‘saved my life’ and that she wanted . to respond to ‘the vultures’ taunting her. She wrote: ‘Ben in a rational mood . would be the first to say that my devotion to my children is . unshakeable. I am with them now, as I always am.’ She added: ‘Our marriage went bad a . few years ago and none of you have any idea what I went through along . with my husband. 'Then we separated for a while anger and bitterness . following that time led to a very one sided story being deliberately . released in order to shame and hurt me.’ The Rothschild heiress continued: . ‘This is the darkest time of my life.’ A later tweet said: ‘As for Jay . Electronica…he saved my life in many ways and I am eternally grateful to . him.’ Kate Rothschild posts Instagram picture of her children on a plane to Twitter, which was then given a 'like' by Jay Electronica (see small pic bottom right) Kate Rothschild posts cryptic tweet about being in a 'talespin' in first message since husband blasted her over relationship with rapper . In an earlier cryptic message, Mrs Goldsmith wrote on her account: . ‘T.A.L.E.S.P.I.N.S.A.N.D.H.E.A.D.R.O.L.L.S.’ One interpretation of the message was that she believed Mr Goldsmith was ‘spinning’ the story about their marriage split. Mrs Goldsmith has previously said the . media has been fed ‘false and inaccurate information’ about the . break-up ‘in a deliberate attempt to damage’ her. The couple’s children have been on a . pre-planned holiday in Italy with their father. The picture of the . youngsters climbing down the stairs of a private jet is believed to be . of them being returned to her. It prompted a response from Electronica . who said he ‘liked’ the photograph. Last night it was unclear where any of the parties in the affair were. Kate Rothschild took to Twitter to defend herself in the latest move in the battle between the estranged spouses . News of the marriage break-up emerged . at the weekend, days after 31 year-old Mr Goldsmith was arrested at the . couple’s £20million home in Kensington, West London on suspicion of . actual bodily harm. He was released without charge after accepting a . caution. It reportedly followed a . confrontation between Mr Goldsmith, youngest son of the late billionaire . Sir James Goldsmith, and his 29 year-old wife over explicit texts and . emails between her and Electronica. He is now expected to issue divorce proceedings on the grounds of adultery. The financier took to Twitter after . the split to accuse his estranged wife of caring more about her image . than their three children. Mr Goldsmith, who inherited . £300million after his father’s death, ridiculed music producer Kate for . hiring a PR firm to ‘fix her reputation’, telling his 6,000 followers: . ‘A bit late surely? How about focusing on her devastated children.’ Backing from women: Mr Goldsmith has been deluged with messages of support on Twitter since it was revealed he had split from wife Kate . The couple married in 2003 but their . relationship ran into difficulties earlier this year. The marital home . was put on sale last month and friends said rumours of a split had been . circulating because of the time Mrs Goldsmith was spending with the . rapper. The impending divorce between the . fabulously wealthy couple is unlike to see any huge financial . settlements, according to a legal expert. William Healing, partner in Kingsley Napley and an expert in high profile divorce cases, claimed . the 29-year-old heiress would not be entitled to a share of her . husband’s estimated £300 million fortune because he inherited it, rather . than earned it, during their eight-year marriage. He . said Mrs Goldsmith’s own £18 million banking dynasty fortune she . inherited from father Amschel Rothschild, who hanged himself in Paris in . 1996, would also be safe. He said: 'Because most of the wealth was inherited in this case the . courts are likely to approach the division of assets on a need basis . rather than a full sharing basis.' Mr Healing added: 'Couples will find all sorts of ways to hurt each other and social media, such as Twitter, is a new tool. Bitter feud: Mr Goldsmith hunting in the English countryside with rapper Jay Electronica, who has been exchanging messages with the financier's estranged wife . 'They need to take a step back. At the end of the day social media can be there for years to come. 'They are grown ups, but do they really want their children to know they were the subject of what could be one of the most bitter new media divorces of the decade?' During the row last week, when Mr . Goldsmith claimed to have discovered incriminating messages on his . wife’s phone, he was said to have slapped Kate and she called the . police. Jay Electronica is thought to have returned to London following his grandmother’s funeral in the US. At his mother Marilyn Denise Flowers’ bungalow in New Orleans, the family refused to discuss the rapper’s . relationship with Kate, a member of the Rothschild dynasty who inherited . £18million after the suicide of her banker father Amschel Rothschild. One relative said: ‘He’s a grown man. He lives his own life.’","Ben Goldsmith split from wife Kate Rothschild after row over messages between her and rapper Jay Electronica .

"It may come as a shock to those fond of quoting a world cup triumph and the outcome of two wars as signs of British superiority. Scientists say that around half of Britons have German blood coursing through their veins. Anybody who paid attention in their history lessons knows that tribes from northern Europe invaded Britain after the Romans left in around 410AD. England prepare to take on Germany at the 1966 World Cup. Archaeological evidence now suggests that 50 per cent of Britons have German blood flowing through their veins . But research by leading geneticists . reveals the extent to which the Germans became part of the nation's . racial mix. Together with archaeologists who have spent years on sites . in the UK, they conclude that 50 per cent of us have some German blood. Biologists at University College in . London studied a segment of the Y chromosome that appears in almost all . Danish and northern German men – and found it surprisingly common in . Great Britain. Analysis of tooth enamel and bones found in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries supported these results. Hengist and Horsa were two Germanic brothers who arrived on the south-east corner of England in 449 AD. They are credited with leading the Angle, Saxon and Jutish armies that first conquered the Celts. The siblings were called to Britain by the Celtic King Vortigem to defend his people against enemies including the Picts. For their services, they were given the island of Thanet to live on. However, following a series of falling-outs with the locals, they gradually came to own more and more land that eventually became known as the Kingdom of Kent. Indeed, Hengist is traditionally named as the founder of the Kingdom of Kent. German archeologist Heinrich Haerke . believes 'up to 200,000 emigrants' crossed the North Sea, pillaging and . raping and eventually settling. The native Celts, softened by years of peace under the Romans, were no match for the raiding parties from across the North Sea. Pottery and jewellery similar to that . found in grave sites along the Elbe River in northern Germany has been . unearthed in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries here. There is also evidence the . settlers remained in contact with relatives on the Continent for up to . three generations. The findings have caused a certain amount of gloating in Germany. 'There is no use in denying it,' wrote news magazine Der Spiegel. 'It is clear that the nation which most . dislikes the Germans were once Krauts themselves. A number of studies . reinforce the intimacy of the German-English relationship.' Anglo-Saxon is a catch-all phrase to . refer to the invaders of the fifth and sixth centuries AD. Angles came . from the southern part of the Danish peninsula and gave their name to . England and the Saxons came from the north German plain. There were . other tribes – such as the Jutes, from Jutland, who settled in Kent. The Anglo-Saxons drove the Britons . into Cornwall, Wales and the North, but a few centuries later faced . waves of invaders themselves – Vikings from Scandinavia and then the . Normans in 1066.

"An Indian man has become the world’s oldest father for the second time at the age of 96. Ramjit Raghav was awarded the title two years ago when he had his first born son Karamjit aged 94. Although he swore one was enough, the pensioner and his wife Shakuntala, 54, welcomed another son Ranjit, last month. Scroll down for video . World's oldest: Ramjit Raghav holding his second baby Ranjit at the ripe old age of 96 . Speaking at his home in the state of Haryana, 31 miles from Delhi, Ramjit said: ‘What can I do? This is all God's wish. He wanted me to have another son.’ When Shakuntala gave birth to the healthy boy earlier this month at the Government hospital in Haryana, the doctors laughed when Ramjit said he was the father. He said: ‘They just laughed but they were very surprised.’ Ramjit, who lives with his family in a studio apartment, has high hopes for his sons. Daddy duties: Ramjit Raghav, 96, with his wife Shankuntala, 54, and sons Karamjit, 4, and newborn Ranjit, is excited to have become a father again . He said: ‘I have been a farmer all my life. But I want them to become high ranking government workers. ‘It's good that I have another son now. Even if one of them dies, God forbid, I will have someone to carry on my family name."" Ramjit admits that as proud as he is of having two healthy sons at his age, his neighbours are more jealous of his sex drive.

The pair met 22 years ago on a rainy morning at a Muslim shrine, Ramjit asked her to come home with him and she has never left. 'She didn't have any family or friends around, and I wanted to help her,' he explains. 'I . took her under my wing and taught her some yoga and we fell in love. Many of my past girlfriends had died so I had never married and then I . asked Shakuntala to be my wife.' Shakuntala believes she would have been dead by now if it was not for Ramjit's caring ways.

"Tory donor: James Stunt is pictured with his wife Petra Ecclestone . James Stunt, the son-in law of Formula One mogul Bernie Ecclestone, has joined David Cameron’s elite Tory dining club, it emerged last night. Art collector Mr Stunt, the husband of socialite Petra Ecclestone, is listed alongside oligarchs, bankers, hedge fund bosses and entrepreneurs in the Leader’s Group of major party donors. For £50,000 a year, members are promised regular dinners, lunches and drinks receptions with the Prime Minister and other senior Tory figures. Mr Stunt, 32, who is the most flamboyant member of the set, is known for his ostentatious displays of wealth. He was famously described by his billionaire father in law as a ‘flash b******d’. His huge car collection reportedly includes two Rolls-Royce Celestials, three Lamborghinis, two Mercedes and two Range Rovers, and he married Miss Ecclestone in a spectacular £12million ceremony in a medieval castle near Rome in 2011. The donors’ list, published on the Tory Party’s website yesterday, showed Mr Stunt was among 32 individuals who attended Leader’s Group events from July 1 to the end of September. Between them they have donated more than £17million to the party since 2010. Other donors listed include Russian businessman Alexander Temerko – who has donated more than £250,000 to the Tories since 2010 and is wanted on fraud charges in his home country – and venture capitalist Adrian Beecroft, who attracted controversy in 2012 after writing a report for Mr Cameron on cutting red tape, which included a proposal to allow employers to fire staff at will. Mr Beecroft reportedly holds a significant stake in payday loans company Wonga. Scroll down for video . Also listed are hedge fund boss Christopher Rokos, Betfair founder Edward Wray and oil entrepreneur Amjad Bseisu. Sir Michael Hintze, who is thought to be the Tory Party’s biggest donor, is listed as a member of the group. The former Goldman Sachs banker has given more than £1.8million to the party since 2010. Also listed in the club is the metals trader known as ‘Mr Copper’. Michael Farmer was elevated to the House of Lords in September and sits as a Tory peer. He has donated more than £3.5million to the party since the last election. For £50,000 a year, members are promised regular dinners, lunches and drinks receptions with the Prime Minister (pictured left with his wife Samantha) and other senior Tory figures . In the past, details of the list have prompted concerns about ‘cash for access’ and fears of behind-the-scenes lobbying of senior Cabinet ministers. Ministers always denied that donors had used their access to influence policy. Tories point out that, unlike Labour, their donations all come from private individuals and they are not substantially funded by trade unions. Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘David Cameron leads a party with dwindling members but an ever-greater reliance on big money from an increasingly small number of mega-rich donors. ‘Ministers’ dinner dates with donors are boosting Tory coffers. The Tories are wining and dining the very same millionaires who have been given a tax cut by this Tory-led Government.’ The seven Cabinet ministers who attended events were Mr Cameron, George Osborne, William Hague, Theresa May, Philip Hammond, Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith. A spokesman for Mr Stunt was unavailable for comment.","James Stunt is the son-in-law of Formula One mogul Bernie Ecclestone .
